      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, is one of the highest in the world.  Many of the world&rsquo;s leading overseas companies have substantial international operations in Ireland.  These include companies in ICT, life sciences and international services, including financial services.  Employment in IDA-assisted companies increased by 3,795 in 2006, bringing total employment to 135,487.</P>
        <P>However, I accept that IDA Ireland faces a significant challenge in seeking to sustain, embed and increase this investment.  A growing number of locations are competing for mobile investment, notably in eastern Europe and the Far East, not only on the basis of low costs but also on the basis of future market potential.  In recent times, cost-sensitive projects have begun to bypass Europe for lower-cost countries such as China and India and it has to be accepted that Ireland is no longer a prime location for what might be called low-cost, low-skilled, basic manufacturing and service activities.</P>
        <P>In responding to this challenge, IDA Ireland is focusing on the development of its client employment base into high technology, high value-added and high-skill functions in areas such as high-end manufacturing, high-end services and research <Col N="138"/>and development.  For some years it has focused on facilitating and encouraging existing and new FDI clients to move up the value chain into higher value-added products, functions and activities, more in tune with the competitive strengths of Ireland today.</P>
        <P>A key factor that will impact on our ability to sustain rapid growth and high employment levels is cost competitiveness, particularly related to property and construction demand, energy costs, local authority charges and services where competition may be limited.  Continued flexibility in responding to changes in both local and international economic conditions is also essential.</P>
        <P>The new national development plan will play a crucial role in maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as an investment location.  The pace of economic growth makes further investment in education critical.  We need to build on our strong relative position in producing science, engineering and business graduates and reverse some of the movement away from the sciences by students in recent years.  Rapid improvement in physical infrastructure is also an ongoing need, especially to support regional development.  Further investment in research and development as provided for in the NDP will be a key factor in improving our competitiveness into the future.</P>
        <P>I am confident all of these issues will be fully addressed by the national development plan and, in tandem with the policies being pursued by the Government and IDA Ireland, we will maintain the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for high-quality inward investment by the world&rsquo;s leading companies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply and acknowledge the success of IDA Ireland over many years in bringing a high level of foreign direct investment to this country.  The chairman of the Small Business Forum and the managing director of Microsoft Ireland, Joe Macri, said recently that the competitive rate of return on investment by multinational companies here has fallen from 28% in 1995 to 12% in 2003 while the rate in eastern Europe rose by 8% at the same time.  Mr. Jim O&rsquo;Hara, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland and reputable managing director of Intel wrote four days ago:</P>
        <P LI="1">In recent years, the cost base for US companies has increased significantly and while it&rsquo;s clear Ireland cannot compete on cost alone, it&rsquo;s imperative we urgently address some of the fundamental drivers of the rapid increase in our cost base.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Are those two people right in their assessment of the economy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I was with Mr. O&rsquo;Hara yesterday at the announcement of a significant investment by Intel in a new digital health research project, the first of its kind by Intel outside the United States.  This indicates the attraction of Ireland as <Col N="139"/>a location for high-end research and development in areas that represent core strategic objectives of companies of the calibre of Intel.  The project involves three major Irish universities, Trinity, UCD and UCG.  In many ways we know that our cost base has increased and economic growth and development have had an impact on the overall cost base of the economy.  That is why we must move higher up the value chain and further into the research and development space and upskill the population.  The type of investment we announced yesterday with Intel will act as a further reference point to attract a similar type of high quality investment from companies of that calibre.</P>
        <P>Last year approximately 80,000 extra jobs were created in the economy and 20,000 were lost through redundancies.  We managed to win significant investments from companies such as Google, Amgen, Centocor, Servier, a French pharmaceutical company, financial services, Northern Trust and, last Monday week in Dundalk, Daiwa, a Japanese financial services company.  We are concentrating on trying to win the technologies of tomorrow for Ireland and the companies that are developing them, which are high in manufacturing, services and particularly engineering, medical devices and financial services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware that in the five years to 2006 manufacturing employment has lost 32,000 jobs?  There is a serious threat in that area.  When will the manufacturing forum that the Minister announced in T16 be established?  What timescale has he set to deal with the issues worrying manufacturers? </P>
        <P>Have the Minister or his Department carried out an assessment of all the multinational companies which have invested in this country, taking into account their activity and employment levels and whether they have implemented some of their decisions about increasing activity and employment?  Are they examining that situation with a view to changing their minds about some of those announcements?  Notwithstanding what the Minister has said about key IDA Ireland backed firms which have come here and are welcome, there is an indication that our economy may be built on a bubble.  We want to reassure people in the multinational sector and employees that we have a competitive cost base for the future, and I am not sure that is the case at the moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I must be careful because Deputy Hogan has made gloomy forecasts in the past which did not turn out as he had predicted.  I commissioned a study from Forf&aacute;s last year on the state of manufacturing in Ireland today <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> internationally traded services.  An important outcome of that analysis was that while manufactur<Col N="140"/>ing jobs have been lost the yield and output from Irish manufacturing has increased.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>No. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It has.  I will refer the Deputy to the study which has been published.  The reason is clear.  As we move towards a more efficient manufacturing environment and apply technologies more effectively we will experience a loss in numbers in employment but will have a more efficient and competitive enterprise that is sustainable in the long term.  We should welcome that development.</P>
        <P>Approximately 150,000 jobs were created in high-end manufacturing in the past six to seven years and approximately 40,000 jobs were created in the area of internationally traded services.  By any international standard, that is an outstanding employment record.  The Deputy is correct that the challenge we face is to sustain this level of creation in the coming decade.  The international arena is clearly much more competitive now than was the case ten years ago.  We are witnessing the rise of significant economic powers in different parts of the world and we must box clever and play to our strengths.  We must add to those strengths via targeted investments on the part of the State and by creating a flexible and adaptive labour market that can respond to the challenges that are coming down the tracks.</P>

      <sTitle>Redundancy Payments.</sTitle>
        <Qst Pid="RuairiQuinn" ToPid="MichaelMartin" Dept="Enterprise">
        <Qid>123</Qid>
        <asker>Mr. Quinn</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> the reasoning behind the Government&rsquo;s decision to fund a redundancy package at Irish Ferries; his views on whether the workers in question were legitimately made redundant, or if their jobs still exist; the action he will take to ensure that taxpayers&rsquo; money is not used to assist companies in the race to the bottom; if this matter was discussed with the social partners before a decision was made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[2750/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The payment of statutory redundancy to employees is a matter, in the first instance, for the employer.  My Department is responsible for ensuring that statutory redundancy is paid to all employees who find themselves in a redundancy situation and who, by reference to age, insurability and length of service are deemed eligible for such payment.  <i>Ex gratia</i> payments, that is, payments over and above the statutory entitlement are a matter for negotiation between employer and employee or by union representatives or other agreed representatives acting on their behalf.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Statutory redundancy was paid to all eligible workers at Irish Ferries and the company subsequently applied for a rebate under the statutory redundancy scheme on 17 February 2006.  Employers who pay statutory redundancy to <Col N="141"/>employees in a genuine redundancy situation are entitled to recoup 60% of the moneys so paid from the social insurance fund.</P>
        <P>When the application was received in my Department, it was examined in detail in accordance with normal procedure.  Such examination gave rise to doubts as to the eligibility of the application under section 7 of the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2003.  Accordingly, the issue of eligibility was referred to the Office of the Attorney General for legal advice.  A number of complex legal issues arose at several stages during the consideration of this matter which required further information to be sought from Irish Ferries.  The matter was considered in detail on the basis of the legal advices received and on the facts of the case and it was determined that Irish Ferries was legally entitled to receive a rebate in accordance with the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2003.</P>
        <P>All decisions to pay a redundancy rebate must be based on the facts of the case and on the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2003.  There is no room for the exercise of ministerial preference or the consideration of matters extraneous to the redundancy legislation.</P>
        <P>The protection of employment &mdash; exceptional collective redundancies &mdash; Bill, as negotiated in the context of Towards 2016, is at an advanced stage of drafting.  The Bill will address cases of collective redundancies where specific situations apply and provide for the extension of unfair dismissals protection in circumstances where all employees are involved in dismissal following a strike.  It is expected that the Bill will be published in a couple of weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Does he accept that there were no redundancies in this case?  What happened was that the jobs in question were sold to people from other countries who were prepared to work at a lower rate.  In logical terms and in light of the facts the Irish Seamen&rsquo;s Union, ISU, agreed, under pressure and coercion, to allow their members to sell their jobs in return for a package, valued at &euro;4.3 million, that was administered out of the fund into which everyone pays.  The package to which I refer was paid out in respect not of people who lost their jobs but those whose jobs were sold to individuals who undertook to work at a lower rate.  In terms of the facts, do I have it wrong or is that a fair presentation of what actually happened?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Deputy&rsquo;s analysis of what happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to facts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not my analysis.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="142"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I also have personal views on the matter.  I was particularly unhappy with what transpired.  However, I cannot allow my personal preferences or instincts to impact on the legal entitlement as per the existing legislative framework.  We must, therefore, rely on the law as it stands.  We have taken steps in our discussions with the social partners to remedy what could be considered deficiencies in the legislation. </P>
        <P>This will result in new legislation to cover collective redundancies of this kind.  It will involve the establishment of a redundancy panel and provide for a statutory consultation process.  The legislation will establish roles, responsibilities and timeframes for the Minister, the Labour Court and the redundancy panel.  It will provide for situations where dismissals take place contrary to an opinion of the Labour Court, with particular reference to redundancy rebate entitlements, as well as consideration of unfair dismissal entitlements, penalties and appeals.  We are moving to close certain gaps that have opened up with this issue.  Our decision on the legislation must be based on the legal advice we have received and not on how we might like it to be or in terms of our own political preferences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it from the Minister&rsquo;s reply that he is not disputing my facts.  The jobs were sold and the employees were not made redundant.  The compensation element of the redundancy package &mdash; the 60% of the cost of buying out the Irish Ferries workers &mdash; was paid for by the rest of us.  The Minister claims he received legal advice, presumably from the Attorney General.  I invite the Minister to publish it.  We must take his word for it, which I do, but we have not seen the advice.  On 12 January, my party leader wrote to the Taoiseach, himself a former Minister for Labour, asking that the advice be published.</P>
        <P>The deal is done and the damage cannot be undone.  However, the Minister referred to the loophole that was exploited in this case which he is attempting to redress with less than 100 days between now and the next general election.  Publishing the legal advice will allow us to test its robustness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Irrespective of the language the Deputy uses, the redundancies were negotiated by representatives of the workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The jobs were sold under duress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There can be many different perspectives on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Up to 100,000 people marched on the streets of Dublin because of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have been through it at all ends.  The redundancy package was negotiated.  I understand the Taoiseach replied today to the Deputy&rsquo;s <Col N="143"/>party leader&rsquo;s correspondence on the matter.  There is a long-standing precedent on the publication of the legal advice of Attorneys General, of which the Deputy is aware having been a Minister.  We have been in discussions with the social partners.  The heads of the Bill have already been published and it is intended to have it enacted prior to any event later this year.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Morgan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> if he will initiate an assessment of sectors and geographic regions expected to experience job losses in the next five years; and if he will put in place specific funding to upskill and re-train vulnerable workers in advance of the expected job losses. </Quest>
        <QRef>[2882/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The continued availability of a well-educated, highly skilled and flexible workforce will be critical to ensuring the continued competitiveness of the economy and to enhancing social inclusion.  Our labour market situation is favourable with forecasted 2006 employment growth of 4.4% and an unemployment rate of 4.4%.  Total employment now exceeds 2 million for the first time in the history of the State.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan 2007-2013, published last week, recognises that continued investment in education, training and upskilling will be crucial in maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s successful economic performance.  Investment in human capital will have an important role in promoting the development and competitiveness of the regions over the period of the plan.</P>
        <P>Under the plan, &euro;7.7 billion will be invested in training and skills development.  This includes some &euro;2.8 billion which will be invested in training for people in employment, new skills for those affected by industrial restructuring, expansion and enlargement of the apprenticeship system and school leavers.  Almost &euro;4.9 billion will be provided for training and employment to promote opportunities for a wide range of groups, including the unemployed, people with disabilities, lone parents and Travellers.</P>
        <P>A key input into determining investment priorities in the coming years will be the findings of the expert group on future skills needs report, entitled Towards a National Skills Strategy and due for publication shortly.</P>
        <P>In addition to supporting companies and workers at the point where redundancies are announced, F&Aacute;S and Enterprise Ireland are open to early intervention in supporting the training and upskilling of workers where the initiative is taken by the industry or sector.  A recent practical example of an early special intervention, which <Col N="144"/>offers a potentially useful model for the future, was one recently taken by the paper print and packaging industry.  In the manufacturing sector generally, the establishment of the high level manufacturing group, as provided for in Towards 2016, will include among its deliberations the challenge of supporting the upskilling of workers in that sector.  The members of that group have been appointed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply, although most of the information it contained is already known to us.  I accept his point that efforts are being made to enhance ongoing activity in upskilling workers and enhancing educational output.  Given the outflow of manufacturing jobs in particular, however, my request is that the Minister initiate an assessment by sector and geographical region to identify and target those that are most vulnerable.  Targeted upskilling of workers in these sectors should then be provided.  A fruitful exercise to begin this initiative would be to talk to some of the companies involved.  Such an approach might yield a significant amount of information.</P>
        <P>We must act in the face of various announcements of redundancies, the selling off of jobs or whatever it is called.  We should at least be grateful that we are on the other side of the task force phase where numerous groups talked a lot but did nothing.  Action must now be taken.  The economy is doing well but there remains a continuous flow of jobs leaving the economy.  Each of these job losses has a major impact, particularly in rural areas.  The consequences are huge not only for the worker but for his or her family and community.  An initiative such as I have outlined would mitigate the impact of such losses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Such action is already being taken.  We have a broad idea of the sectors that are in difficulty.  A recent Forf&aacute;s report pointed out the decline in certain traditional areas of manufacturing, including textiles, leather and electrical machinery.  On the other hand, however, we have made gains in engineering, medical devices and pharmaceuticals.  Those areas in which jobs are being lost are generally characterised by low utilisation of technology, high density of labour and corresponding difficulties in terms of cost base.</P>
        <P>The One Step Up initiative, which we launched in 2004 through F&Aacute;S, is an attempt to do what Deputy Morgan suggests, that is, provide upskilling to the existing workforce.  Some &euro;40 million was provided under this scheme in 2004 and it was expanded in 2005 and 2006.  In addition, the Skillnets programme, an industry-led upskilling initiative, has &euro;62 million to spend between now and 2009 on upskilling and training within companies and particular sectors.  Companies within a range of diverse sectors have drawn down funding under the Skillnets scheme and the feedback is positive.</P><Col N="145"/>
        <P>The national skills strategy, which we are close to finalising, will involve a ramping up of efforts in terms of upskilling the existing workforce.  This is the significant challenge facing us in the coming decade.  We must move the emphasis from acting only when people become unemployed to providing training before that happens.  I do not disagree with the fundamental point Deputy Morgan is making.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are close in our position.  I acknowledge that some investment has been made.  All I ask is that it be more focused and that the assessment I suggest should take place.  I have read the Forf&aacute;s report.  My point is that efforts in this area must be more specific.  Recent job losses include 140 in Waterford, 85 in Rooskey, County Roscommon, 30 in north Donegal and 92 in Youghal.  There is also the prospect of job losses at Motorola in Cork, although that company has at least given some notice which may allow for some degree of upskilling of staff.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister that specific investment be made in vulnerable sectors of the economy.  A detailed assessment must be made to pinpoint those sectors accurately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Morgan might list some of the job gains in the Dundalk-Drogheda area in the past six to nine months.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is busy doing so.  Deputy Morgan might make a similar acknowledgement.</P>
        <P>For the information of the House, I wish to clarify a statement I made earlier.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s letter to Deputy Rabbitte has not yet issued.</P>

        <AskConj><b> </b>asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> if he has a view on the impact on Irish business of an increase in Government and regulator-controlled charges of 55.5% between the end of 2001 and October 2006; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[2753/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I emphasise the important priority I attach to business costs and the broader issue of competitiveness.  There has been an increase in business costs in areas where statutory and independent regulators have to respond to international price movements, for example, in energy markets.  These have undoubtedly contributed to increased business costs, but these increases are also a burden on all economies.  More broadly-based increases in world commodity prices have <Col N="146"/>also increased raw material and component costs for business.</P>
        <P>I wrote to the chairman of the Commission on Energy Regulation emphasising the competitiveness implications of large energy price increases at a time when international prices were falling.  The CER agreed to my proposal for a forum, including the enterprise development agencies, at which the importance of competitiveness could be discussed with the CER in the context of its analysis of price changes.</P>
        <P>According to the Department of Finance, over the long term the Government has contributed very little to inflation.  On average in the ten years to 2006, it is estimated that indirect taxation added an average of approximately 0.5% a year to the CPI.</P>
        <P>In the mix of business input costs there will always be variability in costs.  Irish enterprises cannot be insulated from external-driven price pressures.  What we can do, however, is maintain active oversight of the competitiveness agenda and internal pressure points.  For example, in the last three budgets there was no increase in indirect taxation apart from the recent health-driven change to tobacco duty.  These budgets were designed to limit inflationary tendencies by not increasing indirect taxation.</P>
        <P>We are also making sure that the economy consistently maintains a level of relative competitiveness that encourages firms to invest, expand and create employment.  While we cannot be a low cost economy like India or China, what we are doing &mdash; and doing well &mdash; is managing our competitiveness so that we sustain growth and prosperity.</P>
        <P>I am not complacent about cost competitiveness.  We must concentrate on areas that can be influenced domestically.  It must be recognised that tackling the cost challenges requires a response from all sections of society and not only from Government.  Consequently under Towards 2016, we are re-establishing an anti-inflation group to proactively address areas where costs pressures diverge from those of our competitors.</P>
        <P>On the topic of business costs, I would also like to mention the National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s recently published Statement on the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland.  Looking at overall business costs in key sectors, the analysis points to Irish cities being on average 15% more cost competitive than the average of other high income cities.  The research highlights that Irish cities, besides Dublin, show the greatest cost competitiveness compared with others that were looked at in medical technologies, engineering and food processing.  These are important sectors for economic development and the report underlines the competitive position of a large part of our manufacturing sector.

	<P>What the Minister said is absolute nonsense.  Inflation has nothing to do with international trends but everything to do with domestic policy.  Price increases in the domestic services sector in this country are twice what they are elsewhere in Europe.  The increase in inflation is not due to higher energy prices.  Energy price inflation has declined sharply since 2006 from 14.1% in the first quarter to 1.1% in the final quarter.  </P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister mentioned the cost of doing business in Ireland and in its cities.  Will he consider the cost comparison between Dublin and Manchester in 2006?  For waste disposal, Dublin was 100% dearer; for electricity, it was 50% dearer; for gas, it was 20% dearer; for insurance, it was 40% dearer; for IT services, it was 160% dearer; and for legal services, it was 35% dearer.  It is nonsense for the Minister to say everything is great and that we have no difficulty with cost competitiveness and for the Government to abdicate its responsibility for these costs.</P>  <?oasys _cl11.3- ?>
        <P>Will the Minister indicate the measures he will take to ensure we reverse that trend and ensure Government policy is such that there is not a repeat of the 55.5% net increase in the various services I outlined relative to the rest of the European Union?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Central Statistics Office does not publish separate data covering Government and regulator-controlled charges.  We checked widely and the only source we can get for the 55.5% net increase is a Fine Gael press release of 14 December which is on the Fine Gael website.</P>

	<P>I respectfully suggest that website is not the most robust source or reference I check for figures of that kind.  The National Competitiveness Council in its report produced the data and the assessment on the cost competitiveness of Irish cities; I did not do it.  I clearly excluded Dublin in my reply.  I referred to Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford and these are important.</P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that, compared to other developed cities across Europe, some of our cities are significantly better in this respect.  That is all I was doing and it is important to record that.</P>
        <P>I agree and have articulated for a long time that we need to become more competitive in our domestic economy.  When we took a decision in the retail sector to do that in terms of the removal of the groceries order, Fine Gael again reverted to type, played to the gallery and opposed that measure in the House.</P>

	<P>Fine Gael does not have much credibility in terms of resolving some of the pressures in the domestic economy that have given rise to some of the cost issues, which we need to move to address.  There is no question that costs are a fundamental issue in any developed economy.  We are conscious of that and it is the reason the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, took a clear premeditated decision in the last three budgets not to facilitate any increases and not to increase indirect taxation in any way.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I acknowledge what the Acting Chairman is trying to achieve and I have no difficulty with it.  In respect of all the sheltered and regulated sectors the Minister spoke about, it is interesting he did not dispute the figures I gave.  That is because he has failed to do anything to address issues in regard to waste, electricity, gas, IT and legal services, although I acknowledge there has been an improvement in terms of a reduction in insurance costs.  According to the Central Bank, inflation is an increasing risk to the economy&rsquo;s export competitiveness with the re-emergence of an inflation differential with the rest of the euro area.  Does the Minister disagree with the views expressed in several reports by the National Competitiveness Council, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank or does he believe everything is okay?</P>

	<P>I ask the Minister to be brief in his reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In terms of the anti-inflation position, as part of the social partnership process, we are establishing an anti-inflation group to deal with inflationary pressures on the economy, but the broad macro statistics for Ireland are strong.  We had a very high economic growth rate in 2006 and that is also predicted for 2007.  In terms of a quality of life index and the UN human development index, we are doing particularly well and are ranked very high on it.  We are ranked eighth in the OECD group and third on the National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s benchmark.  In terms of pro-employment taxation policy, we are number two behind South Korea in regard to a pro-employment taxation policy in the context of personal taxation and corporate taxation.  In terms of ease of doing business and an education system that is most responsive to the needs of enterprise and industry, we are number one.  The Deputy can go through indices and there is quite a range of positive indices.  Insurance costs in terms of motor and household premia have significantly decreased because of the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and direct action taken by the Government.  We acknowledge there are other pressures on the economy and it is incorrect of the Deputy to dismiss the external impact over a period of oil and energy pricing.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a major challenge.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Four of the agencies under the aegis of my Department are due to decentralise as follows: F&Aacute;S is to move 383 posts to Birr, County Offaly; Enterprise Ireland is to move 292 posts to Shannon; the Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, County Kilkenny, and the National Standards Authority of Ireland is to move 132 posts to Arklow, County Wicklow.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to provide advice and support to each of the four agencies in furthering their decentralisation programmes and a dedicated agency decentralisation committee exists to drive the process forward.  In addition, I am satisfied that all agencies are fully engaged in the process and are taking all relevant steps to advance their decentralisation plans.  In outlining the current agency position on decentralisation, it must be remembered that the central applications facility, CAF, data are based on priority first preference applications.</P>
        <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, F&Aacute;S is due to transfer its head office, including some 383 posts, to Birr, County Offaly, by 2009.  Currently, two F&Aacute;S staff members are physically located in Birr and another staff member has agreed to relocate, bringing the total to three.  The staff members in question are currently situated in rented accommodation in the Birr Technology Centre.  It is anticipated that between 40 and 50 staff will be located in Birr by the end of the year.  Staff located in Birr will consist of volunteers and new recruits who continue to have the decentralisation clause in their contracts.</P>
        <P>To date, a total of 102 F&Aacute;S staff have expressed an interest in relocating to Birr, broken down as follows: a total of 26 F&Aacute;S staff have volunteered to move, outside of CAF; six F&Aacute;S staff have signed up through the CAF; 34 new entrants have signed contracts with the relocation clause; and 36 promoted staff have signed contracts with the relocation clause.  However, following industrial action these cases are being examined by the parties and the matter has been referred to the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is to move 292 posts to Shannon under the decentralisation programme.  The central applications facility indicates that 19 Enterprise Ireland staff have applied for decentralisation to Enterprise Ireland in Shannon.  Of these, 15 are based within, and four are based outside, Dublin.  The number of applications received from within the Civil Service and public service, including my Department, amounts to 33, giving a total of 52 people.</P>
        <P>While working closely with the Office of Public Works, Enterprise Ireland has identified, but not yet acquired, a preferred site for the construction of a new headquarters building in Shannon, namely, a 13 acre site owned by Shannon Development.  In co-operation with Shannon Development and the OPW, the site was valued <Col N="151"/>and a feasibility study carried out.  The site occupies a prime position in Shannon and is considered suitable for a major landmark building or civic structure.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s national regional development headquarters will be located in Shannon town, as well as a new unit to work with the city and county enterprises boards.  A senior manager has been appointed as head of regions and entrepreneurship and will guide the transition and the establishment of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s presence in the mid-west region.</P>
        <P>Currently, the Health and Safety Authority has a sanctioned staffing complement of 185 sanctioned posts, of which 110 are due to move to Thomastown, County Kilkenny.  To date a total of 62 people have expressed an interest through the central applications facility to transfer to Thomastown.</P>
        <P>The authority has been advised by the Office of Public Works that as the Thomastown site procurement process is in its final stages, the current estimated timeline for availability for occupancy is late 2008 or early 2009.  In advance of decentralising to Thomastown, in August 2006 the authority established an interim office in Kilkenny city.  A total of 15 staff, including staff recruited for the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals, REACH strategy, have relocated recently to that office in advance of moving to Thomastown.  This number will increase to 18 by March 2007.  In addition, future staff to be recruited for the REACH strategy will also be based in Thomastown.  All staff that move in the interim to the Kilkenny office will transfer to Thomastown when the premises there are completed.</P>
        <P>The authority established an interim office in Kilkenny city in August 2006 and 15 staff have relocated to that office in anticipation of moving to Thomastown.</P>
        <P>Finally, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, with a total of 132 staff, is to be relocated to Arklow.  The latest available CAF figures show a total of 107 first preference priority applications for Arklow from the wider public sector subject to the decentralisation programme.  The number of staff in NSAI who have, to date, applied for decentralisation is 11.  The total number required to be decentralised is 132 and none has been decentralised to date.  The NSAI is liaising with the OPW to identify office accommodation in the Arklow area.  The current NSAI implementation plan anticipates a target date of April 2009 as the completion date of its decentralisation programme.  However, this is dependent on the resolution of matters at central level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  When I asked this question on 10 October 2006, I was told a total of only two people from the aforementioned four bodies had decentralised.  If <Col N="152"/>I understand correctly the Minister&rsquo;s comprehensive reply in respect of the Health and Safety Authority, the original figure of 12 people who had moved to Kilkenny has increased to 15.  Am I correct in deducing that between 10 October and 31 January, a net sum of three additional people has moved to temporary accommodation?  The total number of staff scheduled for decentralisation on 10 October was 917.  Of that, a grand total of 18 moved and 899 remain.  This has happened after many people expressed interest, many plans were put in place, promises were explored and many contracts were negotiated.  No doubt many people got inside tracks on where and when things might happen with decentralisation.  Since the announcement in the 2004 budget, only 18 people have moved and they are currently housed in temporary accommodation.  Is this a fair understanding of what the Minister has achieved in the past two and a half years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have laid out in detail for the House the number of staff that each agency plans to decentralise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the 917 staff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an open secret that the agency side of the equation has not been as rapid as the normal decentralisation programmes with civil servants.  For example, my Department has been well subscribed in terms of its move to Carlow and it is going well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>My question refers to the agencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We are making progress on the agencies in terms of the issues identified.  Under the timelines of 2008 and 2009, F&Aacute;S will have a significant presence in Offaly, Enterprise Ireland will have a significant presence in Shannon and likewise with the Health and Safety Authority in Thomastown.  There have been some difficulties with specialist posts in the NSAI that require further resolution.</P>
        <P>While there have been delays in progressing the programme, our commitment to decentralisation is total.  We want it to happen and are anxious that it does so because of the benefit it will bring to the regions concerned.  We hope this policy has support across the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister confirm that people in any of the specialist agencies, who are not civil servants, will not be forced to decentralise if they do not wish to?  This was not envisaged at the time when Mr. McCreevy introduced the raid on decentralisation through the budget process.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on what the implications will be for the loss of institutional memory and expertise in the agencies under his responsibility?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="153"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 149 together.</P>
        <P>Since Hospira made its announcement in respect of its Donegal plant, IDA Ireland had been working closely with the company to secure a replacement for the facility. In March 2006, Abbott, one of the world&rsquo;s largest health care companies, announced that it was acquiring the facility from Hospira and that it planned to make a &euro;36 million investment, with the support of IDA Ireland, to establish a manufacturing facility for its diabetes care products in Donegal town.  This new investment will create 155 high quality jobs at full production.  Abbott has now taken possession of the plant and recruitment of key executives is under way along with the redevelop<Col N="154"/>ment of the site to meet the needs of the new company.</P>
        <P>As regards employment generally in Donegal I published the report of the interdepartmental group on Donegal in July 2006.  I established the group at the request of the Government following a number of major job losses in the county in recent years.  I asked the interdepartmental group to focus on the progress being made on infrastructural requirements to make Donegal a more attractive location for enterprise creation, particularly as it makes the transition from traditional to more modern and higher value-added industries.  The report showed that Donegal has no shortage of advantages and opportunities in so far as the promise of a brighter future for its inhabitants is concerned.  A dynamic combination of State development agencies is active in Donegal, committed to enhancing the attractiveness of the county for business.  These agencies have demonstrated the ability to provide a clear vision and focus for future economic development.  IDA Ireland will pursue more knowledge-based greenfield FDI sites for Donegal and convince existing IDA clients to transform their current operations to higher value activities.  Enterprise Ireland will encourage and assist more innovative, technology-led companies and promote a greater level of start-up activity.  These actions are a recognition of the challenges facing traditional industry and both agencies are responding, as is &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The county enterprise board will continue to provide existing and new supports to microenterprises complementing the work of both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>The provision of much needed infrastructure has been highlighted as an obstacle to job creation in Donegal over a number of years.  I was pleased that the report identified much good news in terms of developments under way or planned in the areas of roads, air, water supply and treatment, broadband, energy and education.  These have been solidified and strengthened in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 just launched.  Particular emphasis has also been placed in the NDP on North-South co-operation and developments which will be of direct benefit to Donegal.</P>
        <P>I also believe that what has already been achieved in terms of job creation in the past year is largely as a result of the ongoing commitment to Donegal of the State development agencies, the infrastructural developments recently completed and the commitment to ongoing and planned developments.  In addition to the Abbott announcement, recent major job announcements include SITA, ZEUS, PowerBoard and AssetCo.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government and the State development agencies are fully committed to fostering the environment for job creation in Donegal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will understand why Deputy McGinley and I are concerned about the level of unemployment in County Donegal, which stands at 14%, significantly above the national average.  It requires special attention because, notwithstanding the Minister&rsquo;s reply, County Donegal feels isolated from the rest of the country.  Not enough has been done in recent development plans to ensure infrastructure such as broadband, access to roads and other services which the Minister mentioned are delivered to Donegal.  There is a willingness to provide this infrastructure in the current plan but implementation is what matters.  Despite several national development plans, Donegal has lost competitiveness in both traditional and other industries.  I welcome what the Minister said on announcements in the past year but he will realise that Donegal is starting from a low base in terms of employment opportunities.</P>
        <P>When will the Government be in a position to announce further infrastructural developments for Donegal, particularly those with a North-South dimension?  The economic well-being of Donegal is often intertwined with the economic activities of Northern Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>A significant investment package was announced for the North in the national development plan, which will be of direct benefit to Donegal.  I am not sure 14% is an accurate figure for unemployment in the county.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure is high, in any event.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been job losses in traditional industries in Donegal, such as textiles, creating considerable difficulties for those affected.  However, the number of people on the live register has been reduced from 9,900 in 2002 to 8,774 in December 2006, although we would like there to be a more rapid decline.  Significant companies supported by the IDA such as PacifiCare, Pramerica Systems, SITA and others have announced the creation of an extra 1,200 jobs.  Enterprise Ireland has also worked hard in the area, leading to AssetCo relocating from the UK to Donegal.  Companies such as PowerBar and PowerBoard are other companies to have set up in Donegal.</P>
        <P>The Letterkenny business park has now been completed and construction, involving Donegal County Council, to extend the Letterkenny ring road to the park is nearing completion.  Work has commenced on an office building of 2,300 sq. m at Windyhall and work is under way on the development of technology units and an additional advance office building at Lisnenan.  In Donegal town, IDA Ireland has commissioned architects to design a 1,000 sq. m office building in Lurganboy and has applied for planning permission.  Also, IDA Ireland has taken on a significant amount of site development work in Ballyshannon, which is now complete, and land has <Col N="156"/>been purchased in Buncrana and planning permission obtained for a factory of 2,000 sq. m. The IDA is working with a local private developer in the provision of additional buildings on the estate.</P>
        <P>Regarding the interdepartmental report alluded to, my Department was the main catalyst and brought other Departments into the process.  We managed to accelerate a range of infrastructural developments, including roads, transport, water and so on.  Electricity continues to need a push.  When I met members of the council at the publication of the report, I told them it is important to have consensus in the community and society on the provision of badly needed infrastructure, including electricity.  There have been planning issues and campaigns against the development, but the continued attraction of big industrial players will require power generation infrastructure and electricity transmission capacity.  This issue requires political consensus and a collective endeavour among all political parties and groups that are anxious to see County Donegal advance industrially and economically.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128, 141, 159 and 196 together.</P><Col N="157"/>
        <P>In December 2005, agreement was reached between SIPTU, the Seamen&rsquo;s Union of Ireland and Irish Ferries on the number of redundancies to be effected, voluntary severance packages to those workers taking redundancy, the terms and conditions of those workers opting to remain with Irish Ferries, the terms and conditions of agency workers for a specified period and the maintenance of existing arrangements.  Following this agreement, 447 employees were made redundant.  Irish Ferries applied for a rebate under the statutory redundancy scheme on 17 February 2006.</P>
        <P>The first point to note is that the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2003 provide for entitlements for workers whose jobs are lost in certain circumstances and corresponding obligations on employers to pay statutory redundancy to the workers.  When employers pay statutory redundancy to their workers in accordance with the Acts, they are entitled to rebates from the social insurance fund.  All decisions to pay a redundancy rebate must be based on the facts of the case and the Acts.  There is no room for the exercise of ministerial preference or the consideration of matters extraneous to the redundancy legislation.</P>
        <P>When the rebate application was received in my Department it was, as is the usual practice, examined thoroughly.  This gave rise to doubts as to the eligibility of the application under section 7 of the Acts.  The issue of eligibility was referred to the Office of the Attorney General for legal advice.  A number of complex legal issues requiring further information from Irish Ferries arose at several stages during consideration of the matter.</P>
        <P>The issue was considered in detail on the basis of the legal advice received and the facts of the case and it was determined that Irish Ferries was legally entitled to receive a rebate in accordance with the Acts.  As yet, no payments have been made, but extensive work on checking all claims has commenced.  It is anticipated that a rebate in the order of &euro;4.3 million will be paid to Irish Ferries by the end of February.</P>
        <P>It is not possible at this stage to provide average statutory redundancy amounts received by the employees, as all claims have not been checked in my Department.  Payment of statutory redundancy is a matter for the employer in the first instance, under which each employee is entitled to two weeks&rsquo; pay per year of service up to a maximum of &euro;600 plus a bonus week.  <i>Ex gratia</i> payments are a matter for the employer and employee and my Department has no involvement in such arrangements.</P>
        <P>There has been no written or verbal contact between Irish Ferries and my office or that of my colleague the Minister of State with special responsibility for trade and commerce, Deputy Michael Ahern.  Searches of my diary and the representations tracking system in my office have not revealed any record of contacts between the Minister&rsquo;s office and Irish Ferries in the past three months.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="158"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Did the Minister have any discretion in respect of declaring the redundancy a voluntary severance scheme?  If the Attorney General had not declared the matter a collective redundancy, we could have avoided paying the rebate to Irish Ferries.  If the matter had not been declared a redundancy, could the former employees have received their compensation tax-free?  How much was the average redundancy worth?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister have information on how many Irish Ferries workers have found employment elsewhere and is he aware that the replacement crews are mainly non-nationals whose working conditions are unacceptable?  Do we intend to take action or investigate this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not have discretion and must follow the law.  We received legal advice in this regard.  We have published the heads of new legislation to address such situations and will publish the Bill, which will deal with collective redundancies, to prevent a repeat of the Irish Ferries case on land shortly.  It was a major part of the social partnership talks.</P>
        <P>On taxation status, if they were not declared to be redundancies under the Acts or the rebate was unpaid, I understand the workers would have been liable for tax on the payments they received.  It would have been a different tax arrangement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that an explanation for the mystery?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I am responding to a question asked of me and putting the information on the record.  I am not entirely happy with the conditions that pertain in the maritime world because they are a cause for considerable concern.  Given our labour laws and conditions, what pertains in the maritime world seems to be a retreat from what we would accept in developed economies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government facilitated the retreat.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The matter must be resolved internationally because it leads to competitive pressures if people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Extend land labour laws to European seas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I recall that when the Cork-Swansea ferry service was set up ten or 15 years ago with council involvement, the rates earned by crews were not similar to those of traditional B&amp;I crews.  It has been a trend in the international maritime sector that we do not want applied to Irish domestic conditions.  In the context of the proposed domestic legislation that has emanated from our discussion with the social partners, we are trying to close off opportunities for this type of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="159"/>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be European-wide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;undermining of basic pay standards and conditions.  Everyone in the House would aspire to such.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister satisfied that every legitimate obstacle was put in the way of the deal made by Irish Ferries when it ripped off taxpayers and hoodwinked its workers?  If not preventable, could the deal have been slowed, thereby discouraging others from following suit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>A more robust interpretation of the law would have established the answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy can recollect, we managed to involve the Labour Relations Commission contrary to the initial wishes of some of the parties, particularly the employers.  The commission played a significant role in trying to resolve the issues at the time.  A variety of sources pressured the commission and some pressed for a resolution.</P>
        <P>The scale of the redundancy payment created its own momentum towards resolving the issue.  Deputy Quinn used other language to describe the situation, but the reality is that the payment was probably higher than the scale of normal redundancies.  This led to pressure on representative bodies to accept the deal.  We managed to keep events inside the labour relations process and to have both parties engage with the labour relations machinery of the State, which we were anxious to achieve.  It was the best we could do in the context of the law that applies, outside of which the Government cannot go.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Most people would understand that the job is made redundant, not the worker, so it is hard to get one&rsquo;s head around the fact that the workers were replaced in exactly the same jobs.  That is why it is difficult to reconcile the redundancy payments.  The Minister said complex legal questions arose and that he has his own views on the matter but it is hard to reconcile the payments in the absence of an understanding of those legal questions.  It would be in all our interests if we could see the legal advice because otherwise we are speaking in a vacuum and there is a deficit of information.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister expect the legislation to address this matter to be passed before the general election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is our intention that the legislation will be passed before the election; we will publish the Bill shortly.  It is not normal procedure, however, to publish the advice of the Attorney General.  We were conscious of this and that is why we want to introduce the legislation.  We have consulted social partners on it and we will now move ahead.  We want to close off any <Col N="160"/>other potential opportunities.  We do not want to see this replicated on land in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister explain again the taxation treatment of this redundancy payment?  Why is it tax free?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is called redundancy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Martin Brady asked whether, if it was not declared to be redundancy in conformity with the Act, people would be liable to taxation, and I understand that they would be.  I can get the details for the Deputy but that is the implication for the workers.  If a decision was taken that the payment was not in accordance with the Redundancy Payment Acts, that would be the position.  It is understood by all concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I take it from the Minister&rsquo;s replies to Deputies Martin Brady and Catherine Murphy that extra, unusual representations were made by representative bodies in the context of this redundancy package because of the numbers involved?  Could one deduce from that reply that a certain interpretation of the law, and the opinion given on it, which the Attorney General took 12 months to deliver and which remains secret, was such that the most benign interpretation of the legal advice was taken in respect of this package because of pressure of an exceptional nature being brought to bear?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what I said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It sounded like that to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Morgan asked if, at the time of the controversy, when Irish Ferries announced its decision, obstacles could have been put in the way then.  In response I said that at the time, when the Labour Relations Commission was overseeing the negotiations between the two trade unions and the employer, there were different pressures on the participating parties.  It would be wrong to take from that that representations were made to us in the context of the decision.  This decision was based on the legal advice we received.  We did not have any representations from the unions.  The unions would not be happy with the determination made and they have articulated that.  IBEC was anxious that the process would be speeded up one way or another.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Am I wrong in saying that a redundancy was described as not a redundancy to ensure the payments made by the company, Irish Ferries, to the 447 workers who agreed reluctantly to sell their jobs for a sum of money were not liable for income tax?  Am I off the wall in saying that?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="161"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is wrong.  We should not read this and spin it out the wrong way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the outcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Martin Brady asked a question seeking clarity on the tax status of a lump sum paid to workers which would not be in conformity with the Acts and I gave him a simple, straight answer to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>If it was not a redundancy, it would be taxed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing can be deduced from that in the context of the motivation or rationale behind the decision that was taken.  As I said, it is not a matter for personal preference.  We must look at the law as it is, take the advice we are given and make a decision.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to report that my Department is making significant progress on commitments in Towards 2016.  Work on the preparation of the necessary legislation to give effect to the comprehensive package of measures contained in the agreement concerning employment standards is being progressed as a matter of urgency.  In addition, the additional resources identified under the agreement for compliance enforcement, adjudication and redress have been approved.</P>
        <P>Preparation of the employment law compliance Bill is well advanced.  Early consultation with the social partners and other interested parties is proposed as a prelude to seeking Government approval for drafting the Bill.  I am committed to publishing the Bill in 2007.</P>
        <P>The Director of the National Employment Rights Authority has been appointed and will take up duty on 12 February 2007.  The advisory board will be established on an interim basis early in 2007.  The headquarters management has been selected &mdash; some of them are already in place and the rest, including a legal adviser and accountant, will take up duty in the coming weeks.  Recruitment and assignment of the remainder of the NERA staff will be progressed in the context of decentralisation arrangements with a view to the additional posts being filled from the second quarter of 2007.  It is my intention that the trebling of Labour Inspectorate staff will be completed in 2007.</P>
        <P>The protection of employment &mdash; exceptional collective redundancies &mdash; Bill is at an advanced <Col N="162"/>stage of drafting.  It will address cases of collective redundancies where specific situations apply and provide for the extension of unfair dismissals protection in situations where all employees are involved in dismissal following a strike.  It is expected that the Bill will be published in a couple of weeks.</P>
        <P>Draft legislative proposals to give effect to the commitments set out in Towards 2016 for the regulation of employment agencies and agency workers are at present the subject of discussion with the social partners.  These discussions are nearing conclusion and it is intended that specific proposals will be considered by the Government during February.  Subject to the Government&rsquo;s agreement, the proposals will then be sent to the Office of the Attorney General for drafting.</P>
        <P>The Labour Relations Commission is finalising its work on the preparation of a code of practice for people working in other people&rsquo;s homes and it is expected that its work will be finalised within the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to preparing and publishing this year a Green Paper on pensions policy which will take account of the views of the social partners.  There will be further consultations following publication and the Government is committed to respond to these within 12 months of ratification of Towards 2016 by developing a framework for comprehensively addressing the pensions agenda over the longer term.</P>
        <P>The Government has agreed in principle in Towards 2016 to the transposition into Irish law of the optional pensions provision of the Transfer of Undertakings Directive and is committed to finalising its consideration of the issue by the end of 2007 following consultation with IBEC and ICTU on the implications of the options for transposition.</P>
        <P>Work has commenced on the Green Paper and the issues arising in the context of transfer of undertakings.  A partnership pensions review group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and including the social partners and the Pensions Board, has been established to progress the issue.</P>
        <P>On 29 November 2006, the Labour Court recommended that the minimum hourly rate of pay should be increased to &euro;8.30 with effect from 1 January 2007 and to &euro;8.65 with effect from 1 July 2007.  By order signed on 20 December 2006, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for labour affairs gave effect to the court&rsquo;s recommendation.</P>
        <P>New employment permit arrangements will come into effect on 1 February.  The Employment Permits Act passed by the Oireachtas last year provides the statutory basis for the new schemes.  The four new types of employment permit are the green card scheme, the work permit, the intra-company transfer permit and spousal and <Col N="163"/>dependant permits.  Workers under the new arrangements may apply and reapply for their own permits, with the exception of the intra-company transfer scheme.</P>
        <P>Consultations took place with the social partners prior to the introduction of the new arrangements.  The new arrangements provide that employment permit applications will not be approved for wages below the REA-ERO rate or the national minimum wage, whichever is appropriate.</P>
        <P>New employment permits will contain a statement on the principal employment rights of the employee, including a prohibition from making any deductions from remuneration or seeking to recover any charge, fee or expense relating to the application for the permit.  The new employment permit arrangements, in particular those relating to contracts for service supplied, will include provisions to ensure adequate safeguards to protect employment rights, including, in most cases, the requirement for employment by an Irish-based employer.  Employment permit holders will be facilitated in transferring to another employment in cases of unfair treatment.  The employment of non-EEA students will be made subject to employment permits in 2007.  Work is under way to draw up a scheme to implement this.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has also been made by my Department of other non-legislative workplace issues.  In March 2005 a high level group was established to oversee implementation of the national workplace strategy.  The first report of the implementation group which was sent to Government, was published on 3 August 2006.  The report outlined the group&rsquo;s progress since its establishment.  Achievements were noted under the strategy&rsquo;s five priority themes: promoting workplace innovation, promoting capacity for change, developing future skills, access to opportunities and quality of working life.  Towards 2016 provides for the establishment of a three-year workplace innovation fund to enable the parties to the agreement and the NCPP to build a stronger commitment to workplace innovation by encouraging the development of new ways of working.  On 10 January 2007, the Taoiseach announced that a sum of &euro;9 million would be available to the fund.  The fund comprises three strands as follows &mdash; promotion of innovation at enterprise level, support for capacity building among social partners and a public awareness campaign.</P>
        <P>The research required to develop the national skills strategy provided for in Towards 2016 has been completed and will be published shortly.  The review of the workplace learning and upskilling offerings available from the point of view of user friendliness-modularisation and future skills requirements among other things, is scheduled for 2007 and it may take the form of a number of sub-reviews.  Towards 2016 also provides for the <Col N="164"/>need to examine the availability of workplace learning and upskilling to lower skilled and vulnerable workers including in manufacturing as well as to workers from overseas.  During the year my Department will invest nearly &euro;70 million to train those already in employment.  In addition, &euro;130 million, a significant increase on last year&rsquo;s provision, has been made available to fund apprenticeship training programmes to cater for historically high numbers of apprentices.  Under the NDP overall &euro;2.8 billion in public funds will be invested in training people in employment, new skills for those affected by industrial restructuring, expansion and enlargement of the apprenticeship system and school leavers.  Both F&Aacute;S and Skillnets have been asked to bring forward proposals to target low-skilled workers.</P>
        <P>The high level group on manufacturing provided for under Towards 2016 has been established.  Progress has been so rapid and extensive that I could go on forever.  The first formal meeting of the group is scheduled to take place on 9 February 2007.  The seventh framework programme, FP7, commenced on 1 January 2007.  A new national support structure has been put in place to give practical effect to the stated Government priority on FP7.  A key feature of the strengthened support structure was the appointment of a national director for FP7 who heads up a dedicated FP7 office based in Enterprise Ireland.  The national director will ensure a co-ordinated approach is adopted in the provision of support to researchers and companies across all of the components of FP7.</P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006, which revoked the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987, I asked the Competition Authority to review and monitor developments in the grocery sector in light of the new regulatory environment.  Since the removal of the order, the Competition Authority has received no complaints of anti-competitive behaviour in the sector, nor has it seen any evidence of such behaviour.  The authority is currently putting its grocery monitor project in place.  In April 2007 one year of post-groceries order data will be available for analysis.  Later in 2007 the authority intends to publish an analysis of developments in the sector focusing on pricing trends, market structures and barriers to entry.</P>

	<P>I refer to the labour inspectorate and the new national employment regulation authority, which is a key element of Towards 2016 because of the many concerns about abuses in the labour market.  A total of 2.028 million are employed, which is a wonderful statistic, but fewer than 30 labour inspectors are in place to ensure workers and their employers comply with health and safety legislation and labour market <Col N="165"/>regulation.

	<P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Cowley &mdash; to ask the Minister if she will carry out an urgent review of the DEIS scheme situation for nine Mayo schools (details supplied) which will be affected; will she agree that this is an inequitable situation which is not in the spirit of helping the disadvantaged and will she confirm the affected Mayo secondary schools will be reviewed immediately, and funding guaranteed to avoid disastrous consequences for the affected students; (2) Deputy Ring &mdash; the flood relief package available for people who have had their property damaged, incurred stock losses etc. in the floods over the last few months in Mayo, particularly areas in south Mayo such as Kilmaine, Hollymount, the Neale, Aughamore, Claremorris and in Crossmolina; advise exactly what help is available for flood relief; what is proposed to resolve the flooding issue in the long term and what funding will be allocated for this purpose; (3) Deputy Ferris &mdash; the pressure being placed on fishermen to go to sea in dangerous conditions due to the current regulatory system; (4) Deputy Durkan &mdash; the serious and ongoing issue of overcrowding on commuter trains from Sallins, Hazelhatch, Kilcock, Maynooth and Leixlip to the city and return whereby passengers more often than not have to remain standing for the entire journey with consequent health and safety implications and the need for the Minister to issue instructions to increase the frequency of the service and the capacity of the trains with enhanced feeder bus backup; (5) Deputy Costello <Col N="166"/>&mdash; the need for the Government to introduce a system of random searches of CIA-operated aircraft landing at Irish airports to ensure that Irish airports are not being used for rendition flights; (6) Deputy Callanan &mdash; to ask the Minister to expedite the building of a new school in Aughrim (details supplied) as this school is grossly overcrowded and does not meet the needs of the population of Aughrim; (7) Deputy McHugh &mdash; the need to provide a new national school at Aughrim, Ballinasloe, County Galway to replace the existing St. Catherine&rsquo;s national school (details supplied); (8) Deputy Lynch &mdash; the position on the possible loss of 300 jobs at the Motorola plant in Cork; (9) Deputy Connaughton &mdash; the very poor conditions at St. Catherine&rsquo;s national school, Aughrim, Ballinasloe, County Galway, where 120 pupils and their teachers operate in mice-infested, damp and grossly overcrowded conditions which include three fabricated buildings and where the huge increase in new houses in the locality demand a new school to cater for at least eight teachers together with all auxiliary services and to determine if it is the Department&rsquo;s intention to build such a new school; (10) Deputy Catherine Murphy &mdash; the continued method of allocating funds to local authorities based on the needs and resources model which is unfair to developing counties, when commercial rates receipts and transfers from the local government fund are combined the <i>per capita </i>spend demonstrates just how disadvantaged the most rapidly developing counties are. The ability of these counties to absorb additional population and build quality communities is impacted by this continuing situation; (11) Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe &mdash; the closure of the national domestic violence intervention agency and the consequences of this for the victims of domestic violence; (12) Deputy O&rsquo;Shea &mdash; the need for equal treatment of drift net fishermen in the Waterford constituency when administering the hardship fund; (13) Deputy Boyle &mdash; the position on the possible loss of 300 jobs at the Motorola plant in Cork; (14) Deputy Burton &mdash; the failure of the Minister to provide more language resource teachers for schools in Dublin West and other areas for large numbers of international pupils with limited or no English language and the huge difficulties this is causing for all pupils and teachers in such schools and for teachers contrary to repeated promises and undertakings made by the Minister and her officials to address this urgent problem; (15) Deputy Allen &mdash; the position on the possible loss of 300 jobs at the Motorola plant in Cork; (16) Deputy Gogarty &mdash; the need for the Government to purchase the lands at St. Edmundsbury-Woodville or to extend the special amenity area order as far as the Lucan road so that these lands can be preserved intact for future generations, preferably as part of a Liffey Valley national or regional park; (17) Deputy Deenihan &mdash; the delay in the technical assessment <Col N="167"/>in relation to the amalgamation of Lixnaw boys and girls primary schools in County Kerry; and (18) Deputy Pat Breen &mdash; the issue of the recent flooding in the Clonlara area of east Clare, the remedial measures which are proposed to prevent a recurrence of this flooding, and whether a liaison structure will be put in place so that the ESB will be precluded from releasing flood waters without adequate notice and with full consideration of the damaging effects such actions may have on surrounding lands.</P>
        <P>The matters raised by Deputies O&rsquo;Shea, Lynch, Boyle and Allen have been selected for discussion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to welcome the Taoiseach and his motley crew back into this arena.  No matter what way the Taoiseach looks at it, the health service is in crisis and the Government still does not appear to understand what it should do to sort that out.  Every day, on average, 250 people lie on trolleys in hospital corridors while 29,000 are waiting to see consultants and 40,000 operations have been cancelled.  Earlier, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, which is one of the best and busiest in the country, had to cancel operations again because there are not sufficient intensive care beds and patients who are sick are being cared for in high dependency beds following the cancellation of serious operations.  After ten years of this carry on from the Government parties who have always talked about their plans, two words sum them up &mdash; wasting and waiting.  They have wasted the people&rsquo;s money and when they are sick, they make them wait even longer.  For some, unfortunately, that is the last thing they do.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s response is absolute silence while the HSE&rsquo;s response is to ask hospital management to explain why these difficulties have resurfaced at this time.  When one talks to somebody who has prepared for a serious operation and who finds it has been postponed, one can understand the depth of feeling and anger.  The fundamental issue, which has not been addressed by the Government parties over the past ten years, is bed capacity.  In 2001, 3,000 additional beds were promised together with an end to waiting lists by 2004.  These were false promises and these commitments have not been, and will not be, honoured.  What would the Taoiseach like to say to the 20 people whose operations were cancelled earlier or the 29,000 people who are waiting to see consultants or the 40,000 whose operations have been cancelled?  What will the Government do about this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny asked me three questions.  Our figures differ a little.  On his first question regarding patient waiting times, the HSE, which has responsibility for all 50 hospitals, continues to report significant improvements in <Col N="168"/>the numbers of patients awaiting admission compared to the same period in previous years.  The average number of patients awaiting admission during the December to January period was more than 50% lower than the equivalent period 12 months ago.  I would have thought that was worthy of acknowledgement.  Obviously, the lower it gets, the better, but we would like to acknowledge the efforts being made by the HSE.  The average number awaiting admission in January up to last night was 111, whereas the average number for admission during the same period last year was 259.  January&rsquo;s 57% reduction follows October at minus 34%, November at minus 32% and December at minus 53%.  The HSE also hopes to reduce the over 24-hours category, which is now down to 4% of patients, to 12 hours over the next few months.  I think that is important.</P>
        <P>The second point Deputy Kenny made was that 40,000 operations were cancelled.  I do not think any operations were cancelled, although some were postponed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Either way, they did not take place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Figures released by the HSE show that in the first six months of last year, 10,368 operations were postponed, not cancelled.  That figure represents 2% of the total number of 527,000 patients who were treated in acute hospitals in the first six months of last year.  While it always regrettable to postpone operations, they are postponed for a variety of reasons, including emergency cases resulting from road traffic accidents and other priorities being taken over elective cases, infection control and the availability of medical and nursing personnel.  Operations are also postponed for medical and social reasons at the request of patients. </P>
        <P>The third question raised by Deputy Kenny referred to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  The bed numbers in St. James&rsquo;s have increased significantly by a total of 140 beds under the bed capacity initiative in new units developed over the past few years.  The HSE informs me that it is aware of the pressure on the intensive care unit capacity in St. James&rsquo;s and it has entered discussions with management on that issue to help rather than, as Deputy Kenny said, to hinder.  The HSE has offered its full support in terms of assisting fast-track post-acute patients in other settings in order to free up intensive care unit beds.  It has also begun discussions with the hospital with a view to increasing high dependency capacity and advises that intensive care unit capacity has been increased from nine to 14 beds over the past few years.  A national bed capacity review is currently being conducted, which will include the assessment of critical care beds.  The critical carers society will be an important participant in that exercise.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="169"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with the Taoiseach and am not inclined to give great credence to his statements about reductions in waiting times in accident and emergency units.  He is well aware that a deliberate massaging of the figures is taking place.  People are being moved from accident and emergency units to elective beds in which people were supposed to be recovering from operations.  However, their operations have been cancelled.  The Government and the Taoiseach made more than one promise that 29,000 patients would be removed from waiting lists by 2004.  What happened to those broken promises?</P>
        <P>Dublin hospitals operate at between 1% and 4% spare capacity, even though the best operational standards recommend 15% spare capacity.  That means a hospital such as Beaumont has between six and 18 beds available if a crisis occurs.  Last night, I visited a number of patients in that hospital.  What this Government has permitted to happen in Beaumont and other hospitals is incredible.  With between 1% and 4% spare capacity, Dublin hospitals are literally operating on a knife edge.</P>
        <P>What happened to the promise to end the waiting lists by 2004?  Does the Taoiseach accept that the figures are being deliberately massaged to make the HSE and the Minister for Health and Children look good in terms of numbers on waiting lists and in accident and emergency units?  Why does there appear to be no responsibility or accountability within the HSE?  Surely, somebody should have asked every person working in that organisation to outline his or her job responsibilities but nobody seems to be able to determine that.</P>
        <P>This is traditionally the night on which people leave out a piece of white cloth so that St. Brigid, if she is around, would keep sickness away.  Maybe it is the case that the Government should turn that into a white flag and give up because it has failed abjectly and utterly on health and the people of this country will not forget that when they get their chance to vote within the next 20 weeks.</P>

	<P>We are paying 140,000 people in our health service to work hard and they are working hard.  Deputy Kenny is correct in that the spare capacity in most acute areas of the health service is very tight.  That always has been the case and I would say it will continue to do so.  As we increased bed numbers by 1,500 and used the National Treatment Purchase Fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am answering Deputy Kenny.  We have used the National Treatment Purchase Fund to treat many of the people on waiting lists.  Opposition Deputies should not try to paint the picture that the people who were on the waiting list five years ago are still waiting.  There will always be people on waiting lists.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying to the Deputy&rsquo;s leader.  We have increased capacity in practically every hospital in the country.  Last year, the HSE contracted from the private and nursing home sector more than 1,000 beds, concentrated particularly but not only in the Dublin area.  This year, it plans to contract 360 beds with the private sector, more than 220 of which will be in Dublin, and it proposes to extend public capacity by 446 this year by building on what it did last year.  Of course, it is already planning beds for next year.  That will provide a total of nearly 800 long-stay beds during the course of this year, comprising 350 private and 446 public beds.  Significant resources are being put into that and they are being used well.  This comes in addition to projects such as the rapid access clinic, which is a new initiative and is now up and running to treat a large number of elderly people, the hospital in the home service, which is being used by teaching hospitals including Connolly and is a very good service, and the out-of-hours system, including the Dublin north doctor on call service in particular, for which the HSE deserves great credit.  For almost a quarter of a century, there was no out-of-hours service by GPs in the Dublin area.  I acknowledge the work done by GPs and we now have centres in Ashtown Gate, Coolock, Ballymun and North Strand which offer excellent services every night and on Saturdays and Sundays by the best qualified GPs.  GP diagnostics and community intervention schemes have also been established and work is ongoing by the accident and emergency task force.</P>
         <P>Deputy Kenny knows that the improvement of 57% in January is an enormous figure.  I do not like to see anybody waiting for anything but it is <Col N="171"/>impossible to reach a situation like that.  However, they are working hard to reach it, which means at times that elective cases are not taken because if there is huge pressure on accident and emergency units and no free beds, hospitals will not admit elective patients.  It is not perfect but that is the position.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am answering Deputy Kenny.  The Deputy can raise it the next day the Minister for Health and Children is taking questions.  That is what they are doing, but they are still seeing more patients on an inpatient basis, more on an outpatient basis and more under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I know it is a rising population, but they are getting more resources to do this and people need to acknowledge it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach seemed to reject Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s factual assertion that the accident and emergency figures are being deliberately massaged.  One of the ways that is happening is that elective surgical procedures are being cancelled.  The Taoiseach admits this is happening and suggests that it is normal.  He is suggesting it is normal for the elective appointments of cardiac and cancer patients to be cancelled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>At the last minute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is saying that in Ireland in 2007 it is normal for patients suffering from cancer and cardiac problems to have their appointments cancelled.  I have a letter from a woman from the former Southern Health Board area dated 23 January.  She has cardiac problems and on instructions from her GP was rushed to Cork University Hospital.  She has now received a letter stating that her appointment for an x-ray examination would be on Wednesday, 5 December 2007 at 10 a.m.  She received a second letter on the same day, stating that her appointment for an x-ray examination would be on Friday, 7 December 2007 at 11 a.m.  Two letters were sent to the same woman suffering from a heart condition advising her of an x-ray on two different dates in December &mdash; she is expected to wait for a year.  How can that be justified?</P>
        <P>The cancer strategy has already been derailed.  The cystic fibrosis area is in crisis and money is unspent.  The negotiations on the common contract for consultants are logjammed.  The doctor-only medical cards have not been taken up.  Now we have the problems in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is arguably the best run hospital in this city and unprecedentedly it now states it cannot cope.  The Taoiseach has come in and quoted statistics.  Is it not the case that this is about capacity, beds and the relevant staff?  When will the Government address any of these issues?  Given the shortage of nurses in this city, what is the Taoiseach saying to the INO, which now feels the necessity to threaten industrial action because of grievances it has?  What is the Government&rsquo;s official position on the INO dispute?  What advice will he give to nurses who will be interested in what he has to say on the way forward?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to correct Deputy Rabbitte, who was obviously preparing his notes and did not listen to the final reply I gave to Deputy Kenny &mdash; which I can understand.  I said &ldquo;elective operations&rdquo;.  I did not categorise any elective operations.  I said that when there is pressure on a hospital through its accident and emergency unit, it holds back on elective admissions.</P>

	<P>He is waffling again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I got five seconds into it anyway.  We have spent large resources successfully to ensure that more than 40,000 inpatients with cancer are treated and there are 55,000 more day cases.  We have created more than 110 consultant posts in the cancer area and more than 300 new cancer specialist posts.  We are building cancer services through the cancer control strategy, which has been welcomed by everybody involved.  We have extended BreastCheck.  We are investing in new cancer treatment.  We have guaranteed capital funding, including more than &euro;400 million for the new radiotherapy network.  The HSE will implement this as quickly as possible.  I do not accept some of the recent claims that it could not be done by 2011.  We have seen what a private operation in Waterford could do in two years.  The resources have been provided.  It is carrying out the task and putting far more people through the system.  It is the same with cardiac procedures.  We have effectively eliminated cardiac lists.  We used only to have cardiac surgery in Crumlin for children.</P>

	<P>I know what the INO case is, but I do not know what the Government&rsquo;s response is, which is what interests me.  What is the Taoiseach saying his Government will do in response to the INO position?  That is the question.</P>
        <P>If the Taoiseach agrees that elective operations are being cancelled, I suggest he asks his backbenchers whether any cardiac or cancer cases are included.  They know they are because they are knocking at people&rsquo;s doors stating that it is the fault of the Minister, Deputy Harney, while the Taoiseach stills tolerates in Cabinet the man who bequeathed this disastrous legacy to her.  At the launch of the latest health strategy in 2004, the Taoiseach sat with his Minister for Finance and pledged solemnly to the people that nobody would wait for longer than three months.  People are still waiting for longer than 12 months.</P>
        <P>In a recent reply to a question from Deputy McManus about the number of care beds in the country, the HSE stated on 6 December that &ldquo;information on intensive care beds and day beds is not currently available&rdquo;.  In his capacity as chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, Deputy Moloney got a letter from the Intensive Care Society of Ireland, <Col N="175"/>drawing his attention to the fact that precisely what has happened in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital this morning would happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The letter went on to point out:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Society would like to draw the attention of the Committee to this policy of closure of adult ICU beds at a time when the population is expanding.  DOHC has stated that the ratio of adult ICU beds to acute hospital beds is 2.2%.  This is incorrect.  The ratio is in fact<?oasys _jy ?>1.6%, amongst the lowest in EU.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It goes on to point out to Deputy Moloney the crisis that this would inevitably precipitate.  Is it not a fact that the problem is capacity and expert staff, neither of which is being addressed?  The commitments into which the Ministers for Health and Children have entered since Deputy Cowen held that office have been neither honoured nor implemented.  As a result, in our relatively affluent economy, people cannot receive health services of a quality they have a right to expect.  People are acutely distressed as a result of their interaction, or that of their relatives, with the health services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To repeat myself, the Health Service Executive contracted with the private nursing home sector for 1,050 extra beds last year.  These have been put into the areas of greatest need, particularly Dublin.  The plan is to provide 360 extra beds this year, the large running costs for which have been provided.  The Health Service Executive proposes to expand public capacity by 446 beds this year and a further 414 next year, the resources and staff for which have been made available.</P>
        <P>Every year for the past ten years there has been a significant increase in consultants, specialists, nurses and related staff.  At times there is a difficulty in recruiting for those posts and in retaining nurses, particularly those who are recently qualified and wish to travel for a period.  Many come back here but not all do.  There would be fewer problems if none of them went but that is life.  There is no restriction on them which creates some pressure.  Many non-Irish staff work in the health service because of that shortage.  We have increased the capacity in paramedical, medical and nursing schools in recent years and provided resources.</P>
        <P>In recent years 800 new staff have been appointed in the cardiac services under the cardiac health strategy.  These include 19 consultants, 81 cardiac specialist technicians, chest pain clinics, fast tracking of patients through accident and emergency units and specialist cardiac services which have been either opened or greatly expanded in Cork, Galway and Dublin hospitals. <Col N="176"/> <?oasys _dc28- ?>Cardiac diagnostic tests have increased by 40%,<?oasys _dc0- ?> coronary artery interventions by 153%, cardiac rehabilitation is provided in 29 hospitals compared with 12 six years ago.  It is no longer the case that 75% of people awaiting cardiac surgery wait for a year or more.  That figure now is under 20%.  Most children had to wait a long time but now the waiting list is short.  Those are the facts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>So there is no problem in the health service.  Everything is grand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say there is no problem.  There will always be pressure and demand for improving the services and issues such as that which arose in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital today.  This is not new and will not go away.  Although we increased the bed capacity for intensive care unit beds from nine to 14 the hospital will at times run into difficulties.  One serious road traffic accident, or operation, or one infection, can at any time create that difficulty.  Although we continually increase the capacity I will not stand up here and say there will be some simple solution such that increasing capacity by another one or two will change the situation. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>That has not happened. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us stop trying to offer simple solutions to every little headline that comes out of every hospital. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not happening yet anyway. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has been in power for ten years.  He should give us a break. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been major improvements over the past ten years.  As Deputy Finian McGrath knows, because he knows the health service better than anybody, it has improved rapidly and dramatically.  He is a good beneficiary of that improvement, as is right.  We will continue to improve which is good for the health service.  We will continue to provide more beds.  I have given the figures for that provision. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to remind the Taoiseach that this debate is not about newspaper headlines.  It is about public patients suffering acutely on hospital waiting lists and in our hospitals because of a simple failure by his Government.  He has gone all over the place with figures so I will keep the focus of my question narrow.  Later tonight an excellent motion on cancer care tabled by the Independent Deputies and me will allow a much wider discussion on this and wider aspects of the health service.  It is very simple to see why planned surgeries in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital have been cancelled over the past week because the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy McDowell, and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy <Col N="177"/>Harney, individually and jointly have blatantly and cynically failed to meet the commitment the Taoiseach made five years ago to restore 3,000 extra beds to the public hospital system. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the story.  That is the real world. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>These are the 3,000 beds that the Government parties ripped out ruthlessly in the 1980s when they aimed at the old, the sick and the handicapped.  If the Government rips out thousands of beds, naturally it will have an acute difficulty.  If in the meantime the population increases by three quarters of a million people it will have a full-blown crisis.  That is as simple as A,B,C.</P>
        <P>The Government deliberately obfuscates the problem because instead of providing those beds in a straightforward way, by extending the capacity of existing hospitals which have plenty of land for such development, and maybe building some new hospitals where they are required, it delays.  It then gives its political friends, beef barons, speculators and developers, lots of tax breaks and public land to make a killing on people&rsquo;s health.  In the meantime public patients are suffering grievously because of this agenda.</P>
        <P>When will the full complement of the 3,000 beds be provided?  Does the Taoiseach have an accurate figure for the extra beds needed by virtue of the increase in population by three-quarters of a million people?  When will they be provided?  Then we will have no more of this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s last question the Health Service Executive and some statisticians are examining bed capacity for the country.  I do not know the figure.  We must wait for that.  To date we have provided approximately 1,500 beds and there are approximately 1,000 in the co-location initiative, which invites private investment and is designed to free up 1,000 beds in public hospitals for public patients.  I know the Deputy does not approve of that initiative but it will add to overall capacity.  I have already given the figures for this year and next year.  That is the status of the bed numbers.</P>
        <P>I have not quoted the wrong figures.  For the winter months so far the reduction in accident and emergency units, which were a significant problem needing to be tackled, was as follows &mdash; October, -34%, November, -32%, December,<?oasys _jy ?>-53% and January, -57%.  Those are the real figures.  The hospitals have worked extremely hard with the Health Service Executive and the accident and emergency unit initiative to provide services more efficiently not just by moving patients around&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>It was moving them around. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="178"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This was achieved by providing out-of-hours services, the winter initiative, the rapid access clinics where the services have commenced and to which people have been referred from accident and emergency departments and are receiving efficient services and use of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  These initiatives were designed to help people.  There are pressures at certain times of the year in hospitals.  At other times, when there is less pressure they can take more people off the waiting lists for elective surgery.  It is not always so easy to do this.  While there are some staff difficulties they are not too great, as I understand it, from the Health Service Executive. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality is that the Government stands over a two-tier health system which it sponsors and nurtures.  That is having a grievous impact on the plight of public patients including those who are very ill.  For the most part private hospitals do not cater for the very ill.  They cherrypick the profitable procedures and the very sick and those requiring high maintenance are directed back into the public health system.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, everyone became familiar with the gut-wrenching case of a Kilkenny mother who was obliged to wait eight months for her colon to be examined.  That delay will cost the woman in question her life.  This is the reality faced by people who are not wealthy and who are dependent on a proper public health system.</P>
        <P>Did it ever occur to the Taoiseach that there is a good reason that the section of consultants who want to operate in the private health system cannot take the Minister for Health and Children seriously when she lectures them on the need for a public-only contract?  Such lectures on her part ring hollow because she is doing everything in her power to shift an increasing level of resources into the private hospitals where these consultants wish to operate at the same time as having contracts to work in public hospitals.  The metaphor of the fox lecturing the members of the pack for casting their eyes over the henhouse comes to mind, particularly in light of the fact that the Minister has already directed the fattest chickens in that direction.  Now she is telling consultants that they cannot move in this direction because she wants them to remain in the public sector.  It is important to note &mdash; this is sometimes overlooked &mdash; that doctors are committed to public-only health care.</P>
        <P>The problem does not relate to the quality of health care or the dedication of those who work in the service, but to access and capacity.  The Taoiseach did not indicate the date on which the full complement of 3,000 beds will be provided and I want him to do so.  Is it not pathetic, when it is clear that the population is burgeoning, that the HSE is only now discussing carrying out of a survey?  Have the HSE and the Government been asleep for the past several years?  When will that <Col N="179"/>survey take place and when will an accurate number of additional beds required by our increasing population be provided?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I stated earlier that the overall survey relating to a population of 4.25 million and rising is under way.  The HSE will present its report on the survey when it is completed.  I also indicated that 1,500 have already been provided and that approximately 350 private beds and 446 public beds will be provided this year.  Arrangements have been made to provide approximately 400 additional beds next year.  I also referred earlier to the 5,000 private beds in public hospitals.</P>
        <P>This matter is not as simple as the Deputy thinks.  The length of stay by patients in all our hospitals has been dramatically reduced.  In the past, people were obliged to remain in hospital for between 14 to 16 days in respect of quite minor procedures.  An enormous level of day surgeries are being carried out at present and the figures have risen by hundreds of thousands.  The old system &mdash; even that which obtained five years ago &mdash; does not necessarily apply.  That point has been made by medical and nursing organisations.  It is because of the efficiency and skill of the members of these organisations that the number of day patients being treated has increased while the length of stay has decreased.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>Why then did the Taoiseach state that an additional 3,000 beds are needed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware the Deputy is an expert on medicine.  We can discuss the matter later.  Day and inpatients are being dealt with in much shorter periods.  The relevant staff have, therefore, maximised the return from our acute hospitals.</P>
        <P>Deputy Joe Higgins is correct that because of the standard of services on offer in our public hospitals, the huge numbers of staff that have been committed and the deployment of modern equipment, people who are seriously ill are far better off in public hospitals than they would be in their private counterparts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Why are public hospitals so dirty?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Joe Higgins is correct that the standards on offer in and the capacity of our public hospitals are of a level of which we should all be proud.  We should continue to put resources&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I heard the Deputy saying.  He stated that, because of the standards on offer and the resources available, one would be far better off in a public acute hospital than in a private hospital and he is correct in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not to take from the fact that hundreds of thousands of people opt to pay health insurance to various companies so that they can access private care.  There is nothing wrong with that.</P>
        <P>Some 1.3 million people have medical cards and 60,000 people have doctor-only cards.  I congratulate the parties opposite for at last seeing the wisdom behind our decision to introduce doctor-only cards.  The Opposition berated me last year and stated that such cards are worse than useless.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The total allocation for my Department for 2007 is &euro;40.624 million.  This is an increase of 8% &mdash; &euro;3.026 million &mdash; on the 2006 Revised Estimates allocation.  Details of the Estimates are set out in the Abridged Estimates for the Public Service, which were presented to the D&aacute;il on 16 November last.</P>
        <P>I look forward to addressing specific issues relating to the Estimates provisions when they are considered in the usual way by the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  I also look forward to responding to questions which Deputies may wish to table separately in relation to specific aspects of the work of my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the draft European Union constitution, what allocation has been made in respect of the National Forum on Europe?  How will the forum&rsquo;s programme unfold during 2007?  Does the Taoiseach envisage the holding of a series of public meetings throughout the country to allow the forum to engage with organisations and individuals in respect of its work, particularly as it relates to the draft constitution?</P>
        <P>What allocations have been made to the National Economic and Social Development Office, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance?  Will the Taoiseach indicate how he sees their programmes unfolding this year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer the Deputy&rsquo;s second tranche of questions first.  Last year, legislation was introduced to establish the National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, as the umbrella organisation to co-ordinate the work of NESC, NESF and NCPP and to create and realise synergies between the work of these bodies.  Accordingly, from now on a single funding provision for these bodies will be included in the Estimates under subhead B.  The allocation for NESC is &euro;1.116 million, while it is &euro;880,000 for NESF and &euro;1.62 million for NCPP.  The allocation for NESDO is &euro;1.937 million.  The increase in funding across the four bodies is approximately 10%, which reflects increased operating costs.  Some of the latter obviously relate to pay but many of them relate to activities in 2007.  By coming together and using only one premises and secretariat, many efficiencies have been created.</P>
        <P>The Estimate includes a provision of &euro;1.621 million to provide for the ongoing work of the National Forum on Europe.  The increase in funding reflects the expanded and increased levels of activity on the forum&rsquo;s part.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the day-to-day <Col N="182"/>operations of the forum because it operates independently.  However, there are resources available for the forum to continue and expand its work.  The Deputy will be aware, from contacts with his group in Europe, that considerable momentum has been created by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in terms of pressing on with the constitution and moving towards a declaration in March.</P>
        <P>The pro-constitution lobby has activated itself over recent weeks, with a meeting in Madrid next week.  Much of that will be decided by the EU Presidency which will support strongly various amendments to the constitution.  It is working wisely in streamlining some issues, while not changing them, placing them in separate annexes.  That should create a position where those member states which have not previously ratified the constitution may do so.  They may do so by parliamentary vote, which is a position we do not have.  Realistically, such a process will not be in 2007 but in 2008, but the referendum on the EU constitution will be back on the table this year.  The German Presidency will provide a blueprint on how to take it forward and, to build on that in the second half of the year, the National Forum on Europe should activate itself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>As there are a couple of dozen questions on Northern Ireland and we will not have much time to deal with them, I will defer on this question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is highly unlikely that we will come to questions on Northern Ireland today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleagues may have a similar view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one heading that briefly deals with Northern Ireland in so far as it applies to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.  To what does the heading, value for money on policy reviews, refer?  It was not provided for last year but received &euro;26,000 this year.  How does that coincide with value for money?  Funding for the information society, e-Cabinet and other initiatives has been reduced by 48%.  Does that mean it is finished or that there is less focus on it?</P>
        <P>One aspect discussed at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation was the need to move beyond the main political parties and establish a civic forum.  Hopefully, with the Assembly elections in the offing, we can reach that point in dealing with wider society.  Does this fall under the remit of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and is it provided for in the Estimates?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note in the Oireachtas buildings that recycled paper is no longer provided for photocopying.  Is that a directive from on high?  Does the Taoiseach endorse this?  Leadership from the Department of the Taoiseach would be critical if we were to have <Col N="183"/>the market for recycled products which we claim we want in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Finance is responsible for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will ask my Department about the recycled products matter.  I thought we were using recycled products.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>So did I.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We certainly were using recycled products, but I will check it.</P>
        <P>The e-Cabinet project is reaching a conclusion.  Only minor areas of work need to be undertaken in 2007, associated with the full roll-out and upgrade of certain functions of the system.  The system is up and running and the costs have been expended.  Future costs will be small.</P>
        <P>There is only a small provision to keep the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation subhead alive in the event that it may have further meetings, but no meetings are envisaged in the foreseeable future.  The civic forum model is not included in that subhead.  I support moving to the civic forum model and made clear throughout the discussions that we are ready to move on that.  It would be an enlightened road for us to take, with wider community involvement.  If we can achieve stability in the political situation, I hope we can get the civic forum moving.  We will play our part in assisting that.</P>
        <P>There are new proposals, which the Minister for Finance outlined, where all Departments must show their outputs to ensure they are getting value for money.  This must be presented in a format outlined by the Minister in the last two budgets.  The value for money subhead refers to work my Department has done on its presentation to the value for money committee.</P>

	<P>I note Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s position and I will accordingly curtail my questions.  The establishment of an all-Ireland civic forum merits provision at this point.  We have waited on it since the Good Friday Agreement.  It would be welcome if the Taoiseach could add to what he has already said on it.</P>
        <P>I note a reduction of 2% in the provision for the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.  What work does the Taoiseach propose to refer to the committee in 2007?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I repeat that I support the broader initiative of the civic forum.  Its costs will not be large and it will come either from my Department&rsquo;s Vote or that of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It is more about getting the initiative up and running.  We made an effort to do so when the Northern Ireland Executive was previously running and it had broad support from the trade unions congress, employers&rsquo; and agri<Col N="184"/>cultural bodies and political groups.  A civic forum would be very beneficial, allowing a North-South basis for groupings, which would normally not be in the political domain, to actively engage with each other on civic society matters.  While much of that is happening informally and on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, a civic forum where people representative of the broad sectors in society could be engaged would be beneficial.  I have made that clear time and again in discussions with the NIO, the British Government and various interest groups in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The All-Party Committee on the Constitution has two or three initiatives in front of it which will take it to the end of the life of this D&aacute;il.  It has been involved in working on the social and family aspects of the Constitution.  Its chairman, Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan, is anxious to finish that work.  A number of its reports have been sent to the Departments and agencies on matters which will be dealt with through legislation.  Others will involve forming a group of constitutional amendments.  There are seven areas where there is ongoing work and it may take a number of years to deal with them.  It is hard to bunch them together and take a number of amendments.  Officials in my Department, the committee secretariat and relevant Departments have been working on that for some time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>My Department and the bodies under its aegis are committed to a policy of equal opportunity for all staff.  Staff are recruited on the basis that they meet the requirement of the positions they will fill.  In addition to complying with the provisions of the Disability Act 2005, we follow the guidelines set out by the Commission for Public Service Appointments in its code of practice for <Col N="185"/>the appointment of persons with disabilities to positions in the Civil Service.  Recruitment to my Department is undertaken by the commission and through positive action programmes such as the Willing, Able and Mentoring programme under the aegis of the Department of Finance.  The Minister for Finance has responsibility for policy in regard to the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The 3% target for the employment of persons with disabilities in the Civil Service and public service was set in 1977 and has never been reached.  It is now enshrined in section 47 of the Disability Act 2005.  Given that the target was never reached and that there are persons with a disability who have the capacity to work in the Civil Service or public service, is the Taoiseach satisfied that the level of monitoring, by the Department of Finance in particular, is sufficiently robust to ensure this legislative requirement is met?  Substantial numbers of potential workers may be affected.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the Government can stand over its implementation of legislation passed by this House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Promotion, training and all other benefits, supports and opportunities for staff in the Civil Service and public service are decided on the grounds of ability, qualifications and other relevant objective criteria.  The percentage of staff with a disability in my Department is 3%, equivalent to six and a half members of staff.  This meets the target recommended in the Disability Act 2005.</P>
        <P>My Department, through the Office of Public Works, maintains best accessibility practice.  The Department is currently conducting an access audit with the OPW to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Disability Act 2005 and to further improve the Department&rsquo;s existing physical facilities and services.  It is not the Department&rsquo;s view that efforts in this area should cease because the target of 3% is met.  We have exceeded that target in the past but when people retire, transfer to another Department or leave, the percentage reduces.  The Department of Finance monitors the situation in all Departments carefully and it is my understanding that most meet the target.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for monitoring the performance of external agencies.</P>
        <P>We constantly seek to improve services.  My Department and most other Departments provide access to information to staff and visitors with a disability in a variety of formats.  In the past few years we have extended the services to include Braille, simple text documents and large print.  Hearing loops for those with hearing aids are installed in the welcoming pavilion, the reception and the press centre.  Relevant technologies are supplied to staff and visitors as necessary. <Col N="186"/> Accessibility tools are part of the standard desktop used in the Department.  Our websites are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure we meet commitments under the web accessibility initiative.  The websites currently comply with levels one and two as specified under that initiative.  Everything possible is being done to make the Department accessible to visitors and staff, and these efforts are monitored and encouraged.</P>
        <P>It would be better if the percentage of staff with disabilities were higher than 3%.  Some Departments, however, have gone to extraordinary lengths to achieve higher figures.  The sectoral plans we published last year, in accordance with the Disability Act, are designed to facilitate an increase in the numbers of people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service and public service.  We should not be satisfied with an employment rate of 3%.  The best approach is to provide the facilities necessary to enhance accessibility and that is being done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Taoiseach responded to a recent evaluation of accessibility in regard to e-Government websites?  The Internet consultancy firm, Red Cardinal, found that one quarter of departmental websites failed to meet the minimum &mdash; priority one &mdash; standards required by the globally recognised website content accessibility guidelines.  Although his Department&rsquo;s website is not mentioned specifically in the report, the Taoiseach must provide leadership in this regard.  Does he know whether it meets the standard?  Does he know whether the same is true of the websites of the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Chief State Solicitor or the Central Statistics Office?  Other Departments will take a lead from the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy refer to accessibility in the use of modern technology?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the international standards for website accessibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To the best of my knowledge, the websites to which the Deputy referred are compliant with standards in this area.  The Commission for Public Service Appointments must adhere to defined standards in devising panels for vacancies.  In line with the requirements of the Disability Act, my Department has appointed an inquiry officer to deal with complaints where the Department fails to comply with the Act, and an access officer to ensure compliance.  The standards to which we adhere are up-to-date and, as I understand it, in accordance with those of external regulatory bodies.</P>
        <P>A monitoring committee comprising staff from all departmental divisions, bodies under the aegis of those Departments and union representatives was established last June.  That committee is obliged to approve a report on compliance with the Act to the National Disability Authority by <Col N="187"/>June each year and to report to the Cabinet committee on social exclusion.  The National Disability Authority is currently investigating best practice methods to capture and record information on disability.  I cannot say whether the standards we have imposed accord with the latest international guidelines but there is no doubt that they are being implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Disability Act 2005 report refers to priority two as the globally recognised standard.  However, the Red Cardinal report to which I referred states that several Departments do not meet this standard.  The Taoiseach might get back to me on this if he does not have the information to hand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question refers specifically to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and that is why I am asking about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s standards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I take Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s point.  As I understand it, my Department is compliant with the standards set out in the 2005 Act.  The National Disability Authority is currently investigating best practice methods to capture and record information on disability.  I assume it is doing so to determine the best mechanism for monitoring the 2005 Act to ensure there is compliance and to allow it to arbitrate on disputed instances.  If the authority is examining this it is in a general sense and its findings will apply to my Department also.  I will get back to the Deputy on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the experience of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department and the points he enunciated, is there not merit in examining the idea of a cross-departmental team to ensure that best practice in one Department is applied in all others, thus ensuring the maximum employment and accommodation of people with disabilities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The objective is to ensure coherence across all Departments and their agencies in regard to what is in the Disability Act, what the National Disability Authority has set down and the commitments in the sectoral plans so public bodies do all they can to ensure we have the best standards.  The guidelines have been updated in regard to possible supports for collection.  We must return this data to the Department of Finance annually.  A sincere effort is being made to ensure everyone complies with the highest standards as per the commitments set down in the Disability Act.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 36, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The last 12 months have seen significant and welcome progress in the peace process.  The St. Andrews Agreement, which the two Governments published on 13 October, is built on the twin pillars of power sharing and support for policing.  It contains an explicit timetable leading to the restoration of the power sharing Executive on 26 March.</P>
        <P>I met Prime Minister Blair in London yesterday to review progress on the implementation of the St. Andrews Agreement.  We remain fixed in our determination to see shared government returned to the people of Northern Ireland.  Since St. Andrews, we have agreed practical changes to the operation of the institutions, we have announced financial packages to help underpin restoration and we have made progress across a range of equality, human rights, victims and social exclusion issues.</P>
        <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s IMC report confirms that the decision of the Sinn F&eacute;in Ard-Fheis on policing contains all the necessary elements of support for policing and criminal justice set out in the St. Andrews Agreement.  This opens the prospect of inclusive support for policing across the entire community.  I welcome this landmark step and the important follow-up comments that have since been made by the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership.  The IMC report also provides further clear evidence and reassurance that the IRA&rsquo;s campaign is over for good.</P><Col N="191"/>
        <P>Our purpose now is to ensure that Northern Ireland can build on all of these positive developments through the restoration of shared accountable government committed to serving all of the people.  There is no reason for any further delay.</P>
        <P>The Assembly election due to be held on 7 March is an integral part of the process and timetable agreed at St. Andrews.  It is being held for the explicit purposes of endorsing the St. Andrews Agreement and of electing an Assembly that will form a power-sharing Executive on 26 March in accordance with that Agreement and timeframe.  That is the single purpose of this election.  The terms are clear: support for policing, support for power sharing and a deadline of 26 March.  That is what acceptance of the St. Andrews Agreement means.</P>
        <P>The Governments are proceeding on the basis that all parties understand and accept this position and that they also understand that the Assembly to be elected on 7 March will be dissolved, in accordance with the law, if it fails to meet its legal responsibilities fully by 26 March.</P>
        <P>We will proceed on the basis of new partnership arrangements in the event this is necessary.  However, we have made clear that this is not our preferred outcome.  After four years of suspension, the people of Northern Ireland are entitled to see devolved government restored and their elected representatives working actively and openly for them in a fully restored Assembly and shared Government.</P>
        <P>I have been advised by the Attorney General that no referendum is required in this jurisdiction on the St. Andrews Agreement as the changes effected by this Agreement do not constitute fundamental changes to the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
        <P>I also took the opportunity at my meeting yesterday with Prime Minister Blair to raise the issue of collusion, particularly in light of the ombudsman&rsquo;s recent report.  The British Government is well aware of the widespread concern on this issue and of the need to find some means to address this regrettable and disturbing aspect of the Troubles.</P>
        <P>As at all stages in this process, contact is maintained at different levels with the British Government and with all of the political parties in Northern Ireland.  The Government also remains in close contact with the United States Administration whose ongoing support for the process is deeply appreciated.  I had the opportunity yesterday to meet with Ambassador Mitchell Reiss and Ms Paula Dobriansky who will succeed Mr. Reiss as the United States Special Envoy on Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to thank Ambassador Reiss for his involvement and contribution over the last four years.  I also wish Ms Dobriansky well in her new role.  I look forward to working <Col N="192"/>closely with her and President Bush over the coming period as we seek to take the final steps flowing from the St. Andrews Agreement.</P>
        <P>I next expect to meet President Bush during my visit to the US to celebrate St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in March.  The final programme for this visit has yet to be finalised.  I expect to participate in the traditional ceremonies at the White House and on Capitol Hill in the course of my visit and I will also attend the American Ireland Fund Dinner.  I also expect the programme to include events in New York.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, I am proceeding, taking account of the views expressed by the other party leaders, with the proposal to establish a new joint Oireachtas committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and North-South co-operation.  This is such an important national issue that it fully merits the attention of a dedicated committee.  I have asked the Chief Whip to discuss the practical arrangements with the Opposition whips with a view to obtaining all-party agreement.</P>
        <P>The question of further sessions of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation will be kept under review.  As of now, there are no plans for a further meeting.</P>
        <P>It has been the practice for the past number of years to meet the Ireland-America Advisory Board over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period and I expect to do so again this year.  My Department maintains contact with the board primarily through the embassy in Washington as well as through mutual visits and meetings.  As the House will be aware, board members give voluntarily of their time and expertise in a number of ways.  I welcome and greatly appreciate their ongoing advice and support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The question most observers will want to ask the Taoiseach is if he will state the basis of the assurance he received yesterday from the British Prime Minister that the DUP is prepared to commit to power sharing after the elections on 7 March, in particular having regard to this morning&rsquo;s comments by the DUP MP, Willie McCrea, who seemed to say the opposite.  In the event the DUP does not agree to share power with the other parties concerned, will he outline the contingency plans the two Governments have?</P>
        <P>Having regard to the decision by Sinn F&eacute;in, which I am sure everybody in this House welcomes, and the delay in convening the Ard-Fheis and making that decision, the window of manoeuvrability is very brief.  Does the Taoiseach have any concerns in that regard?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach said he raised the Nuala O&rsquo;Loan report on collusion with the British Prime Minister yesterday.  I raised this issue in the House in 2005 at the request of Raymond McCord.  The Taoiseach subsequently met Mr. McCord in <Col N="193"/>respect of the experience of his son.  Having regard to the horror revealed in the ombudsman&rsquo;s report, what response did he receive from the British Prime Minister?  Was the role of Sir Ronnie Flanagan, who was head of the special branch and chief constable at material times, raised?  Does the Taoiseach have any reservations about the fact Sir Ronnie Flanagan was on the interview committee which selected Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole as chief inspector of the Garda Inspectorate?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Did the Taoiseach hear yesterday morning&rsquo;s interview with Robert McCartney&rsquo;s sister, Catherine?  Does he accept it is the litmus test of the bona fides of Sinn F&eacute;in that it come forward now with information about the grotesque murder of Robert McCartney and instruct people in possession of such information to make it known to the PSNI?</P>
      </Speaker>
  <?oasys _cl11.3- ?>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will endeavour to answer all those questions.  The first question was on what basis did I accept the decision, or the view, of the British Government.  I was also asked about what Willie McCrea said on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  I will not comment on individual voices from the DUP.  I am much more interested in where the party stands.  We are proceeding on the basis that all the parties accept the St. Andrews Agreement with a full Executive in place on 26 March.</P>
      
        <P>On the closing date of those talks, 13 March, the Reverend Ian Paisley stated he was accepting the St. Andrews Agreement and subsequently clarified that point a second time on 24 November.  This whole business must be St. Andrews Agreement-compliant, otherwise there is no basis for an election.  That is a point I have made in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>It is accepted that Sinn F&eacute;in has moved on the essential issues.  If there were delays, some of them arose from the fact that clarifications, which would have helped the process to move forward quicker, were not forthcoming.  That created some delays in the period before Christmas.  It would be unfair and wrong not to acknowledge and accept that Sinn F&eacute;in has done what has been described as &ldquo;heavy lifting&rdquo; on some of these issues.</P>
        <P>All the parties must play their part now and rise to the challenges ahead.  There is a major responsibility on the Democratic Unionist Party.  It may not be easy for some of them but all the parties must face this responsibility.  Nobody is entitled to sit on his or her hands.</P>
        <P>We should be clear about why an election was called for.  It is worth repeating what I said about the party that wanted an election.  The St. Andrews Agreement states that there would be an endorsement of that agreement.  Members will recall that there was a debate for a period as to whether that would take place by way of a referendum or an election.  The DUP wanted an election so that it could endorse its position to participate in this process.  I cannot imagine that it could <Col N="194"/>be in the interests of Unionism to frustrate the St. Andrews Agreement, which is now in legislation.  The dates agreed are in British legislation.  The process is also set out in British legislation and it is that an election will be held on 7 March and an Executive will be set up on 26 March.  If not, the entire process will collapse in its totality.  There is no provision for anything else after 26 March.  Our discussions on partnership arrangements will continue as the fallback position.  As I said previously, I hope that is not necessary, but I have stated that I want these discussions to continue so that we do not lose further time down the road.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not in the interests of anyone or in the interests of Unionism to allow this to happen, but to do so and fail to agree an Executive on 26 March would be a serious error.  The advertisements the DUP took out after the St. Andrews Agreement make clear that it will be at a disadvantage if it does not fulfil its obligations.  That is its position.</P>
        <P>For the process to work we need the DUP to understand that just as it has had expectations of republicans and policing the rule of law, the rest of us, including Nationalists, republicans, everybody else and the two Governments have had legitimate, if not unreasonable, expectations of the DUP in regard to power sharing.  The DUP has stated that it is prepared to engage in power sharing if the other issues were fulfilled.</P>
        <P>I have talked to Dr. Paisley in recent weeks but Prime Minister Blair has had far more engagement and contact with him, having met him several times a week during the past number of weeks.  It is on that basis that he believes that the DUP&rsquo;s position is that we are moving forward to an election.  He is very clear that if the parties are not committed to the St. Andrews Agreement, there is no basis for an election.  He is convinced that after the elections, the DUP will move to form an executive.  I said yesterday &mdash; I am not saying anything now that I did not say in private &mdash; that I would have liked more clarity on 24 November, in the period prior to Christmas and in recent weeks but, based on the private discussions and meetings he has had, Prime Minister Blair believes that the DUP will fulfil this commitment on the basis that Sinn F&eacute;in has dealt with the issue of policing.  Sinn F&eacute;in has also stated since Sunday that the rule of law should be upheld.  It has further stated that in respect of the McCartney case anyone with any evidence or information should go to the police.  That is important and was one of the questions raised.  That applies not only to that case but all other cases.</P>
        <P>Dr. Paisley, in fairness to him, has said that he would also want to see that there is co-operation on the ground in all these matters.  I hope that in the intervening weeks we will see such co-operation.  It should quickly translate itself.  The Chief Constable should be in a position to be able to <Col N="195"/>see that fairly quickly.  Obviously that will be something that will influence Dr. Paisley as the leader of his party in the intervening period.  It is on the basis that this will happen that we will have a power-sharing Executive on 26 March, which will get up and running immediately.  It is also on the basis of what is provided for in British legislation passed by huge majorities in the House of Commons and the House of Lords.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have raised the issue of collusion in many different ways with the British Prime Minister in recent years and several reports have been published.  I made a public statement on this matter when I said that over the years successive Irish Governments and many others have raised serious concerns about collusion in Northern Ireland.  The recent report along with many other reports demonstrate that these concerns were well founded.  It presents clear evidence that the RUC colluded with loyalist murderers and failed in its duty to prevent many horrific crimes.  They are serious issues for the British Government.  As I pointed out to Prime Minister Blair, they did not happen, as many of the other issues did, in the dim and distant past.  Some of these issues happened under his own watch and up until recent periods.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that Deputy Rabbitte raised the McCord case here and he asked me to meet Mr. Raymond McCord at that stage.  I have co-operated with him in recent months in this process.  However, it is one of many.  As I said previously, we must try to get to a position where all these cases are at least dealt with.  Some families want apologies, some want other action and some want inquiries.  We cannot find one solution that will cover all of them because there are serious cases such as the Finucane case in respect of which the Irish Government &mdash; Members having voted on a resolution on this last year &mdash; is committed to a particular procedure.  There is also the agreement of the outstanding issues of Weston Park.  However, I am also conscious that we must try to find some mechanism for most of the other cases to bring them to finality.  Otherwise, people will still be raising these issues in this House in 25 years time.  That is not a satisfactory position in which to leave these cases.  Therefore, we need to find a way to deal with them.  I have urged the Prime Minister to give this issue serious consideration and under his watch, however long that may be, to try to find a mechanism to deal with it because he understands it very well.  He has been working on that for some months so hopefully we can find a satisfactory way of dealing with it.  I think that covers all the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.</P>

	<P>The time allocated for this business has expired but if the House is agreeable I will hear three brief questions from Deputies Sargent, Kenny and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  I call Deputy Sargent.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="196"/>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Taoiseach was talking to the British Prime Minister did he ask him if he would support an inquiry or even an investigation into the report on collusion, given that from his statement he seems to have set his face against that?  Will he co-operate in the case of resolving the issues that are outstanding?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>This provision is not as satisfactory as we would want.  I would like to remember the name of David Ervine because we did not have an opportunity to speak about him in this House since his death.    </P>
        <P>In respect of the comments the Taoiseach had with the British Prime Minister, what did Tony Blair say about the O&rsquo;Loan report?  Was he as shocked as the Taoiseach was at its findings?  Given that the British Government did not co-operate fully in respect of the Barron inquiry, was there any outcome to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments to him about that?  As Deputy Rabbitte said, did he reflect on the position of Ronnie Flanagan arising from that report?</P>
        <P>I listened to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments in respect of the elections and I hope that this process goes through.  However, Mr. Willie McCrea MP expressed a slightly different view this morning and time is relatively short.  Under what circumstances would plan B be activated by the Government?  When would the Taoiseach be in a position to know?  Following discussions with the SDLP today, I know its members believe that the British Government could withdraw from the electoral process that is under way and cancel the elections.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Taoiseach there should be certainty in this regard.  Is he absolutely satisfied that the process is irrevocable, in the sense that it will happen and that the elections will take place?  Alternatively, will there be a sham and a charade, in which although an election has been called and a process is under way, for some reason the Government that has called the election will then call it off?  The Taoiseach might comment on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In his response earlier the Taoiseach stated that he raised with the British Prime Minister the issue of the O&rsquo;Loan report and the issues spilling therefrom in respect of collusion.  Can he advise us what he means by &ldquo;raised&rdquo;?  Can he advise the House whether, for example, he raised the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, which was published before Christmas?  Did he raise the fact that this body deemed the British to be guilty of international terrorism in Ireland?  Has he pressed the British Government and the Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, on this issue?   I use the word &ldquo;press&rdquo; as against the word &ldquo;raise&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Has the Taoiseach taken up the long-repeated proposition that he and the Prime Minister <Col N="197"/>should jointly hold a special summit on this issue, given the gravity and seriousness of these matters, as underscored by Ms Nuala O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s recent report?  Mindful that the British Prime Minister will vacate his office shortly, has the Taoiseach pressed him to ensure full co-operation from the British Government regarding the pursuit of truth and justice in respect of all such matters and at the earliest opportunity?</P>
        <P>What are the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intentions regarding the proposal I made earlier this week to accommodate a special debate in the House on the issue of collusion in the wake of the O&rsquo;Loan report?  What are his intentions, given that it is now almost a full year since the House unanimously passed a Government motion on the murder of Pat Finucane?  We have seen no further progress in respect of the proposal for the establishment of a full public inquiry.  Did the British Prime Minister give any further indication of a change of heart or mind in this regard?  Can we expect any progress in this matter in the coming period?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach accept, despite what others may think, that there is only one clear purpose in respect of the forthcoming election on 7 March?  Does he accept its clear and bounded intent is to see the re-establishment of the Assembly, a working Executive, the all-Ireland Ministerial Council and, in institutional terms, all the outworking of the promise of the Good Friday Agreement?  Does he accept it is now the DUP&rsquo;s responsibility to state clearly its intent to enter into such a power-sharing arrangement as of 26 March?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach, to make his final reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I noted in my response, I have only a few moments to go through many detailed questions and I will not have time to go through them all.  The Assembly election due on 7 March is an integral part of the process and timetable that we negotiated and to which everyone agreed at St. Andrews.  It is being held for the explicit purpose of endorsing the St. Andrews Agreement and of electing the Assembly that will form a power sharing Executive on 26 March in accordance with that agreement and timeframe.  That is the sole purpose of this election.</P>
        <P>The answer to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question as to whether the British Government can cancel the election at any time during the campaign, if it believes the parties are not serious, is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The legislation provides clearly that it may pull the election at any time, if it believes there is no intent by the parties.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kenny also asked when would we move to the different arrangements.  I refer to the so-called plan B arrangement, or to what I would rather call our partnership arrangement, between the two Governments.  This would take place immediately after 26 March, if there is no intention to set up an Executive.</P><Col N="198"/>
        <P>In respect of the McCord case, the recent O&rsquo;Loan report, the Barron report, the forthcoming McEntee report and the other reports from Weston Park all come to the same conclusion.  There is an enormous amount of correspondence from Taoisigh extending back over the past 30 years.  Successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Ministers for Justice have raised serious concerns in this respect.  Behind all such cases lie many personal stories of lives that have been lost.  However, all of the evidence says the same thing, namely, the RUC colluded with loyalist murderers to execute people.</P>
        <P>The British Government is in no doubt about this situation.  I have pointed this out time and time again.  We have received extended co-operation.  Will we get the British Government to deal with it and to admit it in the same manner as these reports?  I doubt it.  Will it hold a tribunal to examine these matters individually and to go back over hundreds of cases?  I doubt it.  I accept Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s point regarding &ldquo;raised&rdquo; and &ldquo;pressed&rdquo;.  We have done so forcefully and the British Government knows our views in this regard.  I have emphasised to Prime Minister Blair that he would be doing a great service, in whatever period he remains in office, if he tried to give a comprehensive response on the British Government&rsquo;s position on these matters.  I would much prefer he did so because he understands them and knows the details of such issues.</P>
        <P>We await the McEntee report.  I am not familiar with its contents.  However, in respect of the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan, the work of the Barron inquiry shows there was collusion of some kind in this regard.  I also refer to the execution of Seamus Ludlow and the Miami Showband.  I have met the representatives and have been involved with them all.  One cannot put a tooth into such matters and I have not done so.  However, several of these reports, including the Cory report, the Weston Park initiative, the McEntee report, the Barron report and the Hamilton report, show clear evidence that there was collusion.</P>
        <P>The question is how to present that detail.  The Finucane case was taken up as a result of an agreement made in Weston Park to the effect that a sample of cases, rather than every single case, would be taken up.  We undertook to deal with the Breen and Buchanan case while the British undertook to deal with the Finucane case.  However, the Inquiries Bill was not satisfactory in the eyes of either this Government, the Finucane family or those international civil liberties groups that have supported the latter.</P>
        <P>We can bring this to finality as best we can.  We may not resolve them because I do not believe that any single statement can close down all such issues as people have the right to bring them forward.  However, it would be extremely helpful if the British Government, and Prime Minister <Col N="199"/>Tony Blair in particular, was to make some progress in this regard during his remaining period.</P>

	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the important matter of the extremely poor conditions at St. Catherine&rsquo;s national school in Aughrim, Ballinasloe, County Galway, where 120 pupils and their teachers operate in mice-infested, damp and grossly over-crowded conditions which include three fabricated buildings and where the huge increase in new houses in the locality demands a new school to cater for at least eight teachers and all ancillary services, and to determine whether it is the intention of the Department of Education and Science to build such a new school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the latest information available to his Department regarding 300 jobs at the Motorola plant in Cork and to ask if he received any communications indicating that the jobs were at risk.  If so, what action did he take and what are his plans for discussions with company management with a view to saving the jobs under threat, in view of the serious economic implications for Cork of job losses on such a scale?  I hope the Ceann Comhairle accepts my request, given the urgency of the situation.   </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of urgent local and national importance, namely, that RehabCare, with the support of the HSE, has withdrawn a service user allowance of &euro;25.40 from a group of handicapped people in Monaghan town, even though RehabCare hoped the HSE would be in a position to fund it.  Despite a budget in excess of &euro;13 billion, one of the weaker groups in our society has again been the victim of mismanagement. </P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance, namely, the questionable commitment of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to justice for vulnerable members of Irish society, in light of the near withdrawal of services by the National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency.  The Minister, Deputy McDowell, set the precedent of abandoning vital services when funding for the National Missing Persons Helpline was withdrawn in 2005 and is repeating his actions in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with his failure to commit to long-term funding for the National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency.  A full debate on the Minister&rsquo;s ability to deliver justice to the vulnerable must take place in light of these appalling failures. </P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance and to allow the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement to the House on threatened job losses and the possible closure of the Motorola facility in Mahon, Cork, to state the efforts his Department and other State agencies are making to retain these jobs and the plant and to give his views on other recent job losses in County Cork and elsewhere and how such losses are likely to impact on future manufacturing industry in the country. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of national importance, namely, the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to state if he is satisfied that there are sufficient ballot boxes for the upcoming general election, how many are currently in use, how many will have to be acquired and at what cost and how he has allowed this serious situation to develop so near to a general election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent national importance, namely, the savage assault on a girl aged 13 by a <Col N="203"/>pit bull terrier in Dublin, the inadequate enforcement of the existing provisions of the Control of Dogs Act 1986 and the need to update the legislation with a view to regulating the ownership, purchase, breeding and care of dogs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss an important matter of public interest requiring the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to urgently bring forward measures to protect consumers in the telecommunications sector in light of the introduction by one cable operator of charges for customers who do not pay by direct debit, which will be particularly hard for low-income families and other vulnerable sectors, in light of ongoing complaints from citizens across the country of unsatisfactory service from a range of operators in the telecommunications sector and the failure of the Minister to introduce a communications regulations Bill until the last few weeks of this D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of major local importance, namely, to ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the rest of the Cabinet about whether they are aware of the extent of the flooding in the Neale, Cross and Kilmaine areas of County Mayo, where several families were marooned in their homes during the Christmas and new year period with devastating consequences, including some being unable to leave their homes for a long time to go to work, to bring children to and from school and to take care of elderly relatives, and where farmers are still in danger of losing their livelihoods due to the extent of the flooding; and to discuss what steps need to be taken by the Government to remedy and ease the situation, which has been pending for many years, including financial help, and what long-term steps need to be taken to prevent a recurrence.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 14, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Planning and Development Regulations 2007; No. 15, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Council framework decision on the fight against organised crime; No. 1, National Development Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill 2006 <i>[Seanad]</i> &mdash; <Col N="204"/>Second Stage; and No. 2, Prisons Bill 2006 <i>[Seanad]</i> &mdash; Second Stage.</P>
        <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 14 and 15 should be decided without debate.  Private Members&rsquo; business shall be No. 67, motion re cancer services, which shall also take place tomorrow immediately after the Order of Business and shall be brought to a conclusion after 90 minutes on that day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two proposals to put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 14 and 15, motions re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, without debate agreed to?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the motions will be debated when they return to the House.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see it here, but given the question asked by our Whip, Deputy Boyle, on whether the Taoiseach will allow an opportunity for the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to make a statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not arise on this issue.  Does the Deputy agree to the motion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot see another opportunity to raise the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot use this opportunity because we are dealing with two motions without debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The request was made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should stick to medical cards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 14 and 15, motions re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, without debate agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with Private Members&rsquo; business agreed to?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>When will we have a full debate on the Moriarty tribunal, which was clear and has many implications?  The Taoiseach is mentioned in it himself.</P>
        <P>In November, the Government proposed that the Minister of State with special responsibility for children would initiate discussions with Opposition parties about the possibility of a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  As the Taoiseach knows, there is no political difficulty in so far as the zone of absolute defence is concerned, but our spokesman on justice, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, was only contacted by the Minister of State about other proposals in this regard yesterday.  The Minister of State indicated that he wishes to bring <Col N="205"/>the matter to the Cabinet next Tuesday, which is a short space of time in which to deal with a matter of such constitutional significance.</P>
        <P>Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention to hold a referendum on absolute defence as a single entity or as an amalgamation of the other proposals, which have not been discussed yet?  If so, when is that likely to happen?  Will the committee&rsquo;s recommendation to reduce the age of consent for sexual relations to 16 years be part of the referendum?</P>
        <P>Will we have an opportunity to debate the Harris report in respect of the declining quality of spoken Irish in primary schools?  I have mentioned the matter half a dozen times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will debate the Moriarty report.  The Whips will arrange a date.  We should debate it soon because the report was issued in December.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, wants to finalise discussions, but I accept that it will take some time for people to reflect on the matter.  He has almost concluded his work.  He has talked with a number of groups, bodies, churches and other interested parties that sent submissions to him.  The matter depends on discussions with Opposition parties, which we would like to try to bring to a conclusion as soon as possible.  I accept that they cannot be done overnight.</P>
        <P>It is the Minister of State&rsquo;s intention to report to the Government on the overall discussions and his wording next week and I would appreciate it if parties could engage with him during the next period.  It is a matter for them to decide which period is preferred.  We would like to have a referendum if we can get agreement on it, but I do not intend to enter a divisive position.  If we can get agreement on it, we would like to move forward and have the referendum.  It is something that we should do.</P>
        <P>On the Harris report, I must check with the Whips.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Taoiseach that it is important to move forward on constitutional protection for the rights of the child, but I am not entirely clear on the last exchange.  Is the Taoiseach saying that we will have an omnibus referendum or that a number of separate and different proposals will be put to the people?  Is he saying that it is an open question as to whether the referendum will happen before the general election?</P>
        <P>May I ask the Taoiseach about the decision of his Government to give &euro;4.3 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money to a company that sacked 500 Irish workers and replaced them with cheaper labour?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not arise on the Order of Business.  I suggest that the Deputy find another way to raise it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I have found a way.  If the Ceann Comhairle examines the matter, he will find that <Col N="206"/>legislation is promised to plug the loophole, as the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment called it.  How did the loophole arise?  It seems to be tantamount to defrauding the taxpayer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest that the Deputy submit a question to the line Minister responsible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to give &euro;4 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money to a company that sacked its workforce and replaced it with cheaper labour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to obey the Chair.  If he has a question, it should go to the line Minister.  The Deputy also has an opportunity to use Leaders&rsquo; Questions, whereas other Members do not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is promised legislation.  It is permissible to ask my question here.  Will we pay employers to sack their Irish workforces&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot debate what might be in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and to replace them with cheaper labour?  How did it come about that we pulled such a stroke for this company?  At the time, the Taoiseach joined me in saying that it was a disgraceful act, but we have divvied up &euro;4 million to the company.</P>

	<P>Legislation on the protection of employment is due this session.</P>
        <P>On Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s first question, the Government would like to deal with the constitutional amendment over the next few months prior to the election.  We would also like to get agreement on it.  That is why the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is in consultation on whether the issues will be taken collectively.  The Government wishes to deal with the amendment, but we want agreement if possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach about three items of promised legislation.  Perhaps he could reply to the question I attempted to raise earlier, given the commitment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not arise.  Does the Deputy have a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, would like to clear the air on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="207"/>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I said that I have questions on three items of promised legislation.  The first item ought to be promised legislation, as it is under the heading &ldquo;Bills in respect of which heads have yet to be approved by Government&rdquo;.  No. 63 states: &ldquo;The provision of DPP appeal against unduly lenient sentences in serious cases before the District Court.&rdquo;  However, it does not mention a Bill.  Is this a case of the legislation not being properly worded or is this item something other than a Bill?  As it does not give a date, I am unsure as to whether it is a priority.  Will the Taoiseach elaborate on how No. 63 arises and why it is not listed as a Bill?</P>
        <P>Another matter I wish to raise is the charities Bill, which we have been waiting for since 1990.  It is a long Bill &mdash; the explanatory memoranda are 300 pages long.  Can we assume it will not see the light of day before the demise of this Government, even though it is on the pink list?  Will the ethics Bill be published and passed before the election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of the DPP appeal against unduly lenient sentences in serious cases before the District Court will provide for a commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government.  The matter has been referred by the Attorney General to the Law Reform Commission for consideration as a matter of urgent public interest.  The Law Reform Commission has issued a consultation paper on the subject and the final report is awaited.</P>
        <P>The charities Bill will be published this session and we would like to take it before the summer.  Ongoing discussions are taking place on the ethics Bill and we hope to publish and take it this session.</P>

Will the Taoiseach indicate if it is not the intention to flag the Bill for a referendum to enshrine children&rsquo;s rights in the Constitution?</P>
        <P>Since the publication of the health strategy in 2001 we have been waiting for legislation defining <Col N="208"/>the rights of people to health and social services.  The Health Bill is going through Second Stage in the D&aacute;il at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the ordering of business in the D&aacute;il and promised legislation.  I received a letter from the Chief Whip stating that the 25 Bills to be published reflect the Government&rsquo;s determination to fulfil its commitments outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government.  Is the Taoiseach confusing the ninth month of pregnancy for the first?  How can he seriously suggest that 25 Bills can be published, debated and passed or rejected in the ten weeks remaining?  To do that the Government would need more guillotines than the French Revolution.  Will the Taoiseach be serious and tell us which Bills are a priority, ones that the Government intends to take in this session before the dissolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, so we can prepare for what will be proposed to the D&aacute;il?  We do not need a pink wish list &mdash; the longest last will and testament of any Government.  We need a real list.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am pleased to bring before the House the Bill, which was initiated and passed all Stages in the Seanad last November.  I acknowledge the support received in that House and I look forward to consideration of the Bill by this House.  However, I must emphasise this is amending legislation.  It extends the existing powers of the National Development Finance Agency to allow it to provide a centre of expertise for procuring PPP projects on behalf of State authorities, in addition to its existing functions.  One of the key activities of the NDFA is to advise on the optimum means of financing public capital investment projects within the State sector, including PPPs.  The NDFA reports that, to date, it has been asked to advise on more than 100 projects, of which PPP procurement has been considered for more than 60.  It completed its advice on 28 projects at the end of 2006, the cumulative value of which was more than &euro;3 billion.  The basic legislative provisions for State authorities to undertake PPPs and for the establishment of the NDFA are in place in the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Act 2002 and the original National Development Finance Agency Act 2002.</P>
  <?oasys _cl11.3- ?>
        <P>The background to this Bill is the Government decision in 2005, following a period of review, to improve the capability of Departments and agencies to undertake public private partnerships, <Col N="212"/>PPPs.  The centre of expertise for PPP procurement in the NDFA will facilitate the procurement of PPP projects funded by a stream of annual payments from Votes.  This is but one of a number of measures put in place by the Government to secure improved management and delivery of the capital investment programme by Departments and agencies.  Others include the establishment of the NDFA in 2003 with a key role in advising Departments and agencies on the optimum means of financing large capital investment projects.  Since 2004, a medium-term planning framework has been provided in the five-year rolling capital investment envelopes for Departments, published with the annual budget.  My Department issued revised capital appraisal guidelines in 2005 that clarify the delegation, evaluation and accountability requirements of Departments-agencies for undertaking all capital investment projects.  All capital projects worth more than &euro;30 million must be subject to full cost benefit analysis and an individual must also be appointed as project manager for all such projects.</P>
        <P>I have also recently established the central expenditure evaluation unit in my Department to promote best practice in evaluation and project appraisal and compliance by Departments and agencies with the capital appraisal guidelines and value for money requirements.  The Government also undertook procurement management reform resulting in the development of fixed price contracts in the traditional procurement area and capacity building of the public sector to manage these contracts.  This period also witnessed the development of improved skills and capacity in procurement agencies such as the National Roads Authority.  To help address the issue of planning and legal delays, the Government brought forward the measures enacted in the Strategic Infrastructure Act last year.  All these underpin the Government&rsquo;s programme of capital investment, as set out in the recently launched national development plan.</P>
        <P>I will outline some background on PPPs generally and then I will go through the specific provisions in the Bill.  The overall context for the use of PPP arrangements includes a national framework for PPPs agreed under partnership structures with the relevant social partners in 2001; legislation in 2002 to facilitate State authorities&rsquo; engagement in PPPs and to establish the NDFA; the inclusion of PPP targets in the rolling multi-annual capital investment envelopes from 2004; and the targets for PPP in the new NDP, under which it is estimated that such partnerships will fund &euro;13.35 billion of plan investment across the economic infrastructure, human capital, social infrastructure and enterprise science and innovation priorities.  PPPs are only one means of procurement in the NDP which includes overall investment of almost &euro;184 billion over the next seven years.  We have seen the use of PPPs <Col N="213"/>become well established in the roads area, with a steady stream of projects coming through the planning process and reaching the market.  Three toll-funded PPP roads are in operation, procured by the National Roads Authority &mdash; Kilcock-Kinnegad, the Dundalk bypass, and the Rathcormac-Fermoy bypass.</P>
        <P>In the area of environment and local government, local authorities have brought forward a range of projects in water services and housing, both with and without the use of private finance, and are also advancing waste projects.  The PPP process is demanding but it has the potential to provide value for money and timely delivery of infrastructure when applied to projects of the right risk, scale and operational profile and when managed by experienced and skilled practitioners.  The process is demanding up front in that it requires that the whole life costs and service requirements of the asset being procured be quantified.  It involves the negotiation of a contract that, typically, will be of between 25 and 30 years&rsquo; duration.  Our central guidance for State authorities has been updated to take account of our experience of the process as it has developed.</P>
        <P>Last year, my Department revised the central PPP guidelines on the assessment and procurement of projects to take account of the revised capital appraisal guidelines issued in 2005, the establishment of the centre of expertise and my recent value for money initiatives.  These aim for a pragmatic approach, while maintaining an appropriate level of rigour in consideration of the various steps.  A number of formal value for money tests are applied in the process.  After a project is identified as suitable for procurement as a PPP, it can take 18 to 24 months or more to reach construction stage but looking back on the experience of using this approach in the national roads programme and in the first PPP projects in the Government&rsquo;s PPP programme, overall delivery times have been impressive.</P>
        <P>I refer to the specific background to the legislation.  By 2005, deal flow was established in the roads area and in the local government sector.  However, progress was not at the pace anticipated in the area of PPPs funded by unitary payments from departmental Votes.  A variety of reasons for this was identified and the need for specialised skills and capability to manage this relatively complex procurement process was singled out as a key factor.  Finding the most appropriate way to put in place the full range of skills needed for PPP procurement, particularly in areas that lack experience of the process, has proved to be a challenge across many jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>Following a period of review and consultation, the Government decided in July 2005 that the full range of the procurement delivery skills required for PPP procurement in this area should be centralised in a centre of expertise and to locate it in the NDFA.  This measure was designed to <Col N="214"/>improve the capacity of the public sector to develop PPPs funded by unitary payments from departmental-agency Votes.  As is the case with the National Roads Authority in the roads area and the Railway Procurement Agency in light rail and metro, it will underpin strong continuity in managing PPP procurement in the public sector.  In tandem, the Government decided that the PPP projects to be pursued initially, with the assistance of the centre of expertise, should be in a small number of areas initially, moving on to other areas as required.</P>
        <P>Projects in train outside the new arrangements have been handled pragmatically in terms of the existing level of involvement of the centre of expertise.  Since the announcement of the centre in July 2005, a number of projects have been in train in the area of PPPs funded by unitary payments from Votes.  The first major initiative for the centre was in the education sector.  The Minister for Education and Science announced PPP programmes of 23 new post-primary schools and four new primary schools, and of 17 projects at third level, to be procured by the centre of expertise on behalf of her Department.  Significant progress has been made on the programme.  The first bundle of schools in the new programme comprising St. Mary&rsquo;s CBS, Portlaoise, Scoil Chr&iacute;ost R&iacute;, Portlaoise and two amalgamation projects in Ferbane and Banagher is being procured by the NDFA and bidders have been short-listed.  A second bundle of schools was announced last November, consisting of six schools on five sites in Cork, Limerick, Kildare, Wicklow and Meath.  The NDFA commenced the new PPP procurement role on an interim, non-statutory basis, pending the making of the necessary legislative provisions.  Acting on a non-statutory basis does not present significant problems for the early stages of the procurement process.  However, statutory provision is necessary to enable the NDFA to conclude contracts for PPP schools projects in the first half of 2007.</P>
        <P>I would like to set in context the procurement role of the NDFA.  The agency is a project taker and it is responsible for the procurement to delivery stage of projects within the parameters set by the sponsoring Department or agency.  There is a clear distinction between the project development phase and the procurement delivery phase.  Project development is the primary responsibility of the sponsoring Department or agency, with the assistance of advisers, including NDFA financial advice, as necessary while procurement delivery is the responsibility of the centre of expertise in the agency.  The centre undertakes the procurement after all policy issues are cleared by the sponsoring Department or agency, the output specifications are set and the public sector benchmark, PSB, is signed off.</P>
        <P>The existing arrangements for NDFA accountability to the Committee of Public Accounts will embrace the new procurement function being <Col N="215"/>given to the agency in the proposed legislation.  These arrangements mirror those for other State agencies and Departments.</P>
        <P>The projects will be returned to the Department or agency at turnkey stage and the unitary payments to the private sector partner will be made from the Vote of the Department or agency.  The procurement phase for all future PPPs in the areas funded by unitary payments by Votes or agencies will be centralised in the centre of expertise, with the exception of projects agreed between the appropriate Minister and the Minister for Finance.  These new arrangements will not apply to the transport sector or local government where PPP deal flow is established and where the existing procurement arrangements will continue.</P>
        <P>The Government decision of 25 July 2005 also provided for the strengthening of the NDFA board by the appointment of two additional members.  As an interim measure, I appointed two additional members to the board on a non-statutory basis, Mr. Fred Barry, Chief Executive of the National Roads Authority, and Mr. Stewart Harrington, a quantity surveyor, but their formal appointment requires amending legislation to increase the statutory limit on the number of board members in the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002.  Provision is included in the Bill for a third additional board member.  In the context of negotiations with the social partners on Towards 2016, it was agreed that the Government would favourably consider the appointment of a trade union representative to the board of the NDFA.  Mr. Liam Berney of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was appointed to the board on an interim non-statutory basis pending enactment of this Bill.</P>
        <P>I already noted that the NDFA is carrying out the new procurement functions on a non-statutory basis.  I am informed that practical arrangements have been developed to manage the interface between the centre of expertise and the relevant sponsoring Departments.  I also understand these have facilitated access to pre-existing expertise.  The centre of expertise continues to expand and is building up the necessary skills to ensure the sustained delivery of projects in the future.  The NDFA annual report for 2005 set out the significant work already undertaken in its new role and the resourcing arrangements being put in place.</P>
        <P>The Bill I present to the House formally allocates the new procurement function to the NDFA.  The provisions are enabling rather than prescriptive.  The Bill also allows for the appointment of the three additional board members.  It includes consequential amendments to existing provisions governing the NDFA&rsquo;s functions which address issues such as ministerial guidelines and charging of costs and makes provision for a code of conduct to be put in place by the NDFA to govern its functions in regard to PPPs. <Col N="216"/> It also provides for a small number of other matters pertaining to the legislation generally.</P>
        <P>I will now outline the specific provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 is a standard interpretation section to define terms used in the Bill, in this case defining the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002 as the principal Act.  Section 2 is a technical amendment to the definitions in the principal Act to make the text consistent with the wording used elsewhere in legislation.</P>
        <P>Section 3 amends section 3 of the principal Act, which sets out the functions of the NDFA.  The amending provision enables the NDFA to carry out two new functions, namely, to enter into PPPs with a view to transferring the rights and obligations under the PPP to a State authority and to act as agent for any State authority in entering into PPPs.  It is anticipated that in most cases the NDFA will act as agent for a State authority.</P>
        <P>Section 4 inserts a new section in the principal Act, requiring the NDFA to draw up a code of conduct on PPPs based on best practices to ensure good corporate governance and to be approved by the Minister for Finance.  The code of conduct is intended to address, <i>inter alia,</i> any potential conflicts of interest or objectives.  It is considered desirable to provide for a statutory code of conduct in the context of the new procurement functions and the legislative framework governing public procurement at European level.</P>
        <P>Section 5 makes a consequential amendment to section 4 of the principal Act.  It extends the existing obligation on the agency to have regard to ministerial policy and guidelines on PPPs to include the exercise of the new procurement functions.</P>
        <P>Section 6 amends sections 12 and 14 of the principal Act, providing for the appointment of three additional members to the board and making a consequential increase to the quorum for meetings from three to four.</P>
        <P>Section 7 amends existing provisions governing the signing of contracts by the NDFA in section 15 of the principal Act.  The provision will allow for contracts to be signed by any two staff authorised in writing by the board as well as by members of the board in recognition of the volume of documentation involved in PPP contracts.  As the NDFA does not directly employ staff but carries out its functions through the National Treasury Management Agency, the section refers to NTMA employees signing contracts.</P>
        <P>Section 8 amends section 18 of the principal Act to allow the NDFA to disclose confidential information to an &ldquo;appropriate Minister&rdquo; as well as to the Minister for Finance.  &ldquo;Appropriate Minister&rdquo; is defined in the principal Act and covers any Minister of the Government who has functions or general responsibility in connection with a PPP or a State authority.</P>
        <P>Section 9 amends section 22 of the principal Act to bring the procedures for adding bodies to the list of State authorities covered by the legis<Col N="217"/>lation into line with current good practice in regard to the use of secondary legislation.  The new provision takes account of developing case law in this area.</P>
        <P>Section 10 substitutes a revised section for section 26 of the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002, which deals with the expenses of the NDFA and how they are to be met.  In an elaboration of the original provisions in the principal Act, it is proposed that expenses incurred by the NDFA from specific projects, which in practice means the cost of specialist external advisers, should be charged directly to the relevant State authorities and not solely to Votes, as was previously the provision.  The provision for recovery of expenses is being extended to cover the new procurement functions of the NDFA, as well as its advisory functions.  The provision also clarifies that the NDFA may pay expenses from the Central Fund in the first instance, with subsequent recoupment from the relevant bodies.  Deputies will be aware that the NDFA&rsquo;s functions are performed through the NTMA under section 11 of the principal Act.  The NTMA also incurs costs in performing these functions, including staffing costs, and these are met from the Central Fund, which is the case for NTMA costs generally.</P>
        <P>Section 11 updates the Schedule to the principal Act to include all public bodies added to the Schedule by statutory instrument since the enactment of the principal Act and includes a new general category in line with the provisions of section 9 of the Bill.  Section 12 amends the Schedule to the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Act 2002 by adding the NDFA, to ensure those PPP arrangements that the NDFA enters as principal are also covered by that Act.  Section 13 is a standard construction and citation provision.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the centre of expertise is one of a range of measures to enable the public sector to avail of PPPs where they are appropriate.  As I stated on a number of occasions, the PPP approach has benefits when applied to projects of the appropriate scale, risk and operational profile.  PPPs are not the main procurement option for the capital investment programme but they have an important role in the new NDP.  Of course, PPPs are ultimately only a means to an end.  The objective is to put in place public services and infrastructure on a value for money basis for the taxpayer so that Ireland remains well placed to meet the challenges it will face in the coming decades.  In the new NDP, we have set out a role for PPPs, with other procurement options, in delivering investment in our economic and social infrastructure.  In that context, the provisions contained in this amending legislation, together with the other steps the Government has taken to support the process in a practical and realistic fashion, will help to bring about the kind of world-class investment in social and economic <Col N="218"/>infrastructure we are committed to delivering over the coming years.  Applying the necessary skills in the area of PPPs, within a robust framework of guidance, is consistent with the Government&rsquo;s overall commitment to achieving value for money in public investment.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing the comments of Deputies on this Bill and to a more detailed debate on Committee Stage.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is consensus across this House on the major need for investment in social and economic infrastructure.  We have fallen behind in many key areas of infrastructural availability, which jeopardises the continuance of our economic success.  That is the background against which every proposal, whether PPP or otherwise, has to be judged.  We need investment and if PPPs have a constructive contribution to make, we should facilitate them.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 was an ambitious programme which experienced successes as well as failures.  The crucial question we must ask is whether we can be confident that the new NDP addresses the problems which led to failures in significant areas.  Have the flaws that arose in the last NDP been corrected?  One of the disheartening aspects of the NDP is the failure to honestly appraise what happened between 2000 and 2006.  The appraisal included in this programme is anything but honest.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
        <P>There is no mention of any of the failures.  It adverts to the fact that PPP collapsed as a source of funding but does not analyse why it happened or whether changes are needed.  We have had dismal failings.  The health strategy is just one of them.  We were to have 3,000 extra hospital beds and 600 extra primary care centres.  Housing is another area.  We should have twice as many affordable and social houses as have been delivered at this stage.  Whatever about the gloss the Minister wants to put on it by claiming that the Government is very competent, he and his officials need to face up honestly to those failures and analyse what was the ambition that collapsed in many of these cases.  Was it bad project formulation?  Was it bad design?  Was it badly thought out?  Were they just presenting no more than glossy press releases that were not really based on hard thinking?</P>
        <P>The Minister is right that PPP needs to be considered as a very serious instrument.  As he has admitted, it is not a panacea.  It is a tool that needs to be carefully used.  We need to be confident that it is delivering better value for money when it does so.  It has the scope to deliver better value in certain cases, most of which are complex projects where the private sector brings expertise that clearly is not available to us.  It is all very well to have in the NDFA a champion of the case for PPPs, who brings together expertise to progress them.  As the Oireachtas is ultimately responsible <Col N="219"/>for ensuring that the taxpayer is getting value, we need to have some vehicle to determine whether the projects deliver better value.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister is sceptical of the one evaluation carried out by the Committee of Public Accounts of the schools.  He believes that just because of that evaluation we should not feel that PPP is damaged, with which I agree to an extent.  However, the Minister and his officials who champion this cause need to present in some forum the evidence that these projects are delivering.  The annual report of the NDFA contains no evaluation.  It claims to have considered the funding of projects worth &euro;4 billion.  At no point has it done an evaluation to identify how PPP can add value, in what sort of projects it adds value and what are the pitfalls and strengths.  We need to build that confidence.  The Minister expects some 15% of the Government&rsquo;s capital programme to be funded by PPP in time.  If that is to happen we need to have confidence that it will not result in a rip-off for the consumer who must pay bloated tolls or result in Departments needing to pay too much in various shadow charges, etc.</P>
        <P>I welcome the changes in the Bill.  The 2002 Bill was very hastily conceived.  It came from the programme for government to try to kick-start activity.  That we are discussing so soon a new Bill to radically change its mandate and effectively jettison many of the elements of the original mandate shows that the original Bill was not well thought out.  Perhaps it could be claimed that PPP was in its infancy and that justifies it to an extent.  However, there was an inherent conflict of interest built into that Bill between the role of advising on the one hand and participating in the financial packages on the other.  That inconsistency and conflict emerged as the process went on and needed to be addressed.  However, it had been flagged in this House long before it became an issue that needed to be resolved.  There was an element of hastiness in the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor&rsquo;s move to push this ahead without anticipating such matters.</P>
        <P>The special purpose companies were to be the key vehicles for PPPs.  I have not heard mention of them since.  The Minister&rsquo;s speech made no mention of them.  To what extent has the &euro;5 billion of guaranteed borrowing afforded to the NDFA been drawn down?  We are greatly changing the NDFA, which is not a bad thing if we are now moving on the right track.</P>
        <P>One of the flaws in the old Act was the gagging order on the NDFA and I ask the Minister to reconsider it.  When its representatives appear before committees of the Houses, they are gagged from commenting on demerits, projects put together poorly, bad ideas and shoddy projects.  If the NDFA is the main unit for driving these projects forward, it should not be gagged from presenting an honest appraisal of what it handles. <Col N="220"/> It has had &euro;4 billion worth of projects.  As the people who vote taxpayers&rsquo; money, we should ascertain whether it finds many of these projects are shoddy and ill thought out.  It may be finding them wonderful.  However, it should not be gagged from saying so.  We need much more evaluation and transparency on the performance of such projects.</P>
        <P>When and where PPPs are desirable should be openly debated.  Most of the experts would claim that schools would not be the first area where they should be used.  They are not particularly complex projects.  They should be financed in the traditional way with the Government being the chief source of funds.  They do not seem to be the projects that one would champion for this system.  They may have represented an easy way for the agency to cut its teeth.  Presumably it is on complex projects such as the metro that PPP will significantly add value in its capacity to conceptualise a much more complex project and arrive at innovative solutions.  There is an onus on the Minister to provide to the House material from the NDFA showing that its selection of schools, radiation oncology services, prisons, etc, are genuinely well framed for the PPP model and that we can have confidence that it is going in the right direction.  For example, if the prison project goes wrong, is it genuinely possible to transfer risk to the private sector?  It is likely that the only risk that could possibly be transferred is the cost overrun risk.  We are probably stuck with any other risks.  We need to see this risk transfer occurring.</P>
        <P>The public benchmark needs to be properly chosen.  In the new arrangements the sponsoring Minister will sign off on the public comparator.  The Minister for Finance and his Department seem to have no role in this regard.  I understood the Minister wanted a strong level of independent evaluation included so that optimistic views from the sponsoring Department could not dictate bad projects getting approval.  I wonder whether it is correct to give line Ministers this responsibility.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance and his Department should continue to have a role.  There seems to be a belief that the Department of Finance is the bad boy and it needs to be taken out of the mix.  I do not share that view.  I have a certain degree of confidence in the Department of Finance and its scepticism is well founded.  That is not to suggest that PPP cannot do great things to accelerate badly needed projects if it is appropriately managed.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Department of Finance has been too traditional.  However, its prudential concerns are good ones and it ought to play more of a role than is envisaged in the new model, beyond publishing the requirements to carry out evaluations and cost-benefit analyses.  I have not seen any of those evaluations.  I know the Minister said that every project of more than &euro;50 million had cost-benefit evaluation.  Since October 2005, every project of more than &euro;30 million is required to <Col N="221"/>have such cost-benefit evaluations.  They are not being published and are not available.  If they are to be serious tools in holding Minister&rsquo;s and sponsors to account, they must be published.  We cannot seriously have evaluations that are not published as otherwise they would be internal and there would be huge temptation to doctor the figures afterwards if the outcome were different from the evaluation.  It is about gamekeepers and poachers.  The evaluation needs to be in the public domain so that we understand the basis on which we sign up to the project.</P>
        <P>As the Minister rightly said, someone should be responsible for overseeing that process.  If he keeps it a secret, his model will fail.  It is important to publish these <i>ex ante</i> evaluations for which he has brought down the threshold.  I have not seen them published or the responsibility nominated and pinned on projects, as it should be.  Maybe the Minister will tell me in his summing up that it is there.  Until I see evaluations published, and interested members of the public or experts in the field able to pull them apart and say whether the process is well or badly put together, we will not have made the crucial necessary changes.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael and the Labour Party have thought a great deal about this because we hope to be in Government shortly, facing the problems the Minister faces now.  It is important to make this material public and to have proper gateway systems.  It should be a public function to announce successful passage through these gateways, that the person responsible has signed off on the critical factors and the information is available.  The Minister has said there will be monitoring of this sort but it is private.  There will be no public monitoring.</P>
        <P>We in the Oireachtas receive no public monitoring of critical projects in the PPP cost-benefit process.  That must change.  The Government, the Minister and his advisers seem to want to be virtuous, but not yet.  They are keeping back this information which is a mistake.</P>
        <P>We must be careful about the PPP process because it has the capacity to go wrong if not properly managed.  There are many up front costs and we must be careful in selecting projects to make sure that the process brings a benefit.</P>
        <P>Against that background, I tentatively approve the Minister&rsquo;s proposal.  It is right that if the NDFA is to become a centre of expertise it should have the authority to act as an agent on behalf of the sponsoring Departments.  We will discuss the different elements of the Bill on Committee Stage.  The important point is to build confidence here and in the public that the use of PPPs is well founded and that public sector organisations use sound and robust models to ensure that we use the PPP process only in appropriate cases, and handle and control it well as a tool.  That confidence does not exist yet.</P><Col N="222"/>
        <P>One way to build it is to commit immediately to the publication of these cost-benefit proposals, including some of the early indications on why the PPP process is chosen.  As the project rolls through a public process of monitoring, we could see that it was delivering on its initial ambitions.  That public element would concentrate minds magnificently and the Minister ought to make that change.</P>
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister is in the House because I wish to begin with an important question which I hope the Minister will be willing to answer.  Some time ago the NDFA advised us that it was getting involved in the acquisition of 36 new linear accelerator facilities for the treatment of cancer through a PPP.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I saw press releases and reports from the NDFA and its parent company, the NTMA, to the effect that this was a major development in the PPP process.  I also saw detailed reference to it at several conferences I attended on the development of PPPs and the role of the NDFA.  Officials from the NDFA and the NTMA gave a presentation and answered questions on this issue among others before the Committee of Public Accounts some months ago. </P>
        <P>What is the situation regarding the HSE report of July 2006 which advised that there would be additional delays due to the PPP process and that the necessary equipment could be sourced more quickly outside the PPP model?  The Minister may recall, if he was in Ireland over Christmas, as I am sure Deputy Bruton does, that the relevant officer from the HSE was interviewed at length on several radio and television programmes.  He was adamant that the PPP process in this case was adding time and would therefore increase the pain and reduce the prospects of recovery for people suffering from cancer.  It is reasonable to ask the Minister not to hide behind the fudge of commercial confidentiality in respect of PPP projects.  That is why the Government will not answer any questions or be accountable to the D&aacute;il on PPPs.  It is important not to fudge this question and that the Minister tell us what has happened in this case and why an experienced official from the HSE can say authoritatively, and the Minister for Health and Children appears to have accepted it, that the HSE advises that hiring or leasing this specialised cancer treatment equipment through a PPP would add to the delay.</P>
        <P>We all pray that the tens of thousands of people who unfortunately require cancer treatment and are not wealthy enough to afford one of the Minister&rsquo;s tax break private hospitals can avail of this equipment, which the project was intended to provide in a timely way to the public service.  We are told that the Minister for Health and Children accepted the advice of the HSE that the PPP was adding to the delays.  I hope the Minister will not hide behind commercial confi<Col N="223"/>dentiality but give us an answer to this important question.</P>
        <P>Like most people involved in economics, I believe that the core issue in the PPP model is whether it is fit for purpose and does what it says on the tin &mdash; procures certain projects for public infrastructural investment in a timely, cost-efficient, value for money way and possibly offers a time and project management advantage that might be lacking under traditional public sector procurement methods.</P>
        <P>The PPP process does not overtly reflect an ideology but the NDFA Act of 2002 and the launch of the NDFA was one of the Government&rsquo;s great announcements in that year.  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Mr. McCreevy, discovered it and brought it to an astonished nation as the new way to acquire infrastructure to plug the infrastructure deficit, whether in schools, roads, hospitals or telecommunications.  There was a new flag and new way, the PPP way.  It was the mechanism whereby much of the deficit from schools to hospitals was to be addressed.</P>
        <P>We are now being presented with a new 2006 NDFA enactment Bill, from the Seanad, which seeks to create capacity for the NDFA that was obviously omitted from the first Act.  That the Government must introduce a new amendment Bill less than four years after the introduction of the first Act indicates that it could not make up its mind as to the role of the NDFA.  That may well be what happened after the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, was thrown overboard and told to swim to Brussels following the walk on the beach in Inchydoney.</P>
        <P>The Minister has to pick up the pieces and put some shape on something that was a Charlie McCreevy runner intended to win votes at the last election.  Did Mr. McCreevy, as Minister for Finance, mess up?  Did the Minister, Deputy Cowen, as his successor, do so in failing to recognise that the NDFA did not have the capacity suggested by the original Act?</P>
        <P>It seems strange that we are being presented with a new Bill to provide a legislative basis for the development of a centre of expertise which was announced by the Government in 2005 but which appears to lack an essential legal foundation.  When the relevant experts came together to deal with this matter, did they discover that the bird they were attempting to encourage to fly had no wings?  That seems to be what happened.  Someone in Government messed up.  I do not know if the Government ever takes responsibility for anything.  It is obvious, however, that someone messed up because we are being presented with another Bill, even though the establishment of the centre of expertise was announced in 2005.</P>
        <P>This is an opportune time to consider this entire area and, for that reason, I welcome this debate.  We need to examine the experience in other jurisdictions such as the UK, Australia, <Col N="224"/>Canada and Portugal, which have had more experience of PPPs than Ireland.  Several matters stand out in this regard.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referred to the first of these in the context of his report on the initial tranche of school projects.  PPPs financed by the private sector are much more expensive in terms of finance costs because the private sector concerns are obliged to pay higher interest rates than national governments.  When Ireland, the debt level of which is low, purchases debt or borrows money, it can avail of a particularly advantageous rate that cannot be matched by any private banking capacity.  The differential in interest rates can be between three to five points, which gives rise to significant additional costs.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has already highlighted this fact in respect of the first clutch of school projects.</P>
        <P>As a result of commercial confidentiality clauses, there is little public accountability and almost no parliamentary oversight, except long after projects have been either commenced or completed, in respect of PPP projects.  This means that if the taxpayer is ripped off by means of a PPP, we may not discover that fact until years later.  That is probably the greatest difficulty with the approach of this Administration to PPPs.  The Government has used the commercial confidentiality clause to completely duck any sense of accountability in respect of performance, value for money and cost, which is wrong.  It is convenient for the Government to be able to avoid being accountable to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann but such behaviour is wrong because the taxpayer &mdash; on whose behalf PPP projects are committed to &mdash; is obliged to pay the piper.</P>
        <P>While the management of many PPPs is handed over to private sector concerns for up to 25 years, it has become apparent, from the experience in countries such as Scotland, that the ongoing public service management relating to a PPP&rsquo;s delivery of service is much more onerous than originally envisaged.  I made a two-day visit to Scotland with the Comptroller and Auditor General earlier this month.  One of the issues we discussed with our colleagues from the Scottish Parliament and officials from Audit Scotland was that of PPPs.  As a result of the parallels between the private finance initiative in the United Kingdom and the system in operation here, I am of the view that our colleagues across the water have valuable insights to offer us.  The key insight is that the requirement for public service quality monitoring of the service maintenance delivery over the long life of a project is extremely onerous.  I do not know if we have made the necessary developments in our public service to provide for monitoring of this nature.  If the public service does not ride shotgun on the delivery of PPP projects over their long lives, taxpayers may end up being ripped off.</P>
        <P>PPPs are a bonanza not just for the banks, which specialise in getting the debt together, but <Col N="225"/>also for lawyers and accountants.  I acknowledge that the Minister has somewhat reduced the incredible and unbelievable structure initiated &mdash; I am not sure if he saw it put in place &mdash; by Mr. McCreevy.</P>
        <P>The centre of expertise is, I am sure all parties will agree, fundamentally a good idea in the context of buying public procurement.  Anyone who has ever been involved in purchasing or procuring a major project would agree with me in this regard.  We all admire the record of the NTMA and we recognise the potential of its child, the NDFA, to contribute to the proper management of PPP projects.  I do not have a difficulty in that regard.  However, the various matters to which I refer are being overseen by the Department of Finance and its various sections.  A legitimate question arises as to what the PPP section in the Department is doing.  Does it have the same number of staff as previously and are those employed by it in a position to report and provide some level of accountability, via the Minister, to the D&aacute;il in respect of what is happening in the context of PPPs?</P>
        <P>There are three examples of PPP-type projects in my constituency.  I first wish to comment on the first major procurement in respect of roads, via tolls, and the current model, which the Minister has stated is now producing roads on time.  In my opinion, the NRA has got the management of road projects under much better control than was the case up to two years ago.  We must, however, remember the West Link toll bridge, which the Government is going to buy out for approximately &euro;600 million.  Where is the capacity in the Bill to deal with circumstances where a project such as that involving the toll bridge is put in train and where there is considerable appreciation in the value of that project because, for example, of the number of cars seeking to use such a bridge?  Alternatively, where lies the capacity to deal with a situation such as the toll bridge screwing up traffic in the greater Dublin area and causing the kind of misery on the M50 with which everyone is familiar?  What is being done to prevent the occurrence of events of this nature?</P>
        <P>The first so-called PPP project in my area was initiated at Castlecurragh, where land owned by the county council was developed, with a private contractor, namely, Shannon Homes, to provide a mix of social and affordable and private housing.  This project has been mired in problems because contained in the small print of the contract relating to this prototype PPP &mdash; it was included by the Minister&rsquo;s Department in all the early project lists for PPPs &mdash; were extremely onerous requirements relating to management companies.  The officials in the PPP evaluation unit never identified any of this and it has resulted in huge charges being levied on the people who bought the houses and also in tremendous confusion.  However, we cannot approach Shannon Homes and state that it is <Col N="226"/>costing the council a fortune to put right the mistakes that were made.  The public purse is being used to sort out this particular mess.</P>
        <P>The third example to which I wish to refer involves Thornton Hall and the new prison.  A national children&rsquo;s hospital cannot be located on a decent large site on the fringes of Dublin to ensure easy access for patients&rsquo; parents from outside the city.  However, it can be done for a prison with prime land on the M50 purchased at a high price.  Is this down to ideological differences in the Government?  Is it that a prison gets higher priority than a national children&rsquo;s hospital?</P>
        <P>Have the contracts for the new prison at Thornton been signed?  The evaluation tests for the site, set by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, were seriously breached in several respects.  Yet, the building of the prison has entered the PPP process with no accountability from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>The Bill&rsquo;s presentation is timely.  It is an incredibly negative comment on the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor&rsquo;s stewardship of the Department.  The PPP structure has been left in considerable confusion.  We all heard the publicity for the 50 projects which are ready to go.  When the NTMA and the NDFA announced a rapid PPP programme to acquire 36 specialised linear accelerator cancer treatment facilities to bring us on a par with other countries, I was delighted for cancer sufferers and their families.  We know what many of them must endure in the health services.  It can depend on where one lives or one&rsquo;s particular condition.  One may have a good experience with speedy attention from fabulous staff.  In other cases, one may be left waiting for long periods, not knowing if one&rsquo;s life is, as a result, being put in danger.  In summer 2006, the HSE carried out an evaluation on these 36 projects which came to the conclusion that it would result in a longer acquisition period for these essential facilities.  On 22 January, when the D&aacute;il was in recess, <i>The Irish Times</i> reported the Minister for Health and Children saying the procurement process would be slower.</P>
        <P>This is a classic test of a PPP.  One has a traditional procurement process where the HSE procures the equipment it needs as quickly as possible.  The PPP is meant to do it faster.  Under commercial confidentiality clauses, the House cannot ask for details of a PPP project.  It was the HSE that stated its internal evaluation showed the PPP acquisition method would be slower and more expensive.  The Minister must put on the record what happened in this particular case.  A PPP does not have a particular ideological content.  However, it is important that the Minister answers the questions.  Unfortunately, there is a history of bad management of State projects and, in some areas, a history of corruption.  Members must know what Departments are proposing in various PPP projects.</P><Col N="227"/>
        <P>The Government cannot just be a good news Government all the time.  It has a tremendous management of the media, dominating most daily news bulletins and newspapers with its good news stories.  However, as in the case of the linear accelerators, the small print shows it may not be so wonderful and indeed more expensive.  I accept not all Members are perfect but we are entitled to answers so we can act on behalf of our constituents.  It is important the Minister for Finance, who was once the Minister for Health and Children and famously described the Department as Angola, outlines what happened in the linear accelerators project.  The PPP mechanism, in this case, was not the best on offer.  The Minister will do us all a service if he addresses that one question before the conclusion of this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Serious savings can be made by having good on-line procurement systems, whether it is in the health services or local authorities.  Better value for money can be obtained by spending it differently.  The public is increasingly using on-line stores for purchases and it will see the opportunities in this regard.</P>
        <P>One aspect of the Bill that concerns me relates to access to information and the outsourcing of accountability.  I also have concerns about some elements of the PPP process which can result in bad outcomes for the public interest.  For example, it will now cost the State a small fortune, almost &euro;600 million, to purchase back the West Link bridge.</P>
        <P>The decisions made on what projects would be subject to a PPP require significant scrutiny but do not get it.  For example, the section of the M4 built under a PPP was significantly more expensive to build per mile than the public section.  Those who are caught by this are those everyday commuters who pay the toll for using the section of the road.  On the M4 it is proposed to have a toll on the way into Galway and Dublin while all other sections are paid for from the public purse.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Independent Members of the Technical Group on putting forward this important and comprehensive motion on an issue that affects a broad cohort of people in the State.  The motion points to the serious deficiencies in cancer services before constructively pointing to what must be done to redress them.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I commend the Kilkenny mother, who went by the name of Rosie, who explained to the nation some weeks ago how a two-tier health service can be literally deadly for human beings.  The eight months she waited for a colonoscopy can make the difference between a much longer span of life or a much shortened one.  It is absolutely inexcusable that in this State, probably the richest country in the European Union, patients depending exclusively on the public health service can find themselves in such a situation.  It should never happen<?oasys _jy ?>again.</P>
        <P>Cancer is a terrible tragedy.  Each year, 20,000 families learn that a loved one has developed the disease.  Some 7,500 people die from the disease every year, ranging from the elderly to the very young.  It is inexcusable, therefore, that significant preventative measures are not in place.  The comprehensive cervical cancer screening programme that was promised 11 years ago, for example, is still not in place.  International experience shows that such a screening programme is hugely successful in detecting the early signs of a cancer that is usually curable.  Moreover, I am aware of a constituent who, having taken a test, had to wait six months for the result.  This is also inexcusable.</P>
        <P>This motion does not cast any reflection on the medical staff in the health services.  Between June and November last, I watched my brother Liam Higgins, at 61 years of age, progress from a healthy looking man to a shadow, when cancer of the oesophagus claimed his life.  This is an experience endured by many thousands of families each year.  The care my brother received from doctors, nurses, district nurses, hospice nurses and medical staff was exceptional.  What we call for in this motion is a commitment to provide the resources necessary to ensure care is available whenever it is needed and, second, that nobody should have to wait one day longer than necessary to avail of that care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I begin by acknowledging that many public patients receive first-class care. <Col N="230"/> Many are eager to tell me of the professionalism and kindness they encounter.  We must concentrate on those who are not lucky enough to be able to say that.  What is required is a plan to provide equality of access.</P>
        <P>A member of my immediate family had reason to test the quality of the public hospital system within the past 18 months when he was diagnosed with cancer and underwent surgery at Connolly Hospital and chemotherapy at Beaumont Hospital.  While he now enjoys an optimistic outcome and was very satisfied with the care he received, it was impossible to ignore the difficult environment in which the staff who tended him, in Beaumont Hospital in particular, must operate while attempting to deliver a quality health care service.</P>
        <P>Given that our population is growing and aging and that the incidence of cancer is set to increase significantly, it is difficult to reconcile the available services against what is needed in the future.  It is even more difficult to reconcile the transfer, for example, of 20,000 cancer patients annually to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, which is due to occur by 2010 under the cancer care strategy.  There is an existing problem in<?oasys _jy ?>St. James&rsquo;s Hospital that cannot simply be ignored.</P>
        <P>While there are many strategies, plans and theories, the issue at point is what happens in practice.  There is no point having a good strategy if the delivery does not match the intention.  There may be good arguments for providing a total package of care, including surgery and<?oasys _jy ?>follow-on treatments, in one location.  However, the holistic approach in treating patients in St. Luke&rsquo;s, including the subsidiary services paid for out of public donations, will be absent when that transfer occurs.  There is genuine upset among patients at this prospect.</P>
        <P>We all acknowledge the need to secure the best possible outcome for patients.  The problem is that the difference between plans regarding services at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and the stories shared courageously by people through such fora as &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; is the difference between hype and reality.  There is serious evidence of a significant difficulty with the service at this stage, let alone in the future when we will lose some capacity in the system.</P>
        <P>It used to be the case that one used private health insurance to pay for a private room in a public hospital.  That is no longer the case.  The availability of health insurance did not result in improving the life chances of those lower socioeconomic groups who rely on the public health system.  The survival rate is still better where patients can pay for their care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Joe Higgins referred to the case of Rosie in Kilkenny.  This is a tragic, disturbing and shameful case.  After Rosie told her story on Joe Duffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, stated <Col N="231"/>on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; that hers was a once-off case.  Unfortunately, however, her situation is replicated throughout the State; I am aware of three similar cases.  The Minister&rsquo;s comment is typical of the arrogance, insensitivity and ineptitude of the Government.</P>
        <P>Every year there are national campaigns to reduce road deaths, and we recognise that they are required.  It is only recently, however, that we have seen anything close to a cancer awareness programme.  This is despite the fact that the number who die annually from cancer is greater than the combined figure for road fatalities, murders and manslaughters.</P>
        <P>In 1992, the then Minister for Health set up a committee to review cervical cancer services.  Fifteen years later, we still await a national roll-out of this programme.  Instead of measuring the cost of delivering such a scheme, it is time to focus on how many lives will be saved as a result of an immediate roll-out.  Early diagnosis is the most important factor in treating and curing cancer, yet the Government&rsquo;s plan to extend radiotherapy services is already two years behind schedule and will not be implemented until 2013 at the earliest.</P>
        <P>Between 40 and 50 women die every year because of a lack of screening services for cervical cancer.  Approximately 650 to 700 die annually from breast cancer.  Like cervical cancer screening services, the BreastCheck facility is not a national service.  We have all heard the announcements urging women to avail of the service if they are under the age of 65.  How dare the Minister endorse this age limit when research abroad shows that at least two thirds of all breast cancer cases occur in women over 65.  However, the Government precludes women over 65 from availing of the BreastCheck programme.  I do not know why people accept this position.</P>
        <P>Another significant factor in breast and colorectal cancer is obesity.  Over the past ten years, since this Government has been in office, the rate of obesity in this country has doubled.  We await the promised national diet and fitness programme specifically aimed at our children.  Perhaps the penny will drop with the Minister that spending adequate money now on proper national screening and awareness and information programmes will reduce the cost of treatment in the long<?oasys _jy ?>term.</P>
        <P>The announcement that St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin is to close brought about a concerted campaign to change that decision.  St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital should remain open and another hospital should open to alleviate the situation.  I have received letters from all over the country in this regard which only proves the hardship people suffer having to travel to receive treatment.  Last summer, a Clare man travelled to Dublin to get treatment for cancer.  He met a man who had travelled from Donegal for treatment in the waiting room.  Both of those men left Dublin and returned home with<Col N="232"/>out having received treatment because a scanner was not working.  As I said, I do not understand why there has not been outrage and protest on a scale never seen before.  No one should have to tolerate a fraction of what is happening in our health service.</P>
        <P>We should not forget that the Minister sought out this position.  She was going to sort out our crumbling health service once and for all.  Instead of a crumbling health service, we now have a system that has been torn asunder.  However, no one accepts responsibility for it because everything is a matter for the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  The HSE is the most inept, malfunctioning and faceless organisation established by an equally inept and malfunctioning Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this motion put forward by my colleagues, the Independent Deputies.  Cancer care and cancer services is an important issue.  It requires urgent debate and I commend my colleagues for putting it on the political and health agendas.  We will put forward sensible proposals and solutions in this debate.  It is not only a question of attacking the Government; it is about pointing out the reality for patients.  The role of the Independent Deputies is to put forward policies and commend policies which work.</P>
        <P>There is a crisis in regard to the sad illness of cancer.  Some 7,500 people die each year as a result of cancer.  This is a crisis.  There can be no more debate about it.  We must deal with the crisis.  We all have family, friends and neighbours affected by cancer so we need the Government to wake up and take this reality seriously.  However, we also need the Government to put the services in place and to get on with the job.  When we put forward solutions, the Government should adopt them and get on with it.</P>
        <P>I do not want us to have a row as in the case of the Mater site.  An objective decision was made in regard to the Mater site and I say to the Minister to get on with building the children&rsquo;s hospital on that site.  That is what the professionals and independent, objective people decided.  The Minister should get on with it and stop wasting people&rsquo;s time.  I also call on colleagues in all parties to stop wasting people&rsquo;s time.</P>
        <P>I had the honour of being elected in Dublin North Central, the old constituency of the late Dr. Noel Browne.  As the Minister knows, Dr. Noel Browne fought on the TB issue and really made an impact on society.  We need to take a Noel Browne-type approach and to wake up to the reality that 7,500 people die from cancer each year.  Thousands more people &mdash; friends and family &mdash; live with the disease, another reality we must accept.  We need to take a Noel Browne-type approach to deal with this issue.  We also need a community-driven, people centred response.</P><Col N="233"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>I commend the people working in the services, including the doctors, nurses and the consultants, many of whom do an excellent job although it might not be trendy to say so at present.  We should engage in dialogue with the consultants and resolve the current problems.</P>
        <P>We talk about putting forward sensible proposals.  The Independent Deputies call for vigorous programmes for cancer prevention, including the education of children in schools from a young age.  Additional resources and a comprehensive programme should be put in place for the earliest possible detection, and the best possible treatment, of cancer.</P>
        <P>We need the immediate extension of cervical and breast screening to all areas of the country.  We also need appropriate national screening programmes for other cancers, such as prostate cancer.  Some 3,000 acute hospital beds are urgently needed to ensure cancer suffers are not prevented from immediate admission to hospital where necessary.</P>
        <P>I support the motion which calls for the scrapping of the Government bias towards privatisation of health.  Health should not be treated like a commodity or a business.  Health care is a right.  We pay our taxes each week and everybody is entitled to a quality public health service.  When we talk about reforming the health services, the key words are &ldquo;investment&rdquo;, &ldquo;reform&rdquo; and &ldquo;more beds&rdquo;.  I urge all Deputies to support the Independent Deputies&rsquo; motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this timely debate which was most likely sparked by the situation in which Rosie in Kilkenny found herself.  Many people dread hearing the word &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; and commonly refer to it as &ldquo;the big C&rdquo;.  It is associated with pain, suffering and much stress.  If there is a suspicion at any time that somebody might be suffering from cancer, an early diagnosis should be facilitated.  There is no reason people should not be sent for diagnosis as early as possible.  The earlier one intervenes, the better the outcome.  From a health perspective, it means better value for money.  It is also good from the patient&rsquo;s perspective.</P>
        <P>It is worth remembering that if we catch cancers in time, most of them can be successfully treated.  It is important to remember that some types of cancer are preventable and people must take that on board.  Skin cancer is quite common.  We are well aware of the damage the depletion of the ozone layer can cause.  There have been several warnings, yet some people persist in getting burned by the sun and do not worry about the consequences.  It is possible they may develop skin cancer in later life.</P>
        <P>Eating green vegetables and a good balanced diet also help to prevent cancer.  We must accept some degree of personal responsibility for cancer.  Cancers can be detected much earlier.  There is <Col N="234"/>the cervical screening programme, BreastCheck and a simple blood check which can indicate whether one has prostate cancer.  People have a responsibility not to leave getting checked until they have symptoms.  Even when some people have symptoms, they do not want to confront them.  They hope they will go away and they do not want to receive a diagnosis.  People have a responsibility to get an early diagnosis.</P>
        <P>It is very hard to get older men, in particular, to go to the doctor for an annual checkup.  However, when people reach certain milestones, there is an onus on them, particularly men who reach 50 years of age and women, to get regular checks.</P>
        <P>Somebody mentioned the excellent treatment people receive in hospital.  I regularly hear about the excellent care people who are terminally ill receive and the great praise they have for doctors and nurses.  Most people with a terminal illness want to die at home, if at all possible.  To some extent, we must re-examine the community supports available.  For example, I came across a case recently where there was no hospice home care nurse available at weekends for a person who was very supportive of the services received in hospital.  That is a major issue the HSE should take on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; c&uacute;ig n&oacute;im&eacute;ad agamsa, agus c&uacute;ig n&oacute;im&eacute;ad ag mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Teachta Boyle.</P>
        <P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an r&uacute;n seo, agus molaim na Teachta&iacute; Neamhsple&aacute;cha as an r&uacute;n a chur os comhair an T&iacute;.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Connolly mentioned, this issue has many dimensions.  It involves the services, the way we view health and the prevention of illness.  The record is not good from the Government&rsquo;s point of view, given that its preventative health budget is approximately 0.25% of the overall health budget, which is very low by international comparisons.  As a result, we are dealing with crisis issues, given that many people have not only been living an unhealthy life but in many cases their conditions are not detected at an early stage and they are left in dire need of essential acute services, which often are not available.  With the likely closure of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and the increase in the provision of such services in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital being deferred until 2013, there is a sense of crisis due to the lack of services, the lack of Government direction and the lack of delivery in terms of future services.</P>
        <P>Some six in 100 women die from cervical cancer per annum.  It is a very treatable cancer if detected at an early stage but very aggressive if not.  Therein lies an important failure by the Government.  As there is not such a screening programme in place, it is incumbent on women to seek their own screening programme.  The lack of a screening programme is unacceptable.  Cervical screening is not a pleasant procedure.  We must <Col N="235"/>learn from other countries with such screening programmes in place which require women to have smear tests every two years once they become sexually active and every five years when in a stable relationship.  This is basic preventative care, which is not in place here.  The length of time it takes to get the result of a test, which can take six months in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, can mean the difference between life and death for a person.  These issues must be dealt with and put right.</P>
        <P>We raised with the Taoiseach earlier today radiotherapy services in the North in the context of the Civic Forum and the need for standards to be matched North and South.  We need to come up to the bar of the standards in this area in the North which are far higher than they are in the South.  In the case of aggressive category one cancers, head and neck cancers, cervical cancer and others, services in place in the North provide for people in urgent need of care, multidisciplinary team meetings are held to provide four to five weeks of daily radiotherapy while in the South the service is not provided on bank holidays.  The lower service here means the difference between life and death for people.  In many cases people here are generally treated very shoddily.</P>
        <P>If one attends a hospital in Limerick, one can be referred to the Mater in Dublin for radiotherapy treatment and it is not an easy task for the person concerned to travel from Limerick to Dublin especially on a daily basis.  If one lives in Donegal, one is expected to travel to Belfast for such treatment.  Once a person is classified as a Northern Ireland patient, one is not even on the radar of the Department of Health and Children.  That skews the figures apart from the other difficulties of having to wait one&rsquo;s turn if one is from the Republic and not from Northern Ireland.  Essentially, one has to wait in the queue behind people from Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>People in Donegal are crying out for radiotherapy services in Letterkenny.  The Government has said that a critical mass of 400,000 is required, but other EU member states provide a critical mass of only 250,000 is required.  If we were to apply standards that apply in other countries, we would have the services here, but that would require the Government to admit that it has a serious problem and deal with it.</P>
        <P>As the Minister for Health and Children is present, I wish to advise her that I was asked by the Donegal Action for Cancer Care group if it could have an answer to its request for a meeting with her.  It made that request at the end of the summer and it has not heard from her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have met its representatives several times, as the Deputy will be aware.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="236"/>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps there has been a difficulty in communications but the group is looking forward to a reply from the Minister, which is long overdue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this motion in the names of the Independent Deputies and the opportunity it affords us to discuss the standard of cancer services available and the need for an effective cancer strategy here.  I also welcome the fact that the Minister for Health and Children is present for the debate, as far too often during Private Members&rsquo; time members of the Government have chosen not to respond directly to many Opposition Private Members&rsquo; motions.</P>
        <P>As has been outlined, access to cancer services is very much a question of luck depending on the person involved.  It is a game of geographic lotto.  Where a person lives determines whether he or she will have a sufficiently early identification of a condition and whether he or she has direct access to the services that will assist in their treatment.  Different standards of care apply in terms of access to palliative care for many citizens who have various cancers that are inoperable.  This hotch potch approach to standards of care has caused a great deal of public concern.</P>
        <P>The Government strategy in regard to breast cancer has been mentioned but it must be reiterated that until the BreastCheck screening programme is rolled out throughout the country none of us in this House can be satisfied with the multi-standard level of care afforded to women.  I represent Cork South-Central.  Prior to the last general election a promise was made that BreastCheck would be rolled out to the southern and western regions.  It has been promised that BreastCheck will be up and running in Cork city by July of this year.  I admit that some progress has been made.  A site for the facility has been identified, cleared and work has commenced on the foundations.  However, given that tomorrow is 1 February, I am less than optimistic that the deadline of July for the provision of service will be met.  It will probably be available by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister will indicate that a clinical director has been appointed but the process of employing radiographers to provide that service is still under way.  As the Minister is probably only too well aware, one of the main problems with our health service is identifying professionals to fill such positions in sufficient time.  The indication that there is a strongly likelihood that BreastCheck will be up and running in Cork in July or August this year, as still seems to be indicated by the Minister, the Government and BreastCheck, is not likely to hold true.</P>
        <P>The wider cancer strategy needs to be more focused.  We, as a society, do not have sufficient information about the genetic and environmental factors that cause many cancers.  We know that <Col N="237"/>something in Celtic genes makes us more predisposed towards certain types of cancers, but not enough questions are asked as often as they should be about the environmental factors involved, namely, the anecdotal evidence of the existence of clusters of incidents of cancers among people living on the same street or in small communities.  Information is not being compiled that would allow us to answer why these cancer incidents are occurring.</P>
        <P>The National Cancer Registry based in Cork does valuable work but its statistics are based on too wide a geographical basis.  They might reveal the number of people in counties Cork or Dublin who have cancer but they do not give further detail.  If we are to have faith in the quality of information on this area, information is required in electoral districts of the existence of cancers, the types of cancers and the number of people affected to enable us to pinpoint to the degree possible with the technology available the existence of clusters of cancers throughout the country.  Without such information, a cancer strategy will always be ineffective.</P>
        <P>I reiterate the point made by my party leader and colleague that the size of the preventative health care and health education budgets in the Department of Health and Children make it impossible to get the message across that much can be done on an individual basis and within communities to prevent to some extent the existence of the condition of cancer.  If we were to invest sufficient resources in this area, we might be largely able to avoid trying to treat the problem at a later stage in terms of hospital and palliative care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I begin my contribution with a Government health warning, namely, PD-Fianna F&aacute;il ideology can seriously damage one&rsquo;s health.</P>
        <P>It has been confirmed by none other than the Minister for Health and Children that the Government&rsquo;s ideological addiction to public private partnerships has delayed the delivery of life-saving cancer services in this State.  Extra radiotherapy machines are being provided for St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and Beaumont Hospital outside the PPP model because the Minister has been obliged to accept they could not be delivered until 2012 were the PPP process to be used.</P>
        <P>This has been exposed by the leaking earlier this month of the so-called confidential progress report on the delivery of the national plan &mdash; again so-called &mdash; for radiation oncology from the Health Service Executive to the Minister in July 2006.  The Minister was quick to issue a response outlining her version of the progress made under the plan.  The HSE was also forced to issue a response, which can only be described as laughable.  It described the leaked report, which was prepared in July 2006, as &ldquo;an historical one&rdquo;.  It <Col N="238"/>seems that on the unknown planet on which the HSE management lives, six months ago is ancient history.  However, this is only true when its suits the argument.  When the other point of view suits the HSE, six months or longer is an acceptable time for a patient such as Rosie from Kilkenny, who appeared on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;, to wait before receiving a proper diagnosis of cancer, even though the lateness of the diagnosis will cost that woman her life.</P>
        <P>The July 2006 HSE report to the Minister on the progress of the radiation oncology plan states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The overall timeline for project delivery suggested completion of the entire plan by 2011.  A significant exercise has been undertaken to review this timeline.  This has included significant detailed discussion with the National Development Finance Agency, the hospital planning office in the Department of Health and within the HSE.  There is consensus that the target date of 2011 cannot be met.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The National Development Finance Agency has responsibility for putting in place PPP arrangements and it is being addressed by legislation that is before the House today.  The HSE board was informed in December 2006 that the plan would not be in place until 2013 or 2014, were it to be delivered by PPP.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, stated she did not accept the HSE&rsquo;s views.  However, it was not simply the HSE&rsquo;s view that the timeframe set for the delivery of the project by way of PPP could not be met.  The leaked report stated the overall project could not be delivered by 2011.  It made reference to &ldquo;having regard to current advice of the NDFA and the hospital planning office&rdquo;, which is a section of the Minister&rsquo;s Department.</P>
        <P>Despite the clear evidence that reliance on PPP is hampering the roll-out of radiation oncology, the Government, in its proposed amendment to the motion before the House, again commits itself to the flawed PPP process.  Overall, the amendment presented in the name of the Minister for Health and Children is nothing short of pathetic and is simply not in the real world.  In my view and that of many both in the House or who will watch and read of this debate, it is indicative of a tired and failed Government.</P>
        <P>I commend the Independent Members for tabling this comprehensive motion on cancer services.  It correctly identifies the failures of the Government and sets out many of the requisite measures to ensure comprehensive cancer care services.  While the full and speedy implementation of the Government&rsquo;s plan for radiation oncology is necessary, clearly more than that is required.  In itself, that plan is insufficient and fails to deliver radiation oncology on a truly regional and national basis.  The expert working group on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland was established in May 2000 <Col N="239"/>and identified what it called &ldquo;the profound deficit in radiation oncology services&rdquo;.  In 2007, nearly seven years after its establishment, there is still a profound deficit in radiation oncology services.</P>
        <P>The aforementioned leaked report will cause further distress to thousands of cancer patients and their families nationwide who, having welcomed the Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s announced plans for full delivery of services, including radiotherapy centres by 2011, now find the plan is being hampered and will not be delivered on time.  The report has raised a major doubt over the Government&rsquo;s entire cancer strategy.</P>
        <P>I stress again that the Government&rsquo;s delayed cancer care plan is not in itself sufficient and this point cannot be over-emphasised.  It will locate radiation oncology services in Dublin, Cork and Galway, with satellite services earmarked for Waterford and Limerick only.  The half of the island that is north of a line from Dublin to Galway will be badly served by this plan.  I have made this point, as have others, to the Minister repeatedly.  Patients in Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath will be obliged to travel to Dublin.  There is a limited plan for patients from one other Border county, namely, Donegal, to be facilitated in Belfast.  It seems patients in the predominantly rural counties of Sligo and Leitrim will be obliged to travel to Galway.  This is completely inadequate and again demonstrates a failure on the part of the Minister and the Government to deliver health services on the basis of equity and the right of all citizens to equal access on the basis of need, irrespective of their ability to pay or the geographic location in which they live.</P>
        <P>A truly all-Ireland and regionally-based cancer treatment service is needed.  Radiation oncology should be delivered within all the regions without exception.  Cancer sufferers are being subjected to long and painful journeys for treatment.  Many patients, who feel too ill to travel, consequently choose not to avail of radiotherapy.  These are real cases and the Minister cannot be unaware of their number.  The resources exist to deliver radiotherapy on a regional basis and the Government must go back to the drawing board.</P>
        <P>On the basis of the Government&rsquo;s record thus far, as well as the Minister&rsquo;s tenure in office, I doubt whether either retains the will or the energy to make that short but imperative journey.  Nonetheless, we have a crisis in cancer care that must be addressed.  We need a revised, expanded and properly resourced plan that will ensure delivery of such services on time and throughout the regions.  Given the significant surpluses already recorded, this not beyond the Government&rsquo;s gift.  I emphasise that such a plan should not be reliant on PPPs and should be put in place without further delay.</P>

       <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P LI="2" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />the progress that has been achieved to date on the implementation of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology; the commitment of all necessary capital funding for the plan through Public Private Partnership and Exchequer sources;  and the commitment of the Government and the Health Service Executive to achieve full implementation in a timeframe that accords with the Government&rsquo;s policies and priorities; and</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />progress being made in the procurement process for the initiative to develop private hospitals on the campuses of public hospitals in order that up to 1,000 beds currently reserved for private patients may be redesignated for use by public patients.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I wish to record the significant achievements of the health services in our country regarding cancer care and control, and the plans we have which will achieve the services we all want.  We have to catch up after many years where failed economic policies led to enormous problems for health and social services.  The successful economic policies of the Government have meant that the people of our country have generated the substantial resources to start catching up.</P>
        <P>Since 1996, approximately &euro;1 billion<b> </b>has been invested in cancer services nationally.  We have made progress to date and are determined to make more.  That is why our response now is to invest, as never before, to build up all aspects of cancer care and cancer control until we get our cancer services to world class standards.  We are making patient safety and quality outcomes the drivers of all decisions on cancer care.  That programme of investment in cancer care will be pursued relentlessly.</P>
        <P>The finance for radiotherapy is already committed by the Government beyond any doubt.  A new cancer director is to be appointed by international competition in the coming months.  Good things are happening each day in cancer care.  For example, the first prostate brachytherapy cases in the public health system were performed in University College Hospital Galway, UCHG, last Friday and the two patients were back at work on Monday.  This is now one of the accepted forms of curative treatment for men with early staged prostate cancer.  The team performing this procedure at UCHG has more than a decade experience with the technique during which it has treated more than 700 patients internationally.  They are now bringing that expertise to Galway.</P>
        <P>It is only fair to all those working hard in cancer care to record the improvements that they have made and are continuing to make.  It is important that patients should have reasons for hope and optimism about cancer care.  We have <Col N="242"/>achieved the key goal of the 1996 national cancer strategy, which was to reduce the death rate from cancer in the under 65 age group by 15%; this was achieved three years ahead of target.  More than 100 additional consultants have been appointed in key areas of cancer care.  There were almost 94,000 admissions for cancer care in 2005, an increase of nearly 70% on 1997.  Approximately 58,000 people were treated for cancer as day cases in 2005, an increase of 130% on 1997.  In 1997, there was no cancer screening programme anywhere in the country.  This year we are beginning the full national roll-out of BreastCheck to the south and west and I decided also that we would commence a cervical screening programme later this year.  Additional funding of &euro;20.5 million<b> </b>has been allocated in 2007 for cancer control, an increase of 74% on the comparable 2006 investment.</P>
        <P>Cancer survival is improving in Ireland for all the major cancers.  I know that the statistics show that too many people still die prematurely from cancer in our country.  For some cancers, such as breast cancer and cervical cancer, approximately the same numbers of deaths have occurred in each of the years between 2000 and 2005.  However, that is not the valid and effective measure of overall survival rates in a growing and aging population.  We currently have approximately 120,000 survivors, 3.3% of the population.  The National Cancer Registry compared cancer survival data between 1995 and 1997 with data between 1998 and 2000.  Our overall relative survival from cancer increased from 48% to 50% for women and from 38% to 44% for men.  Both of these increases are statistically significant.  For women, there were increases in survival in the four commonest cancers, namely, breast, lung, colorectal and lymphoma.  Survival improved for almost all cancers for men.</P>
        <P>Today I announced the appointment of the first board of the National Cancer Screening Service.  We are going to develop totally integrated national cancer screening programmes in areas where the clinical evidence shows that cancer screening works reliably and delivers real results for patients.  The new board will maximise the expertise in BreastCheck and the cervical screening programme.  It will ensure improved efficiency and develop a single governance model for cancer screening.  The total allocation to the new service is &euro;33 million which is a 71% increase in the 2006 allocation to the programmes.</P>
        <P>I am committed to ensuring that BreastCheck is rolled out to the remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible this year.  I have allocated additional revenue funding of &euro;8 million<b> </b>for this year to meet the additional costs involved.  I have also made available an additional &euro;26.7 million in<b> </b>capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units, five additional mobile units and the provision of state-of-the-art digital equip<Col N="243"/>ment.  Construction commenced on both sites in Cork and Galway in early November last year.</P>
        <P>Some 60,000 women were screened by BreastCheck in 2005, which represents a 19% increase over 2004.  I expect 70,000 women to be screened this year.  Of those screened in 2005, 318 cancers were detected.  From the commencement of screening in February 2000 to August 2006, BreastCheck diagnosed and arranged treatment for 1,867 women with breast cancer.  The first round of screening will commence in the south and west in the spring.</P>
        <P>An effective national cervical screening programme will result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer.  It is my objective to have such a programme rolled out, beginning late this year, based on an affordable model.  From January 2001 to the end of December 2006, approximately 57,000 women attended for screening in the pilot screening programme in the mid-west.  I have allocated additional revenue funding of &euro;5 million in 2007 to facilitate the national roll-out of this programme.  Significant preparatory work is well under way.  It involves the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register.  I have included a requirement in the legislation establishing the new board to implement special measures to promote participation in its programmes by disadvantaged persons and difficult to reach groups.  This is of particular relevance in preventing and controlling cervical cancer.</P>
        <P>Many Opposition Deputies referred to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Kilkenny.  It is regrettable that any patient referred to a hospital with possible symptoms of cancer would be subject to a delay in diagnosis.  This is especially the case as the earlier a diagnosis of cancer is made the earlier treatment can commence and the prognosis is usually better.  I have been assured by the Health Service Executive that a patient referred to St. Luke&rsquo;s for endoscopy and considered urgent will be given an immediate appointment and will be seen within one to two weeks.  Urgent cases are forwarded directly to the medical consultant for prioritisation.  General practitioners are encouraged to make contact directly with the medical consultant.  The HSE has made available capital funding of &euro;300,000 to build a new modular endoscopy unit at the hospital and is referring patients to the National Treatment Purchase Fund to reduce waiting times for non-urgent cases.</P>
        <P>Real progress is now being made in implementing the national plan for radiation oncology.  We already see the return on the substantial investments in Cork and Galway.  In Cork University Hospital 1,845 new patients were treated over the four linear accelerators in 2006.  This constituted 35,302 treatments, an increase of almost 5,800 treatments over the previous year. <Col N="244"/> The waiting time for patients to receive treatment has halved from eight to ten weeks to three to four weeks.  In University College Hospital Galway, almost 1,000 patients were treated in 2006, representing a 76% increase over the previous year.  The number of treatments increased from 10,500 in 2005 to 18,500 in 2006.  University College Hospital Galway expects treatments provided to increase by 7% this year.</P>
        <P>In December last year I met with the chairman and chief executive officer of the HSE and I agreed the executive should examine options to speed up the pace of the plan.  I reiterate that the funding for this plan is totally secured by the Government&rsquo;s decision of July 2005.  This is the first time a major capital project for cancer care has been fully funded years in advance.  The job now is implementation without delay.</P>
        <P>It is my objective and that of the HSE to see the earliest delivery of the plan in the best interests of cancer patients throughout the country.  I am determined the HSE will deliver on this plan in 2011 as originally scheduled.  It is a challenging timetable and I will provide the HSE with the necessary support and approvals to deliver on it.</P>
        <P>The main developments to date include the procurement of additional capacity in the shape of two linear accelerators for St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Rathgar, which are scheduled to be delivered around the end of 2007.  They also include the provision of interim facilities at Beaumont Hospital and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, which will be delivered by early 2009.  The capital requirements amount to &euro;45 million.  Four leading international experts have been appointed to validate the population needs assessments, technical specifications, process mapping and other outputs.  Additional revenue funding of &euro;3.25 million has been provided in 2007 to support the implementation of the national plan.  This funding will support the appointment of five additional consultant radiation oncologists, seven specialist registrars and five support staff.</P>
        <P>Patients are now being referred to the radiation centre at Limerick Regional Hospital.  The operators at Limerick are fully signed up to integrating their service delivery within the radiation oncology department at University College Hospital Galway.  A service level agreement is being finalised at present between the HSE and the private Whitfield Clinic in County Waterford.  It is a good example of the public and private sectors working together for an immediate solution.  This will support the referral of public patients for radiation oncology treatment while we build the public radiation oncology facility at Waterford Regional Hospital.  The NDP will also support a new day ward with 20 treatment places at Waterford Regional Hospital.  Planning of this facility is under way and construction is scheduled to commence next year.</P><Col N="245"/>
        <P>As regards patients in the north west, a service level agreement is now in place for the referral of approximately 50 radiation oncology patients annually from Donegal to Belfast City Hospital and a number of patients have already been referred for treatment.</P>
        <P>The decision to transfer St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to St. James&rsquo;s was taken by the Government in the context of its consideration of the national plan.  The board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and its executive management team are fully committed to supporting the Government&rsquo;s decision.  We value and will build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke&rsquo;s in this transfer.  A transfer along similar lines took place last year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred to Belfast City Hospital, a major academic teaching hospital.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, I am glad to put on the record of the House the substantial developments that are taking place in cancer control and my determination, as well as that of the Government, to ensure cancer care is brought up to a top class standard in our country.  With focus, determination and persistence, this goal will be achieved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not happen by the privatisation of health care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague the Minister for Health and Children has set out very clearly the significant achievements of this Government in cancer control.  We have invested in all elements of cancer care and in all regions.  These achievements have benefited patients throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the independent analysis of our progress in improving cancer survival undertaken by the National Cancer Registry.  This Government is not complacent over its successes in this area.  A recent report, published in June 2006 by the registry, predicts that cancer numbers in Ireland will have increased from 22,000 a year at present to 43,000 by 2020.  The number of potentially fatal cancers will more than double, from 13,800 to 28,800, in the same period.  Approximately two thirds of this increase is expected to be due to the increasing number of elderly people in the population and the remainder to upward trends in the incidence of some of the common cancers.</P>
        <P>This anticipated increase in cancer numbers will place a major additional burden on cancer services and must be considered in current planning for cancer control.  The Minister and the Government are committed to significant additional investment based on an integrated strategy that seeks to improve prevention, early detection, treatment and support services for cancer.</P><Col N="246"/>
        <P>We have in place a national cancer control strategy, which the Minister launched last June.  The aim of the strategy is to reduce our cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality rates relative to other EU countries by 2015.</P>
        <P>The HSE is establishing a national cancer control programme to manage, organise and deliver cancer control on a whole population basis.  The programme will have a strong emphasis on prevention and early detection, integrated across primary, hospital, supportive and palliative care.  The service plan of the HSE for this year sets out the detailed deliverables of the programme.  They include the establishment of the leadership team to implement the programme, including the director of the programme and key medical leaders at network level.  The Minister referred to an overall investment for cancer of &euro;20.5 million in 2007.  This funding will also improve access to diagnostic services, support additional medical oncology and improve transport services for cancer patients.</P>
        <P>Many cancers and cancer deaths are preventable.  As many as one third of cancers could be prevented by public policy initiatives and the promotion of healthy lifestyles.  Early intervention can make the difference.  Cutting down on tobacco consumption and improving diet could help to save many lives.  The Government has decided that it needs to put renewed emphasis on prevention as well as treatment.  We cannot accept the future predictions for cancer incidence without redoubling our efforts to prevent as many cancer cases and cancer deaths as possible.</P>
        <P>Ireland has led the way in Europe and beyond in implementing legislation to address the tobacco epidemic.  There is widespread agreement that the smoke-free at work legislation has been hugely successful.  From 31 May 2007 it will no longer be legal to sell cigarettes in packs of less than 20.  The Minister for Finance decided to increase the tax on a packet of 20 cigarettes by 50 cent in the context of budget 2007.  This increase was coupled with a decision to plan for further increases in tobacco excises for a period ahead, so as to keep the level of tax increasing in real terms and with a call on the social partners to discount some or all of the effect of such price increases in fixing on the relevant inflation benchmark.  The HSE has also announced it is to step up enforcement activity on sales to minors.</P>
        <P>The national survey of lifestyle, attitudes and nutrition, SL&Aacute;N, carried out every four years, is one of the most comprehensive pieces of research undertaken in this country into health and lifestyle.  It has provided the Department with invaluable data for priority setting in health promotion initiatives and programmes which inform the Department&rsquo;s future policy and programme planning.  The 2006 survey is at data collection stage and consists of face-to-face interviews with a randomly selected 10,000 participants.  The <Col N="247"/>Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science have established the social, personal and health education support service, SPHE.  This is based on the importance of the school as a setting for promoting health.  The SPHE curriculum is Ireland&rsquo;s most significant commitment to health promotion in schools.  It is a broad-based health education programme that aims to enhance the self-esteem and decision-making skills of young people.  All schools, both primary and post-primary, up to junior certificate level must make provision for the SPHE curriculum.  A curriculum for senior cycle is being developed.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?><P>Screening for certain types of cancer plays a crucial role in the detection of pre-cancerous and early disease, saving lives and reducing morbidity.  This year, we will have in place a national breast screening service and a national cervical screening service.  I am aware of reports of delays in obtaining results of cervical smear tests.  These delays have not arisen under the Irish cervical screening programme, but relate to smear tests referred by general practitioners to hospital laboratories, which are the responsibility of the HSE.  The HSE has informed the Department that the majority of laboratories will process urgent requests for cervical smear tests in less than two weeks.</P>
  
        <P>To reduce the backlog of cervical smears awaiting testing, the HSE is referring approximately 25,000 smear tests to a laboratory in the US.  The HSE has sent samples from Cork University Hospital to the US and results were returned last week.  CUH is preparing to send a further 2,000 smear tests to the US on 7 February.  The HSE has commenced discussions with the other testing centres and the Royal College of Surgeons is working closely with the HSE to transfer tests to the US.</P>
        <P>The HSE is also making arrangements to ensure proper follow-up of women with abnormal smears.  The HSE has reviewed hospital services, including cytology, and is planning on the basis of a four-week turnaround time in reporting.  The roll out of a national cervical screening programme planned for later this year is the most efficient population approach to prevent and control cervical cancer.</P>
        <P>Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in Ireland and is a significant public health problem.  The National Cancer Forum has monitored emerging evidence and trends in other countries in respect of colorectal cancer screening.  The forum has advised that substantial work is required to address a range of issues as a prerequisite for the development of a screening programme.</P>
        <P>The national cancer screening service, established by the Minister on 1 January, has an advisory function in respect of screening for cancers generally.  The Minister will ask the service to advise on the implementation of a national col<Col N="248"/>orectal cancer screening programme, specifically on the population to be screened, at what intervals screening should take place and the requirements for a quality assured and well organised cost-effective symptomatic service.</P>
        <P>Deputies referred to the need for prostate cancer screening.  Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in men.  There are approximately 11,150 new invasive prostate cancer cases annually.  It is predominantly a disease experienced by older men, with the majority of cases occurring in the 70-74 year age group and the majority of deaths in the 80-84 year age group.</P>
        <P>The National Cancer Forum has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a population-based prostate cancer screening programme in this country.  The forum has recommended that this issue should be reassessed when results are available from randomised control trials being conducted internationally.  This position is consistent with the recommendations adopted by the European Union, which advocate the introduction of cancer screening programmes that have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to professional expertise and priority setting for health care resources.</P>
        <P>I am supportive of the Irish Cancer Society&rsquo;s Action Prostate Cancer campaign, which was launched in April last year by the Minister for Health and Children.  Information on the signs and symptoms of prostate cancer is essential in the early detection of the disease.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan 2007-13 includes major investment in the implementation of the national cancer control strategy.  This will involve significant investment and development of facilities to treat people affected by cancer.  Infrastructural investment will include state-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment facilities, including day and outpatient facilities and facilities for the administration and preparation of cytotoxic drugs.</P>
        <P>The national plan for radiation oncology will be funded under the NDP.  Rapid developments are taking place in terms of diagnostic imaging, which provides a better biological molecular understanding of cancer.  New technologies support better and more accurate diagnoses and, hence, more effective treatments.  Funding will also be made available for these technologies.</P>
        <P>Patients are being referred to the radiation centre at Limerick Regional Hospital.  The operators at Limerick are fully signed up to integrating their service delivery with the radiation oncology department at University College Hospital Galway.  This is an important element of the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s national plan for radiation oncology.</P>
        <P>The service level agreement is being finalised between the HSE and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre Whitfield Clinic in County Waterford.  This will support the referral of public patients for radiation oncology treatment pending <Col N="249"/>the commissioning of the radiation oncology centre at Waterford Regional Hospital as an integral part of the national plan for radiation oncology.  The NDP will also support a new day ward with 20 treatment places at Waterford Regional Hospital.  Planning of this facility is under way and construction is scheduled to commence next year.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to the position at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and the deferral of some cancer operations.  There are significant pressures on intensive care unit and high dependency unit beds.  This is due to a large number of medical emergencies presenting and inpatients whose conditions have deteriorated during treatment.  This has affected the hospital&rsquo;s capacity to carry out some operations on patients who are in need of intensive care nursing after their operations.  Based on an assessment of medical need, some operations needed to be deferred.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that this is an unsatisfactory situation causing patients and their families stress.  The HSE has advised that these patients are given high priority and it is hoped to accommodate them within a week.  The HSE has offered full support to the hospital in terms of assistance to fast-track patients to other settings to free up intensive care unit beds.  ICU capacity at the hospital has been increased by more than 50% in the past three years.  The HSE is in discussion with the hospital with a view to further increasing high dependency capacity at the hospital.</P>
        <P>The developments I and the Minister have outlined are a clear indication of the progress that has been made in addressing the burden of cancer in our community and demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the provision of quality cancer care nationally.</P>

	<P>It is sometimes depressing to stand on this side of the House and listen to the Government justify what it has not done.  In some respects, it is like watching the Government get away with murder.  Some of what has been said tonight reinforces that point.</P>
        <P>In the course of the Minister&rsquo;s speech, she tried to claim success for a gross failure.  She tried to say that her announcement of the appointment of the first board of the national cancer screening service was an achievement.  The board will investigate the development of cervical cancer screening and examine whether to extend BreastCheck nationwide.  It is a gross failure in a Third World country, never mind a country like Ireland.  For the past 30 years, one could cross the Border and avail of cervical cancer screening services.</P>
        <P>Breast screening has been in place there since 1993.  The Minister, while claiming success from failure, said that she has established a board <Col N="250"/>today to look into the development of this policy.  It is similar to the HSE announcement that accident and emergency statistics have improved slightly since last year.  This time last year the crisis in accident and emergency was a national emergency.  Again, however, the HSE and the Minister claim success from failure in their treatment of patients in the health care system.</P>
        <P>In the disgusting and disastrous case of Rosie from Kilkenny, a lady who had a colonoscopy delayed for seven months and was then diagnosed with cancer, she effectively became another victim of the health service, having been given a death sentence as a result of her bowel cancer.  The Minister and the Minister of State&rsquo;s response is that it is regrettable.  It is more than regrettable; what they have done to patients is despicable.</P>
        <P>The next line in the Minister&rsquo;s speech showed the incompetence and lack of regard for what is happening.  She stated that she had been assured by the Health Service Executive that a patient referred to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital for endoscopy and considered urgent will be given an immediate appointment and seen within one to two weeks.  What is urgent?  As far as I am concerned, every patient I send for a significant procedure is urgent.  Will the Minister tell me how to decide when a patient is urgent and when he or she is routine?  That is nonsense.  We cannot define &ldquo;urgent&rdquo;.  We should see every patient in a reasonable timeframe so this sort of nonsense does not happen.</P>
        <P>If the Minister goes to the trouble of looking at these transcripts, I would like to point out that the lady in question was not looking for an endoscopy; she was looking for a colonoscopy.  The Minister does not even know what the patient was supposed to get &mdash; it was a colonoscopy.  Perhaps the Minister might explain to me tomorrow night when she replies when a colonoscopy is not urgent.  We could then make sense of the fact that patients all over the country are having their colonoscopies delayed by up to six months.</P>
        <P>I will explain to the Minister of State what a colonoscopy involves.  If a patient comes to me complaining of weight loss and bleeding from the back passage, it could be piles or it could be a bowel tumour.  I cannot tell if the tumour is significantly high up the bowel &mdash; obviously, I cannot see that far.  That is why we carry out colonoscopies.  Can the Minister tell me when it is not urgent when a patient is bleeding from his or her back passage?  Can she tell me when I can say to the patient that he or she can wait seven months?  I cannot do that and I have been practising medicine for 20 years, but perhaps the Minister has a better idea of these things than me.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that real progress is being made in the implementation of the national plan for radiation oncology.  Is that the radiation oncology plan the Minister, Deputy Martin, published or the plan the Minister performed a U-turn on in July 2005?  Neither of them is going very far.  The Minister, Deputy Martin&rsquo;s plan is gone, after we waited four years for it, while the <Col N="251"/>Minister&rsquo;s plan turned out to be a sham.  There was no policy.  The HSE came out and stated it could not implement it.  The board of the HSE, demonstrating the political interference involved, stated that management was wrong.  It was interesting that the National Finance Development Agency was discussed today because that agency came out and stated that the management was right &mdash; the plan was a sham.  The Government in its arrogance, however, stands over it.  It does not care and says it does not matter.  It is just another person in the litany of patients who are dying after ten years of Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government.  This is the best it can do.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned that four leading international experts have been appointed to validate the population needs assessment, technical specifications, process mapping and other outputs.  Four international experts were not appointed to look into the decision to choose the Mater Hospital for the national children&rsquo;s hospital but that decision will stand for 50 years and cost &euro;500 million.  That is not just disjointed Government but total incompetence and that is how this Administration works.</P>
        <P>I have published two policy papers since becoming Fine Gael spokesperson on health.  The first dealt with primary care screening to cover every area.  It covered blood pressure, because for every person diagnosed with a blood pressure problem, another person is missed.  It covered diabetes, where the same is true.  It covered cholesterol, which has a huge impact on heart disease, and it covered bowel cancer, cervical cancer and breast cancer.  It can be done without establishing another group or commission but the Government does not want to do it.  It comes out with soundbites instead.</P>
        <P>Along with the Labour Party, we announced a patient safety authority.  This policy will not set the world on fire or generate headlines but the consequences of not having such an authority can be seen in the headlines every day &mdash; MRSA, Leas Cross and Rosie in Kilkenny, just one of 40,000 people who stepped forward to say that because the Government is so incompetent, she will die.  The Government just sits there, however, as smug as can be, saying we can wait another year or even until 2011 because it will not do anything in the meantime.  The Government is letting patients die, even before we try to address hospital hygiene.</P>
        <P>I am sick to death of smug Ministers, Deputies Martin, Roche and Cullen, saying on television that the Opposition has no policies.  The Government has no policies.  The Minister&rsquo;s speech referred to the implementation of the national cancer strategy in 1997.  That strategy was published in 1996 by the rainbow Government.  Patients are being treated according to a strategy the last Government drew up.  It is amazing the Government acknowledges that because its national cancer strategy does not have any imple<Col N="252"/>mentation plan.  When it comes to patient safety, the Government ta lks about HIQA.  Already I can see backbenchers getting shaky about it because even they know, although they do not put too much time into the area, that it cannot work and will fall apart.</P>
        <P>The Minister acknowledged that the patient safety authority announced by Fine Gael and the Labour Party was far superior because she set up a commission to look into the plan, although it was not established to implement it.  That shows how bloody useless the Government is when it comes to looking after patients.</P>
        <P>There is even more to it.  Look how screening is working.  What is stopping the Government from making BreastCheck available in the west of Ireland?  Does it have a psychological barrier at the Shannon?  BreastCheck should be national by now, as should cervical cancer screening.  The Government talks rubbish that it will send tests to the United States and try to reduce times to within two weeks if cases are urgent.  When is a smear not urgent?  The Government is great at talking but does not know what it is talking about.  Britain screens its entire population and can have results returned within weeks.</P>
        <P>On a programme about endoscopies, which the Minister should not confuse with colonoscopies, it was stated that the system would try to reduce the waiting time for patients who needed endoscopies from six to four weeks, not six to four months.  The Government, however, thinks it is doing a great job if an urgent endoscopy can be carried out in two weeks when it does not even know what is an urgent endoscopy.  The only colonoscopy I would consider urgent is when the patient is like that poor individual Mr. P. J. Walsh, who was bleeding out of his mouth and had a burst duodenal ulcer.  He could not wait two weeks, he could not even wait two hours.  That is so urgent the operation is needed immediately.</P>
        <P>That is how a health service should work.  It should not work like this, with the spoofing the Minister and Minister of State have come out with tonight.  They are pure wafflers and spoofers who are murdering patients because of their incompetence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I concur with everything Deputy Twomey said.  I would like to concentrate on screening for both breast and cervical cancer, which I have raised on many occasions.  The Government parties have provided an unsatisfactory response to date, although I must welcome the Government&rsquo;s belated examination of the issue.  I acknowledge the Government has taken a number of steps in the right direction, including the announcement of a new board.  However, I question the timing of the announcement and the long delay in addressing this issue.  It is time the Government parties paid more than lip service to cancer screening.</P>
        <P>The Minister reiterated that the Government is committed to rolling out BreastCheck.  I heard <Col N="253"/>the same parties saying they were committed to rolling out the programme before I ever entered politics, and the service is no better than it was years ago.  A Fine Gael Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, initiated the first national cancer strategy in 1996, which, as Deputy Twomey said, the Government parties are working on.  If the strategy had been implemented, as envisaged, both BreastCheck and the cervical screening programme would have been rolled out nationwide by now.</P>
        <P>Women in my constituency can avail of BreastCheck if they fall within the relevant age categories but women in Deputy McGinley&rsquo;s county cannot do so.  My mother-in-law cannot avail of a service to which my mother is entitled.  Who in the HSE or the Government decides that one woman in the age category is more entitled to the service than another women elsewhere in the State?  I would not like to be the bureaucrat or Minister making such callous decisions to exclude a huge proportion of the female population from the programme.</P>
        <P>However, every woman in my constituency is not fortunate in that they cannot avail of the cervical screening programme.  Ireland has one of the highest death rates from this cancer in Europe, with 73 deaths per year.  Such screening must be made available throughout the State and it must form part of a proper national screening programme.  Women are not given the option of a regular smear test unless they pay for it through their general practitioner.  While it is a painless procedure, no woman looks forward to it.  A national campaign is needed to remind women of the need to undergo this test so that they will make the appointment rather than leave it up to those who can afford it to be tested, which is the position outside the mid-west region.  That is totally and utterly unacceptable.</P>
        <P>The international agency for cancer research has estimated that an organised programme of national screening for cervical cancer in Ireland would achieve a reduction of 80% in mortality rates.  That equates to saving 60 lives per year.  I worried when I heard the Minister refer to an affordable model for this programme and she did not spell out what she means by that.  The testing element of the programme is not costly but the treatment of those who are found to have the cancer is much more expensive.  However, the Government places little value on the 60 lives that could be saved annually when it refers to an affordable model for such a programme, otherwise it would have been rolled out nationwide by now.  It is even more frustrating that, while 16 nurses in the midlands have undergone training in this area, they have been waiting for the past two years to participate in the programme and have not been given the authority by the Government to do so.</P>
        <P>Reference was made by a number of Government speakers to the importance of diet in cancer prevention.  However, I ask them to ask the Minister for Education and Science why schools being <Col N="254"/>built under the PPP programme are being allowed to install Coca-Cola and Mars bar vending machines.  Whether the principal wants these machines, the schools are allowed to bring them in.  If the Government is serious about this, it needs to engage in joined-up thinking.  There is no point in one Minister saying one thing while another puts something entirely different into practice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this important, burning and emotive debate on the lack of cancer services in my constituency.  The people of Donegal and the entire north west know better than most the glaring inadequacy of health services under this Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government and nowhere more so than where cancer services are concerned.  The exposure of the Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s national plan for radiation oncology as a sham, which cannot be delivered as promised, cut all the deeper in Donegal where cancer patients have suffered from wholesale Government neglect.  That plan, for example, which was announced with much fanfare, neglected to include the north west in any meaningful way.  If one draws a line between Galway and Dublin, one can see that the Government has made no commitment to provide a radiation unit north of that line.  </P>
        <P>Cancer patients do not have time.  Whether in the context of detection or treatment, time is of the essence when it comes to the impact on patients&rsquo; quality of life, suffering or survival.  Women in Donegal and the north west, in general still await the roll-out of BreastCheck screening services, which are absolutely vital to the early detection and successful treatment of breast cancer.  As a result, Donegal women are being denied their best chance to avoid the trauma of radical surgery.  By the same token, the absence of a national cervical screening programme, 11 years after it was announced, is denying women all over the country access to screening, which should be their right.</P>
        <P>According to the National Cancer Registry, in County Donegal between 1994 and 1999 the annual number of female breast cancer cases was 53, with an annual death rate of 18, that is, one in three.  On average, 1,600 new cases of breast cancer are discovered each year and between 1994 and 2000 breast cancer was the most common cause of cancer death in women.  Cancer survival in Ireland is close to the European average for the common cancers, with the exception of breast and lung cancer, for which survival is well below the average.</P>
        <P>Donegal cancer patients, once they have been given that dreadful diagnosis, are then faced with the absence of radiotherapy services in the north west and they must endure arduous journeys for treatment in other parts of the country.  This has led to women in Donegal choosing &mdash; if one could call it a choice &mdash; traumatic surgery rather than undergo the grind of the travel and the days and <Col N="255"/>weeks away from their homes.  According to the Cancer Care Alliance, the uptake of radiotherapy for patients in the north-western area is below the national average which means that many Donegal patients will lose their battle with cancer because of the lack of services in their area.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s solution of sending Donegal patients to Belfast for treatment represents no progress for many cancer patients in the county for whom a journey to Belfast is as long and arduous as a trip to Dublin.  It is absolutely vital that we have radiotherapy services in the north west.  Fine Gael has committed to the delivery of regional cancer treatment services to those who desperately need them in locations based on population needs and proper long-term planning.  It is clear that the north west has the critical mass to justify a radiotherapy centre and the Government&rsquo;s refusal to reconsider a radiation oncology solution for the area is a most hurtful blow to the people of Donegal.</P>
        <P>While there have been positive indications regarding the appointment of a permanent breast surgeon in Letterkenny General Hospital, the retention and improvement of cancer services there is an absolute must.  There is no doubt that with all the waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money, the arrogant attitude of those too long in power and the incompetent handling of vital public services, the delivery of health services is the greatest failure of the Government.  This is a particularly tragic failure where cancer patients are concerned.</P>
        <P>Thanks to the ongoing neglect of the north west, these realities are all the harsher for patients in Donegal.  Fine Gael and Labour have combined to put forward new proposals that will make a difference to these patients, including the provision of 2,300 new hospital beds around the country, 1,500 convalescent, rehabilitation and long-stay community beds and 1,500 new consultants.  It is only by implementing the policies of the alternative Government, which will increase capacity as well as reforming the way that hospitals and doctors work, that patients can hope to receive appropriate health services.</P>
        <P>This is a burning issue in Donegal.  We have been ignored by the Government and its predecessor.  Prominent Government Members who served as Ministers for Health and Children for many years, such as the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, all ignored the needs of the north west.  People have taken to the streets and are demanding action but we have not yet seen any response from this Government.  Commitments have been made from this side of the House by Deputy Twomey when he visited Letterkenny on one of his first missions after being appointed health spokesman but we are still awaiting a commitment from the Government.  The patience of the people of Donegal is wearing thin.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address an important issue which is having a huge impact on the lives of driftnet fishermen in County Waterford.  The compensation currently being offered to salmon fishermen in the county is a joke.  The driftnet ban is causing severe injustice and this must not be repeated when the time comes to allocate funds to enable fishermen to establish alternative enterprises.  Waterford fishermen make a very strong case that the hardship fund payments should be the same for all licences surrendered with account taken of the years of service of the fisherman surrendering the licence, along the lines of redundancy payments in industry.</P>
        <P>The compensation scheme seriously discriminates against Waterford salmon fishermen and their colleagues in the surrounding areas of the south-east region.  In the Waterford district of the southern fisheries region, the number of driftnet licences in 2005 was 171, with an average catch per licence of 55 salmon.  In the Lismore district, the number with driftnet licences in the same year was 81 and the average catch was 125 salmon.  In contrast, the average catches per licence in Kerry, Mayo and Sligo were 562, 511 and 478, respectively.</P>
        <P>As the migratory path of salmon comes down the western coast, around the south-west corner of Ireland and along the south coast, the salmon returning to rivers in Waterford run the hazard of the driftnet fisheries from County Donegal before returning to their rivers of origin.  In addition, even though fishermen were given an undertaking that the information they provided regarding their catches to facilitate the quota and tagging system would not be used against them, this is not the case.</P>
        <P>Driftnet salmon fishermen are being offered &euro;2,020 for voluntarily surrendering their licences, with a payment from the &euro;25 million hardship fund based on six times their annual catch of salmon for the five years to 2005, multiplied by &euro;23.  They must then verifiably decommission their nets and their boat, technically known as fixed engines, to the satisfaction of the competent authority.  Given that a basic set of nets and fittings costs in the region of &euro;2,500, the compensation for the voluntary surrender of a driftnet salmon fishing licence is less than the value of the equipment which must be decommissioned.  Surely the fishermen must be at least compensated for verifiably decommissioning their nets and boats.  The hardship fund payments should be the same for each licence surrendered with the length of fishing service considered.</P>
        <P>I am calling for the entire question of compensation to be revisited and for realistic payments for those in the Waterford constituency who are <Col N="257"/>being forced to give up an income and a traditional way of life for a pittance.  I am also determined that a fair share of the &euro;5 million fund for the development of new enterprises by the salmon fishermen will go to those who are badly affected by the ban in Waterford and not to those who are part of the strong lobby in the west or to large processing co-operatives which have access to other funding through Bord Iascaigh Mhara or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>The position of the Suir and Nore snap net fishermen who hold 132 licences should also be reviewed.  These fishermen believe the cessation of this ancient method of fishing will cause a deterioration in their beats and that a heritage type of licence should be maintained to assist in stock assessments, counting fish and other research assignments.  The salmon fishermen have repeatedly made the point that there are no fish counters in the Barrow, Nore, Suir or Munster Blackwater.  Such technology is urgently needed to compile exact numbers of fish returning to these rivers because, without counters, it is impossible to know if and when the conservation limit is reached.</P>
        <P>The fishermen believe that for the present, the sale of rod-caught salmon should not be re-introduced and that the issue should be revisited once all rivers meet their conservation limit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, regrets he cannot be in the House to deal with this matter.  I believe he is meeting fishermen.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s strongly held view that our wild salmon stock is a national asset which must be conserved and protected, as well as being exploited as a resource by us all on a sustainable basis.  If we do not take action now, the relentless decline in stocks will continue, leading to the inevitable demise of the wild salmon we value as a cultural, recreational and economic resource.  International best practice for the management of North Atlantic salmon requires the adoption of the precautionary approach and the cessation of indiscriminate mixed stock fisheries.  As Members are aware, the Government&rsquo;s primary motivation in its decision to align future management of the wild salmon fishery with the scientific advice and introduce the appropriate regulations to cease mixed stock fishing is the conservation of the wild salmon species, which has long been regarded as one of Ireland&rsquo;s most prized fish.  It is vital to afford every protection to the remaining salmon stocks and to clearly prioritise conservation over catch.  The current imperative is to maintain stocks above conservation limits or, at the very least, halt the observed decline.</P>
        <P>In future, the wild salmon fishery will be managed on the basis of individual river stocks.  Harvesting of salmon will be restricted to rivers which have been identified as meeting their con<Col N="258"/>servation limit in compliance with Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and wild flora and fauna, the habitats directive.</P>
        <P>The hardship fund adopted by the Government is aimed at alleviating hardship related to loss of income derived from salmon harvesting in recent years caused by the cessation of mixed stock fishing in the interest of conservation.  The approach adopted to determining the hardship payments is based on the recommendations of an independent group which the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, appointed to examine the implications of alignment with the scientific advice for the commercial salmon fishing sector in 2007 and beyond.  In its report, the group noted that the level of hardship likely to be experienced would vary both in extent and scale.  Taking all factors into account and noting in particular there is no legal obligation on the State to provide compensation in a situation where it is imposing management measures that are fundamentally in the public good, it proposed to provide a measure of relief to each individual in line with the level of hardship likely to be experienced and recommended that relief should be based on the recent catch history of the individual licence holder from 2001 to 2005.</P>
        <P>The Government accepted the recommendation of the independent group and has determined that the level of payment should be based on the average net income per salmon in the commercial fishery for the five years from 2001 to 2005.  This income calculation was based by the group on the average price obtained per fish each year less the costs incurred by fishermen.  Each individual licence holder who applies to the fund is set to receive six times his or her average catch multiplied by the average net income per salmon.  An additional payment equal to six times the current licence fee will be made in all cases.  The Minister of State and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, believe this is a fair and reasonable allocation based on a robust and convincing assessment by the group.</P>
        <P>The terms are applied to driftnet fishermen in the Waterford estuary in the same way as to all other driftnet fishermen.  In future, the harvest of salmon by any means will be restricted to those stocks of rivers which meet their conservation limits.  This means there will be no indiscriminate capture of fish.  Commercial fishing and recreational angling can continue only on the scientifically identified exploitable surplus.</P>
        <P>The standing scientific committee of the National Salmon Management Commission has advised that stocks of salmon in the rivers Barrow, Nore and Suir are below conservation limits.  For this reason, no killing of salmon by any method in the River Barrow is permitted during the 2007 season.  Angling on a catch-and-release basis only is permitted on the waters of the Nore and Suir.  This reflects the relative status of the stocks of the rivers.  The regional fisheries boards <Col N="259"/>and the Marine Institute will monitor the stocks in developing a management plan for each of the rivers with a view to identifying the extent of the recovery, if any, arising from the cessation of the mixed stock commercial fishery and any stock rehabilitation works undertaken.  The application of the by-laws will be kept under constant review.  In the event that stocks recover in the rivers of the Waterford Estuary in the future, it should be possible to exploit the identified surplus within the constraints permitted by the habitats directive as transposed by the European Communities (National Habitats) Regulations 1997, SI 94 of 1997.</P>

      <sTitle>Job Losses.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The news of the likely closure of the Motorola plant with the loss of more than 300 jobs will represent an economic body blow to the Cork area.  These are not old-style jobs in heavy industry, but jobs based in the knowledge economy.  During his visit to Cork last week with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Taoiseach lauded the knowledge economy as the cornerstone of the new Ireland.  The knowledge economy is an area that has contributed very significantly to Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth over the past 15 years.  This is part of an increasing pattern we have seen in the Cork area, with companies like this choosing to relocate to Asia or other regions where labour and other costs are lower.  There are very few companies of similar size and skill requirements in Cork and it is likely that those who are about to lose their jobs will need to move elsewhere to look for jobs of a similar nature.  This will worsen the economic consequences of the loss of such a plant.</P>
        <P>The real tragedy is that I understand the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, had warnings since the beginning of the year from a number of sources that the plant was in jeopardy, but he appears to have done nothing.  It would appear that Motorola decided to put all its work out to tender and its plants around the world tendered for different projects.  It would appear that the project work being done by Motorola in Cork will go to Malaysia.  The company in Malaysia put together a package which included incentives, labour costs, tax and all the other things we normally offer and it won out.</P>
        <P>The Minister was told from an early date that the plant had a difficulty.  Although he was contacted on several occasions by employees and other outside interested agencies, he did nothing.  He did the usual, replying that the query would be dealt with.  However, it was not dealt with.  Nobody approached Motorola to ask how we could put together a package to ensure that Motorola stayed in Cork and save these jobs.  There is now a severe threat to these jobs.  These people with highly skilled high-tech jobs will move on.  Dublin is the centre for high-tech jobs <Col N="260"/>in Ireland and we will not be able to keep these people in Cork, which has nothing to keep them there.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to take immediate action in response to this news.  I hope it is not too late.  The Minister should have done something much sooner.  He must be pro-active in ensuring that job losses are kept to an absolute minimum.  He should have taken action at the start of January.  It emerged in recent days that the company, as part of a consortium, was awarded preferred bidder status for a massive &euro;250 million Government contract.  The contract relates to the construction of a secure national digital radio network to be used by the Garda and other emergency services, which is urgently needed.  The timing of that announcement was of no help to the company.  If it ultimately gets the contract I wonder where these items will now be manufactured.</P>
        <P>I would like to read into the record a letter sent to the Minister on 4 January which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">I was wondering if you are aware that Motorola Ireland, in Cork is on the verge of closing down?  [The employees have told me that] they do not have any projects to work on for the last few months.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Most of their existing work has been transferred to Motorola units in Asia and it is common perception amongst the employees that complete closure will be announced within the next month.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">As you know, Motorola is one of the largest private sector employers in Cork, particularly in the IT sector.  Most people who were laid off in the jobs cuts in Motorola Ireland last year have not found jobs in Cork and have had to move to Dublin, because most IT jobs in Ireland are in Dublin.  Consequently, the closure of Motorola would be a devastating blow to Cork, not just for the jobs themselves, but also about the sustainability of Cork as a centre for IT development.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">In light of the above facts, I would like to know what steps the Minister is taking to prevent the closure of Motorola.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is what we want to know tonight.  What steps did the Minister take?  It would appear that he took none because the letter received the standard reply stating:</P>
        <P LI="1">I wish to acknowledge receipt of your recent letter to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mr. Miche&aacute;l Martin TD, regarding your concerns over the possible closure of Motorola Ireland Cork.  I will bring your correspondence to the Minister&rsquo;s attention at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Following this correspondence, there were numerous phone calls, letters and e-mails.  There was no response from the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will be aware that the Motorola factory is sited in our shared constitu<Col N="261"/>ency.  However, its 350 workers come from all the Cork city and county constituencies and hence the interest of two other Cork colleagues this evening.  I would still argue that the effect will be greatest in our constituency.  More of the workers come from Cork South-Central and should the Motorola company cease activities the knock-on effect on service industries will be most felt there.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s comments in the local media have not assuaged fears.  Perhaps he is being realistic in his assessment.  We need to know what was known when and what the reality of the situation is.  I fear that we could be engaged &mdash; I am not sure on whose behalf &mdash; in a cruel act of news management.  What is a 30-day consultation period and why is it that just today another company, Thomson Scientific and Healthcare in Limerick, has chosen to go down exactly the same route?  Is this the new way to make job announcements?  It gives the prospect of jobs being lost and perhaps, at the most positive, scaling back some of those losses or delaying the eventual decision by a number of weeks.  If this is the case it is the cruellest of decision-making methods.</P>
        <P>The Government seems to be in thrall to the globalised world.  This week&rsquo;s Central Bank quarterly report shows that the proportion of our economy based on manufacturing industry is dwindling.  The figures do not lie.  More of our economic activity is in services and less is in manufacturing industry.  What is the Government&rsquo;s response?  Does it have a strategy to protect and enhance manufacturing industry?  We have had a number of reports about developing indigenous industry but we have yet to see the effect of any such jobs coming on stream and becoming a more vibrant element of the economy.</P>
        <P>We need to ask questions about manufacturing industry.  We had the recent announcement of the FCI jobs in Fermoy.  That operation involved a manufacturing process, albeit at a different level.  Even in the industrial estate where Motorola is located, in recent years another large manufacturer, Bourns Electronics, closed.  These are warning signs.  That these are all located in the Cork area is of greater concern to those of us representing the area.  As the Minister responsible, Deputy Martin has a particular responsibility to address the fears that exist and give some assurance that this is not the beginning of a different future industrial environment in the Cork area.  We need an appropriate industrial mix in the Cork area.  If the IT and electronic sectors suffer, other factories and companies may have questions about their future.  We should hear about this in media reports and prepare ourselves for impending decisions in three to four weeks&rsquo; time.  There should be a wide-ranging analysis of manufacturing industry and the Government&rsquo;s policy on that, particularly in the electronics and IT sectors and particularly in the Cork area.</P>
        <P>In a different economic climate a State agency existed to pre-empt firms or industries at risk and decide whether measures could be taken to pro<Col N="262"/>tect them.  Maybe under EU rules that has changed and the Government cannot put capital directly into such companies.  We should, however, consider establishing a State agency to do the type of work that Foras Forbartha Teoranta used to do, especially because of the job displacement in this field.  It could examine whether there are dangers coming down the track and whether we can protect or enhance these industries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is not asking those questions.  It is taking too much of a hands in the air attitude given the number of jobs in this industry that are affected in the Cork region.  More jobs are affected in the add-on industries which support and service these companies.  I urge the Minister to use the opportunity of the longer than usual contribution he will make on this Adjournment debate to address these questions and at least offer some immediate hope for the future of the workers in Motorola and for the future of manufacturing industry in the Cork area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the other Deputies I am very concerned by the recent announcement of the loss of 350 jobs at Motorola.  It is a terrible loss for Cork city and county which have spent many years building up a high-tech jobs base.  I extend my sympathies to the staff members who have been affected and their families who face a bleak future.  Even at this late stage every effort must be made to safeguard these positions because the future of the plant could be jeopardised if so many staff are laid off.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the predicament of Motorola in Cork demonstrates how much Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has suffered under this Government.  It is particularly worrying for Cork, given that this area has invested so much in attracting high end technology jobs.  Since this Government came into power it has imposed at least 40 stealth taxes and charges on businesses and consumers.  By comparison with the United Kingdom, electricity costs are 50% higher, insurance 20%, landfill costs 350% and broadband approximately 10% higher.  Inflation reached a dangerous level at 4.9% in January and is set to climb.  Exports are becoming more expensive as a result of the rising cost of doing business here and because of cut-price competition from overseas.</P>
        <P>That these Motorola jobs are under threat raises serious questions about the Government&rsquo;s economic strategy because these are precisely the type of high end job that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats want to attract into Ireland.  If Motorola finds it too expensive to do business here, many other companies are sure to feel the same.</P>
        <P>I listened with disbelief yesterday morning, Tuesday, 30 January, to the Neil Prenderville Show on Cork&rsquo;s 96FM when the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, said that no one expected the announcement of an immediate closure or that Motorola was considering closure because people felt there <Col N="263"/>would be a window of opportunity to move into other areas.  When the Minister was asked if the company had notified him he said not and that he had spoken to John Phillips the previous morning and that IDA Ireland would have been contacted the previous morning.</P>
        <P>Like Deputy Lynch, I have a copy of a letter sent to the Minister on 4 January.  The spin yesterday set out to give the impression that the Government first heard about this in recent days when a response issued to the letter of 4 January, signed by the Minister&rsquo;s private secretary, acknowledging receipt of the letter and stating that it would be brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  I hope the Minister does not use the same defence in this case as he used in respect of the nursing home debacle and say it was not brought to his attention.  It is incredible that if the Minister was made aware of this on 4 or 5 January, he was in the Middle East, admittedly on a bona fide mission, trying to attract business while Motorola was going down the tubes.  The Minister must address the issues raised by the letter sent to him and other communications sent to his Department by senior staff in Motorola.</P>
        <P>Why was there no response to these people who in good faith sought the Minister&rsquo;s help to save the company?  Was Motorola contacted about the contents of these letters?  What steps did the Minister&rsquo;s office take to prevent the announcement of the closure?  We need the answers tonight.  Most important of all, the Minister should state how he proposes to salvage the company even at this late stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad that this matter has been raised on the Adjournment.  Like every other Deputy and person in Cork, I was very concerned and disappointed to hear about the situation in Motorola.  The company, which employs 330 people, informed its employees on 29 January 2006 of its intention to enter an employee consultation process regarding the future of the Cork site.  The company is considering a proposal to cease all engineering functions carried out at the site.  If this proposal is confirmed, it would result in most employees at the site being at risk of redundancy and could make the business unsustainable in the future.  The company fully intends to carry out the consultation process with the highest possible level of consideration for all of its employees in Cork.  I understand that the company does not intend to comment further in regard to the situation until the consultation process is completed.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s point, the methodology by which a company announces its decisions is entirely a matter for the company.  Neither I nor IDA Ireland has any role in that process.  I ask the Deputy to accept that.  Let us have a constructive debate on this issue.  While I am not suggesting that Deputy Boyle is playing politics with jobs, we can do that too.  The <Col N="264"/>immediate concern here tonight is the workers at Motorola, not political point-scoring, of which we have had evidence.  Other companies have announced their decisions in different ways in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Two companies have done it in exactly the same way.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Other companies did it differently in the past 12 months.  Deputy Boyle must accept that.</P>
        <P>The key reason behind the proposal is that, as part of the company&rsquo;s worldwide reorganisation, the workforce is to be reduced by 3,500 globally.  I was in ongoing discussions with the company before January.  IDA Ireland is in constant negotiations with a range of companies, including Motorola.  We have been in contact with it here, in Cork and in the United States.  When I talk about a window of opportunity, it was known that there had been some staff reductions in Motorola.  Everyone knew there were difficulties at the plant.  No one knew that it was intended to close everything at the plant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>It was in black and white on 4 January. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>IDA Ireland and the Government work with senior management in companies.  We liaise and discuss with them.  I was in discussion with senior management at this company before this debate.  The last quarter results from Motorola were poor.  It did not reach its targets.  The idea that a Minister in Ireland is responsible for Motorola&rsquo;s difficult international performance is a crazy notion.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

       <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has tried to skew the debate into a personality issue.  The bottom line is that Motorola has had international difficulties with some products and the Cork plant operates in a technological area that has created difficulties in that it has reached its plateau in generating revenue.  We and the company were hoping that we could get other activities and projects into the plant to diversify, much as Apple did ten years ago.  That depends on getting mandates from corporate headquarters.  That is how the system works.  It is not that everyone sits around hoping companies close.  There is no wish to do that.  I respectfully suggest to Deputies Allen and Lynch that I am as committed to sustaining jobs in Cork as anyone else in this House.  It is somewhat farcical for people to suggest otherwise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with that issue later.</P>
        <P>As regards job losses announced in companies in County Cork, I assure the people concerned that State agencies will provide every assistance possible.  The priority will be to find an acceptable outcome for all those involved at the earliest opportunity.  I do not accept Deputy Lynch&rsquo;s fatalistic view that everyone will be obliged to leave Cork because of what has happened.  We will be working to secure alternative employment for people within Cork, if possible.</P>

	<P>The role of F&Aacute;S, the industrial training agency, is of particular importance in providing assistance.  The agency&rsquo;s full range of services is made available to the companies generally when redundancies occur.</P>
        <P>In the context of Motorola, I have asked F&Aacute;S, IDA and Enterprise Ireland to engage with the company with a view to supporting, in every possible way, the workers at the plant.  That will be the focus of our attention in the context of working with the employees.  I have been in constant contact with local management in that regard.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that Ireland&rsquo;s strengths and competitive advantages have changed in the past decade&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Minister not respond to the letters?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;and our economy is now characterised by high output and productivity, together with high returns to labour in the form of wages, salaries and better living standards.  Low technology production, which dominated our economic output in the past, is, as Deputy Boyle outlined, being replaced by higher technology and services enterprises.  Contrary to what has been said, Irish manufacturing has performed quite strongly.  Central Statistics Office, CSO, data indicate that manufacturing production, by volume, increased by 28% overall between 2000 and 2005.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the number of jobs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Boyle is aware, the number of jobs is not the only yardstick used in this regard.  The coming into play of proper efficiencies provide longer sustainability and a better opportunity to retain plants.  The latest CSO release on industrial employment in December indicates that employment in manufacturing increased by some 4,000 in the 12 months to September 2006.</P>
        <P>I accept that this is no consolation to the workers at Motorola.  Deputies Boyle and Allen raised issues relating to strategic policy, etc.  It is important that we do not write Ireland off on foot of a series of announcements made in a particular <Col N="266"/>week or two.  A sentiment tends to be articulated that the world is going to collapse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>So it is our fault now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is writing Ireland off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the Government&rsquo;s main tasks is to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain.  In that regard, we continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions and to promote new areas of competitive advantage, such as by developing our research and development base.  We have clear strategies in place to try to deal with the vagaries of a globalised economy.  We are not, as Deputy Boyle suggested, in thrall to that economy.  It is a fact and a reality with which we must deal and it makes matters far more competitive.  We must change and develop our strengths in areas such as research and development, upskilling &mdash; we are investing heavily in this regard &mdash; and working with companies.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies also aim to support sustainable, high value added enterprise in Ireland through the provision of mentoring and developmental supports, the enhancement of management capabilities and critical workforce skills in client companies, support for the creation and implementation of strategies for market entry, development and growth and strong supports for innovation, research and development.  The manufacturing sector will continue to be a significant contributor to exports, employment and economic growth in 2007 and beyond.</P>
        <P>In the past five or six years, more than 440,000 jobs were created in services and 150,000 in high-end manufacturing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the 350 jobs in question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There has, in effect, been a significant turnaround in the nature of employment in Ireland.  As we have seen in the past 15 years, long-term, sustainable economic growth and expansion in employment depend on a competitive and adaptable economy.  For some time, the Government has recognised the inevitable changes taking place across world markets for both trade and investment.  Enterprise policies that equip companies with the ability to better compete in world markets, capture the opportunities arising from globalisation and build competitive advantage in innovation and knowledge have been central to policy development and the impact of these policies is tangible.</P>
        <P>The impact of globalisation on Ireland must be put in perspective.  In the past eight years we have added over 523,000 people to our workforce, an unprecedented growth of 35%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s strategy to create employment in Cork is to progress the development of a knowledge economy so that the city can compete nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment.  The agency is also working with its existing client base to expand their presence in Cork as well as providing modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure in the area.  New investment announcements in the region made in the past year include those relating to Eli Lilly, PepsiCo, GlaxoSmithKline, Trend Micro, Netgear, Amazon, Citco and Amgen, which will result in over 2,300 new jobs at full operation in Cork.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are jobs for the future.  They will not become available until many years from now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>No, some of them have already become available.  Citco will create 250 new financial services jobs, while the recent announcement by Amgen, the largest biotechnology company in the world, has decided to locate in Cork and to create 1,100 jobs there.  IDA Ireland and I worked hard to secure the latter, which is a good development for Cork and its people.  It is important to recognise that fact.  Amazon, another major company, has established a new multilingual customer services centre in Cork and this investment will create up to 450 positions.  In addition, there were also significant job announcements for Cork in the years prior to 2006.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is also working with its client companies in Cork in the context of increasing the number of jobs on offer and it invested almost &euro;9 million in those companies last year.  This investment will support new business employment, as well as research and development, capital investment and staff training in Irish-owned companies.</P>
        <P>The State development agencies will continue to strengthen their marketing and promotion efforts to secure alternative employment for Cork city and county.  This will be done in partnership with other key players to maximise the flow of potential investors to the region and to convert these into new investment and job opportunities.  The policies we are pursuing in the Cork region are bearing fruit.</P>

	<P>I would prefer to work with companies in Cork in expanding their portfolios.  We meet many of them even when they do not have announcements coming down the tracks.  We also work in bringing new companies into the area.  IDA Ireland does a very good job in this.  If results turn out poorly for companies, as they unfortunately did for Motorola, jobs will be cut.  Motorola has cut 3,500 jobs globally.  It is not a practice I would agree with but it tends to be the route certain companies take when the headcount or profit margins are wrong or when targets suggested to the markets are not reached.  Motorola did miss targets for some of its key products during the Christmas.</P>

        <P>Motorola, like any other company, was entitled to tender for the Garda TETRA project.  We <Col N="271"/>cannot get involved in that process for obvious reasons.  If opportunities arise from that, we will seek to exploit them.  It will, however, be different from what was in play.  It is unfortunate that the additional mandates that went to others did not go to Motorola&rsquo;s Cork facility.  The greater the range of a company&rsquo;s activities, the better the chances of sustaining a reasonable degree of employment in it.  That was a factor in this case, as well as Motorola&rsquo;s recent poor global performance.</P>

        <Quest> if he plans to publish corporate manslaughter legislation in view of the high level of workplace deaths here and the fact that his Department felt it would be inappropriate to deal with the issue of corporate killing in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of corporate manslaughter was considered at the time of the drafting of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill, which ultimately became the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005.  The Attorney General was of the opinion that there were much broader issues than safety, health and welfare at work which needed to be considered.  Legislating in the relatively confined area of occupational safety and health would have omitted other sectors where such an offence could be committed. Therefore it was decided that it was not appropriate to deal with the issue of corporate killing in legislation which was providing for the law and regulation of occupational safety, health and welfare. </P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission issued a Report on Corporate Killing in October 2005 and it accepted the view of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office that the scope of the 2005 Act was nar<Col N="274"/>rower than the proposed offence recommended in its Report.</P>
        <P>Consideration of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s Report and recommendations are a matter for the Minister for Justice and Law Reform in the context of his main responsibilities for the criminal law system.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the recent price war on alcohol over recent months; if there was consideration given to excluding alcohol products from the ban on below cost selling of grocery goods; and his views on whether the widespread availability of cheap alcohol will encourage further alcohol abuse. </Quest>
        <QRef>[2720/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of alcohol and below cost selling was dealt with in my Department&rsquo;s November 2005 Report on the Groceries Order.  The Groceries Order was not designed to tackle the issue of alcohol abuse and there is no evidence to suggest that it was capable of doing so. The Department&rsquo;s Report concluded that the Order was a highly inappropriate and disproportionate mechanism by which to seek to control alcohol consumption. </P>
        <P>The question of alcohol abuse is an important issue but one which must be addressed within its correct context.  It raises broad issues of societal behaviour.  However, the type of measure imposed by the Groceries Order is not, and never was, an effective, appropriate or proportionate means of promoting responsible consumption of alcohol.  It did not address the issue of below cost selling at all &mdash; its benchmark was the invoice price.  It did not prevent suppliers from funding cheaper alcohol; it only imposed this restriction on retailers.  Neither did it prevent discounters <Col N="275"/>from selling cheap alcohol.  Indeed, &ldquo;price war&rdquo; prices are probably higher than the prices charged by the discounters for cheaper alcohol products &mdash; the point being that low prices are available to those consumers who require them.</P>
        <P>I fully support the policy objective of promoting responsible consumption of alcohol and tackling the issue of alcohol abuse. If any policy grounds for limiting price competition on alcohol exist, they exist in the context of health, cultural or law and order policies.  A case for regulating price based alcohol promotions should be made to the relevant Minister or Department who would then need to find a statutory power to achieve this objective.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has been party to the European Patent Convention since 1992 and our law reflects its Article 52 criteria on the patentability of inventions. The Convention makes it clear that computer programs &ldquo;as such&rdquo; cannot be patented but it is important to note that this does not extend to so-called &lsquo;computer implemented inventions&rsquo;. These may be patentable under certain conditions and many thousands of such patents have already been granted by the European Patent Office and the national patent offices within the EU.</P>
        <P>However, the application of the case law and the administrative practice of Member States in this area is divergent.  As a result, it is currently possible to patent a particular computer implemented invention in one Member State and not in another, with negative consequences for the efficient functioning of the Internal Market.  For this reason, the Commission brought forward, in 2002, a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, the aim of which was to rectify this situation and to make the conditions for patentability more transparent &mdash; to give innovators and enterprises the ability to compete effectively in the single market.</P>
        <P>Ireland supported the proposal as offering increased certainty on intellectual property rights protection and as reinforcing the single EU internal market.  While the measure had wide support from the European ICT industry, including many within the SME sector, it was opposed by non-proprietary software interests. Ultimately, the European Parliament rejected the proposed <Col N="276"/>directive in July 2005.  After this rejection, the European Commission indicated that it would not be bringing forward a further proposal in this area.</P>

	<P>The most recent full year trade figures published by the Central Statistics Office show that the value of Irish merchandise exports for 2005 increased by 5% compared to 2004 and this followed a 3% rise the previous year.  This increase of 5% in 2005 continues the upward trend in the value of exports, which, with the exception of the global economic slowdown which occurred around 2002, has been a feature of our export performance since the early 1990s.  I am heartened by this continuous improvement in exports, against a difficult background of ongoing low growth rates in the US and the major European economies, in recent years. Figures for the full year 2006 are not yet available but for the 11 months to November, total exports are showing an increase of almost 3% over the same period in 2005, so the solid growth of recent years is being maintained.</P>
        <P>The Irish Government is strongly supportive of Irish exporting firms working to increase their level of exports on world markets.  My Department, through its agency, Enterprise Ireland, is active both nationally at the developmental level and, through promotional activities carried out from a range of locations abroad, in assisting Irish indigenous companies to find new markets for their products and to increase their existing level of market share.  Through its network of 33 international offices, Enterprise Ireland create and implement successful strategies for market entry, development and growth in overseas markets.  The activities of this network include&mdash;</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">In this work, close coordination is maintained with other export promotion organizations, such as An Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and non-governmental bodies such as the Irish Exporters Association. Enterprise Ireland is also assisted by our Irish Embassies abroad, in facilitating the development of export markets for Irish exporting companies. In addition, both myself and my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mich&eacute;al Martin, T.D., have been active in leading trade missions in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and we will continue to do so, to both existing long-established markets, to the new EU member states and also to Asia, with a view to increasing the share of exports by Irish companies worldwide.  Last year, we led a total of 24 Trade Missions to various countries.  Already this year, Minister Martin, accompanied the Taoiseach and other Government Ministers on the recent trade Mission to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. A total of 114 companies participated in that mission and it is estimated that contracts to the value of &euro;65 million will result.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Enterprise policy over the past number of years has been very successful in achieving a decoupling of growth in emissions from economic growth.  The review of the National Climate Change Strategy which was published by my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government last July, shows that emissions per unit of GDP in 2004 were 48% of what they were in 1990.  In fact, while GDP grew by 155% between 1990 and 2004, emissions in the industry, commercial and services sector grew by only 13%.  This achievement in curbing emissions growth in the industry sector is quite impressive when we take into account the fact that industrial production increased by 330% over the same period.  Moreover, the growth in emissions in the industry, commercial and services sector, at 13%, is significantly lower than the national growth in emissions of 23% over the same period.</P>
        <P>However, despite the success which has been achieved in curbing emissions in the enterprise sector, my Department is fully conscious of the need to continually engage in initiatives to ensure <Col N="278"/>that the enterprise sector will be able to meet its Kyoto commitments. In this regard, my Department published a Sustainable Development Strategy in 2003, one of the four key goals of which was aimed at ensuring that appropriate mechanisms were established to assist the enterprise sector in meeting its obligations under the National Climate Change Strategy.  It has transpired that the most important mechanism which has been developed in this regard is the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.</P>
        <P>The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is now regarded as one of the key measures in Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to meet its Kyoto target.  It is also regarded as a flagship policy at EU level to combat the threat of climate change. The Scheme has been operating on a three year pilot basis since 2005.  The second phase of the Scheme will cover the Kyoto commitment period of 2008-2012.  It operates on a &ldquo;cap and trade&rdquo; basis, whereby emission caps are set for each of the installations covered by the Scheme.  If an installation exceeds its cap, it must buy allowances.  Similarly, if an installation manages to reduce its emissions to a level below its cap, it can sell allowances.  The Scheme thus provides a strong financial incentive for firms to reduce their emissions by investing in more efficient technology or changing their processes.</P>
        <P>The Emissions Trading Scheme applies to more than 100 installations in the Energy and Industry sectors in Ireland, encompassing the most significant emitters of  CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>.  Its importance as a mechanism for reducing emissions in the industry sector arises from the fact that 100% of process emissions and approximately 80% of combustion related emissions from manufacturing industry come within its scope.  The level of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>  that each installation is permitted to emit is set out in a National Allocation Plan which must be approved by the European Commission.  As already stated, if any installation exceeds that cap, that installation will have to buy allowances.  Consequently, a very effective mechanism is now in place to ensure that the industry and energy sectors of the economy will make a very significant contribution towards meeting Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto commitment.</P>
        <P>Apart from the Emissions Trading arrangements, Enterprise Ireland offers a set of dedicated supports to companies aimed at increasing awareness of, and promoting, eco efficiency in their operations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>23,684 actual redundancies were notified to my Department in 2006.</P>
        <P>Over the last number of years there has been a significant churn in employment. Some traditional low-cost industries throughout the country are under pressure and are closing. Other sectors, especially the services sector, are providing significant new employment opportunities. Since 1997, over half a million new jobs were created in Ireland and the number in employment now exceeds 2 million. The unemployment rate is 4.5%, which is the second lowest in the EU, and is considered to be virtually full employment.</P>
        <P>In the last 12 months alone, almost 26,000 new permanent full time jobs were created in firms supported by the enterprise development agencies. Despite increasing global competitive pressures, the latest Quarterly National Household Survey (Quarter 3 2006) from the CSO also shows an increase of 83,500 in employment compared to the corresponding period in 2005. Furthermore, this increase is spread across all sectors of the economy.</P>
        <P>While the changing nature of our economy has seen some losses, in contrast, the new jobs created in the enterprise development agencies&rsquo; client companies in the last number of years are heavily concentrated in high value-added, knowledge-based companies that offer greater security in the face of intense international competition. Irish manufacturers engaged in specialised, sophisticated, high technology and value-added activities, and/or operating in non-commoditised markets (e.g. the medical technologies and pharmaceuticals sectors) can continue to compete successfully on international markets going forward. These sectors require specialised skilled staff, specialised technologies, flexible operations, and other factors that are not readily available in many low cost economies, such as modern Intellectual Property (IP) protection laws, a business friendly regulatory environment, etc.</P>
        <P>One of my Department&rsquo;s main tasks is to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business, and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain. In that regard, we continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, including our general taxation package which incentivises both the wealth creating business community and those in, and preparing to enter the labour force. We are also working to promote new areas of competitive advantage, such as by developing our R&amp;D base through the Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation.</P>
        <P>The enterprise agencies also aim to support sustainable, high value added enterprise in Ireland through the provision of mentoring and developmental supports, the enhancement of management capabilities and critical workforce <Col N="280"/>skills in client companies, support for the creation and implementation of strategies for market entry, development and growth, and strong supports for innovation and for research and development. Furthermore, we are continuing to pursue policies to promote lifelong learning and up-skilling to improve labour market flexibility and, where necessary, ensure that appropriate training supports are provided for workers in sectors that are no longer competitive, and who may need to find alternative employment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The BES and SCS are central tax incentive schemes to Ireland&rsquo;s overall strategy for the small business sector.  I established The Small Business Forum in 2005 to specifically look at the environment in which small business operate.  As part of their review the Forum considered whether the strategies being followed to support and develop the spirit of entrepreneurship in Ireland were effective and appropriate, and in this regard made particular recommendations on improving the BES and SCS schemes.  </P>
        <P>The report of the Small Business Forum, &ldquo;Small Business is Big Business&rdquo;, found that over 97 per cent of businesses operating in Ireland today are classified as small, employing almost 800,000 people. Given this context, the Forum raised a number of issues that need to be addressed if the small business sector is to realise its full potential and continue as a key driver of the Irish economy that will be demanded in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Mr. Cowen, T.D., in his Budget 2007 statement announced that both the Business Expansion Scheme (BES) and Seed Capital Scheme (SCS) were being renewed from 1 January 2007 for a seven year period to 31 December 2013, subject to the approval of the European Commission.  I strongly supported this decision, as there is a strong business case for extension of both the BES and SCS.  Businesses particularly small and start-up companies often experience difficulty in accessing early stage development capital and the BES and SCS help to bridge the financial difficulties experienced by new entrepreneurs.</P>

        <P>As indicated by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement, the Business Expansion Scheme and the associated Seed Capital Scheme <Col N="281"/>are approved State Aids and their continuation and the changes proposed will require the approval of the European Commission in line with the &ldquo;Community Guidelines on State Aid to Promote Risk Capital Investments in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises&rdquo;.  I understand that the EU Commission have written to the Irish authorities, seeking more information regarding the status of the schemes and the expected formal notification date of the scheme to the Commission.  The Department of Finance together with an official from my Department have already engaged with the Commission on this matter and it is expected that the formal application for approval will be made shortly.  It is not certain when the European Commission will make its decision.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware the renewal of the Schemes is also subject to the approval of the Oireachtas in the Finance Act.  It is expected that the Finance Bill will be published at the beginning of February.  Assuming a favourable decision by the European Commission, the relevant sections of the Finance Bill will, when enacted, be commenced by Ministerial Order.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment is working very closely with the Department of Finance to secure the approval for the schemes as a matter of priority.  We appreciate the importance of both schemes to encourage entrepreneurs and private investors to invest in new start-up business and micro enterprises, and we are doing everything necessary to finalise matters with the European Commission as quickly as possible.</P>

The goal of the overall strategy is to maximise export sales through the utilisation of applied research, technology and innovation while ensuring economic development is achieved in a regionally balanced fashion. A number of key targets are used to monitor progress towards these objectives. Enterprise Ireland reported an excellent performance in 2006, with all strategic targets met or exceeded by EI client companies, for example:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;1 Billion in New Export Sales forecast</P><Col N="282"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />550+ Companies Engaged in Meaningful (&euro;100K+) and 40+ in Significant (&euro;2M+) Research and Development in 2006</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />150 Productivity Improvement Fund Investments</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Net gain in Employment of 1,200.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Preliminary indications are that Irish companies have gained strong positions in international markets that will result in the achievement of &euro;1 Billion in new export sales by year-end, when final data for 2006 is confirmed. Total employment in Enterprise Ireland supported companies is 141,000 representing a net gain of 1,200 in 2006. EI continuously pursues new opportunities for client companies in international markets. As a result of deepening relationships with major global corporations, 5 such companies invested &euro;9.5 Million in venture capital in Enterprise Ireland client companies in 2006.</P>
        <P>75 companies with high export growth potential were established in the year. 89 key reference sales were secured for start-up clients and 79 of these were in first time export markets. In addition, significant new first time export sales contracts with a value of &euro;125 Million were won by client companies with Enterprise Ireland assistance.</P>
        <P>Client companies in the Scaling Portfolio are actively pursuing rapid global growth strategies to achieve agreed scale thresholds of &euro;10 Million, &euro;15 Million and &euro;20 Million. In 2006 Enterprise Ireland supported 8 major investments by scaling companies.</P>
        <P>There is sustained evidence that research and development and innovation are now firmly on the enterprise agenda.  During 2006, 550+ companies invested &euro;100,000 or more on R&amp;D projects and a further 40+ in excess of &euro;2 Million. During 2006 Enterprise Ireland initiated the R&amp;D Advocates programme through which experienced senior business R&amp;D practitioners encourage companies to engage in practical research and development for the first time.</P>
        <P>EI will coordinate Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the &euro;50 Billion 7th EU Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7), launched in 2006. FP7 will provide opportunities for Irish researchers in industry, higher education, voluntary organisations and other areas to tap into European research networks and funding.</P>
        <P>Total EI funding approvals to client companies for research and development, expansions, management development, training and productivity improvement projects in 2006 amounted to in excess of &euro;120 Million. This represents an increase of almost &euro;40 Million over last year and is a clear indication that EI clients have a real commitment to grow their international business. The investment pipeline for 2007 remains strong.</P><Col N="283"/>
        <P>150 companies are engaged in significant productivity improvement projects and are investing &euro;80 Million with support from Enterprise Ireland. These projects represent a first step on the route to developing an innovation strategy and culture within the recipient companies with the ultimate goal of competing successfully in international markets.</P>

	<P>Article 40.6.iii of the Constitution of Ireland guarantees the right of citizens &lsquo;to form associations and unions&rsquo;.  The Irish Courts have found that the explicit right to associate contained in the Constitution is matched by an implied corollary right to disassociate.  Accordingly, it is a matter for an individual to decide whether or not to join a trade union.</P>
        <P>Trade unions are a vital part of Irish life.  Through the national partnership process, they have played a dynamic role in paving the way for national prosperity, in modernising our economy, in accommodating change and in creating a healthy climate for industrial relations. Through their participation on boards of many of our State bodies, they have contributed significantly, both in representing and vindicating the rights of their members, and also in helping to shape our strong performance and rapid development.</P>
        <P>The State is supportive of the trade union movement and its role in society, but does not provide specific supports or encouragement regarding trade union membership or recruitment. Responsibility for encouraging workers to join trade unions lies with the trade union movement itself.</P>
        <P>An annual grant is paid to assist the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in meeting the cost of providing its Education, Training and Advisory Services (ETAS), which provides training for union officials and activists in affiliated unions.   The allocation for 2007 is &euro;1.887m.</P>
        <P>The trade union movement also benefits from the Trade Union Support Scheme (TUSS) administered by F&Aacute;S.  In 2006, the funding provided was &euro;1.227m.</P>
        <P>The Department also provides funds to Trade Unions to assist in the costs incurred by unions in the course of amalgamations. The allocation for 2007 allocation is &euro;147,000.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services defines a posted worker as &ldquo; a worker who, for a limited period, carries out his work in the territory of a Member State other than the State in which he normally works.&rdquo; The Directive guarantees workers posted to a Member State from another Member State the terms and conditions of the host State. </P>
        <P>Directive 96/71/EC was transposed into Irish law by section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, which provides that all employee protection legislation on the statute book in the State applies to posted workers in exactly the same way as it applies to Irish workers.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s comprehensive body of employment rights legislation, which protects employees against arbitrary behaviour by employers, applies, therefore, to all workers employed on an employer-employee basis in Ireland. The Protection of Employee&rsquo;s (Part-Time) Work Act, 2001 also provides that all employee protection legislation applies to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a contract of employment that provides for his or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employment. Thus a person, irrespective of nationality or place of residence, who works in the State under a contract of employment, has the same rights under Irish employment rights legislation as Irish employees.</P>
        <P>Labour Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the Inspectorate seeks redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Employers are required to maintain records in respect of such employees and these records, together with other substantiating evidence, for example, a statement from an employee, provide the essentials of a basis for legal proceedings. Failure to maintain adequate records by an employer is an offence.</P>
        <P>No distinction is made in terms of worker nationality or place of residence insofar as the enforcement of employment rights legislation is concerned. In the circumstances information on <Col N="285"/>posted workers in terms of the number of complaints made under the auspices of this Directive, the number of investigations undertaken and the number of prosecutions undertaken is not readily available. However, almost 16,000 inspections/ visits were undertaken by the Labour Inspectorate in 2006 to determine compliance with employment rights legislation. During the year, the Inspectorate also recovered arrears of pay amounting to almost &euro;1.4 million and initiated legal proceedings against 24 employers in respect of breaches of employment rights legislation. Prosecutions brought before the Courts in 2006 resulted in the imposition by the Courts of fines against 8 employers amounting to a total of &euro;33,351.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.6- ?>
        <P>It should be noted also, that in many cases, Employment Rights Legislation has provisions whereby workers who believe that they have been denied their entitlements, or otherwise unfairly treated, can, as an alternative to dealing with the Labour Inspectorate, take the matter before a Commissioner in the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
        <P>I urge anyone who has evidence of the mistreatment of posted or other workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the Inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.</P>

	<P>The registration of Employment Agreements and the maintenance of the Register of such agreements is a matter for the Labour Court and one in which I have no direct function. Currently I understand that there are 45 Employment Agreements registered with the Labour Court.  Information in relation to REAs, and on those which have been registered or varied in recent years, is available on the Labour Court website at www.labourcourt.ie and in the Annual Reports of the Labour Court.  Copies of the Annual Reports are available in the Oireachtas Library and on the Court&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is based on a voluntary approach with terms and conditions of employment being determined in the main by a process of voluntary collective bargaining between the parties. A feature of voluntarism is that collective agreements are generally not enforceable in law. However, Employment Agreements (provided for in the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 2004) are agreements on pay and conditions of employment negotiated by the two sides in an industry or enterprise. Employment Agreements may be presented to the Labour Court for registration. Where the Labour Court is satisfied that the agreement presented satisfies the statutory requirements, it will register the agreement. The effect of this is to make the provisions of the agreement legally enforceable in respect of every worker of the class, type or group to which it is expressed to apply and to his or her employer, even if such worker or employer is not a party to the agreement.</P>
        <P>While complaints of breaches of the Registered Employment Agreement are investigated by the Labour Inspectorate of the Department, the enforcement of the provisions of a Registered Employment Agreement may also be effected by direct complaint to the Labour Court. A trade union, an association of employers or an individual employer may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with a Registered Employment Agreement. If, after investigating a complaint, the Court is satisfied that the employer is in breach of a Registered Employment Agreement it may, by order, direct compliance with the agreement. Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that our system of Registered Employment Agreements provides a strong framework for the regulation and enforcement of collective agreements between employers and workers on a wide range of terms and conditions of employment.</P>

	<P>Directive 98/6/EC on the requirement to indicate product prices was transposed into Irish law in Statutory Instrument No. 639 of 2002 and came into force on 1st March 2003. The Directive obliges retailers to display the selling price and the unit price (the price per kilo or litre) for products.  </P>
        <P>I decided to review the EU price display legislation as it is legislation which impacts on the consumer every time they decide to purchase a product.</P>
        <P>On 20th October 2006 I arranged for advertisements to be placed in the national newspapers inviting comments on the Regulations.  A Consultation document outlining the issues which people could comment on was also produced and was available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  I also arranged that groups and businesses with an interest in these matters be written to.  A number of organisations have submitted comments to my Department in relation to the review on EU price display legislation.  All of these comments are currently being considered and proposals will be made in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that as the Regulations transpose an EU Directive all proposals will have to be considered in conjunction with the European Commission.  They are currently reviewing the operation of the Price Display Directive by Member States and any further actions that we take will have to incorporate and complement any EU changes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to thank the Deputy for this opportunity to put on record in the House a more accurate presentation on Ireland&rsquo;s export control system than that which has been portrayed in recent media articles.</P>
        <P>My Department operates an export control system dedicated to preventing the export of goods that could be used in nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, that could be used to violate human rights or exacerbate internal conflicts in the country of final destination, that <Col N="288"/>could be subsequently diverted for purposes other than their stated end-use and to prevent strategic exports to countries whose behaviour is a threat to international peace.</P>
        <P>Controls are applied on the export of military and dual-use goods, that is, items and technology that potentially have both civil and military applications.  All export licences are granted in accordance with the criteria set out in the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.  These include respect for human rights and the rule of law in the country of final destination, regional peace and security, the behaviour of the buyer country with regard to the international community and the existence of a risk that the goods will be diverted within the buyer country or re-exported under undesirable conditions.  In addition, Ireland complies fully with trade sanctions and arms embargoes that have been imposed by the United Nations, the EU and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</P>
        <P>Recent media coverage has sought to convey the impression that Ireland is a major arms exporter.  In the first instance I would like to recall the findings of the 2004 Forf&aacute;s report, on export licensing of military and dual use goods, that Ireland does not manufacture finished military goods but that a small number of firms are engaged in the production of non-lethal components for military equipment.  In 2006, for example, four fifths of the licences granted were for fire control components.  Other military goods exported included ground vehicle and aircraft components and explosives used for mine-clearing purposes.</P>
        <P>I would also like to emphasise that over 95% of licensed Irish exports are dual-use goods, the vast majority of which are in the electronics sector.  Other dual use exports include computers, machine tools and cryptography software.  A dual use licence is only granted when my Department is satisfied that the goods in question are intended for civil end use.  If there is any reason to suspect that the goods will be used for a military purpose, or that they will be diverted to an end-use other than that specified in the application, a dual use export licence is not granted.</P>
        <P>With regard to the export of military goods, while licensed values give an indication of exports in this area, the actual value of exports is usually significantly less.  In 2005 for example, actual exports comprised less than half of the total licensed values.</P>
        <P>This Government is committed to ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s export control system is in line with best international practice and will shortly introduce in the Oireachtas the Control of Exports Bill 2007.  Among the key features of this legislation are substantially increased penalties, enhanced inspection and audit powers for officers of my Department and the introduction of controls on brokering and technical assistance activities and <Col N="289"/>on intangible transfers of technology.  The Bill also provides for the submission of an annual report to the Oireachtas on Ireland&rsquo;s export control system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 56 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, requires a liquidator of an insolvent company to submit a report to the Director of Corporate Enforcement within 6 months of their appointment.  Liquidators are also obliged to bring High Court proceedings for the restriction of the directors of such companies within 5 months of receipt of such reports, unless relieved of that obligation by the Director. </P>
        <P>In relation to the company mentioned, I have recently been informed by the Director that he has temporarily relieved the liquidator of the obligation to take restriction proceedings pending receipt of a further report from the liquidator to be submitted in two month&rsquo;s time.  This form of decision is, I understand, usually made when the liquidator&rsquo;s enquiries have not yet reached a point where he is in a position to make a firm recommendation on the appropriateness of proceedings with a restriction application.  In such cases where a further report is requested and submitted the obligations and time periods set out in section 56(2) apply again.</P>
        <P>The role of the Employment Appeals Tribunal arises from claims referred to my Department by the liquidator of the Company concerned on behalf of the employees for arrears of wages, holiday pay and other entitlements for payment from the Social Insurance Fund under the Insolvency Payments Scheme. As the circumstances of the insolvency gave rise to a doubt as to whether the claims could be paid under the scheme, the question was referred to the Tribunal under Section 9(3) of the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984 for a decision on the matter. A full hearing by the Tribunal was scheduled for 14 December 2006, but the Tribunal on that date adjourned it until 21 March 2007. The Employment Appeals Tribunal is independent in the performance of its functions and <Col N="290"/>it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</P>
        <P>As regards new legislation relating to &ldquo;phoenix&rdquo; situations, I would draw attention to the changes introduced by Part 5 of the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001 which address problems and issues connected with business failure.</P>

	<P>Some months ago, I asked the Health and Safety Authority to update the 2002 Code of Practice on Workplace Bullying in light of the updated requirements in the new Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority in 2006 has since developed a draft &ldquo;Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work&rdquo; to be published in accordance with Section 60 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. The draft Code is aimed at preventing bullying and dealing with the problem when it happens in workplaces. It is a Code for both employers and employees. The draft Code explains what bullying means and deals with the responsibilities of employers and employees as regards preventing it.</P>
        <P>The draft Code, when published, will replace the &ldquo;Code of Practice on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying&rdquo; published by the Authority in 2002 under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989.</P>
        <P>Public consultation by the Health and Safety Authority on the draft Code, in accordance with the 2005 Act, concluded on 16 January 2007.  I understand that the Authority is currently analysing the submissions received on the draft Code. I look forward to receipt of the of Authority&rsquo;s resultant proposals as soon as possible for my consideration and consent to publication.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to say at this stage what changes, if any, to primary or secondary legis<Col N="292"/>lation will be required to fully implement this revised Code.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 174 together. </P>
        <P>The EU and its member states have played an influential and active central role in various initiatives in this field over recent years such as the adoption of the WTO General Council Decision in August 2003 which waived WTO members&rsquo; obligations under the TRIPs Agreement.  That waiver allowed WTO member countries to grant compulsory licences for the production and sale of patented pharmaceutical products intended for export to third countries lacking pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity to meet their needs.</P>
        <P>The temporary 2003 waiver was then copper-fastened by the WTO General Council decision in December 2005 proposing a permanent amendment to the TRIPs Agreement in this regard.  WTO procedure required that to be submitted to its member countries for their acceptance.</P>
        <P>Over this period the European Community also acted on the TRIPs waiver approach in adopting Regulation (EC) No. 816/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006.  That regulation on the compulsory licensing of patents relating to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products for export to countries with public health problems, came into force on 29th June 2006.  It now provides a legally secure, predictable, effective and sustainable solution for those members of the WTO and other least developed and developing countries, which want to use the licensing system to access the affordable medicines that they may need.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 1130 to 1132, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In an increasingly knowledge-based and globalised environment, skills required are progressively becoming more sophisticated.  While manpower forecasting over the medium to longer term can only provide an approximation of likely demand and supply, the Government has made provision to ensure that we have the best assessment of future skills needs and the policies and training programmes in place to respond to them.</P>
        <P>Central to this endeavour is the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Group.  It has been monitoring developments and proposing responses since 1997. That work has involved ongoing research into labour demand and supply in a number of economic sectors.</P>
        <P>In recent years the overall context within which that has been taking place has been characterised by a tight labour market &mdash; more employment and less unemployment.  Existing and emerging skills shortages have been estimated and responded to by:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Significantly increasing public funding to improve the skills of those at work</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Providing more focused incentives and supports to encourage those capable of working to enter into active employment</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Benefiting from immigration to meet current skills shortages in the indigenous workforce</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In the course of this year my Department will invest nearly &euro;480 million in training programmes operated by FAS, Skillnets and others organisations.   Out of this sum &euro;280 million will be allocated to training programmes to prepare people enter employment.  A further &euro;70 million is being provided to train those already in employment.   In addition,  &euro;130 million, a significant increase on last year&rsquo;s provision, has been made available to fund apprenticeships training programmes and so <Col N="296"/>to cater for historically high numbers of apprentices.</P>
        <P>In the course of the National Development Plan overall about &euro;7.7 billion in public funds will be used to support training and skills development.  This is again indicative of the importance that the Government attaches to having a highly skilled, highly productive, flexible and mobile workforce that will support national competitiveness and sustain economic and social prosperity into the future.</P>
        <P>Finally, I asked Forfas to undertake research that will inform a National Skills Strategy out as far as 2020.  That work in now complete and will be published shortly.</P>

	<P>My colleague, Mr Michael Ahern, TD, Minister of State at my Department, attended the EU Competitiveness Council, which took place on 4th December 2006.  </P>
        <P>The following is a summary of the four main agenda items discussed:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="10"><i>Modernised Customs Code</i></P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Council held a policy debate on a proposal for modernizing the Community customs code with a view to providing political guidance for further work. The Council discussed three issues arising from a proposal to modernise the EU Customs Code &mdash; Single Window, Centralised Customs Clearance and Customs Representation.  The modernisation of the customs code was an essential pillar for EU growth and competitiveness.  In general there was political support for the concepts of Single Window and Centralised Clearance but additional work is needed to resolve technical problems. Delegations acknowledged that the conditions for Customs Representation should be compatible with the principles of the Internal Market. There was majority agreement to abolish restrictive practices for customs agents but also to ensure community-wide professional competency.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="10"><i>Innovation Policy</i></P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Council held a policy debate on a broad-based innovation strategy for the EU and adopted conclusions to be forwarded to the December European Council for endorsement. The Council considered that support for inno<Col N="297"/>vation was an essential part of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs and that it merited an ongoing position on the EU&rsquo;s competitiveness agenda.  Public policies should aim at improving access to financing in support of innovation, at creating an innovation friendly regulatory environment and a demand for innovation as well as reinforcing the activities of institutions which promote innovation, including the links between research institutions and industry.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Commission will present a comprehensive strategy on Intellectual Property Rights during 2007 and the Council invited the Commission also to present its Communication on Patents as soon as possible.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Council also took note of a presentation by the Commission on the 2006 Competitiveness report, an oral report by the Presidency on the draft regulation for the establishment of a European Institute of Technology and the state of progress concerning the preparation of proposals for Joint Technology initiatives.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="10"><i>Better Regulation</i></P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Council held an exchange of views based on a presentation from the Commission and a questionnaire from the Presidency. The Commission proposal for a reduction of 25% in administrative burdens was the focus of particular attention. While many Member States could support the principle involved, many also raised issues about the detail and how it would operate in practice given that Member States had different starting points. The Council reaffirmed the priority which it attaches to a well-functioning regulatory framework as an important means both to achieving agreed political objectives and in strengthening the competitiveness of European enterprises. The Presidency indicated that ongoing detailed discussions would be required and noted that the next three Presidencies were prioritising better regulation.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="10"><i>Consumer Credit Directive</i></P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Council took note of a progress report by the Presidency on a draft Directive on credit agreements for consumers amending Council Directive 93/13/EC (15406/06) and also held a brief exchange of views. This draft Directive aims at harmonising certain aspects of the laws, regulations and administrative procedures of the Member States concerning agreements covering credit for consumers. It establishes the conditions for a genuine internal market while ensuring a high level of consumer protection. Two issues need to be addressed (a) the benefits of harmonisation in this area and (b) which particular areas require more detailed regulation.  Discussions will continue under the <Col N="298"/>German Presidency.  The Council also adopted its common position on simplification of nominal quantities for pre-packed products.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition to the main agenda, the Finnish Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr. Mauri Pekkarinen, hosted a lunchtime discussion on Competitiveness, Climate Change and Energy Policy.</P>
        <P>The Council also took note of information given by the Presidency and by the Commission on:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Activities in the Pharmaceutical Forum;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Commission communication on external aspects of competitiveness: &ldquo;Global Europe: competing in the world&rdquo; &mdash; Council conclusions of 13 November 2006;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The EU-US informal economic ministerial meeting;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The review of the consumer acquis;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The common frame of reference in European contract law;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The review of the timeshare Directive;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The state of play on suspension of import duties on primary aluminum (at the request of the Polish delegation).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The proposals and initiatives discussed by Council are at various stages of negotiation and development and Ireland&rsquo;s position is being represented in the appropriate working and expert groups. My Department always seeks to play a constructive role in relation to all EU proposals and is anxious to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are safeguarded while also being mindful of our responsibilities to the Union as a whole. In the normal process of negotiation, we may and do seek amendments or identify provisions which could be improved on or take positions on amendments sought by other Member States or the Commission.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am aware of the details of the Live Register for December, 2006, published by the Central Statistics Office on 12 January, 2007.  The Live Register figures for County Kerry as a whole show a total of 6,793 in December 2006 compared to 6,650 in December 2005.  These figures cover seven towns.  The figure for Tralee <Col N="299"/>is the biggest component &mdash; 3,098 in December 2006 as against 2,950 a year earlier.  During 2007, the Industrial Training agency F&Aacute;S, will continue to provide services in the Tralee area through each of its four client services divisions.</P>
        <P>While I am concerned at any increase in Live Register figures, it is important to point out that the Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment.  Unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey which is also published by the CSO.  The unemployment rate for the South West Region in the last survey was 4.1%.  This was below the national unemployment rate of 4.5%.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, the Industrial Development agencies are making every effort to attract industry and employment to Tralee.  Indeed, I stressed the importance of this to the agencies during my visit to the town on 15 March, 2006.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157, 1134 and 1135 together. </P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s strengths and competitive advantages have changed over the last decade, and our economy is now characterised by high output and productivity, together with high returns to labour in the form of wages, salaries and better living standards. Low technology production, which dominated our economic output in the past, is being replaced by higher technology and services enterprises. It is the case that manufacturing firms in the more traditional sectors have, in recent years, operated against a backdrop of significantly declining external demand, downward price pressure, and an increasingly competitive international environment together with upward pressure on costs and the strengthening of the Euro against our key trading partner currencies.  There are areas of activity in which Ireland&rsquo;s <Col N="300"/>competitiveness is seriously challenged and it is inevitable that, among the factors which influence the location decisions of companies, the competitive attractions of alternative geographic locations will figure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the environment in which it must operate, Irish manufacturing has, in fact, performed quite strongly; CSO data indicates that manufacturing production by volume has increased by 28% overall between 2000 and 2005.  The latest CSO Release on Industrial Employment, December 2006, indicates that employment in manufacturing increased by some 4,000 in the 12 months to September 2006.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the changing nature of our economy has seen some losses, in contrast, the new jobs created in the enterprise development agencies&rsquo; client companies in the last number of years are heavily concentrated in high-value added, knowledge-based companies that offer greater security in the face of intense international competition. Irish manufacturers engaged in specialised, sophisticated, high technology and value-added activities, and/or operating in non-commoditised markets (e.g. the medical technologies and chemicals sectors) can continue to compete successfully on international markets going forward. These sectors require specialised skilled staff, specialised technologies, flexible operations, and other factors that are not readily available in many low cost economies, such as modern Intellectual Property, IP, protection laws, a business friendly regulatory environment, etc.</P>
        <P>One of my Department&rsquo;s main tasks is to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business, and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain.  In that regard, we continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, and to promote new areas of competitive advantage, such as by developing our R&amp;D base.</P>
        <P>The enterprise agencies also aim to support sustainable, high value added enterprise in Ireland through the provision of mentoring and developmental supports, the enhancement of management capabilities and critical workforce skills in client companies, support for the creation and implementation of strategies for market entry, development and growth, and strong supports for innovation and for research and development.</P>
        <P>My Department and the enterprise development agencies will continue to monitor and review the performance of the Manufacturing sector of the economy. While there are undoubtedly challenges to be addressed, I believe the sector will continue to be a significant contributor to exports, employment and economic growth in 2007 and beyond.</P>

	<P>My Department has been making good progress in the relocation of the required 250 posts to Carlow under the Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation Programme.  </P>
        <P>With regard to the property side of the Department&rsquo;s move, the Office of Public Works completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre late in 2005. On 31st May 2006, the OPW commenced the tendering process by seeking <Col N="302"/>expressions of interest from developers in relation to the design, build, finance and maintenance of new office accommodation and car parking for the Department in Carlow.</P>
        <P>On completion of this stage, a short-list of developers will be drawn up from whom tenders will be invited.  Following the tender evaluation process the preferred tenderer will be requested to seek suitable planning permission.  On obtaining this, the OPW will formally award the contract and construction will commence.  The OPW expect construction to begin late in 2007 and the construction phase may take up to 24 months.</P>
        <P>In order to accommodate staff who wish to move earlier than the projected building completion date, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, are progressing an earlier move to Carlow. The OPW have advised my Department that negotiations on the procurement of interim accommodation to facilitate an advance move are nearing completion.</P><Col N="303"/>
        <P>I expect this advance move option to allow for the movement of approximately 80 decentralising staff to Carlow during the second quarter of 2007, on a voluntary basis.</P>
        <P>The number of posts in Business Units decentralising to Carlow, as at 26th January, is 280.  As at 26th January, my Department has 97 Carlow-bound applicants assigned within the Department, with a further 74 Carlow-bound applicants yet to be assigned to the Department. None of the required staff have been decentralised to Carlow to date. It is hoped to have all decentralising posts filled in sufficient time to ensure that staff are adequately trained in advance of the move to Carlow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 179 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputies will be aware, on 18 June last year, I joined the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and other Cabinet colleagues to launch our comprehensive Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation for the period 2006-2013. This Strategy provides for the continued development of a world-class research system, underpinned by the essential physical and human infrastructure, doubling the number of PhD graduates over its lifespan. Top-level researchers will also be drawn from both home-grown talent and the brightest who can be attracted from overseas. The Strategy also proposed mechanisms to ensure that the investment in research is turned into commercial value, to <Col N="304"/>the greatest extent possible, and, in regard to enterprise, the Strategy set out structures and mechanisms to enhance supports to industry and encourage firms to become more engaged in R&amp;D activity.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s firm commitment and support for the STI Strategy was confirmed in the NDP, of which the STI Strategy is a core component. The NDP has set out how an unprecedented &euro;8.2 billion investment in Science, Technology and Innovation will work to deliver the knowledge economy in this country. Over the lifetime of the NDP, the State will invest &euro;6.1 billion in STI, as detailed in the following programme areas:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />World Class Research STI  &mdash; &euro;3,462 million</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Enterprise STI  &mdash; &euro;1,292 million</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Agri-Food Research  &mdash; &euro;641 million</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Energy Research  &mdash; &euro;149 million</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Marine Research  &mdash; &euro;141 million</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Geo-science  &mdash; &euro;33 million</P>
   <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Health research  &mdash; &euro;301 million</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Environment Research  &mdash; &euro;93 million</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This will bring Ireland into line with R&amp;D performance in leading countries. The investment in human capital, physical infrastructure and commercialisation of research, which I have outlined here, is complemented by investment in initiatives set out in the NDP allocations for Higher Education and the IDA. Taking account of these <Col N="305"/>amounts, the global NDP investment in STI is over &euro;8.2 billion.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to report intensive progress on the implementation of the STI Strategy over the past six months. While overall policy continues to be directed by the Cabinet Committee on STI and its supporting high-level IDC, the Strategy also provided for the establishment of new cross-cutting structures at operational level, to take forward its implementation in a whole of government manner.</P>
        <P>In line with the recommendations of the Strategy, my Department has established Technology Ireland (TI) with participation from EI, IDA Ireland, SFI, Forf&aacute;s and HEA. TI has met on 6 occasions since the Strategy was launched. TI is bringing coherence to the enterprise dimension of the Strategy and will have particular responsibility for overseeing the implementation of required actions to achieve the BERD targets set out in the SSTI 2006-2013. Among the SSTI initiatives currently being driven by TI are: simplifying the R&amp;D Grants Schemes, strengthening the Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) in the Universities and developing a proposal for the development of Competence Centres.</P>
        <P>The Higher Education Research Group/ HERG, which is chaired by the DES, with my own Department as Deputy Chair, held its first meeting on 10 January and has agreed a substantive work programme for the year ahead, in terms of tackling the objectives in the Strategy for the HE Sector, including growing our research infrastructure and human capital.</P>
        <P>The ASC has agreed its work programme for 2007 and will tackle key issues raised in the STI Strategy including Researcher Careers and International Collaboration. The Advisory Science Council published a major report on Health Research, which I launched with my colleague the Minister for Health on 23 November, reflecting the cross-Departmental nature of this issue and addressing the potential for Health Research, which had been highlighted in the SSTI.</P>
        <P>In addition, in December, I advised the Government of the appointment of Professor Patrick Cunningham as the new Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government and he will play a key role in providing scientific input and advice in furtherance of the STI Strategy.</P>
        <P>Most importantly, the &ldquo;whole of government&rdquo; approach to STI, which had ensued from the new coordination and governance structures put in place by Government since June 2004, has now been reinforced by the cross-Departmental STI Strategy and consolidated in the new NDP. This will ensure that we continue to benefit from the necessary synergies, coherence and more structured policy coordination required in this complex and evolving environment.</P>

        <Quest> his plans to introduce paid learning leave to enable workers to up skill. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>This Government is committed to the promotion of lifelong learning both as a means of ensuring personal career advancement for workers and of ensuring the skills needs of industry are met.   It therefore co-operates with industry and employees by investing significant resources in training programmes for the employed.  This year my Department will invest &euro;70m in schemes for the employed.  This is more than five times the investment made in 2004.  </P>
        <P>Any discussion about the question of paid learning leave needs to take account of the respective responsibilities of employers in addressing the skills requirements of their businesses and individuals in their own career advancement.  It is therefore not my intention to introduce a universal scheme of paid learning leave.</P>
        <P>However, I believe it is worth investigating whether there is a role for the State in intervening further in case of low-skilled workers who would not otherwise engage with or be offered access to training and education programmes.  FAS are therefore piloting a small-scale programme over the next eighteen months of paid learning leave for such employees. The results of this pilot will inform future policy in this area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 164, 1127 and 1129 together.</P>
        <P>The relocation of businesses within particular types of industry, and with it a certain number of jobs, is a reality of modern global manufacturing for a highly developed economy such as Ireland. The factors that influence a firm&rsquo;s decision to relocate are varied and complex.  In addition to relative wage rates and other cost factors, these may include business takeovers, consolidations and changes in product or market focus. For these reasons it is not possible to quantify why firms relocate or the actual number of jobs which relocate to lower cost economies. While there may be some anecdotal evidence available for both, there is no system in place to capture and validate such data on a widespread basis and indeed such an exercise would be fraught with difficulty.  While off-shoring can contribute to job losses for firms in some sectors, productivity gains achieved through off-shoring also represents an opportunity to develop higher-end manufacturing and related activities domestically.</P>
        <P>The phenomenon of globalisation is changing the way economic production is organised the world over. Lower barriers to trade and improvements in transport technology are increasing the specialisation of production, resulting in global supply chains.  Ireland experiences both benefits and costs resulting from globalisation. The clearest demonstration of the benefits to Ireland from globalisation is illustrated by inward Foreign Direct Investment. This has been one of the principle causes of the strong economic performance of Ireland over the last two decades. However, as Ireland has gained from the mobility of modern production and supply chain models, competition from other locations for mobile FDI has intensified.</P>
        <P>This shift in the structure of international trade poses challenges to economic policy makers in all countries. Thankfully, Ireland has so far shown itself sufficiently flexible and adaptable to move to higher value added activities, providing quality, sustainable jobs. Furthermore, in large companies this process of transformation is often accommodated by a reallocation and retraining of staff within the company, and this on-going internal re-organisation and upskilling, resulting in improved productivity in the face of international competition does not get the same media attention that job losses do.  However, there are of course cases where plants do shut down, and the resulting redundancies can be very difficult for workers and their communities. Where this has occurred to date it has mainly been confined to relatively low technology, labour-intensive activities. We are continuing to pursue policies to promote lifelong learning and upskilling to improve labour market flexibility and, where necessary, ensure that appropriate training supports are provided for workers in sectors that are <Col N="308"/>no longer competitive, should they need to find alternative employment.</P>
        <P>The principle task of government is to ensure that Ireland continues to be an attractive place to do business, and to help foster economic competencies higher up the value chain. In that regard, this government has made significant progress in working towards maintaining and enhancing our framework competitive conditions, and promoting new areas of competitive advantage by developing our R&amp;D base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures, and promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning. Clearly the strategies set out in the new National Development Plan will play a crucial role in maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as an investment location.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, it should be noted that in addition to attracting foreign investment, IDA Ireland also places significant focus on embedding existing multinational enterprises in Ireland, by encouraging such enterprises to increase the scale of Irish subsidiaries, and to also expand the range of activities undertaken in Irish subsidiaries to include less mobile types of operations (e.g. R&amp;D activities, Supply Chain Management, etc.). This process of embedding subsidiaries of multinational enterprises makes relocation less likely.</P>

	<P>A Memorandum will be brought to Government shortly authorizing publication of the Control of Exports Bill and I hope to bring the new legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the next few weeks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The proposed legislation will update the existing Control of Exports Act which dates from 1983 and will ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s export controls are in line with best international practice.  In this regard, the new legislation will include, for the first time, provision for the regulation of arms brokering activities in Ireland and by Irish citizens abroad. This will enable Ireland to fulfil its obligation under the EU Common Position on Arms Brokering, which requires Member States to take all the necessary measures to control brokering activities on their territory.  This shift in the structure of international trade poses challenges to economic policy makers in all countries.

        <P Just="Left">This Department&rsquo;s contribution to the development of English language skills of migrants is the provision by F&Aacute;S of technical English language training.

        <Quest> his response to the NCB Purchasing Managers Index for November 2006 which shows that growth in the manufacturing industry has almost ceased; the actions he will take to ensure a sufficient manu<Col N="312"/>facturing base exists here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Any figure above 50 in the NCB Purchasing Managers Index indicates sectoral growth. The Irish manufacturing sector expanded for the 39th consecutive month in November with a modest growth rate of 51.6. Further expansion occurred in December when the index rose to 53, above its long-term average of 52.6. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish manufacturing sector has been a key component of the Irish economy over the last two decades and I believe that it will continue to be a significant contributor to exports, employment and economic growth in the future.  The performance of the sector is subject to ongoing review by my Department and the enterprise development agencies.  For example, the July 2006 report: &ldquo;The Changing Nature of Manufacturing and Services, Irish Trends and International Context&rdquo;, by Forf&aacute;s, on the changing nature of manufacturing demonstrates that the trends in Ireland are in line with the gradual process of structural change that characterises economic development. This has resulted in a decrease in the numbers employed in manufacturing with a concurrent rise in the number of jobs in services.  While the total number employed in the sector may have declined, both manufacturing output and merchandise export levels increased significantly between 2000 and 2005 (by 28.2% and 31.8% in volume terms respectively). This trend suggests that strong productivity improvements have been achieved over the past 5/6 years in the Irish manufacturing sector.  It should also be noted that the latest CSO release on Industrial Employment (28 Dec 2006) indicated an increase of 4,000 in the numbers employed in manufacturing in the quarter ending September 2006 relative to the same period in 2005.</P>
        <P>To assist industry maintain competitiveness and increase productivity, the economic development agencies are working on an ongoing basis to promote the adoption of new technology and best practice at company level. The agencies aim to support sustainable, high value added enterprise in Ireland through the provision of mentoring and developmental supports, the enhancement of management capabilities and critical workforce skills in client companies, support for the creation and implementation of strategies for market entry, development and growth, and strong supports for innovation and for research and development.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 172, 185 and 199     together.</P>
        <P>International benchmarking reports suggest that the regulatory burden in Ireland is relatively light.  The IMD (International Institute for Management Development) World Competitiveness Yearbook 2006 ranks Ireland 8th out of 61 countries surveyed for the extent to which bureaucracy does not hinder business activity.  The World Economic Forum&rsquo;s Global Competitiveness Report 2006-07 ranks Ireland 17th out of 125 countries surveyed for having a low burden of government regulation.</P>
        <P>While it appears, therefore, that Ireland enjoys a relatively favourable position, it remains important that every effort be made to maintain and improve this position, that the concerns of business are addressed on an ongoing basis, and that the work currently being done by our European neighbours does not see Ireland falling behind in competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Towards that end, I established the Business Regulation Forum in November 2005 to investigate ways in which the burden of regulation on business could be reduced.</P>
        <P>During 2006 the Forum collected evidence of the burden of regulation on business in Ireland. This activity can be treated under four headings.  (1) The BRF invited submissions from interested parties on the regulatory burden on business, and received forty responses, which will be considered in detail. The issue was also discussed with relevant stakeholders some of whom were invited to present to the Forum at its monthly meeting.  (2) The Forum liaised with international experts, both through inviting guest speakers to address the Forum&rsquo;s meetings and by visiting other jurisdictions to learn from their progress.  (3) Two main research projects were carried out by the Forum.  First, six case studies were completed, looking at the day-to-day regulations that businesses face.  Second, a pilot study was carried out on ways of reducing the administrative cost to business of two specific regulations (based on the &lsquo;Standard Cost Model&rsquo; which is an internationally used tool for measuring the administrative burden of regulations.  (4) Finally, the Forum has reviewed work done in other fora. It has reviewed the work on regulation by the Small Business Forum and will also examine results of a new survey by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Forum hopes that the final results of two projects being carried out by the Better Regulation Group, chaired by the Dept of the Taoiseach (ie a study of business attitudes to regulation and a regulatory &lsquo;mapping&rsquo; project), will also be of assistance to their work.</P>
        <P>Following this work during 2006, the Forum intends to present a report to me during the first quarter of this year, drawing conclusions from the material outlined above and making recommendations on taking the work forward.</P><Col N="315"/>
        <P>In addition to the work of the Business Regulation Forum, and specifically relating to the small business sector, I would point out that I recently enacted legislation to raise the audit exemption thresholds applying to small companies in respect of turnover and balance sheet to &euro;7.3m and &euro;3.65m. respectively. (The previous thresholds were &euro;1.5m and &euro;1.9m.)  This will remove the compulsory annual audit costs from the very large number of companies qualifying from the enhanced exemption level.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance announced a package of measures in Budget 2007 aimed at:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Enhancing the Business Expansion and Seed Capital Schemes up to 2013 (subject to EU Commission approval of State Aid Rules)</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Reducing the Administrative Burden on Small Businesses in relation to the payment of Corporation Tax, Preliminary Tax and the requirement for a Tax Clearance Certificate, by increasing the current thresholds which trigger such requirements. In addition, the Revenue Commissioners have been asked to explore further opportunities to reduce the tax compliance burden on all firms, large and small.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Increasing the VAT Cash Accounting and VAT Registration Turnover Thresholds from 1 March 2007 to simplify administration and reduce working capital requirements on small businesses.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Finally, the Company Law Review Group (CLRG) has finalised its work on the preparation of the General Scheme of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill and I understand that it expects to report on its findings shortly.  The CLRG&rsquo;s proposals will bring the existing 13 Companies Acts into one and will make it easier for firms and practitioners to understand and comply with the law relating to the incorporation and operation of companies in Ireland.</P>

        <P>In this regard, the Report of the High Level Inter-Departmental Committee established to examine the implementation of the recommendations of the Consumer Strategy Group was published in February 2006. The approval of the Government was received to draft the general scheme of a Bill to establish the new National Consumer Agency as recommended by the CSG. The general scheme was approved by the Government and duly published in August 2006 together with a detailed regulatory analysis of the proposed legislation.  The Consumer Policy Section also conducted a public consultation process in relation to the general scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Consumer Policy Section subsequently worked in conjunction with the Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s Office in drafting the legal text of the Bill.

Consumer Policy Section commenced work on the second phase in the Autumn of 2006. This phase will include a review of the law governing consumer contracts including the Sale of Goods and Services Act 1980 and will also involve a review of all secondary legislation including regulations requiring the display of prices by traders.</P>
        <P>In addition to the foregoing legislative activity, the Consumer Policy Section continued to provide support to the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the European Consumer Centre, the Interim Board of the National Consumer Agency and the Assay Office whose premises at Dublin Castle are currently undergoing a major redevelopment. Consumer Policy Section also represented Ireland on various committees/bodies in relation to Consumer Protection both at EU and national level.</P>
        <P>In line with the recommendation of the Consumer Strategy Group, additional resources have been allocated to the Consumer Policy Section. A total of 10 staff are now employed in the Section and the cost to the Department of those staff came to approximately  &euro;410,000 last year. I am determined that the Consumer Policy Section will continue to receive the necessary resources to enable to carry out its important work of delivering a modern and effective national consumer policy.</P>

	<P>Detailed costs of complying with Freedom of Information responsibilities are not generally kept by public bodies.  As FOI has become more ingrained into the culture of public bodies, certain aspects of compliance such as record keeping practices, training and staff awareness are covered by the general staffing and administration costs of those bodies, and could not easily be separated out.</P>
        <P>It is possible, however, to estimate the principal costs associated with supporting the Freedom of Information Act.  The FOI Central Policy Unit in the Department of Finance estimates the cost of processing a single FOI request at &euro;420.  On this basis, the 71 requests processed by my Department in 2006 cost an estimated &euro;29,820 to process.  In addition, my Department has a dedicated FOI Unit which deals with the administration of FOI and the promotion of best practice.  The estimated cost of running this unit in 2006 was &euro;169,959.</P>
        <P>There are 54 agencies under the aegis of my Department which are subject to FOI.  Between them they received 83 FOI requests in 2006.  Given the number of agencies, listing them individually is impractical for the purposes of this response, but if the Deputy so wishes I would be happy to supply a breakdown to her.  On the basis of an estimated cost of &euro;420 per request, these 83 FOI requests are estimated to have cost &euro;34,860 to process.  In addition, a number of agencies have dedicated FOI staff, and the estimated cost of maintaining these staff in 2006 was &euro;343,018.  Some of these dedicated staff costs may overlap with the cost of processing individual requests as some of these staff act as FOI decision makers.  Additionally, a number of smaller agencies would not dedicate specific resources to FOI.  Nevertheless, there will be a cost to those agencies arising from the general administration of FOI and these costs are not identified above.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 1136 together. </P>
        <P>In the rapidly changing global environment in which Ireland competes, the changing skills needs of the economy are difficult to predict with certainty.  However it is possible to identify trends to assist us make informed policy decisions aimed at minimizing skills shortages in the future.  These trends indicate that the skills required in the economy are becoming more sophisticated.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure that the existing and future work force has the necessary high level and up-to-date skills, this Department in recent years has:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Significantly increased its allocations for initiatives aimed at improving the skills of those at work,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Provided more focused incentives and supports to encourage those capable of working to enter into active employment, and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Put measures in place to ensure current skills shortages in the indigenous workforce can benefit from immigration.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">During 2007, the Department will invest nearly  &euro;480 million in training programmes operated by FAS, Skillnets and others organisations.   Out of this sum &euro;280 million will be allocated to training programmes to prepare people enter employment.  A further &euro;70 million is being provided to train those already in employment &mdash; a five fold increase on the allocations in 2004.   In addition,  &euro;130 million &mdash; a significant increase on last year&rsquo;s provision &mdash; has been made available to fund apprenticeships training programmes and so to cater for historically high numbers of apprentices.</P>
        <P>The high priority given to training and skills development will be maintained and further increased over the course of the National Development Plan, 2007-2013.  This announced that a total of &euro;7.7 billion in public funds would be invested in this area over the seven-year period.  This demonstrates the importance the Government attaches to having a highly skilled, highly productive, flexible and mobile workforce that will support national competitiveness and sustain economic and social prosperity into the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Companies operating in Ireland are no different than companies anywhere else in the world. They operate in a market economy, are affected by international events that influence global economic activity and the employment they create here is subject to specific business and product life cycles in different sectors. Over the decades since Ireland became a location of choice for so many foreign investors jobs have been lost each year. </P>
        <P>But what sets us apart as a competitive country is twofold. It has been our ability to create a growing and successful enterprise economy in which jobs losses are outweighed by broad based employment creation. It has also been our capacity to consistently look to the future, adapt our competitive position and maintain our world class standing as a competitive economy  &mdash; one that meets the demanding investment criteria of tomorrow&rsquo;s industries, products and technologies and on which our future prosperity, growth and employment will be based.</P>
        <P>Attracting mobile foreign investment is a tough challenge, particularly in the context of globalisation. Like us, the countries against whom we compete for investment continually improve and refine their competitive attractions. Nevertheless Ireland continues to be one of the most attractive locations in Europe for foreign investment. Over the years new enterprise policies are helping to reshape and reposition our economy towards one based on knowledge activities, creating new areas of competitive strength and positioning us as a leading European centre for knowledge led sectors and activities.</P>
        <P>This is bringing new strategic advantages. In 2006, IDA Ireland won 71 new projects involving a total investment of &euro;2.6 billion. Among its 2006 successes, investment in research and development continues to increase. For example, 54 R&amp;D projects were supported involving investments of &euro;470 million. This compares with corresponding investment of &euro;140 million in 2004 and &euro;260 million in 2005. Investment decisions of this scale are not made lightly nor are they made in favour of lowly rated, poorly performing and uncompetitive economies.</P>
        <P>With full employment and our ambitions to be a knowledge intensive rather than a resource intensive economy, volume based growth and job numbers are somewhat less important than previously. FDI growth should now be looked more on the basis of investment and employment quality than on the volume of jobs or investment per se.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, despite intense competition for international investment from emerging economies, initial estimates are that 11,800 new jobs were created in our FDI sector. This more than offset 8,000 job losses leaving employment in the foreign owned sector about 3,800 higher in 2006 than a year earlier.</P>

	<P>The European Commission published its Annual Progress Report for 2006 on implementation of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs on 12 December 2006.  The overall assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s performance is that we are making very good progress in the implementation of our National Reform Programme (NRP), including the priority areas arising from the 2006 Spring European Council. The underpinning role of the social partnership process and the range of commitments agreed under Towards 2016 is also acknowledged.  </P>
        <P>The Commission again places Ireland in the first tier of Member States with the strongest record and progress in pursuit of the Lisbon goals.  Ireland ranks amongst a handful of countries which has received no specific recommendations.</P>
        <P>As far as my own Department is concerned, in terms of rankings, Ireland scores very highly in terms of best enterprise environment due to the ease of starting a business, good access to capital and relatively low levels of administrative &ldquo;red tape&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the Commission identified key strengths of our National Reform Programme as:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Recently adopted Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy 2007-2013 and the substantial increase of public investment in R&amp;D;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Recognition of the need to prioritise public investment in infrastructure and other growth-promoting expenditure;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Measures to address early school leaving and enhance skills, such as the commitment to develop a long-term national skills strategy.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition to the various measures outlined in the NRP progress report, submitted in October 2006, many of the initiatives and changes outlined in Budget 2007 are entirely consistent with our overall strategy to stimulate and sustain economic growth and employment.  The recently published National Development Plan 2007-2013 further demonstrates a level of investment and a range of measures across the policy spectrum which reinforce this strategy.  Building on these developments, we would expect to record strong progress in continuing to meet the Lisbon objectives.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s Annual Progress Report will now form a key input to the Spring European Council in March 2007.</P>

	<P>I accompanied the Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern TD on the very successful trade mission, organised by Enterprise Ireland, to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 14th to 19th January 2007.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food Ms. Mary Coughlan TD and the  Minister for Education and Science Ms. Mary Hanafin TD also participated. The mission visited Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. </P>
        <P>These countries were chosen because Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates represent the two most important economies for Ireland in the Gulf region. Saudi Arabia is initiating a 10-year National Development Plan, involving the expenditure in excess of &euro;500bn, which offers  major opportunities for Irish companies to sell their expertise and skills.  Dubai&rsquo;s position, as the key hub for business operations across the Middle East, is due to its booming market, geographic position, increasingly pro business environment and adoption of mainly Western business rules. Dubai is also the regional business base for a large number of multinationals and emerging Arab regional companies.</P>
        <P>A total of 114 Irish companies participated, mainly from the ICT, Educational Services, Environmental and Engineering Services, Medical Devices and Food and Drinks sectors.  The <Col N="322"/>group included representatives of 20 companies from Northern Ireland, reflecting the increasing co-operation on trade among companies and business organisations across the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Mission has been regarded as a significant success. Over 1,200 meetings took place between the Irish participants and their potential and existing customers. Two major business meetings organised by Enterprise Ireland and addressed by An Taoiseach, were held in Riyadh and Dubai and were attended by 400 and 500 people respectively. Other events organised by Enterprise Ireland included a software workshop which I opened and two Education workshops at which Minister Hanafin presided.</P>
        <P>During the mission, a total of 25 significant agreements were signed. Initial estimates from companies and organisations who participated, place the likely future value of agreements reached, at  &euro;65 million.</P>

        <Quest> if he will report on the work of the Competition Authority in 2006; the number of mergers that, due to their nature, were referred to his Department rather than the Competition Authority for decision; the main points of these cases; his views on whether changes to competition law are required in the short to medium term; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The first part of the question relates to the day-to-day work of the Competition Authority which is the independent statutory body responsible for the enforcement of competition law in the State.  Its mandate and functions are set out in the Competition Act 2002, as amended.  The Competition Authority is statutorily required to publish an annual report of its activities during the year within 2 months of the end of its financial year and copies of this report are laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Also, the Chairman of the Authority is accountable under section 38 of the Act directly to the Oireachtas and is required to give evidence to the Public Accounts Committee and to any other Committee established by either House of the Oireachtas in regard to the activities of the Authority. </P>
        <P>Details of all notified mergers since 1st January 2003 are available from the Competition Authority and are published on its website, www.tca.ie.  I have no function in mergers, other than in relation to media mergers.  My role under the &ldquo;media&rdquo; provisions in the Act involves considering the acquisition in the context of the &ldquo;relevant criteria&rdquo; as specified by section 23 of the 2002 Act. These criteria essentially relate to media plurality/cross-media issues.</P><Col N="323"/>
        <P>During 2006, I was notified of 22 media mergers, none of which warranted further investigation, and the mergers were accordingly put into effect.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that the current definition of a media merger is extremely broad and captures a significant number of transactions which are unlikely to be a cause of concern in the context of the criteria specified in the Act.  Consequently, I am currently examining the relevant provisions relating to such transactions to see if some amendments might be required to allow for more efficient operation of procedures for vetting such media mergers.  Any amendment required will likely relate to the definition of media merger and can be effected by means of secondary legislation.</P>
        <P>More generally, my Department will commence a review of the operation of the Competition Act 2002 during the course of 2007 and a decision will be made after the completion of that review on the need to introduce changes to the current legislation.</P>

        <P>The final cost will depend on such factors as the outcome of the competitive tendering process.  Importantly, this cost can be set against the overall financial benefit accruable to the exchequer from the move to Eastpoint, such as the sale of a substantial part of the Glasnevin site.  It is anticipated that the benefit to the exchequer will be a multiple of the cost of fitting out the new facility at Eastpoint.</P><Col N="324"/>

One of the options considered to address the issue was that of developing the Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Glasnevin site to provide accommodation for all Dublin staff.</P>
        <P>However, following the introduction of the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme in December 2003, the option of a major investment in new purpose-built premises on the Glasnevin site was deemed to be inconsistent with the proposed decentralisation of some 300 of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 600 Dublin based staff to Shannon.</P>

        <P>Enterprise Ireland nevertheless faced the same operational challenge of operating from four separate locations across Dublin. Crucially having all Dublin based staff in one location will enable Enterprise Ireland to further deliver on one of its most important initiatives, the creation of integrated teams of staff with complementary expertise to service client companies.</P>
        <P>The substantial number of remaining staff, plus the fact that the leaseholds on two of these premises are due to expire in 2008, meant that the Agency had to decide on an appropriate office solution that would, on the one hand provide suitable accommodation for the staff currently spread across the four separate Dublin locations, and on the other hand give Enterprise Ireland the flexibility to comply with the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme.</P>
        <P>Having explored a number of possible solutions, the Board of Enterprise Ireland decided that the single site office solution offered in the East Point Business Park was the most appropriate from a number of perspectives, including value for money and flexibility. In September of 2006, following the Board decision, Enterprise Ireland signed a commercial 25-year lease on the two units in East Point. The leases have in-built break clauses, plus a clause to enable the Agency to sub-let space, if required.</P>
        <P>Guidelines regarding property arrangements in the greater Dublin area, aimed generally at public service organisations, are more appropriately issued by the Department of Finance or the Office of Public Works.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding the ongoing dispute between Green<Col N="326"/>core and its former employees who are still to receive their redundancy payments; his views on whether Greencore should be using the compensation it received from the State to redevelop the site at Mallow before they have paid their workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P Just="Left">On 26 April 2006, the Labour Court made a recommendation regarding the redundancy terms for Irish Sugar workers at the Mallow plant.  The court has issued three clarifications of its recommendation since April, but<?oasys _jy ?>these failed to achieve a resolution to the<?oasys _jy ?>dispute.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes is a matter for the parties involved.  The Irish system is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing a solution on the parties to an industrial dispute.</P>
        <P>The company has indicated that it is not prepared to alter its existing redundancy package.  Similarly, the trade unions have not changed their position and are not prepared to accept the company&rsquo;s offer.</P>
        <P>I very much regret the failure of the parties to find a resolution to this dispute.  However, the services of the Labour Court remain at the disposal of the parties, if they wish to return.</P>
        <P>As regards restructuring aid under the Agreement on the Reform of the EU Sugar Regime, this is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  However, I understand that the EU restructuring aid for the sugar industry, as provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006, is to cover the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring, involving factory closure and renunciation of quota.  In July 2006 the Government made decisions regarding the percentage of the aid to be reserved for beet growers and contractors and the indicative breakdown of the potential allocation of the aid to be followed by Greencore in preparing its restructuring plan.  These decisions are now the subject of judicial review proceedings instituted by Greencore in the High Court and, in the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on this issue.</P>

	<P>There is a need to tread cautiously when interpreting quarterly results for industrial production as the indices are subject to fluctuation. Such results are best compared to performance relative to the corresponding quarter of the previous year rather than relative to the preceding quarter. </P>
        <P>While CSO data indicates that production decreased by 6.0% in the period September-November 2006 compared to the period June &mdash; August of the same year; a comparison of third quarter figures between 2005 and 2006 shows a slight increase in manufacturing production for that particular quarter in 2006.</P>
        <P>Taken over the past five years Irish manufacturing has, in fact, performed quite strongly; CSO data indicates that manufacturing production &mdash; in volumes &mdash; increased by 28 percent overall between 2000 and 2005.  The performance of the sector is subject to ongoing review by my Department and the enterprise development agencies and while there are challenges to be addressed, I believe the sector will continue to be a significant contributor to exports, employment and economic growth in the future.</P>
        <P>To assist industry maintain competitiveness and increase productivity, the economic development agencies are working on an ongoing basis to promote the adoption of new technology and best practice at company level.

	<P>My Department and its agencies support the financing of SMEs in a number of ways. The funding provided by Enterprise Ireland and the County and City Enterprise Boards, in the form of grants, refundable aid and equity participation, provides an important source of finance to many SMEs.  In addition, <Col N="329"/>Enterprise Ireland actively promotes the availability of venture capital in Ireland and I have approved funding of &euro;175m for venture capital that is projected to leverage venture capital funding of some &euro;1 billion over the next decade.  </P>
        <P>Furthermore, the HALO Business Angel Partnership which is managed by the Dublin Business &amp; Innovation Centre (BIC) and supported by the Cork, Waterford and Galway BICs, is designed to encourage and facilitate the provision of informal investment in enterprises by Business Angels, typically high net worth individuals who wish to invest in early stage companies with good growth potential.  This partnership is being supported financially by Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland.</P>
        <P>JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises) is a joint initiative of the European Commission with the European Investment Fund and the European Investment Bank to promote SME access to finance and financial engineering products in the regions. Under the JEREMIE programme, national and regional authorities can opt to deploy money made available by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in the form of market-driven financial instruments, instead of offering grants.</P>
        <P>The European Investment Fund&rsquo;s JEREMIE programme was examined in the context of the arrangements already in place to assist enterprises in accessing appropriate financial support. However, given the nature and structure of the programme, particularly in terms of the scale of operations that would be required to secure EIF participation, it was felt that it was not best suited to the present circumstances pertaining in the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, my Department is, in response to a recommendation of the Small Business Forum, currently researching the possibility of the financial institutions accessing loan guarantees from the European Investment Fund that would enable them to expand their lending to small enterprises and remains open to the possibility of participation in the JEREMIE programme if circumstances indicate that it could benefit Irish businesses in a workable manner.</P>

	<P>The number of workplace inspections/visits undertaken by the Labour Inspectorate in 2006 amounted to 15,855. Breaches were detected in 2,250 of these cases. The primary objective of the Labour Inspectorate in the case of the breaches detected was to seek compliance and rectification of any breaches identified, including redress for the individual/s concerned and payment of any arrears due to employees. In this regard the Inspectorate, in 2006, recovered from some 349 employers arrears of pay amounting to almost &euro;1.4 million. Prosecutions were initiated in 2006 against 24 employers in respect of breaches of employment rights legislation while prosecutions brought before the Courts in 2006 resulted in the imposition by the Courts of fines against 8 employers amounting to a total of &euro;33,351.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has requested a breakdown of inspections on an industry sector basis. The information is not readily available in this format. The Inspectorate currently records its activities by the legislative instrument under which it is granted enforcement powers. The legislative instruments involved include the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 and the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1997. Inspections under these pieces of legislation, which are undertaken across all sectors, accounted for 89% of all inspections in 2006.

	<P>I have read the report and noted the allegations contained in the magazine article.  I have also noted that the company has denied the allegations.</P><Col N="334"/>
        <P>The wages and employment conditions of workers employed in Retail Grocery are governed by the Retail Grocery and Allied Trades Employment Regulation Order.</P>
        <P>I would urge any employee or former employee who is of the view that their employer is not operating or has not operated in compliance with the provisions of the Employment Regulation Order to make a formal complaint to the Labour Inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Inspectors are authorised to examine employers&rsquo; relevant records and seek to have irregularities rectified. The Inspectorate has undertaken inspections of the Company referred to in recent years and is <Col N="335"/>currently investigating one complaint by a former employee.</P>
        <P>Labour Inspectors pursue allegations of breaches of certain employment rights legislation and when evidence of non-compliance with such legislation is found, the Inspectorate seeks redress for the individual/s concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Employers are required to maintain records in respect of such employees and these records, together with other substantiating evidence, for example, a statement from an employee, provide the essentials of a basis for legal proceedings. Failure on behalf of the employer to maintain adequate records is an offence.</P>
        <P>It should be noted also that, in many cases, Employment Rights Legislation has provisions whereby workers who believe that they have been denied their entitlements, or otherwise unfairly treated, can, as an alternative to dealing with the Labour Inspectorate, take the matter before a Commissioner in the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
        <P>If the issues in dispute between a worker or a group of workers are not covered by Employment Rights Legislation, a case may be referred to the Labour Relations Commission or to the Labour Court in accordance with the Industrial Relations Acts.</P>
        <P>The Labour Relations Commission operates a number of free services to assist in the prevention or resolution of workplace disputes:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Commission&rsquo;s Conciliation Service provides trained facilitators who assist employers and workers to resolve disputes when their own unassisted efforts have not succeeded.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Commission&rsquo;s Mediation Service provides a confidential process to allow parties resolve their conflict in a mutually agreeable way with the help of a neutral third party.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Commission&rsquo;s Advisory Service works closely with employers, trade unions and employees to promote, develop and implement best industrial relations policies, practices and procedures.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Rights Commissioners investigate and recommend on disputes and grievances referred by individuals or small groups of workers under the relevant industrial relations or employment rights legislation.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Labour Court acts as an industrial relations tribunal to provide a free, comprehensive service for the resolution of industrial relations disputes, where the parties to a dispute have been unable to reach agreement.  While ultimate responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes is a matter for the parties involved, since the Labour Court <Col N="336"/>is a Court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and, consequently, are prepared to accept the outcome of the process, namely, the Labour Court recommendation.</P>
        <P>For a dispute involving an individual&rsquo;s or small group&rsquo;s grievance or grievances, there exists a Code of Practice on Grievance and Disciplinary Procedures which dictates best practice for addressing grievance and disciplinary issues. The procedures set out in the Code are in line with the voluntarist tradition of Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations.  Grievance cases that cannot be resolved within a company may be referred, in line with the Code of Practice, to a Rights Commissioner under the Industrial Relations Acts and, if necessary, appealed to the Labour Court.</P>

        <Quest> the terms of reference given to the Company Law Review Group for their investigation into the report from the EU Commission entitled Study on the Economic Impact of Auditors&rsquo; Liability Regimes, as referred to in the statement of 3 January 2006; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the 8th Directive on Auditing, the EU Commission arranged for a study on the economic impact of current EU rules on auditors&rsquo; liability regimes and on insurance conditions in Member States.  This study entitled &ldquo;Study on the Economic Impact of Auditors&rsquo; Liability Regimes&rdquo; was published late last year, and describes the existing limitations in the insurance market for international audits, examines the economic needs for limited auditors&rsquo; liability and compares several possible methods for limiting liability.  </P>
        <P>Given the debate which has been launched by the EU study, I requested the Company Law Review Group (CLRG) to examine the matter, in addition to the Limited Liability Partnership strand of his existing remit to the CLRG in relation to its 2006/07 Work Programme.</P>
        <P>I requested that the CLRG examination of the issue of auditor liability include the following:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To develop an understanding of the issues associated with the current regime of auditor liability in Ireland;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To consider whether the current regime is in need of reform having regard to the policy issues and other considerations that are relevant, including those concerning the continuity of supply of audit services to the Irish economy;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In the event that the view of the CLRG is that reform to the present system is war<Col N="337"/>ranted, to identify the areas in which it is considered reform is required, and the means by which this might best be achieved including the development of proposals in the matter.  In particular, potential remedies as to how such reform could be achieved, including but not limited to, changes in the law</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />for the introduction of statutory liability caps;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to permit limitation of liability by contract;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to introduce a regime of proportionate liability;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to permit auditors to incorporate;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">should be explored, though not to the exclusion of other possible solutions.</P>
        <P>I have requested that the CLRG examine these issues, report its findings and make appropriate recommendations to him in the light of its work over the coming months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the enactment of the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 which revoked the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987, I asked the Competition Authority to review and monitor developments in the grocery sector in light of the new regulatory environment.  Since the removal of the Order, the Competition Authority has received no complaints of anti-competitive behaviour in the sector, nor has it seen any evidence of such behaviour.  </P>
        <P>The Authority&rsquo;s Grocery Monitor Project in now place.  In April 2007 one year&rsquo;s worth of post Groceries Order data will be available for analysis.  Later in 2007 the Authority intends to publish an analysis of developments in the sector focusing on pricing trends, market structures and barriers to entry.</P>
        <P>During the debate that surrounded the removal of the Order I predicted that increased competition in the market would lead to prices being cheaper than they would be if the Order remained in place. CSO figures are consistent with this view, particularly when grocery price inflation is compared with overall inflation.</P>
        <P>The CSO has recently published the Consumer Price Index for December 2006. The figures show that the prices of products previously covered by the Groceries Order fell by 1.6% in the nine-month period since the Groceries Order was abolished (April to December). During the same <Col N="338"/>nine-month period, prices of products not covered by the Groceries Order rose by 2.3%.</P>
        <P>The overall impact on all grocery prices (Groceries Order and Non Groceries Order items) is a decrease of 0.6% in the nine-month period from April to December 2006.</P>

	<P>The Enterprise Strategy Group&rsquo;s (ESG) report was an important policy agenda both for national competitiveness and for strengthening a positive business environment. </P>
        <P>The subsequent Action Plan to progress implementation of the ESG&rsquo;s recommendations covers 47 topics and set out a number of action points for Enterprise Ireland. Significant progress has been made by Enterprise Ireland in relation to the implementation of these actions. I am satisfied that good progress is being made on the Plan. There are no areas in which implementation is not either underway or completed. The process is being monitored by the Enterprise Advisory Group under the Chairmanship of Mr Michael Buckley. The Advisory Group will report to me later this year on the implementation process around all Action Plan recommendations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Online Redundancy Payments System (RPS) has been fully operational since June 2005. From June 2005 until 31 December 2005, a total of 2,648 online claims were received, this represents 19.14% of the total claims received for the seven-month period (13,837).  10,610 claims were submitted online in 2006, representing 45% of the total of 23,684 claims received.</P><Col N="339"/>
        <P>The average online processing time is six weeks where claims are correctly filled out and hard copies submitted with the necessary signatures and correct figures. The average time for processing hard copy only applications is currently 11 weeks.</P>
        <P>The integration of the online Redundancy Payments System with REACH was considered but was found to be unnecessarily expensive, with few benefits and greater costs than would be incurred with a stand-alone system. REACH itself was only in the development stage at that time and it was deemed more cost efficient to proceed with a system developed specially for a redundancy situation, which is usually a once off event for a company.</P>

	<P>The Consumer Protection Bill will be published in the next few days. The new National Consumer Agency will be placed on a statutory footing immediately after the Bill is enacted by the Oireachtas. In this regard the Bill will be presented to Seanad Eireann on 6th February 2006. There is already in place an Executive Chairperson of the Interim Board of the Agency and it is expected that the process of recruiting a Chief Executive in accordance with the provisions of the Bill will take place in due course. I am confident that the establishment of the new Agency will help to ensure that Irish consumers will enjoy the highest levels of protection. </P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear that the co-operation of the British authorities is essential in the case of any suggestion for a public inquiry on these matters.  </P>
        <P>This is something which was clear from the efforts of Judge Barron in all of his inquiries. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, which looked at those Reports, has recognised that.  The Government has been using all appropriate means in its efforts to ensure that co-operation.</P>
        <P>A public inquiry in this State which did not have the full co-operation of the British Government would not resolve any of the outstanding questions.</P>
        <P>As the Joint Oireachtas Committee has said, questions relating to allegations of collusion can only be dealt with by the British Government. That is the focus of our efforts in ongoing contacts with the British Government, including at the highest level.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 and 224 together.</P>
        <P>Under the timetable set out in the most recent report from the Decentralisation Implementation Group to the Minister for Finance, two hundred and thirty posts from the Property Registration Authority are scheduled to move to Roscommon by mid  2009.   These posts include general service, technical and specialist grades, the precise details of which are available on the Public Appointments Service (PAS) website.  In line with the central protocols under the decentralisation programme, the staff will be made up of serving officers from the Authority, staff from other areas of the Public Service who have applied for transfer to Roscommon under the Central Applications Facility (CAF), as well as staff who will have transferred from the Department of Agriculture and Food.  To date, around one hundred and fifteen public servants have indicated Roscommon as their first preference under the CAF and applications continue to be accepted under the Programme.</P>
        <P>It has been agreed that before the final move to Roscommon, an advance party of sixty-five people will be located in the town and over thirty officers have already taken up duty there, including twenty three staff from the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The balance of the staff will move there in the first half of 2007 but no decision has as yet been made as to the grade profile of the officers to be included in the second advance party.  The final decision on these matters will be based on operational requirements at the time and when the temporary accommodation becomes available.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works has identified a site for the permanent offices in Roscommon and the matter is being progressed in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  An architect and project <Col N="348"/>team have been assigned and applications have been invited from interested developers who wish to be invited to tender for the construction of the new offices.  It is anticipated that the accommodation will be completed and available for occupation by the target date of 2009 and it will cater for the Authority&rsquo;s full staffing complement.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the Report of the High Level Group on Traveller Issues which was published in March 2006 following approval by the Government.  The recommendations contained in the Report represent the position of the Government. The details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.justice.ie. The Report makes clear the extent to which Traveller groups are represented in the decision making process and how an integrated approach to service delivery should be achieved. A key recommendation of the Report is the development of an integrated approach to service delivery at local level using the structures of the City and County Development Boards (CDBs). Traveller Interagency Groups have since been established in each CDB area and the High Level Group Report specifies meaningful consultation with local Travellers as an essential element in developing the integrated approach.</P>
        <P>Towards 2016 includes a commitment to give &ldquo;concentrated attention&rdquo; to achieving progress on Traveller issues based on an integrated approach to service delivery, and it is encouraging that all social partners have subscribed to this approach. I am therefore confident that Traveller Organisations are being included in appropriate national fora and that they will continue to make a valuable input to ongoing developments to support the Traveller Community.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227, 239 and 358 together.</P>
        <P>A fee for immigration registration certificates was introduced in the Immigration Act 2004 (Registration Certificate Fee) Regulations 2006, which came into effect on 27 May 2006.  The introduction of such a fee had been flagged both in the Immigration Act 2004, and in the discussion document containing the outline policy proposals for an Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.</P>
        <P>Non-EEA nationals who register with an immigration registration officer receive a secure residence document in the form of a Certificate of Registration (registration card).  The State must provide the administrative resources and computer systems necessary to deal with the issuing of these residence documents.  The costs involved include the setting up and maintenance of a state-of-the-art computerised registration system operated by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the administrative work by registration officers in the form of checking of documentation and capture of registration details and the actual cost of the card itself which includes several security features, including a bio<Col N="350"/>metric chip.  The current fee of &euro;100 is in line with the amounts charged in other states.</P>
        <P>The Regulations provide for the waiving of payment of the statutory fee for the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) non-nationals who, at the time of registration under section 9 of the Immigration Act, 2004, are</P>
        <P LI="2">(i) under 18 years of age</P>
        <P LI="2">(ii) married to Irish citizens, or</P>

	<P>The person concerned made an application for a travel document in April 2006 and was refused as no documentary evidence was provided to support his claim that he needed to travel to obtain his own national passport.

	<P>The Children Act 2001 is the primary statutory framework for the youth justice system.  It adopts a twin-track approach which addresses both the issue of child welfare and of youth justice. The aim is to address the needs of children who require special care or protection in tandem with addressing the  issue of offending children.  Responsibilities under the Act span three Government Departments: Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science. </P>
        <P>While much of the responsibility comes within my remit, it should be noted that functions under the Children Act 2001 have been delegated under S.I. 474 of 2002 to my colleague Mr. Brian Lenihan T.D., Minister for Children.

To date, significant sections, and amendments introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2006, have been brought into force by me and the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>In relation to those provisions for which my Department has responsibility, Statutory Instrument (S.I.) 151 of 2002 commenced a range of provisions including provisions concerning the Garda Diversion Programme, the treatment of <Col N="353"/>child suspects in Garda stations, the Children Court, child protection measures and some powers of the Court.</P>
        <P>S.I. 468 of 2004 commenced provisions in respect of family conferences under the supervision of the Probation Service.  S.I.  No.529 of 2006 commenced provisions affecting the age of criminal responsibility as provided under an amendment contained within the Criminal Justice Act 2006 and these changes came  into effect on 16 October 2006. The effect of this change is that  children under 12 years of age shall not be charged with an offence except in the case of murder, manslaughter, rape or aggravated sexual assault where the age is 10 years.</P>
        <P>The role of Special Residential Services Board (SRSB) changed on the  29th November, 2006 by way of an amendment to the Criminal Justice Act, 2006. A key development in this regard is that the bed management role  and phone line service for referral of children to detention schools has transferred to the Irish Youth Justice <Col N="354"/>service from the SRSB.  S.I. No. 586 of 2006 refers.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also amends a number of other provisions of the 2001 Act, including the area of youth detention. In this regard I would like to inform the Deputy that responsibility for this issue will transfer from the Department of Education and Science to my Department, and preparation for the introduction of the new detention system is well underway.  Significant work has also been carried out by the Probation Service to implement the community sanction provisions outlined in the legislation.</P>
        <P>The following table lists the sections and subsections which have yet to be commenced and which come within the remit of my Department.  The table also lists the new sections and amendments introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which await commencement. As previously mentioned it is intended that all outstanding provisions of the Act will commence on 1st March, 2007.</P><Col N="353"/>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware of the changes in recent years aimed at bringing about improvements in the youth justice system and I am pleased to say that I have secured additional resources, as published in the recent estimates, to support changes being made in this area, including the establishment of the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS).  Funding for Young Person&rsquo;s Probation, which was established <Col N="354"/>last year and implements certain provisions of the Children Act 2001, has increased fourfold from &euro;1.39 million in 2006 to &euro;6.98 million in 2007.  The Garda Youth Diversion Projects, a crime prevention measure, have had budgetary increases rising from &euro;5.3 million in 2004 to &euro;9.8 million for 2007.  I have already increased the number of projects from 64 to 84 and I intend to increase this to over 100 projects by the end of 2007.  </P>
        <P>The Youth Justice Programme in the National Development Plan commits to spending &euro;224 million to support youth justice programmes and to further expand the number of diversion projects to almost 130 projects nationwide.  It also allocates &euro;143 million for the redevelopment of the children detention schools over the life of the Plan.  In addition to the direct expenditure on youth justice the Government continues significant expenditure on programmes to promote <Col N="355"/>health and well-being and on programmes to combat economic, social and educational disadvantage which are factors which impact indirectly on youth offending.</P>
        <P>This investment is being made in the context of structural reforms in the management and development of youth justice strategy.  The IYJS, which is an executive office of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, also comes within the policy environment of the Office of the Minister for Children to link up with the wider issues affecting children&rsquo;s lives.  In committing these resources in the area of youth justice it is my view that the lives of children who offend and that of their communities will be improved and that this is being achieved through interventions aimed at rehabilitation, challenging offending behaviour and providing for the welfare and care needs of young people who come into conflict with the law.</P>
        <P>With regard to the overall rate of crime, we need to be conscious of what the statistics taken over a prolonged period show.  The crime rate per 1,000 of the population has dropped from 26 per 1,000 in 2003, the first full year of the present Government, to 24.5 per 1,000 in 2006, the lowest it has been during the period of this Government.  By way of comparison, during 1995 there were 29 crimes per 1,000 population and in 1996 there were 28 crimes per 1,000 of the population.  While this downward trend is welcome I have expressed concern over events that we have seen recently and I am committed to a programme of continuing development in terms of both legislation and resources.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Garda authorities are currently finalising the tender process for the installation of three Garda CCTV Systems in Ballyfermot, Clondalkin and Tullamore.  These three towns were chosen as representative of the average size of a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na CCTV system, containing a good cross-section of the type of urban area in which Garda CCTV is typically deployed.  These systems will use wireless CCTV technology which will allow CCTV cameras to be redeployed as necessary to meet changing policing requirements.  Contractors will be required to complete the deployment of these CCTV systems within 3 months from the date of contract.</P>
        <P>Further such projects are now under preparation by the Garda Commissioner as part of the process of outsourcing Garda CCTV systems. <Col N="357"/>Clonmel will be considered together with the remainder of the Garda CCTV Programme.</P>
        <P>I also wish to inform the Deputy that an initial grant of &euro;5,000 has been allocated to Clonmel RAPID Crime Prevention, Safety &amp; Security Task Group to enable it to prepare proposals for a local Community CCTV system.  Pobal have invited all of the groups who received such funding to submit final proposals before the end of January 2007.</P>
        <P>In addition, a new round of funding under the Community Based CCTV Scheme was advertised on 1 December 2006 with a closing date of 28 February 2007.  It is open to any organisation from Clonmel to submit an application for grant aid from my Department of up to &euro;100,000 under this Scheme. In addition, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has given a commitment to provide successful applications from RAPID areas with a further grant to a maximum of &euro;100,000 subject to the total grant aid from both Departments not exceeding &euro;200,000 or 100% of the capital costs of the project, whichever is the lesser.</P>

        <Quest> the number of homicides in the State involving the use of firearms from 1 June 2002 to 1 December 2006; the number of the homicides involving firearms committed during this period that have resulted in successful convictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table shows the numbers of murder offences recorded where a firearm was used and the numbers of detections, proceedings commenced and convictions in respect of those murders between 1 June, 2002 and 1 December 2006.  It is anticipated that the number of convictions obtained will increase as the number of proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil is central to the strategy of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating serious crime and in particular murder.  The Operation, which commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in May, 2005 and was subsequently extended nationwide at my request, has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high-profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.  Notable improvements have been achieved in the recorded number of incidents of crime being targeted by the Operation.  In particular, I am pleased to note the increase of 34% in detections of possession of firearms in the fourth quarter of 2006 which I believe has contributed to the reduction of 3.4% in discharges of firearms.  I believe that Operation Anvil has also contributed to the increase in that quarter of detections of offences of possession of drugs for sale or supply <Col N="359"/>which is closely associated with many murders using firearms.</P>
        <P>In addition to the introduction of Operation Anvil, the Garda Commissioner in November 2005 augmented the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 Garda members to address the problem of criminal gang activity.  Enforcement by the Unit has resulted in further firearms being seized and a number of persons arrested, thereby disrupting their criminal activities.  There has also been an increase in Garda monitoring and targeting of individuals and groups involved in armed crime in particular. In December last, the Commissioner allocated an additional 20 officers to the Bureau.</P>
        <P>A wide range of provisions to combat gun crime were introduced in the Criminal Justice Act, 2006.  With effect from 1 November, mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, came into effect for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest.</P>
        <P>Recent events, particularly the deaths of wholly innocent members of the public caught up in internecine gangland conflict, have made it tragically clear that what has been achieved already must be built on so that we can protect our society from the dangers in our midst. A Government can have no greater priority than the safety of its people and it is against that background that we have taken a series of decisions which involve a comprehensive programme of measures to <Col N="360"/>ensure that the full resources of the State are brought to bear as never before against the activities of those who have showed a callous disregard for the rule of law.</P>
        <P>On 19 December last, the Government agreed my proposals for an unprecedented package of measures which includes:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A further increase of 1,000 in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to bring the total to 15,000 over the next three years;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Sanction for 300 additional civilian administrative support posts for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The recruitment of the 7 senior civilian posts recommended in the recent reports from Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole and Maurice Hayes;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An increase in the retirement age for Garda&iacute;, Sergeants and Inspectors from 57 to 60;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A proportionate increase in the targeted strength of the Garda Reserve from 900 to 1500;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Increased staffing for the Forensic Science Laboratory, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Courts Service;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />No limit on funds available for the Witness Protection Programme.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I will shortly be putting legislative proposals to Government.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that murders involving the use of firearms tend to have lower conviction rates than other murders.  This is not unique to Ireland.  I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the highest priority is given by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the investigation of murders and the detection of those responsible.</P><Col N="359"/>

        <P>Advertisements inviting applications for renewal of permission to remain granted under the IBC/05 scheme were placed in National Newspapers this morning 31 January, 2007.</P>
        <P>Applications must be made on the official IBC renewal form which sets out the requirements for renewal and which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website (www.justice.ie). Hard copies of the form will also be available at the Irish Naturalization and Immigration Service (INIS), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 and Garda District Headquarters stations outside Dublin. Forms will also be distributed to various non-governmental organisations working with immigrants and asylum seekers.</P>
        <P>Applications for renewal for permission to remain granted in January, February or March 2005 must be submitted by post to the IBC Unit by 2 April 2007 at the latest. All other applications must be submitted one month in advance of the date on which the current permission to remain in the State expires.</P>
        <P>Pending examination of their application for renewal submitted under the above arrangements, applicants whose permission has expired and who require renewal of permission for employment or urgent travel purposes should attend their local registration office.  Such requests will be examined on a case by case basis.  Guidelines to assist applicants in making their application are available with the application form.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Garda Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.</P>
        <P>These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.</P>
        <P>Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>Finally, the current recruitment drive to increase the personnel strength of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na in line with Agreed Programme for Government commitments is fully on target with a combined strength (all ranks) of both attested Gardai and recruits in training numbering 14,068 as on 31 December 2006.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner is currently drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and, in this context, the policing needs of Tallaght will be given the fullest consideration.</P>

	<P>On foot of my proposal, the Government decided last year that a commission of investigation should be established into the making of a confession by the late Dean <Col N="363"/>Lyons about the tragic deaths of Ms. Mary Callinan and Ms Sylvia Shiels in March 1997 in Grangegorman Dublin 7.  A draft of the Order establishing the Commission and a statement of reasons for its establishment were approved by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I published the Report of the Commission of Investigation into the Dean Lyons case on 1 September 2006 and it was comprehensively debated in this House on 29 and 30 November, 2006. I believe the Report, based on the sworn evidence of all relevant witnesses to a senior counsel of considerable experience and integrity, Mr George Birmingham SC, offers a thorough independent analysis of the relevant facts &mdash; including those matters to which the Deputy refers.   The Report is available on the website of my Department. A number of copies were also placed in the Oireachtas library on my instructions.</P>

	<P>As I stated in reply to Question no. 104 of the 9th November 2006, my colleague, the Minister for Transport, has raised this suggestion with me.  The Secretary General of my Department subsequently brought the proposal to the attention of the Courts Service, which has now forwarded its views.</P>
        <P>Traffic courts are held on a regular basis in Dublin.  In the judgment of the Courts Service, however, there would not be a sufficient volume of cases to warrant a dedicated traffic court in Districts outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  As the Deputy will appreciate, because each District Court is a court of local and limited jurisdiction, it  can only deal with cases that occur within the District which it serves.</P>
        <P>The levels and types of business coming before the courts are continually monitored to ensure that delays in hearing cases are kept to a minimum. Systems are reviewed to ensure that potential backlogs are detected early so that allocation of resources can be properly planned.  It is a matter for the President of the District Court to decide how business will be allocated among the resources available in terms of both judges and accommodation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253 and 254 together.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as at 31 December, 2006 was 12,954. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,252 (or 21%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The number of recruits in training at the Garda College as at the 31 December, 2006 was 1,114 which resulted in a combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training of 14,068 as of that date. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a <Col N="368"/>package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed that the personnel strength (all ranks) of each of the Garda Divisional and District Drugs Units as at 31 December, 2004, 2005 and 2006 was as set out below.</P>
        <P>The total personnel strength of Divisional Drug Units has increased from 273 to 283 over the period 31 December, 2004 to 31 December, 2006. As with any large organisation, on any given day personnel strengths of district and local drug units may fluctuate due to promotions, retirements and transfers.</P>

        <P>It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within Garda Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs.

        <P FLI="0">The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>
        <P>The procedures employed to assess an applicant for naturalisation are as set out in summary form below.</P>
        <P>Upon receipt, each application is examined to determine if the statutory application is completed fully.  Incomplete application forms are returned to the applicant for amendment.  Valid applications are then examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.  Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and enquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary.  Since this procedure was introduced on 1 April 2005, over 3,000 applicants who applied since that date have been found to be ineligible.  All such applicants are informed of any shortfall in their residency and will be able to reapply when they have the required residency.</P>
        <P>The next stage of the process involves assessing an applicant&rsquo;s financial status in respect of their ability to support themselves in the State.  Enquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard.  At the same time enquiries are also made with the Garda Siochana to clarify if the applicant can be deemed to be of good character.  There may also be circumstances in individual cases which require a greater level of investigation than other cases.  Once all enquiries are completed, the file is referred to me for a decision.  The Deputy will appreciate that these processes can take a lengthy time to complete.</P>
        <P>The above procedures have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the <Col N="372"/>integrity of the naturalisation process.  Consequently, having regard to the resources available, which are kept under constant review, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved.</P>

	<P>Following the submission to me in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, I decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, I am pleased to note that the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics for the third and fourth quarters of 2006.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.</P>
        <P>I have requested the CSO to provide the information sought by the Deputy directly to him.</P>
        <P>The provision of secure parking for bicycles in Dublin City is the responsibility of Dublin City Council.</P>

       <P LI="1">(b) the Minister was satisfied, on the advice of a Minister of the Government, that the applicant had established a manufacturing or international services or other acceptable wealth and job creating project here that was viable and involved a substantial investment by the applicant, and</P>
        <P LI="1">(c) all other requirements of the Act had been complied with.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the period 1989 to 1994, 66 investors (plus 39 spouses and children) were naturalised.  The Report of the Review Group of the Investment based naturalisation scheme, which I published in August 2002, reports &ldquo;that there was a significant number of cases in which the requirements of the Statement of Intent either were not adhered to or where evidence that they were adhered to is absent from the Department&rsquo;s files.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Arising out of a view that there should be a more formal and transparent approach to investment based naturalisation, new guidelines were introduced in 1994, which took the form of Terms of Reference of an Advisory Group to the Minister. The Group was to examine each application for naturalisation based on investment, with the assistance of evaluation/advice from relevant agencies where necessary and, in making their recommendations to the Minister, would apply the following criteria:&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) Substantial residence must be purchased and retained in ownership for a period of at least 5 years with an undertaking to reside in the State for a minimum of 60 days in the 2 years following naturalisation.</P>
       <P LI="1">(b) The level of investment must involve a net contribution of at least &pound;1 million per applicant.</P>
       <P LI="1">(c) Where the investment is in the form of a loan it shall be for a duration of at least 7 years at an interest rate not greater that 1 per cent below the representative Government bond yield on the secondary market, or not greater than 1 per cent below DIBOR, whichever is lower.  The loan shall be made by the applicant direct to the firm concerned, without involvement by any intermediary.  The loan arrangement shall be transparent and open to scrutiny and shall be such as to prevent the loan being factored or sold on.  The loan shall not be <Col N="379"/>secured by the assets of the company in which the investment is to be made.</P>
      <P LI="1">(d) As ordinarily naturalisation would be for life, the duration of the investment should be for a significant period; at the very least 5 years.</P>
       <P LI="1">(e) the number of jobs created or maintained must be readily quantifiable and arise from the investment only.</P>
       <P LI="1">(f) Audited and certified confirmation of the investment to be available to the Group from an established auditing firm of accountants to the effect that the investment has taken place in accordance with the rules of the scheme for naturalisation.</P>
       <P LI="1">(g) The investment will be monitored by Forf&aacute;s to ensure that the conditions of the investment are being maintained and, in the event that they are not, will inform the Group who, in turn, will inform the Minister for Justice with a view to revocation of citizenship.</P>
        <P LI="1">(h) Police certificate of character must be provided by authorities in country of origin (and, if required, from the Police in any country where the applicant has resided or carried on business or maintained substantial investments) together with express permission to the authorities in Ireland to enquire behind it.</P>
        <P LI="1">(i) Annual certification by an established auditing firm of accountants to Forf&aacute;s that the investment is being maintained for the appropriate period.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If approved by the Minister, written assurances in respect of the various requirements of the terms of reference were obtained from the applicant prior to the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.   41 investors and 37 minor children of investors were naturalised since the introduction of the Terms of Reference.  The Review Group reported that there appeared to be a greater degree of compliance with the Terms of Reference.</P>
        <P>It has been the practice of successive Ministers for Justice not to publish details of individual naturalisation cases other than those which are required by law, that is, the publication in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il of the name and address of the applicant, the date naturalised and whether he or she was an adult or minor.  Applicants linked to investments &mdash; and for that matter all applicants &mdash; have an expectation that there will be no additional form of publicity about their applications other than that which is prescribed by law.</P>
        <P>I am on the record in this House some years ago in relation to the naturalisation in 1990 of eleven persons under the Scheme.  Question No. 5 of 17 October 2002 sets out the background to this matter.  I subsequently informed the House <Col N="380"/>in response to Question No. 193 on 13 May 2003 that I had received legal advice to the effect that grounds did not then exist for the revocation at that time of the naturalisation certificates in question.  The Deputy can be assured that if the circumstances of any particular case are brought to my attention, I will have no hesitation in using my statutory powers of revocation to the fullest extent possible.</P>
        <P>The investment based naturalisation scheme was abolished in April 1998 and, as the Deputy will be aware, I introduced provisions in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004 to ensure that this scheme will not be re-instituted and to rule out any future such scheme.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Kilkenny is one of the 17 areas which form part of the current Garda CCTV Programme, as follows (listed alphabetically): Athlone, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght, Tullamore and Waterford.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities are currently finalising the tender process for the installation of three Garda CCTV Systems in Ballyfermot, Clondalkin and Tullamore.  These three towns were chosen as representative of the average size of a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na CCTV system, containing a good cross-section of the type of urban area in which Garda CCTV is typically deployed.  These systems will use wireless CCTV technology which will allow CCTV cameras to be redeployed as necessary to meet changing policing requirements.  Contractors will be required to complete the deployment of these CCTV systems within 3 months from the date of contract.</P>
        <P>Further such projects are now under preparation by the Garda Commissioner as part of the process of outsourcing Garda CCTV systems. Kilkenny will be considered together with the remainder of the Garda CCTV Programme.</P>
        <P>I also wish to inform the Deputy that an initial grant of &euro;5,000  has been allocated to Kilkenny County Council to enable it to prepare proposals for a local Community CCTV system. Pobal have invited all of the groups who received such funding to submit final proposals before the end of January 2007.</P><Col N="381"/>
        <P>In addition, a new round of funding under the Community Based CCTV Scheme was advertised on 1 December 2006 with a closing date of 28 February 2007.   It is open to any organisation from Kilkenny to submit an application for grant aid from my Department of up to &euro;100,000 under this Scheme.</P>
        <P>The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has given a commitment to provide successful applications from RAPID areas with a further grant to a maximum of &euro;100,000 subject to the total grant aid from both Departments not exceeding &euro;200,000 or 100% of the capital costs of the project, whichever is the lesser.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 269 to 272, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Foreign nationals granted residence in the State should be able to support themselves without becoming a burden on the State&rsquo;s resources. Different conditions may be applied to different categories of foreign nationals depending on their residence status.</P>
        <P>In general, non-European Economic Area (EEA) nationals lawfully employed or self-employed in the State are not expected to have private medical insurance to cover themselves in the event of illness, although there is nothing to prevent the application of this condition where <Col N="382"/>it is considered necessary with reference to the circumstances of the individual&rsquo;s case.</P>
        <P>The position in regard to a non-EEA national married to an EU citizen is set out at Regulation 6(2) of the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006 which transposed the Free Movement of Persons Directive from 2004.  EU citizens are not required to have private medical insurance where they are workers or self-employed in the State.  However, they are expected to be in a position, whether through employment or otherwise, that they can support their spouse and dependant family members without being an undue burden on the State.  Therefore, while it is not prescribed, evidence of medical insurance may serve to provide assurances as to their financial self-sufficiency.</P>
        <P>A non-EEA citizen who is not economically active, e.g. a student or a retired person, would normally be required to have private medical insurance while they are present in the State.</P>
        <P>A non-EEA worker who becomes unemployed would be expected to seek and obtain other lawful employment if they wish to remain in the State.  During a short period of seeking employment it would not be expected that he/she would have private medical insurance.</P>
        <P>In regard to a non-EEA citizen who applies for residence on the basis of his/her marriage to an Irish national, it should be noted that there is no automatic entitlement to residence in the State on the basis of marriage to an Irish national.   However, having private medical insurance is not one of the requirements considered when assessing an application for permission to remain in the State from a non-EEA citizen who is married to an Irish national.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, <Col N="383"/>I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I have also been informed that the projected number of Garda&iacute; who are due to retire from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2007 is 356 (all ranks).</P>
        <P>Garda management state that this projection is based on variables and is therefore subject to change over time. This projection is calculated for the Force as a whole and is not available by rank or Division.</P>
        <P>I should also mention that I have made Regulations increasing the retirement age for Garda&iacute;, Sergeants and Inspectors from 57 to 60 years of age with effect from 22 December, 2006. This will help to maximise Garda strength and ensure continuity of key skills within the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Thanks to this decision there will be no compulsory retirements from Garda, Garda Sergeant and Inspector ranks on age grounds over the next two years.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 276 and 277 together.</P><Col N="385"/>
        <P>The purpose of the safety camera initiative is to enhance overall road safety and help reduce the numbers of deaths and serious injuries on our roads.  The performance criteria to be applied will be determined by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the deployment of cameras will be focused on locations where there is an established or prospective risk of collisions. The Garda authorities inform me that  the safety camera project will commence with approximately 500-600 locations countrywide (about 15-20 locations per local authority area). Speed monitoring will take place on the basis of a matrix which will link the monitoring to speed related collision data.  The number of locations will be increased as necessary to achieve the targeted road safety objectives of increasing compliance with speed limits across the entire road network,  reducing the speed of vehicles at locations that have a speed related collision history  and  acting as a deterrent to driving at excessive speed.</P>
        <P>There are no plans, at this time, to use the proposed safety camera system to enforce bus lane compliance. Driving a vehicle (other than a taxi in the course of business) in a bus lane during the period of operation is a fixed charge offence with effect from 3 April, 2006  strictly enforced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Provision in legislation for the award of penalty points for offences such as bus lane non-compliance is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Transport.</P>
        <P>The requirements of a system to monitor the individual speed of vehicles and one to gain broader information with a view to traffic management obviously differ and  I am  informed that it is not currently envisaged that the safety camera system will be used for traffic management or linked to the traffic control system in Dublin or other cities.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks) of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength (all ranks) of each Community Policing Unit based at Pearse <Col N="387"/>St, Harcourt Terrace, Kevin Street, Donnybrook, Rathmines and Terenure Garda Stations as at 31 <Col N="388"/>December, 2000 to 2006 (inclusive) was as set out in the table hereunder:</P><Col N="387"/>

        <P>I am further informed that the Ratoath area of Co. Meath forms part of the Ashbourne Garda District. The personnel strength of the Ashbourne District as at 31 December, 1997 and as at 24 January, 2007 was 56 and 77 (all ranks) respectively.

In addition, the personnel strength of Ashbourne Garda Station as at 31 December, 1997 and as at 24 January, 2007 and was 23 and 49 (all ranks) respectively.

        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently no plans to open a Garda Station in Ratoath and that local Garda management report that the Ratoath area is well patrolled by Garda&iacute; from Ashbourne Garda Station. They are assisted by the Traffic Units from Kells, Drogheda and Ashbourne Garda Stations along with members on Operation Anvil.</P>
        <P>I am also advised that a full time Community Garda was appointed to the Ratoath area in 2004.</P>
        <P>The level of Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</P>
        <P>The situation will be kept under review by the Garda Commissioner and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Ratoath area will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I commenced Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 regarding civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by an adult on 1 January, 2007. </P>
        <P>A person behaves in an anti-social manner if the person causes or, in the circumstances, is likely to cause, to one or more persons who are not of the same household as the person (a) harassment, (b) significant or persistent alarm, distress, fear or intimidation, or (c) significant or persistent impairment of their use or enjoyment of their property.</P>
        <P>The first step in the procedure set out in the Act is that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issues a behaviour warning to a person who has behaved in an anti-social manner.  The behaviour warning will contain specific information.  It will include a statement from the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issuing it that the person concerned has behaved in an anti-social manner and will give details of the unacceptable behaviour, such as what the behaviour was and the time when and the place where it took place.  It will make a demand either that the people cease the behaviour or otherwise address the behaviour in a way set out in the warning.  Finally, the behaviour warning will warn the person that failure to comply with this demand may result in an application to the courts for a civil order or that issuing of a subsequent behaviour order might also result in an application to the courts for a civil order.</P>
        <P>If a behaviour warning or a series of warnings does not result in the person changing his or her behaviour, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may apply to the District Court for a civil order to prohibit the person from doing anything specified in the order.  Only a senior member of the Garda can make the court application, which means an officer not below the rank of superintendent.  An order will <Col N="393"/>remain in force for a period specified in the order, which cannot be longer than two years.  If no period is specified, an order will remain in force for two years. The penalties for breach of an order will be a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or a maximum of six months imprisonment or both.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Children, Mr Brian Lenihan T.D., has developed a range of separate procedures to apply to young people which were framed in the context of the overall philosophy and policy that underpins the Children Act and contain significant additional features to the civil orders for persons over 18. Every effort is made to provide an opportunity for the child and his or her parents or guardians to address the behavioural problems in a way that minimises contact with the criminal justice system. These proposals, which come into effect from 1 March next, will also ensure there will be full parental involvement at all relevant stages.</P>
        <P>Information on behaviour warnings and civil orders made will be available to all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the PULSE system.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will monitor the implementation of these plans and will inform my Department on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>Preparations are currently being finalised for initiatives to increase public awareness and knowledge of these provisions of the Act.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Under Section 8 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, Garda&iacute; have the power to caution persons they suspect to be loitering in an area for the purpose of prostitution to leave immediately the area and, if the person fails or refuses, a Garda has the power to arrest them, without warrant, and charge them with an offence. In its efforts to prevent loitering for the purpose of prostitution, Garda&iacute; use their powers under this section and section 7 (soliciting or importuning for purposes of prostitution) of the Act, as well as imposing certain bail conditions on persistent offenders.</P>
        <P>I commenced Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 regarding civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by an adult on 1 January, 2007.</P><Col N="397"/>
        <P>A person behaves in an anti-social manner if the person causes or, in the circumstances, is likely to cause, to one or more persons who are not of the same household as the person (a) harassment, (b) significant or persistent alarm, distress, fear or intimidation, or (c) significant or persistent impairment of their use or enjoyment of their property.</P>
        <P>The first step in the procedure set out in the Act is that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issues a behaviour warning to a person who has behaved in an anti-social manner.  The behaviour warning will contain specific information.  It will include a statement from the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issuing it that the person concerned has behaved in an anti-social manner and will give details of the unacceptable behaviour, such as what the behaviour was and the time when and the place where it took place.  It will make a demand either that the person cease the behaviour or otherwise address the behaviour in a way set out in the warning.  Finally, the behaviour warning will warn the person that failure to comply with this demand may result in an application to the courts for a civil order or that issuing of a subsequent behaviour order might also result in an application to the courts for a civil order.</P>
        <P>If a behaviour warning or a series of warnings does not result in the person changing his or her behaviour, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may apply to the District Court for a civil order to prohibit the person from doing anything specified in the order.  Only a senior member of the Garda can make the court application, which means an officer not below the rank of superintendent.  An order will remain in force for a period specified in the order, which cannot be longer than two years.  If no period is specified, an order will remain in force for two years. The penalties for breach of an order will be a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or a maximum of six months imprisonment or both.</P>
        <P>Depending on the particular circumstances of any case, the activities of a prostitute in an area may amount to behaving in an anti-social manner as defined in the Act, in which case the remedies available under the Act can be considered.</P>

        <Quest> his views on whether cocaine is being used as casually and widely as is claimed in a newspaper article of 14 January 2007 (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[1577/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed that currently, the joint Prevalence Survey undertaken in partnership between the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD &mdash; Republic of Ireland) and the Drugs and Alcohol Information and Research Unit (DAIRU &mdash; Northern Ireland) is generally regarded as the most reliable baseline data on drug prevalence in Ireland.  </P>
        <P>That study, which surveyed 8,442 people aged 15-64 in Ireland and in Northern Ireland between October 2002 and April 2003, reported that 3.1% of the population had ever used cocaine, 1.1% had used it in the last 12 months and 0.3% used in the last month.</P>
        <P>However, the Government is of course aware that all available indicators point to an increased prevalence of cocaine usage in recent times. More detailed evidence on the current cocaine situation will arise from the all island Drug Prevalence Survey 2006/07 being conducted by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, which is in progress at present. This study will give a clearer picture of the current levels of usage of cocaine.</P>
        <P>The Government remains resolutely committed to tackling the problem through our National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008.</P>
        <P>The National Strategy addresses the problem under pillar headings of education and prevention, supply reduction, treatment and rehabilitation and research and is firmly founded on the principle that drug misuse needs to be addressed in an integrated manner across these headings through a co-operative approach involving the statutory, community and voluntary treatment sectors.</P>
        <P>The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under the stewardship of my colleague, Minister of State Mr. Noel Ahern, is the lead Government Department in co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy.</P>
        <P>Efforts to tackle the problem of cocaine use are broadly based to include measures aimed at both supply and demand reduction, including awareness initiatives.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s remit in this area, while not exclusively, is primarily in the area of drug supply reduction and drug law enforcement remains a key feature of the Government&rsquo;s drug policy framework.</P>
        <P>Evidence of increasing misuse of any drug is, of course, a matter of concern and the Garda authorities continue to take a number of <Col N="402"/>measures to address the problem on the supply reduction side.</P>
        <P>The Garda National Drugs Unit and local drugs units conduct intelligence-driven operations to target individuals suspected of involvement in the distribution of cocaine. Drug units and community policing personnel are engaged in intelligence gathering on individuals and groups suspected of involvement in the sale and distribution of the drug. There is also targeted patrolling by uniform and plain-clothes personnel of problem areas in order to detect and disrupt persons involved in such activity.</P>
        <P>Tackling organised crime and drug trafficking is primarily achieved through the use of specialist units and targeted intelligence led operations.</P>
        <P>The Organised Crime Unit, established in November 2005, in conjunction with the Garda National Drugs Unit and local Garda&iacute;, continues to implement initiatives such as Operations Anvil and Oak which target criminals involved in the trafficking of drugs</P>
        <P>Significant drug seizures including the considerable increase in the amount of cocaine seized over the last number of years have been made as a result of these operations.</P>
        <P>These operations, which are ongoing, continue to dismantle drug trafficking networks and have led to the arrest in recent times of major criminals both based here and abroad who are involved in the drugs trade</P>
        <P>The record level of resources, both in financial and personnel terms, being made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year is proof of the Government&rsquo;s commitment and determination to ensure that the Garda authorities will continue to implement targeted, intelligence and high intensity operations against organised crime with a special focus on drugs crime.</P>
        <P>Furthermore we are ensuring that our law enforcement agencies have a strong legislative platform from which to operate in their work tackling those involved in such criminal activity.</P>
        <P>While our legislative package for tackling drug trafficking is already viewed as being one of the most stringent in Europe, the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for further measures which will enhance the powers of the Garda&iacute; in the investigation and prosecution of drug offences.</P>
        <P>Finally, I can assure the Deputy that my colleague Minister of State, Mr. Noel Ahern T.D., is fully aware of the issue of cocaine in our society and recently commissioned a joint briefing paper on the issue from the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) and the National Drug Strategy Team (NDST).  He is currently in consultation with the Departments and Agencies involved on the issues raised and the recommendations made in that paper.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, in addition to the Community based CCTV grant aided scheme, Garda CCTV Schemes are currently operational in the following 9 areas: Dublin South Central, Dublin North Central, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Tralee, Bray, Dundalk and D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  In addition, a scheme for Finglas has been approved and funded and some work remains in order to complete this project.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that approval has been given for the installation of CCTV at 17 Town Centre locations, as follows (listed alphabetically): Athlone, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght, Tullamore and Waterford.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities are currently finalising the tender process for the installation of three Garda CCTV Systems in Ballyfermot, Clondalkin and Tullamore.  These three towns were chosen as representative of the average size of a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na CCTV system, containing a good cross-section of the type of urban area in which Garda CCTV is typically deployed.  These systems will use wireless CCTV technology which will allow CCTV cameras to be redeployed as necessary to meet changing policing requirements.  Contractors will be required to complete the deployment of these CCTV systems within 3 months from the date of contract.</P>
        <P>Further such projects are now under preparation by the Garda Commissioner as part of the process of outsourcing Garda CCTV systems.</P>

	<P>I have indicated in the past that I recognise the case made for dispensing with the taking of contemporaneous notes during interviews and for relying instead on electronic recording.  I recognise, too, that this would give rise to a number of legal, operational and procedural issues.</P>
        <P>In its third report (which I laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 18 March 2005), the Steering Committee on Audio and Audio/Video Recording of Garda Questioning of detained Persons examined this issue in some detail and recommended that current arrangements continue for the present.  Factors considered by the Committee included the logistical challenge in making transcripts available at short notice, and checking their contents against the taped version, the resource implications of this, and the question of presentation of tapes in Court.  Currently tapes are only played in court when there is a dispute about the written evidence presented.  The Committee also thought it important, if there were to be a change to the Judges Rules dispensing with full contemporaneous notes, to assess any impact this might have on the conduct of criminal trials.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that any move away from the taking of contemporaneous notes would have to address these concerns.  The existing regulations dealing with the electronic recording of interviews are now being revised, and in this context I have asked the Garda Commissioner for his views, from an operational policing perspective.  I will take his views, and the final views of the Steering Committee, fully into account in my finalisation of the new regulations.</P>

	<P>The person con<Col N="412"/>cerned, a Nigerian national arrived in the State on 4 January, 1999 and applied for asylum.  His claim for refugee status was considered under the process then applicable and was refused by the Asylum Division of my Department.  He was notified of the decision on 28 January, 2000.  He appealed this decision to the appropriate body at the time, the Appeals Authority, which affirmed the decision of the Asylum Division.  He was notified of this decision on 10 November, 2000.</P>
        <P>In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, the person concerned was informed on 10 November, 2000 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was, in accordance with the Act, given the options of making representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons why he should not be deported i.e. be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before the deportation order was made; or consenting to the making of the deportation order.  Representations setting out reasons why he should not be deported were subsequently received.</P>
        <P>I expect the case file to be submitted to me shortly for decision.  This decision will be taken having regard to considerations specified in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended.  These considerations include matters relating to the common good, the person&rsquo;s family and domestic circumstances, as well as humanitarian considerations.  Consideration will also be given to the prohibition of refoulement which is contained in section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended.</P>
        <P>With regards the work status of the person concerned, he was issued with a right to work letter on 29 March, 2000.  However, once the person concerned is issued with a notification of intention to deport this right to work letter is no longer valid.</P>

        <P>Police certificates are issued, free of charge, to individual applicants by the Garda Superintendent of the Garda District where the applicant resides for the following purposes: requests from non-national consular authorities; applications for non-national visas; and establishing a business in another European Union Member State.</P>
        <P>In addition, individuals may submit requests under the Data Protection Acts 1988-2003 to the <Col N="413"/>Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU), Racecourse Road, Thurles, Co. Tipperary, seeking disclosure of personal information from the Garda Criminal Records Database.  Any such request must be accompanied by a fee payment (in the form of a cheque or postal order) of &euro;6.35, together with evidence of identity.  The response issues directly to the individual applicant.</P>
        <P>Finally, the GCVU provides a criminal record vetting service to registered recruiting organisations in respect of, inter alia, persons recruited to work with children and vulnerable adults, with the written consent of the persons to be vetted.  Vetting applications may be submitted only by the registered recruiting organisation, and a disclosure thereon is issued by the GCVU directly to the requesting organisation.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The combined strength (all ranks) of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068.  Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000.  The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met.  The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that no Garda Stations in County Mayo have been closed over the past 10 years.</P>
        <P>The personnel strength of the Mayo Division as at 31 December, 1997 and 2006 was 258 and 279 respectively.  This represents an increase of 21 (or 8.1%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer in Co. Mayo to allocate personnel within the Division on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>

	<P>On 18 January 2007, Tetra Ireland Limited was selected by the Department of Finance as the preferred bidder for the provision of the National Digital Radio Services.  This is a key milestone in the plan to provide a secure digital radio service for emergency services, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other non-commercial public bodies. </P>
        <P>The preferred bidder will now work with the relevant Departments and Agencies to complete a Service Performance Evaluation (SPE).  This will involve the provision of a live working system covering a significant geographical area in the Dublin and surrounding areas.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as one of the principle users of the service, will play a major role in the evaluation and testing of the network and equipment . The SPE will enable the preferred bidder, Tetra Ireland, to demonstrate that it can deliver all the aspects of the system and provide a fully working solution that meets all of the requirements of an emergency services network.</P>
        <P>The SPE will be completed within a six month timeframe. In parallel with the SPE, the Department of Finance will conduct contract negotiations with the preferred bidder and, subject to satisfactory completion of these negotiations and a successful outcome of the SPE, a contract for the provision of the nationwide services will be signed by that Department.  National roll-out will commence immediately thereafter.  It is planned to be fully completed within a two year timeframe.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Deel was a pro-active crime prevention initiative put in place by senior Garda management in a number of adjoining Garda districts along the North Cork/West Limerick border.  The Operation, which involved additional patrols and checkpoints by uniformed and plain-clothes personnel, was carried out in April and May 2005 and again in November and December 2005.  The primary objective of the Operation was to prevent and detect the activities of travelling criminal gangs who were suspected of being involved in burglar<Col N="416"/>ies and other criminal activity within the targeted districts.</P>
        <P>The Operation was very successful in thwarting the activities of such gangs through high visibility policing and resulted in a number of high profile arrests, prosecutions and convictions.</P>
        <P>I am also informed that, following a review, the initiative was reactivated during 2006 under Operation Anvil with a more general focus on the Southern Region.  It is proving particularly successful in tackling night time travelling gangs who specialised in committing burglaries. A number of members of these gangs were arrested and are currently before the courts.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that the Operation is resulting in a significant reduction in the number of burglaries recorded in the Region.</P>

	<P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, initiated a pilot project aimed at combating incidents of graffiti in Dublin City, Galway City and Bray, Co. Wicklow.  Fingal County Council was not included in the pilot project.  This project is separate from, and additional to, the graffiti abatement programmes carried out by the local authorities themselves on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>The identification of graffiti sites in each of the pilot areas is an ongoing process and as soon as sites are identified and reported to my Department immediate arrangements are made to have them cleaned up. To date 879 sites affected by graffiti have been identified in the Dublin City Council area and at present work on cleaning them up has either been completed, is ongoing or is due to commence shortly.  The list of sites identified to date is set out in the attached schedule.</P>

	<P>The application referred to by the Deputy was received in the Visa Office, Dublin on 11th December, 2006.  The decision of the Visa Officer to refuse this application was taken on 2nd January, 2007.</P>
        <P>The Visa Officer who examined the application was not satisfied, on the basis of the documentation submitted, as to the relevance of the <Col N="430"/>English course to the applicant&rsquo;s employment. The financial evidence provided was also deemed insufficient and the applicant&rsquo;s passport was due to expire within six months of the end of the proposed visit.</P>
        <P>An appeal against the refusal decision was received on 23rd January, 2007. Following a re-examination of the application, the decision to refuse was upheld on the same day as the applicant had not adequately addressed the reasons for refusal.  As each applicant is entitled to one appeal only, no further review in this matter can be granted; however it is open to the applicant to make a fresh application.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 provides the legal basis for the operation of authorised checkpoints by Garda&iacute; for the mandatory alcohol testing of drivers, without individual suspicion that the driver has consumed alcohol.  The legislation provides that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not below the rank of Inspector, may authorise the establishment of checkpoints under the section, and requires that the locations and the hours during which checkpoints may be operated must be set out in the authorisation. </P>
        <P>Under the provisions of section 4 an authorisation, or a copy thereof, shall, until the contrary is shown, be sufficient evidence in any proceedings under the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2006, of the facts stated in it, without proof of any signature on it or that the signatory was a person entitled under section 4 to sign it.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is no legal requirement for Garda&iacute; carrying out mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints to carry with them the order authorising the checkpoint.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the procedure followed when persons who fail roadside random breath tests fail to pay the fines levied against them; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that persons who fail mandatory alcohol tests (MAT) do not receive fixed charge notices and therefore payment of <Col N="431"/>fines at that stage does not arise. Under section 4 of the Road Traffic Act, 2006 a person stopped at a MAT checkpoint is required to provide a preliminary breath test. A person who fails or refuses to comply with a MAT may be prosecuted and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;5,000 and/or imprisonment for up to six months.</P>
        <P>Under long-standing legislation, if a Garda as a result of the test forms the opinion at the roadside that a person has consumed an intoxicant then he/she can arrest that person and bring the person back to a Garda station for the purpose of administering an evidential test. The penalty for refusal to provide an evidential test is a fine of up to &euro;5,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 6 months. If a person is charged with the offence of drink driving under road traffic legislation, the case proceeds to the courts and is dealt with under the courts system in the normal manner.</P>

        <P>Advertisements inviting applications for renewal of permission to remain granted under the IBC/05 scheme were placed in National Newspapers this morning 31 January, 2007.</P><Col N="432"/>
        <P>Applications must be made on the official IBC renewal form which sets out the requirements for renewal and which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website (www.justice.ie).  Hard copies of the form will also be available at the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 and Garda District Headquarters stations outside Dublin.  Forms will also be distributed to various non-governmental organisations working with immigrants and asylum seekers.</P>
        <P>Applications for renewal for permission to remain granted in January, February or March 2005 must be submitted by post to the IBC Unit by 2 April 2007 at the latest.  All other applications must be submitted one month in advance of the date on which the current permission to remain in the State expires.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no automatic entitlement to residency in the State for a non-EU national on the basis of marriage to an Irish national.  However, I do consider applications which are made in writing to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department for permission to remain in the State on this separate basis. If granted, the non-EU national will be entitled to reside in the State, work without the requirement of a work permit and operate a business in the State without applying for business permission from my Department.</P>
        <P>A foreign national married to an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended where they have been continuously resident on the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of their application and for two out of the four years prior to that year.  The marriage concerned must be recognised under the laws of the State as subsisting.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service operates four helplines for applicants for visas, citizenship, residency status and related immigration matters.</P>
        <P>I am informed that callers to the helplines are greeted by an automated answering service with recorded information messages and a menu option which effectively asks them which of the four helplines they wish to be connected to.  When automatically put through to the helpline they require, they speak to one of the staff assigned to the helpline.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that the maximum number of calls which are queued to each of the four helplines at any given time is ten.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that there is a balance to be struck between the resources allocated to giving information about applications and dealing with such applications and I can inform her that the allocation of resources in this regard is kept under regular review.</P>

        <P>The Visa Officer who examined the application was not satisfied, on the basis of the documentation submitted, as to the bona fides of the applicant.</P>
        <P>An appeal against the refusal decision was received on 27th November, 2006.  Following a re-examination of the application, the decision to refuse was upheld on 5th December, 2006 as the applicant had not adequately addressed the reason for refusal.  As each applicant is entitled to one appeal only, no further review in this matter can be granted; however it is open to the applicant to make a fresh application.</P>

	<P>As I have indicated to the Deputy by way of response to his recent representations, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  In the case of a non-national applicant who is the spouse of an Irish citizen those conditions are that the applicant must:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be of full age</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be of good character</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be married to the Irish citizen for at least 3 years</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be in a marriage recognised under the laws of the State as subsisting</P><Col N="435"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be living together as husband and wife with the Irish spouse</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the island of Ireland immediately before the date of the application and, during the four years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the island of Ireland amounting to two years.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />intend in good faith to continue to reside in the island of Ireland after naturalisation</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the Citizenship section of my Department in December 2006.  The application was examined and it was determined that the person in question did not have the required reckonable residency as she was not married for three years at the date of application and consequently was not eligible to apply for a certificate of naturalisation at that time. She was informed of this by letter dated 8 January 2007.</P>
        <P>It is open to the person in question to lodge a new application if and when she is in a position to meet the statutory requirements applicable at the time.</P>

An initiative has therefore been put in place, involving increased patrols by Garda&iacute; during the times when these incidents are occurring, and this has resulted in the arrest of a number of persons for such incidents.</P>
        <P>Policing strategies for the area are predicated on the policy of reducing and preventing such incidents and the maintenance of an environment where the quality of life of the residents can be assured and consolidated.

	<P>I am aware of the introduction of a Corporate Manslaughter Bill in the UK in 2006.  The offence was proposed in a UK Law Commission Report in 1996 and the Bill was introduced in Parliament last year.</P>
        <P>The current law in Ireland does allow for a corporate prosecution for manslaughter, but there is considerable uncertainty as to the precise form of that liability.</P>
        <P>In the context of an amendment relating to corporate manslaughter proposed for the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 during the debate in April 2006, I indicated that my Department would give consideration to a separate Bill on this topic.</P>
        <P>That examination is under way and will have regard to a number of aspects raised in the Law Reform Commission Report on Corporate Killing of October 2005.  Consultations are ongoing with other relevant parties, in particular the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, where much of the expertise on company and corporate matters resides.  Following this consultation process, it is expected that legislative proposals will be prepared to bring to Government for approval.</P>

        <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that an applicant for naturalisation must have one year&rsquo;s period of continuous residence in the State before the date of the application and a total amounting to four year&rsquo;s residence in the State in the eight years preceding that period.</P>
        <P>Section 16(g) of that Act provides that I may, in my absolute discretion, waive the statutory conditions in certain circumstances, including where the applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.  In considering applications under this provision, I am generally disposed to waive two years of the normal residency requirement, thereby requiring such applicants to have been resident in the State for three years at the time of application.

        <P>As there were no circumstances apparent in the application which would lead me to depart from the general policy outlined above, I decided to refuse the application based on the fact that the applicant was not in the State three years at the time of the application.

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his D&aacute;il Question No. 154 of 14 December 2006.  The status of the person concerned remains as set out in that Reply. </P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deputy might wish to note that, in addition to the eleven factors contained in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), I must also have regard for Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement before making a deportation order. This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to the country in ques<Col N="441"/>tion and other third countries.  In this case, I am entirely satisfied that there are no refoulement related reasons to prevent the deportation of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was classified as evading his deportation on 31 October 2003. As such he is liable to arrest and detention under Section 5 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, for the purposes of ensuring his removal from the State.  I would therefore urge the person concerned to come forward and present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau without further delay.</P>
        <P>The person concerned is awaiting deportation following a comprehensive examination of his asylum claim and of his application to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum and subsequently for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.  The enforcement of the deportation order is now an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 383 to 385, inclusive, and 387 together.</P>
        <P>Policy in the law on barring, protection and safety orders is comprehensively contained in the Domestic Violence Acts of 1996 and 2002 so as to apply equally in support of men and women whose safety or welfare requires it because of the conduct of the other spouse or partner. The Act of 1996 prescribes that where the court, on application to it, is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the safety or welfare of the applicant or any dependent person so requires, the court may make either a barring order, a protection order or a safety order.  In the case of the granting of an interim barring order i.e. an order made between the making of an application for a barring order and its determination, the court must (under the Act of 1996) be of the opinion that: (a) there is an immediate risk of significant harm to the applicant or any dependent person if the order is not made immediately, and (b) the granting of a protection order would not be sufficient to protect the applicant or any dependent person.</P>
        <P>In the Act of 2002 I made provision that the application for an interim barring order must be made either on affidavit or on sworn information and, if the order is made ex parte, a note of the evidence given together with the court order and <Col N="446"/>the affidavit or sworn information must be served on the respondent as soon as practicable.</P>
        <P>While I have no proposals for change in the two Acts, their operation continues to be reviewed in my Department. Moreover, I have, in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, provided for the relaxation of the in camera rule by way of allowing preparation of reports in family law proceedings while continuing to respect the confidential nature of family law cases.</P>
        <P>Until recently, it has been difficult to draw any reliable conclusions on the outcomes of family law cases due to the strict application of the in camera rule.  This, however, changed as a result of Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 (Section 40(3)) Regulations 2005 (S. I. No. 337 of 2005).  The regulations allow certain classes of persons &mdash; namely mediators, researchers and persons engaged by the Courts Service &mdash; to attend family court sittings, subject to Ministerial approval, in order to draw up and publish reports.  Approval is subject to certain safeguards including a requirement that the parties to a case or any relevant child would not be identifiable.  Under the scheme, I have approved one family mediator, and several other persons engaged in family law research.</P>
        <P>In addition, in October of last year the Courts Service engaged a family law reporter on a one year pilot basis to record and produce reports on family law proceedings for distribution to the media and the public.  The project will record and create reports of family law proceedings for the first time; will gather, assess and present meaningful statistics on family law matters before the courts; and will assemble and distribute information regarding the family law process and courts.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 386 and 389 together.</P>
        <P>Under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the father of a child may apply to the court for an order giving directions on any question affecting the welfare of the child,  including access to the child.  In making such orders the court has to regard the welfare of the child as the <Col N="447"/>first and paramount consideration.  Where appropriate and practicable, the Court in making any order takes into account the child&rsquo;s wishes in the matter having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  In considering whether to make an order under section 11, the court, further to section 11D (as inserted in the Act of 1964 by the Children Act 1997) must have regard to whether the child&rsquo;s best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis. This provision gives effect to a provision in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
        <P>The Act of 1964 (again by way of amendments in the Children Act 1997) encourages parties to a dispute in relation to a child to agree on the custody or guardianship of or access to a child.  Prior to institution of proceedings the legal representatives of the parties must discuss with them the possibility of agreement.  The Court may adjourn any proceedings to assist agreement between the parties.  These legislative provisions are extensive. They permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child&rsquo;s care and upbringing having regard to the child&rsquo;s best interests.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have no role in the enforcement of court orders. This is the function of the courts, which are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the performance of their functions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2004 specify nine grounds on which direct and indirect discrimination in the provision of goods and services is prohibited. The specified grounds include gender, marital status and family status and are defined as follows the &ldquo;gender ground&rdquo; &mdash; that one is male and the other is female; the &ldquo;marital status ground&rdquo; &mdash; that they are of different marital status; the &ldquo;family status ground&rdquo; &mdash; that one has family status and the other does not or that one has a different family status from the other.</P>
        <P>The Acts outlaw discrimination in the access to and provision of all goods and services which are generally available to the public, irrespective of whether they are provided by the State or by the private sector and whether on payment or not.  The Equal Status Act permits differences in treat<Col N="448"/>ment on any of the nine specified grounds where required by or under any enactment or order of a court. The Acts also permit differences in treatment on the nine specified grounds in certain limited circumstances.  The Equal Status Acts provide a mechanism under which a person who feels he or she has been illegally discriminated against may have his or her complaint investigated and seek redress. Two independent bodies, the Equality Authority and the Equality Tribunal, have been given statutory roles under equality legislation.</P>
        <P>The Equality Authority has a broad mandate under the Equal Status Acts to combat discrimination and promote equality of opportunity in the areas covered by the Acts. It also has a role in providing information and advice to any person who feels that he or she has been discriminated against on any of the grounds covered in the equality legislation, whether in an employment or non-employment area.  A person who claims that he or she has been discriminated against in the non-employment area may seek redress by referring their case directly to the Equality Tribunal. If the Director finds that there was discrimination, she may make an order for compensation for the effects of the discrimination and/or order a specified course of action to be taken.</P>

	<P>I am informed by Garda management that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are trained to the highest standard in dealing with incidents of domestic violence, irrespective of the gender of the victim.  In relation to the training provided to Garda&iacute; in the area of domestic violence, the position is that lectures relating to &lsquo;Offences Committed within the Family&rsquo; are given at Phase 1, 3 and 5 of training at the Garda College. The lectures cover all matters relevant to: The Domestic Violence Act 1996, as amended, including Barring/Protection/Safety Orders;  Arrest powers, procedures to follow, advice to be given; Bail issues, Children&rsquo;s Act 1908 and related matters; Child Care Act 1991, including the duties of the Health Boards and Courts in matters of child-care.  Garda Policy on Domestic Violence, powers of entry, use of force, arrests and prosecution of offenders are all covered during training. The contextual policing aspect of training deals with the rights of victims in situations of domestic violence.</P><Col N="449"/>
        <P>Throughout training, Student/Probationers undertake role-play exercises with scenarios which depict practical incidents that they may encounter relating to domestic violence. This role-play type training develops their skills and competencies in dealing with all aspects of domestic violence.  Garda Management have also informed me that arrangements are being made to facilitate AMEN, an organisation representing male victims of domestic violence, in delivering a training presentation to Student Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>The chief civil legislation relating to domestic violence is the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, as amended in 2002.  This is comprehensive and drafted in gender-neutral terms.  It provides for a situation where Safety, Protection and Barring Orders can be applied for, and issued by the court as a matter of urgency.  Contravention of any Order under the Acts is an offence and subject to sanctions under the criminal law.  In addition, criminal legislation such as the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, which provides for prosecution in cases of assault and harassment, is also gender-neutral.</P>
        <P>In relation to the enforcement of the law on domestic violence, the Garda&iacute; have a clear written policy which is non-gender specific.  The policy provides that any incident of domestic violence reported to the Garda&iacute; must be fully investigated. The Garda Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit at Harcourt Square liaise with all agencies representing victims of domestic violence.</P>

        <Quest> his views on appointing a second district judge in County Donegal and a second circuit judge to the Northern Circuit as there is a continuous backlog of unheard cases in the District and Circuit Courts in County Donegal (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of extra judicial resources in the Northern Circuit or in the Donegal District is a matter, in the first instance, for consideration by the Presidents of the Circuit and District Courts respectively.  I will be guided by the Presidents of the Courts as to the need for additional permanently assigned judges.</P>
        <P>The Presidents have, at their disposal, unassigned judges who can be used, inter alia, to assist permanently assigned judges where pressure of work demands.  I understand in this respect that, last year, 90 extra court sittings were organised in Donegal by the President of the District Court in an effort to tackle delays. The previous year, the President made arrangements for 112 extra sittings and a total of 1,139 cases were disposed of.  This had the effect of greatly reducing the backlog at the time.  The President of the District Court will, no doubt, continue to assign additional judges to Donegal as need arises.</P>
        <P>In relation to the question of a second permanently assigned judge for Donegal, I am advised that the District Court Committee of the Courts Service Board has examined the issue and has decided against recommending any change.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Circuit Court, the Deputy will be aware that a judge was assigned to the Northern Circuit with effect from 24 July 2006. While the level of delays in criminal matters in the Northern Circuit is significantly lower than in many other venues around the country, five weeks of additional sittings were allocated to the Northern Circuit in the last term to deal with lengthy criminal trials in Carrick on Shannon and Monaghan.  Waiting times for family law and civil cases in the Northern Circuit compare favourably with other venues around the country.</P>
        <P>With regard to the general issue of judicial resources, I have secured Government approval to bring forward legislation for the appointment of extra judges in the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks) of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met.  The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>Garda management state that while no date has yet been set for the next competition for recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in the context of the accelerated Garda recruitment programme it is expected that a Garda recruitment competition will be held in the latter half of this year.</P>

	<P>In April 2006, the Law Reform Commission published a Report entitled &ldquo;eConveyancing: Modelling of the Irish Conveyancing System&rdquo;.  This Report, and the accompanying consultancy report by BearingPoint, contains the first detailed &lsquo;end-to-end&rsquo; process model of the entire conveyancing process in Ireland.  It contains a comprehensive overview and analysis of the role of the various stakeholders in the conveyancing process and their state of readiness for eConveyancing.</P>
        <P>The Report also made a number of recommendations concerning the practical implementation of an eConveyancing system, including the establishment of an eConveyancing Project Board to oversee developments.  This Board is currently putting in place a work programme which will include information briefings for stakeholders and a range of pilot projects. I would therefore urge all stakeholders to engage with and participate in this work programme in order to ensure the success of the project.</P>
        <P>An important precondition for the introduction of a comprehensive eConveyancing system is the extension of compulsory registration of land ownership in the Land Registry and eventual closure of the Registry of Deeds. For this reason, one of the main functions of the new Property Registration Authority established under the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006 is to promote and extend the registration of land ownership. I expect that the Authority will set out its strategy for achieving this objective in its first strategic plan which it is in the process of drafting at present.</P>
        <P>I should add that reforms contained in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006, which is currently awaiting Second Stage in the House having been passed by the Seanad, will update and simplify the law relating to the ownership and conveyancing of land in order to bring it into line with modern conditions and this will also assist introduction and successful implementation of eConveyancing.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 4 May 2000 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was informed by letter dated 11 August 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with Section 3 (3) (b) (ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>His case was examined under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations received on his behalf from the Refugee Legal Service for temporary leave to remain in the State. On 3 August 2004, I refused temporary leave to remain in the State and signed a deportation order in respect of him. Notice of <Col N="456"/>this order was served by registered post requiring him to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on 18 November 2004, in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State. The person concerned failed to present as required and was classified as evading his deportation. As such he is liable to arrest and detention under Section 5 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, for the purposes of ensuring his removal from the State.  I would urge the person concerned to come forward and present himself to the GNIB as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might wish to note that, in addition to the eleven factors contained in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), I must, as stated earlier, also have regard for Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement before making a deportation order. This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to the Country in question and other third countries. In this case, I am entirely satisfied that there are no refoulement related reasons to prevent the deportation of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The person concerned is awaiting deportation following a comprehensive examination of his asylum claim and of his application to remain temporarily in the State.  I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum and subsequently for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.  The enforcement of the deportation order is now an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>A submission has been received in my Department in relation to <Col N="457"/>the Government&rsquo;s drug policy from the group referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>In relation generally to the matters raised in the submission, the Deputy will be aware that the Government&rsquo;s overall policy to tackle the drug problem is set out in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 &ldquo;Building on Experience&rdquo; and responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the strategy lies with my colleague, Mr. Noel Ahern T.D., Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P>Under the current national strategy, which sets out a framework for action for the period 2001-2008, drugs policy is being delivered across the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.</P>
        <P>A mid-term review of the Strategy was concluded in 2005.  The review, which involved a comprehensive and public consultation process, was overseen by a steering group chaired by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs with representation from the statutory, community and voluntary treatment sectors to reflect the partnership basis on which the Strategy is founded.</P>
        <P>The review found that the current aims and objectives of the National Drugs Strategy are fundamentally sound. It also highlighted the need to re-focus priorities and accelerate the rollout of some of the Strategy&rsquo;s actions and, in this context, a number of new actions and amendments were identified, bringing the total number of actions to 108.</P>
        <P>Within this policy framework, my Department will continue to develop measures, in consultation with the relevant Government Departments/ Agencies and the Community and Voluntary sectors to ensure that a co-ordinated and integrated response is in place to tackle the drugs problem.</P>

	<P>I am informed that there were 20 females in custody at Limerick Prison on 26 January, 2007.  This figure compares with a bed capacity of 20.  The ten cells in the female area of the prison were originally designed for single cell occupancy, however, it was necessary to &ldquo;double up&rdquo; due to the high level of female committals in the Munster area.  The alternative would have been to release female prisoners at an early stage of their sentence solely to make way for new committals.</P>
        <P>While it is recognised that the female facilities in Limerick Prison are not ideal, there are significant space restrictions in Limerick Prison which preclude a major development of this area.  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware of two major prison developments, one in North County Dublin and the other in Munster.  It is intended that these new facilities will alleviate the pressure on female accommodation spaces by providing predominantly single cell accommodation with in-cell sanitation facilities and will also offer significant improvements in the areas of work, training, educational and medical services for women inmates.  There are no plans to reduce the capacity of the female wing of Limerick Prison in advance of these new developments.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the allegations made to the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, during the course of his inspection of Wheatfield Prison in 2006 (and as set out in his recently published Report), of an incident of bullying and racism arising from an alleged assault by the Prisoners on a non-national Prisoner in the prison.  The Inspector&rsquo;s Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  I am also aware of the Inspector&rsquo;s recommendation that the Visiting Committee investigate these allegations.  </P>
        <P>In this regard, I am also conscious of the views of the Governor and his management team (also reported in the Inspector&rsquo;s Report) that such activity is not widespread and that any such instances have been acted upon &mdash; including referral to the Garda authorities for investigation.</P>
        <P>I have consulted with the Director General of the Irish Prison Service in relation to this matter and he has advised me that racism and bullying are not widespread in Wheatfield.  Any complaint of this nature would be fully investigated by a senior member of management appointed by the Governor for such a purpose and would not be tolerated by the Governor.  No complaint has, however, been made by a prisoner to the Governor.  (A register of all assaults and serious complaints is maintained in the prison).  There is also a Governor&rsquo;s parade held each day in the prison where all prisoners can discuss any matter that concerns them and all prisoners are fully aware of this procedure.  Wheatfield Prison is very pro-active in not allowing bullying or racism to occur and, in this regard, Intercultural Awareness Training was piloted for both staff and prisoners there.  The Governor also initiated a training programme for all staff in the prison.  In the light of this, the Director General has informed me that, in his view, there is no need to have any independent investigation carried out into allegations of bullying and racism in Wheatfield and I agree with this.  In the circumstances, I will not be arranging for any independent investigation to be carried out.</P>
        <P>The most appropriate way of dealing with such behaviours in a prison context is through continued awareness and vigilance on the part of Prison Service Management and staff to ensure that any such behaviours do not go unnoticed and are dealt with either by recourse to the internal prison disciplinary rules or, if appropriate, referral to the Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>In relation to racism, the new draft Prison Rules contain two references regarding sanction for racist occurrences in that any prisoner shall be guilty of a breach of prison discipline if (a) he or she treats with disrespect, through the use of any abusive, insolent, racist or threatening behaviour or language, the Governor, any prison officer, any prisoner, any visitor to the prison or any other person, or (b) displays, attaches, or <Col N="461"/>draws on any part of a prison, or on any other property, threatening, abusive or insulting racist words, drawings, symbols or other material.  The new Rules will come into operation shortly.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that the additional hours system has not resulted in a curtailment of services to prisoners in Wheatfield Prison.  While it is the case that the agreed staffing configurations in the industrial area in Wheatfield Prison have not yet been achieved, it is expected that they will be achieved very shortly.  In the meantime, however, all workshops in Wheatfield Prison are open on a daily basis Monday to Friday.</P>
        <P>Local management has succeeded in maintaining a high level of service to prisoners.  Wheatfield Prison has gained major national and international awards for its kitchen and catering workshop facilities and community services and other awards for a range of other workshops.  A very wide range of subjects are taught in the workshops to improve offenders employability on release from custody.  For example, a new laundry facility provides accredited training for prisoners which has already facilitated trainees obtaining employment placement on release.  A wide range of subjects, which include Open University courses, are also taught in the Education Unit which is operational five days per week, Monday to Friday.</P>
        <P>In addition, dedicated additional staff have recently been appointed to Wheatfield Prison in the drug treatment area and Addiction Counsellors will be appointed shortly.  This is in line with the Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy &amp; Strategy &mdash; &lsquo;Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons&rsquo;.  Finally, a new system for focusing on rehabilitation in the prison system, Integrated Sentence Management, has recently been introduced in Wheatfield Prison on a pilot basis.</P>

I am further informed that on 29 January, 2007 there were no persons aged 17 years or under in Wheatfield Prison and, furthermore, that no such person has been held there in recent times.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware that the Children Act 2001, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2006, provides for the detention of children aged up to 18 years in children detention schools.  It further provides that no child shall be committed to a prison.  A transitional provision has been included in the Act to allow for the continued detention of boys aged 16 and 17 in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution or another place of detention until such time as sufficient children detention school places are available.  These provisions have not been commenced but it is the intention of my colleague the Minister for Children, who has delegated responsibility for the Children Act, to bring the outstanding provisions into force on 1 March, 2007.  When implemented, management responsibility for children detention services will be located in the Irish Youth Justice Service, an executive office of my Department, which also has oversight of all other aspects of youth offending responses.</P>

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements. </P>

	<P>The application referred to by the Deputy was received in the Visa Office, Cairo. The decision of the Visa Officer to refuse the application was taken on September 5th, 2006.</P>
        <P>The Visa Officer who examined the application was not satisfied, on the basis of the documentation submitted, that the applicant would adhere to the conditions of the visa. An appeal against the refusal decision was received in November, 2006. Following a re-examination of the application, the decision to refuse was upheld in January, 2007 as the applicant had not adequately addressed the reason for refusal. As each applicant is entitled to one appeal only, no further review in this matter can be granted; however it is open to the applicant to make a fresh application.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 422, 464 and 465 together.</P>
        <P>The House will appreciate that the granting of bail is a matter for the courts and that the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is, of course, independent in the performance of his functions, is the State for the purposes of dealing with such applications.  Moreover, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the circumstances in which bail may have been granted or, indeed, refused in particular cases.</P>
        <P>What I can confirm is that I have been made aware by the Garda authorities that in a significant number of cases involving operations they have launched against gun and drugs crime bail has been granted despite Garda objections.  I am in no way impugning either the independence or the decisions of the courts in saying that I remain concerned that the Constitutional amendment which allows for the refusal of bail where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of serious offences is not operating in practice as effectively as we would wish.  It is against that background that I intend, insofar as <Col N="466"/>a legislative response is required, to bring forward proposals shortly.</P>
        <P>It would not be appropriate to put into the public domain details of any communications by me or my Department with the Chief Justice or his Office about such matters.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks) of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities state that Donard Garda Station form part of the Baltinglass Garda District.  Local Garda management report that normal open hours for Donard Garda Station is from 11am to 1pm daily.  Donard Garda Station is equipped with a Public Access Call Box (P.A.C.B.) system and outside the opening hours of the Station, all calls are diverted to Baltinglass Garda Station.  I am further informed that a new <Col N="467"/>Garda Station has been built at Donard and is being handed over to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

	<P>The essential purpose of a criminal trial is to establish whether or not an accused is guilty of the offence charged.  It is a fundamental principle of our legal system that the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty.  Alleged behaviour by the accused is at the nexus of a criminal trial and it is the accused who, if found guilty, will be liable to serious consequences in the form of criminal sanctions which, in the case of serious sexual offences, could be up to life imprisonment.</P>
        <P>It is now generally accepted that our legal system did not in the past always afford sufficient consideration to the part the complainant played in the criminal justice process.  More recently, the role of the complainant has been given greater attention and this has been reflected in a number of changes that have been made for the purpose of making the trial process a less traumatic experience for complainants, and this is especially so in the case of sexual offences.</P>
        <P>Examples of these changes are as follows. Since 1990, it is no longer necessary to warn the jury about the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant.  Instead, the judge decides on a case by case basis whether the jury should be given such a warning.  Also, procedures are now in place whereby the prosecution team arrange for pre-trial consultations with complainants in cases of serious sexual assaults to familiarise them with the legal procedures and to explain the layout and procedures of the court and the type of matters which may be the subject of examination by counsel. Another positive development has been the extension of the Civil Legal Aid Scheme to allow a complainant in cases of serious sexual assaults to consult a legal aid solicitor who may accompany the complainant into court. A further initiative was the provision of separate legal representation for complainants for the duration of an application to adduce evidence of cross-examine a complainant about his or her past sexual history.</P>
        <P>The above are examples of the advances that have been made to improve the position of the complainant in the criminal trial process to reduce the sense of alienation and helplessness that can arise. I will give serious consideration to any further suggestions for changes to assist complainants in serious sexual assault cases. However, any such suggestions would have to comply with the constitutional guarantee that the <Col N="472"/>accused would be tried in due course of law and would receive a fair trial in accordance with the requirements of international human rights instruments.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 442 and 463 together.</P>
        <P>I recently announced my intention to ask the Government to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings.  I also stated that it is intended, as part of the new Immigration policy framework, to provide a clear policy statement setting out how these cases will be managed once it is established that trafficking has taken place.  I would reiterate, however, that the lack of a specific legislative provision on the victims of trafficking has in no way reduced Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to dealing with cases sympathetically as they arise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Legislation creating an offence of trafficking in persons for the specific purpose of sexual or labour exploitation is contained in the draft criminal law (trafficking in persons and sexual offences) Bill.  This Bill will comply fully with the criminal law requirements of the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons and the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings.  The General Scheme of the Bill was approved by Government in July 2006 and is now with the <Col N="475"/>Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for drafting.   Ireland signed the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons on 13 December 2000.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the guidelines in relation to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na serving at certain stations are set out in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Code.  In the above regard, the position is that a member is not permitted to serve at any Station which is within 32 kilometres of any place where the member, or the member&rsquo;s spouse/partner, has relatives permanently residing; the member&rsquo;s spouse/partner, or other family members or relatives engages in any business requiring a licence or certificate, the grant of which, by a Court or otherwise, may be opposed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

        <P>Officials of my Department had a meeting with representatives of the NDVIA on 29th January 2007 and explained to the NDVIA  that, in accordance with customary procedures, their final report on the pilot project and its most recent outcomes would now be evaluated by the Department.  The  original external evaluation of the pilot project, completed in early 2006, will also be reviewed again in order to consider fully the options for advancing the objective matter of the pilot project on a nationwide basis.  My Department has since been in consultation with the NDVIA on the question of a funding arrangement &mdash; on an interim basis &mdash; pending examination by the Government of the report submitted, and of any new developments in the area.   It is understood that this offer is acceptable to NDVIA.   During the period 2003 &mdash; 2006 inclusive, the NDVIA has reported to us that it interacted with 39 clients, mostly victims but including a small number of perpetrators.  Any decision by the NDVIA to  have closed following completion of the pilot project would not have resulted in any loss of availability of front line services provided by the State or otherwise to address violence against women.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that on 31 December, 2006 the total number of persons recruited to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reached an all-time high of 14,068. Following the attestation of 299 new members on 16 November, 2006., the attested strength reached a record 13,000. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%), during that period. </P>
        <P>I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>

	<P>The statutory requirements for naturalisation are set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  This provides that applicants for naturalisation, other than spouses of Irish citizens, must have been resident for five years of the nine year period prior to the date of application.  Resident in this context means residence for which the applicant had the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and where such permission was not granted for the purposes of study or seeking asylum.  </P>
        <P>The average processing time for applications for certificates of naturalisation is at present approximately 24 months but the Deputy will appreciate that depending on the particular circumstances involved, individual cases may take <Col N="479"/>longer to process. The length of time taken is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in the last number of years. As the following table indicates, there is an upward trend in the number of such applications and this trend is continuing in the year to date.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In the interests of fairness to all concerned, it is the practice of the Citizenship Division of my Department to process cases in chronological order based upon the date of receipt of the application.  The only areas where this practice is not observed involve applications by persons with refugee status or where the application is made on behalf of a minor.  In the case of applicants with refugee status the Government has obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951.  Accordingly every effort is made to ensure that applications from such applicants are dealt with as quickly as possible, having regard to the general volume of applications.  Where applications made on behalf of minors are concerned, these generally require less processing than standard adult applications so it is usually possible to finalise them more quickly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.  The procedures employed to assess an applicant for naturalisation are as set out in summary form as follows.</P>
        <P>Upon receipt, each application is examined to determine if the statutory application is completed fully.  Incomplete application forms are returned to the applicant for amendment.  Valid applications are then examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.  Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and enquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary.  Since this procedure was introduced on 1 April 2005, over 3,000 applicants who applied since that date have been found to be ineligible.  All such applicants are informed of <Col N="480"/>any shortfall in their residency and will be able to reapply when they have the required residency.</P>
        <P>The next stage of the process involves assessing an applicant&rsquo;s financial status in respect of their ability to support themselves in the State.  Enquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard.  At the same time enquiries are also made with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to clarify if the applicant can be deemed to be of good character.  There may also be circumstances in individual cases  which require a greater level of investigation than other cases.  Once all enquiries are completed, the file is referred to me for a decision.  The Deputy will appreciate that these processes can take a lengthy time to complete.</P>
        <P>The above procedures have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.  Consequently, having regard to the resources available, which are kept under constant review, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved.</P>

	<P>The illegal use of mobile phones in prisons and places of detention has the capacity to compromise the security of the institution and the safety of the staff and other prisoners.  I am advised that mobile phones have been used by prisoners to continue some of their illegal activities including organising the smuggling of contraband into prisons.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service, in common with prison authorities in other jurisdictions is attempting to find an effective means of eliminating the risks posed by prisoners having access to mobile phone technology and, in this context, regular searches are carried out by prison service staff in all prisons and places of detention to locate and remove mobile phones.  I can assure the Deputy that I am determined to deal with the problem of prisoners using mobile phones and, in this context, I believe technology offers the only real answer to dealing with the problem.  In that regard the Prison Service is at an advanced stage in the examination and procurement of technological options for dealing with the use of mobile phones within prisons.</P>

	<P>Persons in the State considered to be illegal immigrants, have come from a range of different circumstances, including: failing to present to an Immigration Officer at the time of arrival in the State, for the purposes of seeking permission to enter and remain in the State; obtaining a permission to enter the State by deception, through the production of bogus travel documents and/or the provision of false information; having entered the State lawfully and being allowed to remain in this jurisdiction until a specified date, has remained in the State beyond that date; having made application for refugee status and consequently been granted permission to enter the State, failed to comply with an Order to remove him/herself from State following rejection of such application.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has responsibility for conducting immigration controls at the frontiers of the State.  However, fixed immigration controls conducted by Immigration Officers attached to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at ports of entry, relate only to persons entering the State.  As immigration controls are not undertaken at locations where people exit from the State, it is not possible to establish how many non-Irish nationals have remained in the State following expiration of a permission granted to enter and remain in Ireland for a specified period of time.</P><Col N="482"/>
        <P>Persons illegally present in the State also include those in respect of whom Deportation Orders have issued, having had an application for refugee status refused.   While there is a high level of evasion by those subject to Deportation Orders, the actual execution of Orders is at a level comparable to other EU Member States.  However, in regard to those evading, there are clear indications that a significant proportion have in fact left the State.

        <P>I am also aware of reports suggesting that prisoners may be engaged in criminal activities, including drug dealing, from inside prison cells and I would like to assure the Deputy that I am committed to continuing to implement all appropriate measures to deal with such activity and to ensure that the prisoner&rsquo;s contact with the outside world is tightly controlled and monitored in an appropriate way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Prisoner visits in all closed prisons are carefully controlled and held in sight of prison officers and monitored on CCTV.  In addition, new visiting arrangements are in place in almost all closed prisons whereby only persons who have been pre-approved by the Governor are permitted to visit.  The implementation of a passive drug dog detection programme is currently under way and initial reports are very positive.  Telephone calls in closed prisons are monitored by prison officers and incoming and outgoing mail is subject to examination by a prison censor.  There is regular contact between the Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss security issues and Garda&iacute; will be contacted whenever any suspected criminal offence has taken place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the major challenges in prisons  worldwide lies in preventing access to contraband items, primarily mobile phones and drugs, which for obvious reasons, are viewed as highly valuable commodities which could assist in illegal activity.  Efforts are made on a continual basis to prevent the flow of such contraband into our prisons, by for example, the installation of nets over exercise yards, vigilant observation of prisoners by staff, upgraded CCTV monitoring, the use of screened visits and prisoner and cell searches. In addition, plans to avail of technological options for dealing with the use of mobile phones within prisons are at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>Random searches of cells and their occupants and searching of correspondence and other items entering the prison have all intercepted significant quantities of contraband in recent years.  When a person is admitted to prison custody, he or she is searched and prohibited items and money are taken.  Similarly, searching takes place of prisoners returning from court, temporary release or after visits.  Searches of prisoners also take place where their behaviour or information received raises suspicions that they may be in possession of contraband.  The Prison Service has recently conducted a number of trial tests on <Col N="486"/>modern cameras and probe systems which assist in searching previously difficult areas such as hollow chair or bed legs, U-bends in toilets, drain holes, under floor boards and other cavities.  Initial tests would appear to indicate that these new technologies will be a valuable asset in this area.  The new prison estates at Thornton Hall and a location in Munster will also make it harder for contraband to enter the prison by locating recreation yards away from perimeter walls and having a cordon sanitaire.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also be aware of a recent directive to the effect that a number of serious drug dealers are now to be segregated in a special area of Cloverhill Prison.  It is anticipated that this initiative, in conjunction with the other measures referred to earlier, will prevent them from exerting inappropriate influence over other persons.</P>

	<P>Section 29 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 inserts a new section 2B into the Firearms Act, 1925 which provides that I may, in the interests of public safety and security, by order declare specific firearms and ammunition as &ldquo;restricted firearms&rdquo; by reference to their category, calibre, working mechanism, muzzle energy and description.</P>
        <P>Officials of my Department are currently in discussions with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and representatives of the main shooting organisations regarding the types of firearm which may be &ldquo;restricted&rdquo;.  Following these discussions the statutory instrument, which will deem certain firearms as &ldquo;restricted firearms&rdquo; for the purposes of the section 2B of the 1925 Act, will be finalised.  It is important to note that firearms deemed to be &ldquo;restricted&rdquo; may be licensed by the Garda Commissioner and any person wishing to obtain such a licence may apply to the Commissioner for a firearms certificate.  The Commissioner may issue a firearms certificate for a &ldquo;restricted firearm&rdquo; where he is satisfied that the person fully complies with the conditions, set out in section 4 of the 1925 Act, for the grant of a &ldquo;restricted firearm&rdquo; certificate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of designating certain firearms as &ldquo;restricted firearms&rdquo; is to ensure that, in the interests of public safety and security, certain firearms may only be licensed following careful examination by the Garda Commissioner and where specific conditions are met.</P>

        <P>Following the submission to me in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, I decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, I am pleased to note that the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics for the third and fourth quarters of 2006.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.  I have requested the CSO to provide the information sought by the Deputy directly to him.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks) of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.  I have been further informed that the personnel strength (all ranks) of the Dungarvan, Tramore and Waterford City Garda Districts as at 31 December 1997 and 2002-2006, inclusively, was as set out in the following table:</P><Col N="487"/>

        <P FLI="0">The Garda Districts referred to above form part of the Waterford/ Kilkenny Garda Division and I have also been informed that the personnel strength of this Division as at 31 December, 1997 and 2006 was 306 and 380, respectively. This represents an increase of 74 (or 24%) in the number of Garda personnel allocated to the Waterford/ Kilkenny Division during that period.   In addition, the Division&rsquo;s resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the <Col N="488"/>Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units, all of which have had increased resources to provide a comprehensive policing service to the areas.</P>
        <P>I should say that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These <Col N="489"/>personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>

	<P>Under Section 104 of the Explosives Act, 1875 I may by order deem any substance, which appears to be specially dangerous by reason either of its explosive properties or of any process in its manufacture being liable to explosion, to be an explosive within the meaning of the Act.  All of the restrictions relating to importation, storage, manufacture sale, etc.,  which apply to explosives apply to such substances.  Three orders have been made under the Act which deem the following substances to be explosives:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Ammonium Nitrate,</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Sodium Chlorate,</P>

	<P>The Criminal Justice Act 2006 contains provisions to deal with public order offences. Section 184 amends the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 to provide for a fixed penalty procedure in relation to the public order offences of disorderly conduct in a public place and intoxication in a public place as an alternative to proceedings being taken in the first instance.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that work on the necessary arrangements for the introduction of these provisions is ongoing and is expected to be completed in the near future.</P>
        <P>Policing arrangements for public events and in locations generally, along with the allocation of Garda resources, are a matter for the Garda Commissioner. Where such events take place the Garda authorities work closely with local residents in order to avoid as far as possible disruption to local communities.</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that every effort is made by local Garda management, on the occasions of major match days or events, to ensure appropriate attention is afforded to public order offences. Garda&iacute; on duty on such occasions are pro-active in dealing with any attendant problems arising. In addition, <Col N="494"/>Garda patrol vans are also on patrol to assist at any area of concern in relation to public order offences.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a <Col N="496"/>package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>In relation to the allocation of Garda personnel, the position is that under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 it is the responsibility of Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  In this regard, I am informed by Garda management that personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>I should also say that each Garda Division&rsquo;s resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units, all of which have had increased resources to provide a comprehensive policing service to the public.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that <Col N="500"/>period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the number of Garda&iacute; (all ranks) in Mallow Garda District as at 31 December, 1997 and 31 December, 2006 was 47 and 54 respectively. This represents an increase of 7 (or 14.89%) in the number of personnel allocated to the District since that date.</P>
        <P>The Mallow Garda District form part of the Cork North Garda Division and I have also been informed that the personnel strength of this Division as at 31 December, 1997 and 2006 was 209 and 260, respectively. This represents an increase of 51 (or 24.4%) in the number of Garda personnel allocated to the Cork North Division during that period.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Division&rsquo;s resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units, all of which have had increased resources to provide a comprehensive policing service to the area.</P>
        <P>I should say that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>

	<P>The Disabled Drivers&rsquo; and Disabled Passengers&rsquo; (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and VRT (up to certain limit) on the purchase of a car adapted for the transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, as well as relief from excise on the fuel used in the car up to a certain limit.</P>
        <P>The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. To get the Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions:</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</P>
       <P LI="1">(b) be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</P>
       <P LI="1">(c) be without both hands or without both arms;</P>
        <P LI="1">(d) be without one or both legs;</P>
       <P LI="1">(e) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</P>
      <P LI="1">(f) have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A special Interdepartmental Review Group reviewed the operation of the Disabled Drivers Scheme.  The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The Group&rsquo;s Report, published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other coun<Col N="503"/>tries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.</P><?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.</P>

        <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have granted 10 year licences to the four mobile phone operators, licensed by ComReg to provide mobile telephony services in Ireland, to install telecommunications equipment on the mast at the Garda Station referred to. For structural reasons it was necessary to replace the original mast with a new mast and I understand the replacement mast has been erected under the exempted development provisions contained in Class 31, Park 1 of Schedule 2 of Planning and Development Regulations 2001. The Garda telecommunications equipment has also been relocated to the new mast and the original mast has been removed from the site.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of their licence agreement with the Commissioners, the mobile phone operators are obliged to install and operate all equipment within current standards and E.U. regulations and adhere to the guidelines on exposure limits to emissions, issued by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, (ICNIRP). In addition, the Commissioners&rsquo; Consultants monitor all such developments on behalf of the Commissioners to ensure compliance with the regulations is achieved from the outset and is continuous during the term of the licence agreement.</P>

This equates to a tax credit of &euro;360 per annum for single persons and &euro;720 for widowed and married persons. For those aged 55 years and over, the maximum level of rent paid on which tax relief can be claimed is being increased from &euro;3,300 to &euro;3,600 per annum for a single person and from &euro;6,600 to &euro;7,200 per annum for widowed and married persons.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 500, 511, 537, 552, 555, 558 and 559 together.</P>
        <P>I have been very conscious that, as a result of the exceptional rainfall since mid-November, there are a number of areas throughout the country, but particularly in the West and North-West, which have been severely affected by flooding. It was with this in mind that I announced on 18th January, that the Commissioners of Public Works will work with Local Authorities to try to identify solutions to the various flooding incidents that have occurred.</P>
        <P>The Local Authorities are the front-line responders where State sector assistance is required in the event of serious flooding. They are therefore likely to have information which, allied to the local knowledge of their staff will be invaluable in determining the most likely immediate cause of the flooding. This information when allied to the expertise of the OPW in dealing with river engineering, will assist in devising potential solutions to the individual problems in the most <Col N="506"/>efficient manner possible. Where additional surveys or other information is needed this will be procured.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that, where solutions are identified which offer an acceptable level of social and financial benefit and which are environmentally acceptable, that these will be implemented as quickly as possible. In most cases the flooding occurred from rivers or watercourses for which the Commissioners of Public Works do not have responsibility and in respect of which consequently they have very limited powers. We will therefore be relying on the full co-operation of the Local Authorities and of local landowners in many cases to implement remedial measures quickly.</P>
        <P>Where it is not possible to find flood relief measures which are viable other flood protection measures may be considered.</P>
        <P>With respect to Clonlara, County Clare, I am advised by the Commissioners that an engineer visited the area in December and that efforts to find a solution are ongoing.</P>
        <P>With regard to South Mayo, OPW officials are in consultation with Mayo County Council regarding the flooding there. I understand they are making good progress towards identifying possible flood relief works for Crossmolina and Clyard, Kilmaine, and are continuing to seek solutions to the flooding problems in the other areas affected.</P>
        <P>If issues arise in any case requiring consultation with other Departments contact will be made on a case by case basis at the local level as far as possible. An inter-departmental working group is not considered necessary at this stage.</P>
        <P>The provision of Humanitarian Assistance is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs. I have written to the Minister with copies of the Parliamentary Questions and representations which I have received on the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Primary Medical Certificate required to qualify for the Disabled Drivers&rsquo; and Disabled Passengers&rsquo; (Tax Concessions) Scheme, which provides relief from VAT and VRT (up to certain limit) on the purchase of a car adapted for the transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, as well as relief from excise on the fuel used in the car up to a certain limit.</P>
        <P>The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers&rsquo; and Disabled Passengers&rsquo; (Tax <Col N="507"/>Concessions) Regulations 1994. To qualify for the Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions:</P>

       <P LI="1">(a) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</P>
       <P LI="1">(b) be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</P>
       <P LI="1">(c) be without both hands or without both arms;</P>
        <P LI="1">(d) be without one or both legs;</P>
       <P LI="1">(e) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</P>
       <P LI="1">(f) have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Senior Medical Officer (SMO) for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the SMO to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.</P>
        <P>A special Interdepartmental Review Group reviewed the operation of the Disabled Drivers&rsquo; Scheme.  The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The Group&rsquo;s Report, published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.</P>
        <P>In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. <Col N="508"/>This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 502, 588 and 589 together.</P>
        <P>I welcome the NYCI Report which raises many important issues regarding young people and their management of credit card debt and is further evidence of the increased awareness of the importance of consumer protection in the field of financial services. I understand that the Financial Regulator is examining the &lsquo;Can You Credit It&rsquo; report prepared by the NYCI and this will inform their study of the transparency of information provided to all holders of credit cards.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator spends significant time and resources informing consumers about the potential risks of credit cards. Publications including credit card cost surveys are available to help consumers choose the card that suits their needs. However, guidance from the Financial Regulator recommends that consumers take on the right type of credit for the right purpose; credit cards are not suitable for long-term debt as the rates are far higher than other forms of credit. The Financial Regulator also issues information to help people who have problems with credit card debt.  This information is available through its publications, help-line and website.</P>
        <P>All credit card providers must comply with the Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code, which states that financial services providers must act in the customers&rsquo; best interests and only provide financial products that are suitable for the consumer. In addition, there are some specific rules with regard to interest rates and credit cards limits.  When a credit institution is changing its interest rates, it must state the effective date of the new rate.  It must also update the interest rate <Col N="509"/>details on its information services as soon as the change comes into effect.  With regard to credit card limits, they cannot be increased unless requested by the consumer.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that credit card debt represents less than 2% of personal sector credit and less than 1% of overall private sector credit (PSC), and is one of the slowest growing components of PSC. Credit card data refers to debt outstanding on all credit cards at end-month and includes balances that may be paid in full at the payment due date. The increase in the number of cards issued and the amount of debt outstanding is in line with a general trend of increased market penetration in EU and a move towards electronic retail payment methods.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 504 and 573 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware that there is a need for a new Divisional Headquarters in Wexford and in this regard the Office of Public Works are finalising the purchase of a new site.   As soon as this process is complete, the OPW will engage contractors for the building of the new station.  In the interim, any essential maintenance to the existing station will be carried out under the Garda maintenance programme.</P>

	<P>The payment of tax liabilities by a taxpayer is a matter between the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>I am advised by Revenue that the taxpayer in question holds several employments, and his tax credits are accordingly distributed across the <Col N="510"/>employments.  This may be causing him some difficulties.  However, his local tax District has no record of any approach from him, and in the absence of information, it is not possible to be of assistance to the taxpayer.</P>

        <Quest> the monthly breakdown for the number of people who have applied to the Revenue Commissioners for a tax refund for the period November 2004 to November 2006; the number of these refund applications that have been resolved; the amount paid as a result; the number of refund applications rejected; and the number of refund applications outstanding. </Quest>

	<P>The following Table 1 sets out the total number of PAYE refunds for the period 1 November 2004 to 30 November 2006, together with totals for the number of refund applications resolved, amount refunded, and the number of underpayments, (plus an estimate for the number of refund applications outstanding at 30 November 2006).</P>
        <P>Table 2 sets out the monthly breakdown for each of these categories, as requested by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I should like to clarify that refund applications are not rejected &mdash; they either result in an overpayment, in which case a refund issues, or else it is established on foot of the application that either no repayment is due or that there has been an underpayment of tax.  Accordingly, for completeness, I am including in the table the number of claims which resulted in underpayments. A vital component used to compile the statistics in the enclosed table is the individual balancing statement issued to taxpayers.  In this regard it is important to point out that a separate balancing statement is issued in respect of each tax year. <Col N="511"/> Accordingly, the table should be read on this basis.</P><Col N="511"/>

	<P>The minimum starting rates of pay in my Department are &euro;389.76 per week, for Services Officers and Services Attendants, and &euro;436.29 per week for Clerical Officers. These rates are in excess of the National Minimum wage, including the addition of one euro per hour. Accordingly, there are no staff serving in my Department, earning the national minimum wage, less than the national minimum wage, or at a rate of not more than one euro per hour in excess of the national minimum wage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With the exception of the Office of Public Works which currently employs 35 apprentices and trainees who are legislatively exempted under section 5 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, all agencies under the aegis of my Department have confirmed that there are no staff serving in those agencies earning the national minimum wage, less than the national minimum wage, or a rate of not more than one euro per hour in excess of the national minimum wage.</P>
        <P>My Department does not have details of payments made to individual employees of external contractors engaged by the Department. However, when tendering for services, my Department requires that potential contractors are in compliance with the necessary statutory <Col N="514"/>terms and conditions applicable to all workers in Ireland, including, where appropriate any Joint Labour Committee Agreements.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> if he will make provision for compensating registered charitable organisations for VAT payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply. This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</P>
        <P>The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group (ICTRG) appears to accept that charities can not be granted VAT refunds through the tax system. However, they are still seeking the introduction of a grant or subsidy in lieu of the VAT charities pay on their business inputs and estimate that this would cost &euro;18 million per annum.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the 140 bodies represented by the ICTRG already acknowledge that they receive &euro;8.6 million in funding either directly or indirectly from the Exchequer. However, there are currently 7,000 charities registered with the Revenue Commissioners. It is therefore likely that the introduction of a scheme along the lines proposed by the ICTRG would cost the Exchequer significantly more than the &euro;18 million they have estimated. The ICTRG will argue that they represent the largest charities but as many educational and sporting organisations are also registered with the Revenue Commissioners as charitable or not-for-profit organisations that is not the case. Therefore, the introduction of grant in lieu of VAT paid by registered charities would undoubtedly lead to other exempt bodies such as schools, hospitals and sporting, many of which are already registered as charities, seeking to benefit from such a system of refunds. These exempt bodies are already receiving considerable Exchequer funding.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the tax code currently provides exemption for charities from Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Capital Acquisitions Tax, Stamp Duty, Probate Tax and Dividend Withholding Tax. Moreover, charities also benefit significantly from the uniform scheme of tax relief for donations, which was introduced in the Finance Act 2001 and which, for the first time, allowed tax relief on personal donations to domestic charities and other approved bodies.  The relief is based on the taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal rate which for an individual donor could be as high as <Col N="515"/>41%. In the case of donations from the PAYE sector the relief is given directly to the charities.</P>

	<P>Section 21 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 provides that a credit union member aged 16 or over, can nominate in writing a person or persons to become entitled to all or part of the member&rsquo;s property in the credit union at the time of the member&rsquo;s death up to a prescribed limit and provides for the member to vary or revoke their nomination.</P>
        <P>The request for an increase in the Section 21 limit for nominations originated from the credit union movement, taking account of increased levels of savings and price changes since the limit was set in 1997.  In their submission to my Department the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) pointed out that nominations have a social purpose in that they ensure that the next-of-kin do not have to go through an expensive and time-consuming legal process in relation to the deceased member&rsquo;s property in the credit union.  The increase in the limit from &euro;13,000 to &euro;23,000 was approved by the Registrar of Credit Unions and by the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC), the statutory expert advisory body on credit union issues.</P>
        <P>ILCU have advised my Department that they are revising their guidance notes for credit unions to ensure that members are advised when they are completing nomination forms as to the implications of the nomination in respect of any existing or subsequent wills, and that this is already highlighted in ILCU&rsquo;s nomination form.</P>

	<P>Investments under the National Development Plan/ Community Support Framework (NDP/CSF) 2000-2006 are delivered through seven Operational Programmes which are directly managed and implemented by Government Departments, the Regional Assemblies and other agencies.  Progress on the implementation of the NDP/CSF is subject to ongoing monitoring through the individual Operational Programme Monitoring Committees and the overarching NDP/CSF Monitoring Committee chaired by my Department.</P><Col N="518"/>
        <P>Furthermore, according to EU Regulations, progress on the NDP/CSF must be monitored and reported on a regional basis, that is, for the Border, Midlands &amp; Western and Southern &amp; Eastern regions.  My Department reviews and generally monitors implementation of the NDP/CSF on this basis from information submitted by the Operational Programme Monitoring Committees but does not monitor expenditure at county level.</P>
        <P>However, the project implementing bodies do attribute spending at county level.  The most recent county level information from the project implementing bodies for the period January 2000 to December 2002 represents approximately 80% of the spending.  This information is set out in the following table and includes details in relation to Donegal.</P>
        <P>In addition, the NDP/CSF information website (www.ndp.ie) provides information on certain projects categorised on a county basis and the Deputy may wish to refer to that website for information on projects in County Donegal.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Where an individual contributes to a pension and that individual would, but for the insufficiency of his/her relevant earnings or employment remuneration in a particular tax year, be entitled to tax relief in respect of such contributions in that year, the individual concerned may seek tax relief on those pension contributions in a later tax year for which he/she has relevant earnings or employment remuneration (subject, of course, to the normal age-related and overall earnings limits for tax relief in respect of pension contributions).</P>
        <P>Many pension schemes provide for a pension, not alone for the holder, but also for the surviving spouse should the holder predecease the spouse. Pension contributions to a pension scheme that provides for widows/widowers and orphans also qualify for tax relief in the normal manner.</P>
        <P>The purpose of funding pension arrangements is to enable an individual to provide an adequate income in retirement for him or herself and <Col N="520"/>family dependants relative to his or her pre-retirement income.

I have no plans to amend them in the manner suggested by the Deputy.</P>

        <Quest> if the Revenue Commissioners will review the application of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 6W for top slicing relief; if they will allow the claim in all the circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that the taxpayer&rsquo;s claim for top slicing relief was made outside the time limit of four years as laid down in the Finance Act 2003.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Finance Act 2003 introduced a new time limit for claiming tax repayments. Where a claim is made after 1 January 2005 the overall time limit is reduced from 10 to 4 years. The change was announced in the Budget speech in December 2002 and the measure received a considerable amount of print and broadcast media publicity at that time.</P>
        <P>Reminders of this change were advertised by Revenue in the national press in October and November 2004. In addition to the Revenue advertisements there was considerable comment about this change including a number of newspaper articles, towards the end 2004.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately the taxpayer&rsquo;s claim for top slicing relief for the year 2001 was made well outside the four year limit from the end of the year of assessment. To be within the time limit, the claim should have been made before 31 December 2005, whereas in fact the claim was first made in October 2006.  It is not therefore possible to allow a claim for relief at this stage.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the position regarding stamp duty and inheritance tax especially in relation to a parent leaving their house to their two children. </Quest>
        <QRef>[43944/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a charge to stamp duty does not arise where the house passes to the children by inheritance on the death of the parent.</P>
        <P>Whether inheritance tax arises when a parent leaves a house to his/her children depends on the circumstances. The Finance Act 2000 introduced a package of measures specifically designed to reduce the impact of inheritance tax for certain dwelling houses. The purpose of this exemption was to benefit individuals who had been living in a house for a period prior to taking the benefit, either by way of inheritance. The main conditions <Col N="521"/>attaching to the exemption are that the beneficiary of the dwelling house must have resided in the house for a minimum of 3 years prior to the inheritance and must not have an interest in any other dwelling house. Also, the recipient or recipients must continue to occupy that dwelling house as his/her only or main residence for a period of 6 years commencing on the date of the inheritance. This exemption ensures that what may be the family home for many people will not be the subject of inheritance tax when it is inherited.</P>
        <P>If this relief does not apply in the case in question, the children can avail of the &ldquo;Group thresholds&rdquo;.  The relationship between the person who provided the inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who received the inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum tax-free threshold &mdash; known as the &ldquo;Group threshold&rdquo;.  There are three Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer and these thresholds are indexed annually by reference to the Consumer Price Index.  The indexed Group threshold applying to an inheritance received by a child from their parents is the Group A threshold.  In 2006 this threshold was &euro;478,155 and for 2007 the threshold is &euro;496,824.  Each child is separately entitled to its own Group A threshold.</P>
        <P>Any other inheritances that might have been received by the child from the parents since 5 December 1991 will also be taken into account on each occasion when applying the threshold for the purposes of calculating the inheritance tax. If the total value of all inheritances received by the child since this date from the parents is above the threshold figure then a 20% rate of inheritance tax will apply on the excess over the threshold figure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in relation to sellers of equipment through casual arrangements such as fairs and on a door to door basis, no separate registration provisions exist and the normal arrangements with regard to VAT and Income Tax registration apply.  I am also advised that the Revenue Commissioners have engaged on a continuous basis with the regular participants at fairs and exhibitions to advise them of their compliance obligations.  Accord<Col N="522"/>ingly, many such traders are registered for VAT and remit through the normal return process.</P>
        <P>Because &lsquo;casual traders&rsquo; are not recorded separately in Revenue&rsquo;s tax register, there is no specific information available on the level of such activity that took place in 2006, nor are there statistics available on the amounts of VAT and Income Tax paid by such sellers.</P>
        <P>Revenue manages the risk presented by &lsquo;casual traders&rsquo; through periodic compliance testing of the registration status and remittance position of those operating at markets etc.  Revenue staff regularly visit Exhibitions, Fairs, Open-air markets, Seasonal Street Traders, Music Concerts and major sporting events to ensure that participants and traders are tax compliant.  From time to time, joint compliance operations are carried out by Revenue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish National Federation Against Copyright Theft (INFACT).  Revenue also routinely obtain details of casual trading licences issued by local authorities for any follow up action required.</P>
        <P>While there has been no general audit of this sector as a whole during the past five years, audits would have taken place on individual traders where Revenue&rsquo;s Risk Profiling indicated a need for a specific intervention.  Where Revenue receive complaints in relation to the operations in this sector, these are followed up as required.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 518 and 561 together.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan 2007-2013 sets out in Chapter 3 a strong framework for the promotion of regional development with a particular focus on investment in the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) Gateway centres.</P>
        <P>These Gateway centres include 5 &mdash; Dundalk, Letterkenny/Derry, Midlands, Galway and Sligo &mdash; which are in the Border, Midlands and West Regional Authority areas. The NDP also empha<Col N="523"/>sises the need to invest in other areas in the Gateway centres including key towns, villages and rural areas.</P>
        <P>The Plan sets out an indicative allocation of some &euro;184 billion for investment in specified sectoral areas over the period. It is not possible at this juncture to state precisely how much of this will be allocated to the 5 Gateway areas referred to above. However, Chapter 3 does detail the development challenges facing each Gateway area and sets out a number of key Programmes and Projects to be developed in response over the period of the Plan.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Plan provides for the establishment of a Gateways Innovation Fund of some &euro;300 million of Exchequer funding for the period 2008-2010. The purpose of this fund is to leverage matching private and other public funding for projects that give added value to Gateway development. The Fund will of course be accessible to Gateway areas in the Border, Midlands and West Regional Authority areas.</P>
        <P>In summary, I am confident that the overall level of investment in the Plan, combined with key Programmes and Projects referred to, can bring about the further economic development of the Gateway centres, including those in the Border, Midlands and West Region.</P>

        <P FLI="0">As a general rule, all vehicles imported permanently into the State must be registered for VRT purposes.  However, section 135 of the Finance Act, 1992, and Regulations made thereunder, provide for a range of circumstances in which foreign-registered vehicles, brought temporarily into the State, are exempted from the registration requirement.  Foreign residents working here temporarily are permitted to use foreign-registered vehicles in the State, normally for a period not exceeding 12 months, as are foreign students.  The exemption also extends to include vehicles brought into the State by tourists, or by other non-residents who are in the State on a casual basis, e.g. Northern Ireland residents on shopping trips.  The use of foreign-registered company and commercial vehicles by State residents is also permitted in certain circumstances.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the <Col N="526"/>Finance Act 2003 put in place a package of measures relating to the repayment of overpaid tax. This took place against the background of a special report by the Ombudsman to the Oireachtas in November 2002 highlighting among other things the lack of a general scheme of interest on repayments. At the time there was no general statutory right to the repayment of overpaid tax nor was there any general entitlement to interest in respect of repayments. The new measures were also enacted against the background of a number of court decisions which, based on the &ldquo;doctrine of unjust enrichment&rdquo;, had on a piecemeal case by case basis established a common law right to the repayment of tax with interest.</P>
        <P>The Finance Act 2003 measures provided for a new general statutory right to the repayment of overpaid tax. They also provided for a 4 year time limit on the making of repayment claims. This was, however, balanced on the assessment side with a 4 year time limit on the raising of assessments and the making of enquiries by Revenue (except in cases of fraud or neglect). Finally, provision was made for the payment of interest on all repayments at an annual rate of slightly over 4%. During the course of the Finance Bill 2003 my predecessor indicated that the measures being put in place achieved the necessary balance between establishing a fair and uniform system for taxpayers while at the same time protecting the interests of the Exchequer. It also addressed the issue raised by the Ombudsman in respect of the need for a general scheme for the repayment of overpaid tax.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the current arrangements continue to achieve the necessary balance between establishing a fair and uniform system for taxpayers while at the same time providing the necessary protection for the Exchequer.</P>

        <P>In relation to cases settled by negotiation and agreement with Revenue, this generally involves <Col N="527"/>compromise on both sides. It is only where agreement cannot be reached or if the person assessed so requests, that a formal assessment is appealed to the Appeal Commissioner(s).  The Appeal Commissioners is the body, independent of the Government or any other entity, including the Revenue Commissioners, appointed to hear and determine tax and customs appeals. Their decision is final and conclusive unless the person assessed requests a rehearing in the Circuit Court or unless a request is made for a case stated to the High Court, on a point of law.   The Appeal Commissioner(s) make their decisions having regard to evidence presented and arguments made by both Revenue and the person assessed. They may confirm the assessment raised or change the quantum of the assessment, i.e., either increasing or reducing the figures in the assessment.  In the case of an assessment that has been raised, further tax penalties, if penalties are due based on the facts in the case, will be levied where the assessment is determined in a higher figure. If such an assessment is determined in a lower figure, the tax penalties arising will be reduced; including in some cases a reduction to a nil amount.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the above procedures are fair and equitable to both the taxpayer and Revenue and are also in line with the provisions for appeals set out in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no plans to tape record interviews between their officials and taxpayers and accountants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Taxpayers&rsquo; rights are safeguarded in a number of ways. Revenue auditors operate within the framework of Revenue&rsquo;s Customer Service Charter.  The Customer Service Charter sets out the fundamental elements of the service that taxpayers are entitled to and what Revenue expects of taxpayers. In addition Revenue Auditors carry out audits within the framework of the Code of Practice for Revenue Auditors and the Operations Manual for Outdoor Powers. The three documents are available at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>There would be no additional benefit to the citizen or the State in incurring the significant expense of formally recording interviews between taxpayers, accountants and Revenue Auditors. <Col N="528"/>Detailed contemporaneous notes of audit interviews are kept. Access to these notes may be obtained under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three significant financial elements of the sugar compensation package, as far as farmers, as sugar beet growers, are concerned. The first is an amount of &euro;123 million, payable over the next seven years via the single payment scheme, as compensation for the drop in the support price of beet. The second element of the compensation package is the restructuring aid. In July 2006 the Government decided that a sum of &euro;40m restructuring aid be reserved for beet growers. This decision has been challenged by the Irish sugar processor by way of Judicial Review proceedings in the High Court.  The third element is the diversification aid worth almost &euro;44m, which will be drawn down in the framework of the National Restructuring Programme.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are of the view that payments under the first two elements of the package in relation to the support price compensation and the restructuring aid to growers will be taxable as income.  I am further advised that the Revenue Commissioners await some clarifications to enable them to finalise a view about the tax implications of the third element of the package, the diversification aid. The National Restructuring Programme on this element of the package was recently submitted to the EU Commission for consideration.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) that a site for the new decentralised offices in Newcastle West was purchased from Limerick County Council in 2005.  In common with other projects in the Decentralisation Programme, following receipt and evaluation of Expressions of Interest, tenders for the proposed building were invited by the OPW from a number of contractors on a design/build basis and a preferred tenderer was identified.</P>
        <P>A planning application was lodged by the preferred tenderer with Limerick County Council in <Col N="529"/>October 2006.  In December 2006, additional information was requested by the Council in relation to the foul sewer, the site boundaries and the front elevation of the proposed building.  Also requested by the Council was a comprehensive historical study and comprehensive record drawings and a photographic study relating to certain existing buildings which were on the site at the time of purchase.  In the interests of moving the project forward, the OPW is assisting the preferred tenderer in providing the additional information.  A decision by the Council on the planning application will be due within four weeks of the date of receipt by it of the additional information.</P>
        <P>On receipt of a satisfactory planning permission, the OPW will endeavour to have the working drawings and other necessary documents completed by the preferred tenderer with a view to a contract being placed and work commencing on site at the earliest possible date.</P>

        <Quest> the circumstances in which a person coming to work here may import a vehicle and not be required to register the vehicle for vehicle registration tax, road tax, car insurance, national car test and driver testing; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 527 to 529, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that responsibility for road tax, car insurance, the national car test, driver testing, or an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not lie <Col N="530"/>with my Department. My reply, therefore, is only in respect of vehicle registration and vehicle registration tax.</P>
        <P>As a general rule, all vehicles imported permanently into the State must be registered for VRT purposes.  However, section 135 of the Finance Act, 1992, and Regulations made thereunder, provide for a range of circumstances in which foreign-registered vehicles, brought temporarily into the State, are exempted from the registration requirement.  Foreign residents working here temporarily are permitted to use foreign-registered vehicles in the State, normally for a period not exceeding 12 months, as are foreign students studying here.  The exemption also extends to include vehicles brought into the State by tourists, or by other non-residents who are in the State on a casual basis, e.g. Northern Ireland residents on shopping trips.  The use by State residents of foreign-registered commercial vehicles, and of foreign-registered cars provided by employers, is also permitted in certain circumstances.</P>
        <P>These provisions are required to be in conformity with Article 39 of the EU Treaty, which provides for the free movement of EU workers between Member States, and a reciprocal arrangement also applies to Irish residents who bring their cars temporarily to other Member States.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no requirement for vehicles imported under the temporary exemption provisions to be presented to the Revenue Commissioners to avail of the relief.  Documents relating to ownership and registration must be kept within the vehicle when it is in use in the State, for production as required.  When such vehicles fail to meet the conditions for temporary exemption they must be permanently removed from the State or presented for registration.   It is not a requirement of the registration process either to declare the nationality of the person importing the vehicle or to record whether the person is working here.</P>
        <P>Therefore, the details of such vehicles are not normally captured or held in the vehicle registration system and data on the number of persons availing of the temporary exemption at any particular point in time, or who have availed of it prior to registration, is not available.</P>
        <P>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their officers, who are based at numerous locations around the country, carry out regular and ongoing checks to identify and deal with breaches of VRT Regulations, particularly in relation to the permanent retention of such vehicles in the State or their coming into the possession of State residents.  In addition, co-ordinated national enforcements campaigns are periodically carried out to detect infringements in this area.</P><Col N="531"/>
        <P>The following table provides information regarding the level of enforcement activity since 1998 to date and includes the level of enforcement action arising from the detections.  It is <Col N="532"/>worth noting the significant increase in the number of vehicles challenged during 2006 compared to recent years, reflecting the efforts being made to tackle abuse in this area.</P><Col N="531"/>

        <P FLI="0">The amount of Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) due to be paid each year is dependent on the amount of monies on deposit and the rates of interest applying to such deposits, rather than on the number of accounts involved.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the statutory return of DIRT filed by the financial institutions requires details only of the relevant amount of interest paid in the year and the appropriate tax in relation to the payment of that interest.  Such DIRT returns are subject to audit by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>A refund of DIRT is provided for in very limited circumstances only, viz. an individual who is not liable or fully liable to income tax and is over 65 years of age at some time during the tax year, or is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental/physical infirmity from maintaining themselves (Bodies qualifying for &lsquo;charitable&rsquo; status and companies are also entitled to refund of DIRT).</P>
        <P>Under existing provisions, the taxpayer must advise Revenue that they meet the legislative requirements and the amount of the retention tax paid.  However, as the Deputy is aware, I announced in the recent Budget that, in 2007, credit institutions will be enabled to operate DIRT-free accounts for those aged 65 and over and for those who are permanently incapacitated, where their income falls below the relevant income tax limits.  These changes will be included in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners issued 11,620 copies of the relevant Form (Form 54D) for 2005 to those who had claimed refunds in previous years.  The Forms for 2006 will be issued during the first quarter of 2007.</P>

	<P>I would point out that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Act 2001, and that I, as Minister for Finance, have no function in decisions in this regard. </P>
        <P>The Valuation Act, 2001 provides in Schedule 3, Sections 1(a) and (b) that all buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose including constructions affixed thereto are rateable.  The basic premise under the Act is that all interests (including buildings) and all developed land are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4.</P>
        <P>Equestrian centres typically include stables for horses, a covered riding ring and ancillary buildings to support the enterprise.  These are not excluded from ratability under the Act.  Land that is developed for sport, such as, for example, playing pitches, golf courses, tennis courts etc is exempt under Schedule 4, Section 4.  Buildings on these lands, such as stands, bars, etc. are not, however, exempt.  Non-licensed club-houses are treated as &ldquo;community halls&rdquo; and as such are exempt because they are not run for profit, are open to the general community, are recreational or otherwise are of a social nature.  It is considered that none of the specific exemptions contained in Schedule 4 would encompass equestrian centres.</P>
        <P>The Valuation Act, 2001 maintains the long-standing position that commercial enterprises &mdash;  including equestrian centres &mdash; are liable for rates.  Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other useful services and products, which would be difficult in equity to resist.  The process could thus substantially reduce Local Authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.</P>
        <P>The rateable valuation of commercial property is based on net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of the property.  Any ratepayer dissatisfied with the ratability of a property, the valuation assessed on a particular property or the method of calculation can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is also a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</P>
        <P>Rating legislation, as distinct from valuation legislation, and issues arising from it are matters for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I <Col N="536"/>would also point out that in relation to funding for equestrian centres; the Irish Sports Council has provided funding of over &euro;4m to the Equestrian Federation of Ireland between 1999 and 2006.  From 2007 funding for equestrian sport will be provided through the new national governing body Horse Sport Ireland.  Grants of &euro;66,000 have been allocated to Equestrian sports in the past five years under the Sports Capital Programme administered by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  Equestrian projects have also been supported under the Tourism Product Development Scheme 2000-2006 (grant aid of &euro;3.45m has been approved in respect of 7 projects) towards the provision and development of equestrian centres.</P>

	<P>The Pensions Incentive Tax Credits scheme was introduced by me in last year&rsquo;s Finance Act to encourage SSIA holders, particularly those on low incomes, to continue the savings habit and to commence or improve their pension arrangements under the scheme. </P>
        <P>For each &euro;3 of matured SSIA funds invested by an eligible SSIA holder in an approved pension product, the Exchequer will contribute an additional &euro;1 by way of tax credit to a maximum of &euro;2,500.  The Exchequer will also contribute an additional tax credit relating to the exit tax deducted from the SSIA on maturity and based on the proportion of SSIA funds transferred to the pension product.  The main condition attaching to the Pensions Incentive Tax Credits scheme is that gross income for the year prior to the year in which the SSIA matures cannot <Col N="537"/>exceed &euro;50,000. The intention behind this condition was to target the incentive at lower income earners.  Setting any limit for this purpose is always difficult because there will be some individuals who will fall marginally at the wrong side of the limit and who will not qualify for the incentive. This would be the case irrespective of what income limit was set. The income limit in the case of this incentive is reasonable, in my view, and I do not propose to change it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 536 and 569 together. </P>
        <P>Section 1025 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the taxation treatment of payments made under legally enforceable arrangements by one spouse of a marriage to the other spouse in consideration, or in consequence, of the annulment or dissolution of a marriage or where the couple are separated.  Legally enforceable arrangements include court orders, arbitration awards and deeds of separation including foreign orders and arrangements.</P>
        <P>Payments for the maintenance of the other spouse are: payable without deduction of tax, deductible in computing the total income of the payer and chargeable to income tax in the hands of the recipient.</P>
        <P>In effect the income is treated as if was the income of the recipient and not the payer.  Maintenance payments in respect of children are not taxable in the hands of the children or the receiving spouse.  The effect of this is that the payments are treated the same way as if the taxpayer was providing for the child out of his or her after-tax income.  This is in line with the tax treatment of all other parents, where the cost of maintaining their children is not tax deductible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would draw to the Deputy&rsquo;s attention that the stamp duty head of charge for mortgages was abolished in the recent Budget with regard to mortgage deeds executed on or after 7 December 2006.  The cost of abolishing the mortgage head of charge was estimated at &euro;20m in 2007 and in a full year.  The duty was abolished in the context of the simplification of the stamp duty code for both the Revenue Commissioners and practitioners, particularly in advance of the proposed introduction of E-Stamping. </P>
        <P>Before the stamp duty on mortgages was abolished, primary mortgages had been exempt up to the value of &euro;254,000, and those at higher values were subject to stamp duty of 0.1% subject to a maximum duty of &euro;630 whether in respect of residential or non-residential property.  The exemption threshold for primary mortgages was raised in 2001 from &pound;20,000 to &pound;200,000, and was converted to &euro;254,000 in 2002.  The duty that had applied to collateral or additional mortgages was generally a &euro;12.50 fixed duty and in the case of equitable mortgages and transfers of mortgages, was generally 0.05%, subject to a maximum of &euro;630.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Valuation Act 2001, which came into effect on 2nd May 2002, provides that commercially operated child care facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, cr&egrave;ches, and Montessori schools are liable for rates unless specific criteria for exemption are met.  This is a continuation of the pre May 2002 situation.  In regard to the Valuation Act, 2001, I should point out that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties <Col N="539"/>under the Act, and that I, as Minister for Finance, have no function in decisions in this regard. </P>
        <P>It was not intended that the Valuation Act 2001 would expand or contract the valuation base.  The effect of removing any category of property such as commercially operated childcare centres from the valuation base would be to increase the rates burden on other ratepayers.  At the time of drafting the Valuation Act 2001 it was considered that where Exchequer assistance to certain sectors was desirable it should be direct assistance rather than interfering with local authority funding by way of rates relief.</P>
        <P>Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 outlines the categories of property and the various uses that are deemed to be non rateable under the Act.  Paragraphs 10 (education) and 16 (charitable purposes) are two areas in that schedule which may be relevant to the `ratability of pre-school facilities.  In the area of education, paragraph 10 Schedule 4, exemption is limited to educational institutions, not established and not conducted for making profit or funded wholly or mainly from funds provided by the Exchequer and in either case is open to the general public.  Paragraph 16 Schedule 4 provides exemption for charitable organisations that occupies and uses its facility exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for profit.  Therefore cr&egrave;ches/pre-school/playschool facilities established on a non-profit generating basis and/or operated by a charitable organisation for charitable purposes are not liable for rates.</P>
        <P>The rateable valuation of commercial property is based on the net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of the property.  Any ratepayer dissatisfied with the ratability of a property, the valuation assessed on a particular property or the method of calculation can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.  Rating legislation, as distinct from valuation legislation, and issues arising from it are matters for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>The core objective of Government policy in the area of child support is to provide assistance which will offer real choice to parents and which will benefit all children.  Following on from increases in Child Benefit in Budget 2006, this policy has seen a further increase of &euro;10 per month announced in Budget 2007.  This increase will come into effect in April 2007 and will bring the monthly rate of Child Benefit to &euro;160 for the first and second child and &euro;195 for the third and subsequent child.</P>
        <P>Budget 2006 also marked the introduction of a National Childcare Strategy costing a cumulative <Col N="540"/>&euro;2.65bn over five years to address the supply and the cost of childcare.  This strategy included the introduction of the Early Childcare Supplement worth &euro;1,000 annually for each child up to his/her sixth birthday.  A four week extension to both paid and unpaid maternity leave was introduced in 2006 and a further four week increase to both paid and unpaid maternity leave becomes effective in 2007, bringing the duration of paid maternity leave up to 26 weeks at that time and the duration of unpaid leave to 16 weeks.</P>
        <P>A major new multi-annual National Childcare Investment Programme, running from 2006-2010, will support the creation of an extra 50,000 childcare places of which approximately 20% will be for 3 to 4 year age group and will provide an early childhood care and education focus.  To date, over 900 capital grant applications, amounting to more than &euro;170m, have been received.  To complement the roll-out of these new places, a total of 17,000 childcare workers will be trained over five years.  Under the EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Programme 2000-2006, more than 32,000 new places have been created and a further 24,500 places have been supported with grant-aid allocations amounting to almost &euro;500m over the last six years.</P>
        <P>I would also mention that in December 2005, the Government established the Office of the Minister for Children (OMC) to bring greater coherence to policy making for children.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Childcare Facilities in June 2001.  The Guidelines indicate that planning authorities should ensure that their Development Plans and Local Area Plans should include policies in relation to the provision of childcare facilities.  The Guidelines state that planning authorities should require the provision of at least one childcare facility for new housing areas unless there are significant reasons to the contrary, for example, development consisting of single bedroomed apartments or where there are adequate childcare facilities in adjoining developments.  For new housing areas, a threshold of one childcare facility for each 75 dwellings is suggested as being appropriate.</P>

A follow up meeting to discuss the findings of this report was held with the engineers on 15 January, 2007.  Following on from these discussions the position is that major structural repairs are required as a matter of urgency to ensure the safety of the bridge.  The engineers have been requested to prepare a proposal for the necessary works and to provide a provisional timetable for the work and a preliminary estimate of cost.  Once this information is to hand officials from OPW will enter into discussions with Coillte, who co-own the bridge, on the carrying out of the repair work.  The extent of the work involved will necessitate the complete closure of the bridge to both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. In such circumstances OPW will have to consider the closure of the heritage site at this location during the coming season.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer in question is in receipt of round sum travel expenses from her employer based on logged expenses over a three month period.  The law provides that a deduction can be claimed for travel expenses only if they are incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in performing the duties of the employment.  Payments by an employer which are no more than a reimbursement of allowable expenses actually incurred by an employee in performing the duties of the employment may be paid tax free.  This can be done by the employer paying an allowance which does not exceed the equivalent Civil Service allowance as set out in Revenue Leaflet IT51.  (This leaflet can be viewed on Revenue&rsquo;s website at www.revenue.ie/leaflet/it51.htm.)  However, in the case in question the round sum allowance paid by the employer is not in accordance with Leaflet IT51 and is therefore taxable.  The employer has been instructed by Revenue that PAYE/PRSI deductions must be made from these round sum expenses with effect from 1 January 2007.  This does not preclude the taxpayer from subsequently claiming a tax deduction in respect of vouched expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the duties of her employment. </P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a person who has no personal pension but whose spouse has a pension of &euro;29,000 per annum can avail of the Pensions Incentive Tax Credits scheme subject to the individual satisfying the following conditions: Be an SSIA holder; the SSIA holder&rsquo;s gross income (i.e. before all deductions) in the tax year before the year in which the SSIA matures does not exceed &euro;50,000; the SSIA funds are invested within 3 months of the maturity of the SSIA. </P>
        <P>Homemakers, and all other individuals, who have no occupational pension can also avail of the incentive subject to them satisfying the conditions outlined above.  In addition, and in accordance with my statement in this matter of 29th September 2006, SSIA funds invested in pension <Col N="544"/>products should remain there for at least 12 months in order to retain the tax credits.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the lending poli<Col N="544"/>cies and practices of the institution concerned.  The lending policies and practices operated by any financial institution within the current legal and regulatory framework are the responsibility of the institution itself, in respect of which the Minister for Finance does not exercise any statutory function. </P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, consumer credit including hire purchase and consumer hire, together with moneylending and home loans, are governed by the Consumer Credit Act 1995, which sets out important consumer protection measures, including the form and content of the credit agreements in respect of those types of loans. Complaints in relation to the matters governed by the Consumer Credit Act may be dealt with by the Financial Services Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>The Irish Credit Bureau (ICB) is an independent, commercial organisation and as such I, as Minister for Finance, have no role in determining <Col N="545"/>its operations or the scope of its activities.  However, my Department understands that the ICB does not decide who credit is offered to, but rather helps lenders to make this decision through the provision of information regarding the loan history. Were such information not available, it is likely that the cost of credit would rise for many customers in order to allow for the higher uncertainty as to the credit risk involved.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 133 of the Finance Act 1992 provides the legislative basis for the requirement for manufacturers or distributors to provide a declaration to the Revenue Commissioners of statutory chargeable values (or open market selling prices, OMSPs, as they are referred to) for all new vehicles in the State for vehicle registration tax (VRT) purposes. </P>
        <P>The OMSPs of new vehicles are required as the basis for assessing VRT liability.

Revenue are currently required, therefore, to observe that confidentiality.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a site purchased which falls within the one acre curtilage of an existing residential property i.e. a corner garden, is classified as residential property for stamp duty purposes.  The consideration paid or value of the property must exceed &euro;127,000 before stamp duty is charged.  The purchaser cannot claim First Time Purchaser Relief as that relief applies only to the purchase of a dwellinghouse or apartment </P>
        <P>A site purchased outside of a curtilage is classified as non-residential property for stamp duty purposes and duty is charged on a consideration or value over &euro;10,000.</P>
        <P>In relation to the purchase of a new dwellinghouse by a first-time buyer, or any other buyer purchasing a new house as his or her principal private residence, stamp duty does not arise where the property does not exceed 125m².  However, I would point out that a developer purchasing a site on which new housing is to be constructed will normally incur a stamp duty liability on the purchase of the land.</P>

        <Quest> if he has considered changes in the tax rules affecting cohabiting couples who are particularly unfairly treated where only one is working, in view of a number of recent reports on the need to make changes in this area, and the positive response which these reports have received from Government. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Generally speaking, the tax system treats members of cohabiting couples as separate and unconnected individuals.  Each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes and credits and bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  There are no special favourable tax arrangements for cohabiting couples with dependent children.  The Working Group Examining the Treatment of Married, Cohabiting and One-Parent Families under the Tax and Social Welfare Codes, which reported in August 1999, was sympathetic, in principle, to changes in the tax legislation to address the issues raised relating to cohabiting couples and reported that the options <Col N="547"/>that it set out should be considered further. However, it acknowledged in relation to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples that a key issue is whether tax law should proceed ahead of changes in the general law. </P>
        <P>I am aware of a number of recent reports which will help to inform the Government&rsquo;s deliberations in this general area including: the Tenth Progress Report of the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution entitled &lsquo;The Family&rsquo; which was published in early 2006; the Options Paper presented to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in November 2006 by the Working Group on Domestic Partnership; the Report of the Law Reform Commission on the rights and duties of cohabitants which was published in December 2006.</P>
        <P>I previously put on the record of the House that I would view as problematic and unwise a situation where changes in the tax code relating to the treatment of couples would set a headline in advance of developments in other relevant areas of public policy, for example, in the area of legal recognition of relationships other than married relationships.  I am still of that view.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the impact the 21% VAT on non-resident artists performing for not for profit arts organisations is having; his plans to tackle same in the Finance Bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I should explain that not-for-profit organisations are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive with which Irish law must comply.  The means that non-profit making organisations do not charge VAT on their services and cannot recover VAT on goods and services which they purchase.  Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT. </P>
        <P>The VAT Act lists a range of activities that are exempt from VAT.  Included in this list is the promotion of and admissions to live theatrical or musical performances.  This very broad exemption is allowed under Article 132 of the EU VAT Directive.  In effect, this means that the promoter <Col N="550"/>realises the full value of admission fee as no VAT is applied to admission fees. In this regard, the current exemption is already very generous covering a broad range of actives accessible to the wider public.</P>
        <P>In addition, one of the basic tenets of EU VAT law relates to the proper functioning of the internal market. This means that it is not possible to use VAT law to favour artists not resident in this state over artists that are resident in the state.  In relation to providing a VAT exemption for performance fees charged by musical or theatrical performers to not-for-profit arts organisations, the position is that the VAT treatment of a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the status of the customer.</P>
        <P>There is no provision in European VAT law that would allow for an exemption from VAT on supplies by non-resident artists when they perform for not-for-profit cultural organisations as such an exemption would have to apply to all such performers. It is estimated that this would cost in excess of &euro;20 million. All performance fees are therefore liable to VAT at the standard rate of 21 per cent.</P>

This is a taxable source of income but is not taken into account when determining her spouse&rsquo;s entitlement to the home carer tax credit.

        <P>Departments and Agencies are primarily responsible for the management of their own resources, including training and development of their staff. It is their responsibility, therefore, to ensure that they have sufficient capacity and adequately trained staff to discharge the function of spot-checks.</P>
        <P>I have also recently established the Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit (CEEU) in my Department, one of whose functions is to carry out periodic reviews of spot-check reports received in my Department from Departments and Agencies.  This Unit may also carry out some spot checks on its own initiative and more generally offer guidance and advice in the matter to Departments and Agencies.  At present six civil servants (including support staff) are assigned to the Unit. Two more expenditure evaluators are expected to join the Unit in the near future following a recent open recruitment process. In addition, my Department currently has four participants in the Masters Programme in Policy Analysis run by the IPA. Upon completion of the programme, they will be assigned as expenditure evaluators to the CEEU, two in mid 2007 and two in mid 2008.  All staff of the CEEU directly engaged in evaluations and spot checks have appropriate third-level qualifications, relevant work experience, and a good understanding of cost-benefit analysis and other project appraisal techniques.</P>
        <P>To assist Departments and Implementing Agencies in carrying out spot checks for compliance with the value for money requirements my Department issued draft guidelines in the matter to them for comment.  These guidelines <Col N="557"/>are now being finalised in the light of the views and comments received and they will be issued shortly.  The principles outlined in the draft guidelines, as circulated, represent best practice and Departments would be expected to have regard to them in carrying out spot checks pending finalisation of the guidelines.</P>

	<P>A Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit (CEEU) was recently established in my Department and is in its initial phase of operations.  There are currently six civil servants (including support staff) employed in the Unit.  Two more expenditure evaluators are expected to join the Unit in the near future following a recent open recruitment process. In addition, my Department currently has four participants in the Masters Programme in Policy Analysis delivered by the Institute of Public Administration (IPA) in association with the Faculty of Commerce, UCD. Upon completion of the programme, they will be assigned as expenditure evaluators to the Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit, two in mid 2007 and two in mid 2008. </P>
        <P>I established the CEEU as part of a range of recent initiatives to assist Value for Money (VFM) in public expenditure.  These initiatives also include the putting in place of a comprehensive approach to appraising and managing capital programmes and projects including requirements for: ex ante appraisal of all capital spending; cost benefit analysis of all capital projects costing more than &euro;30 million; regular reporting on progress to Departmental Management Advisory Committees and Boards of implementing agencies; appointment of an individual project manager to manage and monitor progress on all projects;  spot checks for compliance with the VFM requirements; and, post project reviews.</P>
        <P>I would stress that responsibility for achieving VFM for programmes and projects rests in the first instance with the relevant Departments and Implementing Agencies.  The role of the CEEU is to assist these bodies by promoting best practice in the evaluation and implementation of programme and project expenditure. It will focus in particular on ensuring that Department of Finance frameworks in relation to the appraisal and management of programmes and projects are being implemented and can carry out spot checks to verify this.  The Unit also oversees ongoing programme evaluation under the Value for <Col N="558"/>Money and Policy Review Initiative and it has a remit to develop and implement a scheme of programme evaluation under the new National Development Plan (2007-2013). Overall it is my objective that the CEEU will play an important role in inculcating better VFM practice throughout the system.</P>

        <Quest> the position in relation to a father who wishes to give a gift of a house on approximately one acre of land; the implications for capital gains tax and gift tax for father and son; if there are other taxes due on a gift of this size; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[2824/07] </QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the proposed gift of the house and land, in the circumstances outlined, would be treated as a disposal by the father for capital gains tax purposes.  In computing the gain the deemed sale price is the market value of the property at the date of the gift. For illustrative purposes a computation of the tax payable, using the figures and the limited information supplied by the Deputy, is attached.  However, full or partial main residence relief may apply if the father occupied the property as his only or main residence during his period of ownership. </P>
        <P>I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners the question of gift tax arising when a parent makes a gift of a house to his son depends on the circumstances.  The Finance Act 2000 introduced a package of measures specifically designed to reduce the impact of gift/inheritance tax for certain dwelling houses. The purpose of this exemption was to benefit individuals who had been living in a house for a period prior to taking the benefit, either by way of gift or inheritance. The main conditions attaching to the exemption are that the beneficiary of the dwelling house must have resided in the house for a minimum of 3 years prior to the gift/inheritance and must not have an interest in any other dwelling house.  Also, the recipient must continue to occupy that <Col N="560"/>dwelling house as his/her only or main residence for a period of 6 years commencing on the date of the gift/inheritance. This exemption ensures that what may be the family home for many people will not be the subject of gift/inheritance tax when it is the subject of a gift/inheritance.</P>
        <P>Where dwelling house relief does not apply, the son in question can avail of the &ldquo;Group threshold&rdquo; exemptions.  The relationship between the person who provided the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who received the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary) determines the maximum tax-free threshold- known as the &ldquo;Group threshold&rdquo;. The Group thresholds are based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer and these thresholds are indexed annually by reference to the Consumer Price Index.  The indexed Group threshold applying to a gift or inheritance received by a child from their parents is the Group A threshold and for 2007 this threshold is &euro;496,824.  Any other gifts/inheritances that might have been received by the child from the parents since 5 December 1991 will also be taken into account on each occasion when applying the threshold for the purposes of calculating the gift/inheritance tax.</P>
        <P>In this case, where the value of the house is &euro;400,000 approximately and where the son has received no previous gifts/inheritances from his parents, no gift tax will arise on the gift of the house by the father to his son.  This is because either the dwelling house exemption will apply to the gift depending on the circumstances, or if this exemption does not apply, the value of the gift will, in any event, be below the tax-free threshold of &euro;496,824 of the son from his parents.</P>
        <P>Consanguinity relief provides that a stamp duty liability is reduced by 50% in the case of transfers between certain blood relatives, such as from a parent to a child.  In this respect, a gift of a house valued at &euro;400,000 attracts a stamp duty liability of &euro;30,000 at the rate of 7.5%; which is reduced by 50% to &euro;15,000.  If the son in question has not previously purchased a house or has not received, on or after 22 June 2000, a gift of a house, first-time buyer&rsquo;s relief would apply and the stamp duty relief would apply at 6%.  In this circumstance, after the application of consanguinity relief, the stamp duty liability would be &euro;12,000.</P>
    <P el="10"><i>Capital Gains Tax &mdash; 2007</i></P>
        <P>The following computation illustrates the computation of capital gains tax payable on the gift of property from father to son, where the property was valued at &euro;400,000 in 2007 and purchased during the 12 months ending on 5/4/1978 for &euro;30,000.  The incidental costs of purchasing and gifting the property are estimated at &euro;1,000 and &euro;5,000 respectively.</P>
       <P>The computation is based on the legislation in place as at 31/1/2007.</P>

	<P>It was not necessary to carry out a Strategic Environmental Assessment of the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  This is because the Plan is primarily a strategic document and indicative financial Plan, is not unduly prescriptive as regards projects over the period and does not impact on the planning or environmental framework within which consent is given for individual projects.  It accordingly does not fall within the framework of the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive and it was not therefore subject to a formal SEA.  I would point out, however, that Environmental Sustainability is a key horizontal objective of the Plan and Chapter 6 of the Plan deals with this issue in some detail. </P>

        <P>The level of excise relief available &mdash; and the breakdown of the relief between each of the alternate fuels &mdash; is that which had been proposed by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in advance of Budget 2006.  It is regarded as a level which is sufficient to match Ireland&rsquo;s output potential in relation to renewable energy crops for motor fuels over the period of the scheme.  Consequently, any extension in the amount of relief which formed part of that Budget announcement is not envisaged at this stage.  The Deputy will, of course, be aware that there are non-fiscal measures that can be used to promote Biofuels, including pure plant oil.  These are, however, outside my remit but are under consideration by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that when goods are imported into, or received in Ireland from a country outside the EU they are liable to Import charges (Customs Duty, Anti-Dumping, Countervailing and Excise Duties where applicable and VAT) at the point of importation. </P>
        <P>Goods from the Channel Islands,which though part of the customs territory of the EU are not part of its fiscal territory, are treated as non-EU goods and are therefore liable to VAT.

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  The supply of all fuel products used for home heating and light are therefore subject to the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% under Article 28 (2e) of the Sixth VAT Directive.  This means that Member States had the option of maintaining, at a reduced rate of not less than 12%, any items not listed in Annex H of the Sixth VAT Directive, provided these items carried a reduced rate on 1 January 1991. In Ireland the parked VAT rate equates to our reduced rate of 13.5%. </P>
        <P>It would therefore be possible to reduce the VAT rate applicable to fuel and energy used for heat or light to 12%, for example, home heating oils, wood pellets, gas and electricity.  Even if this reduction is passed on in full it would have a minimal impact on the price of such supplies.  Altering the VAT structure by introducing a second reduced VAT rate would represent a fundamental change to the structure and operation of the VAT system, making administration more complex as well as increasing the administrative cost for the private sector.  Indeed, Ireland is one of only 8 Member States that apply a reduced or parked rate to such goods. In the majority of Member States the standard VAT rate is applied to such goods which can mean rates of between 15% and 25%.</P>
        <P>However, I would add that in the recent budget the Excise Duty on Kerosene and LPG was reduced to zero with effect from the 1st January 2007.  This measure follows through on the commitment in last year&rsquo;s Budget when these rates were halved.  This measure is estimated to cost &euro;24 million in 2007.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that, late last year, in response to these energy price increases, the Government took steps to improve the social welfare Household Benefits Package scheme by increasing the amount of electricity or gas entitlements covered under the scheme.  This will benefit over 340,000 social welfare recipients and cost almost &euro;50 million.</P>

	<P>Stamp duty exists on various financial cards in order to provide Exchequer revenue. The stamp duty on cheques, bills of exchange and promissory notes has existed for many years and when electronic means of money transfers were subsequently introduced, stamp duty was gradually extended to these products to ensure that the stamp duty from cheques etc. was not eroded.  The stamp duty applies irrespective of the volume of bank transactions made.  I do not believe that these charges are either excessive or act as a disincentive for pensioners using financial institutions.  In addition, the stamp duties on financial cards contribute significantly to the Exchequer and are in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates generally low.  Accordingly, there are no plans to introduce exemptions to stamp duty on financial cards for any category of individual. </P>

	<P>The &lsquo;living over the shop&rsquo; scheme commenced on 6 April 2001 and is due to terminate on 31 July 2008.  The aim of the scheme is to provide traders and investors with an incentive to develop existing vacant or under-utilised space over shops into residential accommodation.  The scheme is in operation for the cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford where the relevant local authority has designated certain streets as being eligible for the scheme.  Buildings that front onto designated streets can qualify for &lsquo;section 23&rsquo;-type relief, owner-occupier relief and capital allowances where expenditure is incurred on their construction, refurbishment or conversion.  Tax incentives only apply where the ground floor is in commercial use or, if vacant, where the last and the proposed use is commercial.  Incentives for commercial development are conditional on residential development also being carried out.  </P>
        <P>The relevant local authority must certify that the work is consistent with the aims, objectives and criteria for the &lsquo;living over the shop&rsquo; scheme.  The ground floor of the building must be in use, or be intended for use, for commercial purposes. Industrial premises, offices and premises used for the provision of mail order and financial services are excluded from the scheme.  The commercial part of the building must be in use either by an owner-occupier for the purposes of a trade or profession or by a lessee renting the premises on <Col N="568"/>bona fide commercial terms at arm&rsquo;s length.  The upper floor or floors of the building must be in use, or be intended for use, as residential accommodation.  The accommodation can be either rented to tenants or occupied by the owner.  The floor area for an individual residence must be at least 38 square metres and cannot exceed 125 square metres.</P>
        <P>The completed building must have a certificate of reasonable cost or a certificate of compliance issued by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Property developers are not permitted to claim relief under the scheme.</P>
        <P>Expenditure on construction, refurbishment or conversion of buildings can qualify for tax relief.  However, relief for expenditure on conversion work applies only in respect of the residential part of a building. Expenditure on refurbishment qualifies only where it amounts to 10% or more of the market value of the commercial part of the building before the refurbishment takes place. The cost of a site or of the existing building or any costs associated with the acquisition of the site or building do not qualify. Finally, the amount of expenditure incurred on the commercial part of a building is limited for relief purposes to the amount of relief arising on the residential part of the building.</P>
        <P>The original termination date by which qualifying construction, refurbishment or conversion work had to be carried out was 31 December 2004.  However, along with most of the other property-based incentive schemes, this date was extended in the Finance Act 2006 to 31 July 2008 where certain conditions are met.  These conditions require a full and valid application for planning permission to have been received by the relevant local authority by 31 December 2004 and work to the value of 15% of the overall qualifying costs to have been carried out by 31 December 2006.  There is a gradual reduction in the amount of expenditure that can qualify for relief after 31 December 2006.  Expenditure incurred during 2006 can qualify in full without restriction.  However, only 75% of expenditure incurred in 2007 and 50% of expenditure incurred in the period from 1 January 2008 to 31 July 2008 can qualify for relief.</P>

	<P>I assume that what the Deputy has in mind is the tax treatment in Ireland of maintenance payments received by a person from his or her former spouse resident in another EU country.</P><Col N="569"/>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the circumstances mentioned and where the maintenance payment is made under a legally enforceable maintenance arrangement, the person receiving the payment is liable for tax at his or her highest rate of tax on the amount of maintenance received for his or her benefit.</P>
        <P>This tax treatment arises from the provisions of Section 1025 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The section deals with payments made under a &ldquo;maintenance arrangement&rdquo;. A maintenance arrangement is defined as an order of court, rule of court, deed of separation, trust, covenant, agreement or arrangement or any other act giving rise to a legally enforceable arrangement and made or done in consequence of the separation or the annulment or dissolution of a marriage.</P>
        <P>The section provides that where a legally binding maintenance arrangement is in place, then (a) the paying spouse receives a tax deduction in respect of the alimony payments for the benefit of her/his spouse (but not in respect of maintenance for his/her children); and (b) the receiving spouse is taxed (at her/her highest rate of tax) on the amount of alimony received for her/his benefit (but is not taxed on the alimony received in respect of her/his children).</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that where both spouses are Irish resident for tax purposes, a separated (but not divorced) couple may jointly elect to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place and, where such an election is made, then the payer does not receive a tax deduction for the alimony payments and the receiving spouse is not taxable on them.</P>
        <P>Payments made under a non-legally binding arrangement are ignored for income tax purposes.</P>
        <P>Maintenance payments in respect of children are not taxable in the hands of the children or the receiving spouse.  The effect of this is that the payments are treated the same way as if the taxpayer was providing for the child out of his or her after-tax income.  This is in line with the tax treatment of all other parents, where the cost of maintaining their children is not tax deductible.</P>

	<P>The assessment of eligibility to medical cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants. Under Section 45 of the Health 1970 medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. Section 58 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, provides for GP visit cards for adult persons with limited eligibility for whom, in the opinion of the HSE, and notwithstanding that they do not qualify for a medical card, it would be unduly burdensome to arrange GP medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. Persons aged 70 and over are statutorily entitled to a medical card, regardless of their means. In all other cases an assessment of means is undertaken.</P>
        <P>In assessing eligibility, the HSE use guidelines based on people&rsquo;s means, which includes their income, certain allowable outgoings and the effect of factors such as medical need. These guidelines are not statutorily binding and a decision to refuse an application or renewal of a medical card may be appealed to the Executive for further consideration.</P>
        <P>Applicants whose sole income is derived from Department of Social and Family Affairs payments or HSE payments, which are below or in excess of the eligibility income guidelines will be granted a medical card.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 the medical card assessment guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29%.  Other significant changes which I have introduced are that applications are now considered on the basis of income net of tax and PRSI and that allowance is made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work. In June 2006, I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those used in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>My Department and the HSE are at present considering whether any further changes to the guidelines are required, having regard to factors such as changes in income levels generally, the nature of typical household outgoings and also changes to the various social welfare schemes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 606, 607 and 736 together.</P>
        <P>In 2006 I announced the Government&rsquo;s commitment to co-fund an innovative programme of prevention and early intervention for children. The Programme will run for a five-year period and has a fund amounting to &euro;36 million in total, half of which will be provided by Government and half by The Atlantic Philanthropies. The Programme is being managed by the Office of the Minister for Children (OMC) in conjunction with the co-funders.</P>
        <P>Tallaght West Childhood Development Initiative was one of three sites invited to submit a proposal under the Programme. Following evaluation by an international expert panel (on behalf of the Government) and separately by The Atlantic Philanthropies, the Tallaght West proposal has been approved for funding.  My Office is currently in discussion with Tallaght West CDI in relation to a Service Level Agreement, which is expected to be finalised very shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 608 and 792 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 &mdash; 2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>
        <P>Community based/not for profit groups who applied for staffing grant assistance under the EOCP submitted applications to the Childcare Directorate which, prior to December 2005 was within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  These applications were then forwarded to Pobal (formally known as ADM Ltd) which is engaged to manage the day-to-day operation of the programme.  Thorough appraisals of all applications are carried out by Pobal prior to their consideration by the Programme Appraisal Committee chaired by the Childcare Directorate.  The recommendations of the Committee are then forwarded for decision to the Secretary General of the Department.</P>
        <P>The Group in question was approved a total of &euro;137,000 in capital grant assistance in June 2005 under the EOCP towards an extension of their existing facility.</P>
        <P>In April 2002, the Group was approved a total of &euro;38,000 in staffing grant assistance under the EOCP for a period of 3 years.   Approval for an additional &euro;33,000 in staffing grant assistance was given in September 2005 for the period to 31 December 2007.  A request by the Group for additional staffing funding, to cover the childcare places associated with the extension of the service, was approved on 15 December 2006 with the grant of a further &euro;60,200.  This brings the total amount in staffing grant support approved to 31 December 2007, to &euro;131,200.  Each of the decisions to approve funding, including the most recent approval of 15 December 2006, has been communicated to the Group.</P>

        <P>With regard to the application for capital grant assistance under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 &mdash; 2006 referred to in the question, I understand that the Group concerned were notified in May 2006 that they were not recommended for capital grant assistance, as the project did not represent value for money when considered in line with building costs guidelines, and that there is a risk of duplication and displacement of existing services.  The letter informing the Group of this decision was dated 10 May 2006 and it further informed the Group that any appeal should be submitted within one month of the issue of that letter.  My Office is not aware of any formal appeal being submitted by the Group.  In order to obtain capital funding under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 contracts were required to be signed with Pobal, which is engaged to administer the grants, before 31 December 2006.  However, if the Group wish to have an application for capital grant assistance considered under the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010, they may do so by contacting Cork County Childcare Committee.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Many women in immediate post-partum will experience emotional changes sometimes described as the baby blues.   While distressing, this is usually transitory and responds well to family support and encouragement.  In a small number of cases, a more sustained and significant psychiatric disorder can be expected, two thirds of which can be described as affective (mood) disorder with significant depression or periods of elation, one third of which may take on a psychotic aspect.  Nursing staff in maternity hospitals would be familiar and alert to this phenomenon and mothers to be would be advised of same in antenatal preparation classes.  The family support and follow up visits by primary healthcare professionals, General Practitioner and Public Health Nurse, act as a support and guidance to new mothers and would be alert to symptoms of post-natal distress or depression.</P>
        <P>The three Dublin hospitals Rotunda, Coombe and Holles Street have four sessions of dedicated consultant psychiatry each and these work in close liaison with community based mental health services to provide specialist intervention when required.  With the development of liaison psychiatry similar arrangements are available to other maternity hospital outside Dublin.  The recently opened Elmount Unit in St Vincent&rsquo;s has  3 mother and child beds so that a mothers mental health needs can be addressed without disrupting the important bonding process between mother and baby.  Similar facilities are available in acute inpatient setting nationally.  If there is any clinical indication, concern or risk to the health and welfare of the child, mental health professionals will intervene to support and treat the mother&rsquo;s illness while ensuring the child&rsquo;s safety needs are met. <Col N="576"/> For women who have experienced post-natal mental health difficulties, subsequent pregnancies are managed in collaboration with local mental health services and occasionally it is possible to begin a treatment regime before the delivery with due regard to the impact of medication on the developing foetus.</P>
        <P>Under the Child Care Act, 1991 the Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for promoting the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  One of the major principles underlying policy in this area is that a child should, in so far as possible and having regard to his or her safety and welfare, be cared for within their own home.  Family support programmes are provided by services such as the Community Mothers, Family Support Workers, Teen Parents Support Projects, and Springboard Projects and encompass specific interventions such as Parents Plus programme and the Family First Parenting Initiative, as well as a range of general parenting programmes and supports.</P>
        <P>Under the Child Care Act, 1991 children can be taken into the care of the HSE, and placed in foster care or residential care, in accordance with the Child Care Regulations, 1995.  In the case of women with post-natal mental health difficulties where clinical indication suggest any significant risk to the baby or other children, HSE child care services may provide for short term fostering with supervised access until the mother&rsquo;s mental health has been restored.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it the question refers to the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Convention is the most widely ratified of the six core United Nations human rights treaties and the global support for it is a compelling demonstration of the international commitment of governments to the promotion and protection of children&rsquo;s rights.</P>
        <P>Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child without reservation in September 1992 and submitted its Second report in July 2005 to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. On 20th September, 2006 Ireland appeared before the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva to outline the progress that has been achieved in relation to the increased and enhanced development of policies and services for children since Ireland&rsquo;s last appearance before the Committee in 1998.</P>
        <P>The UN Committee welcomed Ireland&rsquo;s comprehensive Second report. The Committee com<Col N="577"/>mented on the fruitful and open dialogue with the Irish State delegation and welcomed the many new developments since Ireland&rsquo;s last report was examined in 1998, including a Minister for Children who sits at the Cabinet table, the establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children, the publication of the National Children&rsquo;s Strategy, and the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, to name but a few.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s implementation on each and every aspect of children&rsquo;s rights under the Convention is outlined in the report. Implementation takes the form of legislative, policy and administrative provisions across the range of policy areas.</P>
        <P>The Child Care Act, 1991 sets out the statutory framework within which child welfare and protection services for children aged 0-18 years are provided in Ireland.  The emphasis of the Act is on supporting children and families in their own communities having regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of the child to be brought up in their own family. The dominant focus in child care services since the early 1990s has been on the protection and care of children who are at risk.  This policy has shifted in recent times to also include a preventive approach to child welfare involving support to families and individual children, the aim being to avoid the need for further more serious interventions later on. The 1991 Act places statutory responsibility for the provision of child welfare and protection and family support services on the (Health Service Executive) HSE. Regulations and standards have been introduced on the placement of children in residential care, in foster care and with relatives. Inspections are carried out on the basis of those regulations by the Social Services Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>The United Nations committee hearings provide a useful opportunity for us to measure our progress and take stock of what has been achieved and identify priorities for the next stage of our development. As I acknowledged to the committee in Geneva, although there have been huge advances made in the position of children during the last ten years in Ireland, there are areas which need further development and investment.  The United Nations committee highlighted areas where further progress could be made, such as advancing the rights of the child in the Constitution.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach announced on Friday 3rd November, 2006 that a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights should take place and asked me as Minister for Children to initiate a process of consultation and discussion with the other D&aacute;il parties and with all relevant interest groups. I have engaged in a series of discussions with political party representatives, the Ombudsman for Children, non-governmental organisations (represented by the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance) and faith-based groups. Based on these discussions I will be bring<Col N="578"/>ing forward proposals for consideration by Cabinet.</P>
        <P>The Government will use the UN Committee&rsquo;s concluding observations to help decide our priorities as we work to improve the lives of children in Ireland going forward. Ireland&rsquo;s third and fourth consolidated Report is due to be submitted by 27th April, 2009. My Office continues to highlight those areas to which the UN Committee has drawn attention and has asked Departments to note and examine the concluding observations in the context of business and strategic planning processes.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to improving the lives of all children in Ireland under the National Children&rsquo;s Strategy and in order to bring greater coherence to policy making for children, the Government has established the Office of the Minister for Children (OMC).  The OMC is an integral part of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The OMC focuses on harmonising policy issues that affect children in areas such as early childhood care and education, youth justice, child welfare and protection, children and young people&rsquo;s participation, research on children and young people and cross cutting initiatives for children.  Children now have a stronger voice on issues that affect them, through my attendance at Cabinet meetings.</P>
        <P>In relation to juvenile crime there has been no increase in the rate of offending by young people in recent years.  All young people suspected of committing an offence are referred to the Garda Diversion Programme.  The number of young people referred to the Programme in recent years has remained stable at approximately 17,500 young people each year since 2002.  The 2005 figure of 17,567 actually represents a decrease of 0.5% over 2004.  The percentage of children considered unsuitable for the Programme and sent forward to be considered for prosecution has also been falling since 2002.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to tackling the problems in the youth justice area.  Following a review of the system completed in December 2005, a series of reforms has been initiated including the establishment of the Irish Youth Justice Service, the development of new community alternatives to detention and the investment of considerable resources to support the process. <Col N="579"/> Under the National Development Plan, &euro;224 million has been committed to youth justice programmes over the lifetime of the plan.</P>
        <P>In relation to child welfare and protection services family support programmes are provided by services such as the Community Mothers, Family Support Workers, Teen Parents Support Projects, and Springboard Projects and encompass specific interventions such as Parents Plus programme, the Family First Parenting Initiative as well as a range of general parenting programmes and supports.</P>
        <P>The Family Support Agency provides, under the Scheme of Grants for Marriage, Child and Bereavement Counselling Services, funding for Child counselling in relation to Parental Separation and funding for relationship counselling.</P>
        <P>The Family Support Agency also provides a Direct Mediation Service.  Parents may elect to go to mediation, which can help in these circumstances. The Family Mediation Service is a free professional service. Mediation helps couples who have decided to separate, or who have already separated to negotiate their own terms of agreement, taking into account the needs and interests of all involved.  Mediation assists parents in working out a parenting plan for their children. A parenting plan is a carefully devised schedule which lays out how to share time with the children, how to manage responsibilities, and how to make decisions about the children. When a couple has reached agreement, a session is offered to parents with their children to discuss their new family arrangements in an encouraging and positive way.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 618, 623, 648, 676 and 785 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s recommended immunisation programme is based on the guidelines of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (NIAC).  Vaccines are continually evolving and guidelines change given the nature of these developments.</P>
        <P>The Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland currently recommend vaccination against pneumococcal disease only for persons who are at increased risk of the disease and its complications, particularly for those with: asplenia or severe dysfunction of the spleen, including surgical splenectomy; chronic renal disease or nephrotic syndrome; chronic heart, lung or liver disease illness including cirrhosis; diabetes mellitus; sickle cell disease; immunodeficiency or immunosuppression due to disease or treatment, including HIV infection at all stages; patients with CSF leaks, either congenital or complicating skull fracture or neurosurgery; and persons aged 65 years or older.</P>
        <P>The inclusion of the pneumococcal vaccine in the Primary Childhood Immunisation Programme is being considered by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee as part of its review of the immunisation guidelines.  No decision has yet been reached.  My Department and the Health Service Executive will be guided by the expert advice from the NIAC in this regard.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>
        <P>The NCIP came into effect from 1 January 2006, with an allocation of &euro;575 million for the 5 year period of 2006 to 2010.  The NCIP is a key element of the National Childcare Strategy 2006-2010, the aim of which is to deliver a more comprehensive approach to early years care and education.  The NCIP is designed to deliver 50,000 additional childcare places, with a greater focus on pre-school places for 3 to 4 year olds and school age childcare.  Childcare places are provided either through community based/not for profit childcare groups or by private providers.  Capital grant applications under the NCIP are assessed under a number of criteria; chiefly the nature and extent of the need locally for the service proposed, the applicant&rsquo;s capacity to deliver the project proposed and value for money.  All proposals are expected to demonstrate how they will increase the supply of quality childcare, and furthermore, community projects are expected to have a focus on disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Under the EOCP support is provided towards the staffing costs of employing childcare workers in community based childcare centres in disadvantaged areas, ensuring that less advantaged parents in those areas have access to quality childcare in order to facilitate access to education, training and employment opportunities.  Staffing grants under the EOCP have been extended to the 31 December 2007 for all groups who are meeting the terms of their existing staffing grant contracts.  A new programme of staffing grants under the NCIP is expected to be announced in 2007 and will be informed by the outcome of a Value for Money Review of the EOCP which is currently in progress.  The Review is expected to be completed in the first half of 2007 following which the procedures and criteria governing the new grant scheme will be made available both generally and to existing staffing grant recipients.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am committed to ensuring that the BreastCheck service is rolled out to the remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible.  I have allocated additional revenue funding of &euro;8 million for this year to meet the additional costs involved.  I have also made available an additional &euro;26.7m capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and five additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment. The first round of screening will commence in the South and West in the spring which will take around 27 months to complete. The BreastCheck Programme is designed to offer repeat screening within an interval of 21-27 months.</P>
        <P>The expert advice from BreastCheck and from the National Cancer Forum, as contained in its a Strategy for Cancer Control, is that following the national extension of the current programme, the upper age limit should be extended to women aged 69 years. Accordingly, when the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered at national level, I will consider extending the upper age limit as recommended. Any woman irrespective of her age or residence who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As hospital doctors do not have General Medical Services contracts, prescriptions written by them for medical card holders are not reimbursable under the GMS scheme.  Such prescriptions must be transcribed by the patient&rsquo;s GMS-contracted general practitioner to a GMS form.  The prescription can then be dispensed by a pharmacy that holds a community pharmacy contract.  Under emergency dispensing arrangements, GMS patients can obtain a short term supply of a hospital prescription from a community pharmacy, where it would not be possible or practical to contact their GP within a reasonable period.</P><Col N="587"/>
        <P>This administrative arrangement provides for greater auditability and security within the GMS scheme.  It also proves worthwhile because GMS patients have greater contact with their general practitioner after leaving hospital, establishing a valuable link between primary and secondary care services that might otherwise be less frequent.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 631, 735 and 840 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has received correspondence on aspects of the charges from a number of organisations and individuals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005, in keeping with Section 53 of <Col N="589"/>the Health Act, 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges may be levied.</P>
        <P>Class 1 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;120 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;35, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>Class 2 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;90, or the weekly income of that person less &euro;55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person. The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo;. Under Section 1 (b) of the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005, the HSE can examine a person&rsquo;s overall financial situation in view of the person&rsquo;s reasonable expenditure in relation to themselves or their dependants, if any.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the HSE, based on its own legal advice and taking into account the individual circumstances as well as the service being provided, to make a decision on any charges levied.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The assessment of eligibility to medical cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants. Under Section 45 of the Health Act 1970 medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. Section 58 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, provides for GP visit cards for adult persons with limited eligibility for whom, in the opinion of the HSE, and notwithstanding that they do not qualify for a medical card, it would be unduly burdensome to arrange GP medical  and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. Persons aged 70 and over are statutorily entitled to a medical card, regardless of their means. In all other cases an assessment of means is undertaken.</P><Col N="590"/>
        <P>In assessing eligibility, the HSE use guidelines based on people&rsquo;s means, which includes their income, certain allowable outgoings and the effect of  factors such as medical need. These guidelines are not statutorily binding and  a decision to refuse an application or renewal of a medical card may be appealed to the Executive for further consideration.</P>
        <P>The General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme provides for a choice of doctor for medical card holders. Where a person fails to secure their GP of choice, s/he may be assigned to a GMS contracted GP by the HSE.				</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular issue raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Regulation (EC) 1408/71 provides for the coordination of social security systems, including healthcare, among EU member states. Under its provisions persons who are residing in one member state but who are pensioners of or employed in another member state, are entitled to receive, <i>inter alia</i>, healthcare in the member state of residence provided on behalf of the member state of employment or the member state paying the pension (the &ldquo;competent state&rdquo;). In Ireland, those residing here who are covered by EU Regulations receive an EU medical card.</P>
        <P>Under these provisions, a UK pensioner residing in Ireland or a UK-employed person who resides in Ireland receives an EU medical card. Dependants are also covered by these provisions. These provisions apply between Ireland and the UK as between Ireland and all other EU member states.  The Regulation provides for costs to be reimbursed by the member state on whose behalf the healthcare is provided. Because of the traditional close links between Ireland and the UK, and the considerable movement between the two countries, a bilateral reimbursement agreement is in place to deal with reimbursement for healthcare provided under EU Regulations on a lump-sum basis.</P>

	<P>Where an Irish national returns to Ireland and is not covered by any of the arrangements made under EU regulations, he/she should be regarded as ordinarily resident here if he/she: is employed or self-employed here; or satisfies the HSE that it is his/her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.</P>
        <P>Where an Irish national is working abroad on a short-term contract but satisfies the HSE that it is not his/her intention to take up residence outside of Ireland on an indefinite basis, the status of <Col N="592"/>ordinarily resident and eligibility for Irish health services may be retained. The HSE may take account of the nature and duration of the contract as well as evidence such as proof of property purchase, lease or rental, or evidence of transfer of funds, bank accounts or pensions in arriving at its decision.</P>
        <P>Where an Irish national has been resident abroad for a period of up to three years but the HSE is satisfied that the person did not establish an entitlement to health services in any other country, the HSE should (if the circumstances as outlined above do not apply) regard the person as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in Ireland if he or she requires treatment on returning to Ireland. This is intended to ensure, in particular, that persons who emigrate do not lose their health services eligibility on residence grounds before they have been able to establish eligibility elsewhere. It would not apply where a person is covered by EU Regulations and, in particular, it would not entitle a person temporarily resident in another EU country to have the HSE extend the European Health Insurance Card beyond the normal period.</P>
        <P>An individual living in Ireland for at least one year is considered by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to be &lsquo;ordinarily resident&rsquo; and is entitled to either full eligibility (Category 1, i.e. medical card holders) or limited eligibility (Category 2) for health services.  Dependants of an &lsquo;ordinarily resident&rsquo; person who themselves have not been in Ireland for a period of one year must declare themselves to be the dependants of that person to the HSE, and seek to satisfy the HSE that they intend to remain in Ireland for a period of at least one year.</P>
        <P>Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship, with the exception of persons over the age of seventy years, who are automatically entitled to a medical card. Persons in Category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.  Determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Persons not entitled to a medical card, but with an income below a certain threshold (50% above the medical card income guidelines) may be entitled to a GP visit card.   A GP visit card entitles the holder to free GP services. For those who do not qualify for a medical card, a number of schemes exist which provide assistance towards <Col N="593"/>the cost of medication.  Under the Drug Payment Scheme a person and his/her dependants do not have to pay more than &euro;85 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.</P>
        <P>Persons in Category 2 (non medical card holders) are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and out-patient public hospital services including consultant services. The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;60 per night, up to a maximum of &euro;600 in any twelve consecutive months. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of &euro;60 where the patient does not have a referral note from his/her doctor.  A maternity and infant care service is provided during pregnancy and up to six weeks after birth.</P>
        <P>Further information on eligibility for health services can be obtained from the HSE National Information Line on 1850 24 1850, which operates from Monday to Saturday between the hours of 8.00 a.m. and 8.00 p.m., or on <i>www.hse.ie</i>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret BUPA&rsquo;s decision to leave the Irish market and have endeavoured to achieve a solution that would enable BUPA to remain, but would also protect the fundamental principles of the regulatory framework, and in particular, community rating.</P>
        <P>Following the High Court decision last November, a meeting was arranged between BUPA senior management and myself in an attempt to facilitate the company remaining in the Irish market. Since that initial meeting further discussions have taken place with BUPA. Unfor<Col N="594"/>tunately, it did not prove possible to reach an agreement which BUPA would accept would allow them to stay in the market. However, BUPA has advised that its members will be covered for the duration of their existing contracts and I acknowledge BUPA&rsquo;s commitment to their members in this regard.</P>
        <P>Subscribers who are unable to renew their cover with BUPA are entitled, under open enrolment regulations, to move to another insurer without penalty for a similar level of cover to that held with BUPA. They will not be subject to any additional waiting periods before cover takes effect and will not have to re-serve any waiting periods already served, whether in respect of initial cover or in respect of pre-existing conditions as long as the break in cover does not exceed 13 weeks.</P>
        <P>It is important that we have a healthy and competitive market for health insurance.  The objective of the legislative and regulatory framework which the Government has put in place is to ensure that competition in the market works to the benefit of all health insurance subscribers. The Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case. To that end, I have appointed a three person group to carry out a business appraisal of the health insurance market in Ireland. The group is to provide their view as to whether an adequate rate of return is available in the Irish health insurance market to insurance undertakings in the current conditions, whilst maintaining community rating. I have asked the Group to report back to me by the end of March.</P>
        <P>In the meantime I have just received the views of the Competition Authority and the Health Insurance Authority on the issue of sustaining fair competition in the market. The proposals contained in the Reports will be given careful consideration by Government with a view to advancing competition in the market and addressing any barriers identified.</P>

The group will monitor and assess progress on the implementation of all the recommendations including those which fall under the responsibility of the HSE, government departments and other relevant agencies.  The Group is to submit its first annual report in mid 2007.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the individual recommendations of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; is a matter primarily for the HSE.  The HSE established an implementation group in July 2006 to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; a reality.</P>
        <P>The Chairs of the implementation group and the monitoring group are meeting in the near future and following that meeting the HSE will publish a Progress Report and outline the proposed implementation programme over the 10 year life of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Both of these groups will play an important role in ensuring that the recommendations are implemented in a co-ordinated and timely manner.</P>
        <P>In 2006, a sum of  &euro;26.2 million was provided for the development of our mental health services in line with &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;.  A further sum of &euro;25 million has been allocated for 2007 to continue this development.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am aware of concerns that have been raised in recent years concerning the safety of  the class of medicines known as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) which are used to treat depression.</P>
        <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the statutory body responsible for the regulation of medicinal products in Ireland.  The Board, in consultation with its European counterparts, has continuously monitored the safety of this class of medicines since they were first licensed for the Irish market. The Board has taken regulatory action on these products when deemed necessary.</P>
        <P>In 2004 the Board took part in a Europe wide review of medicinal products containing paroxetine, which is one of the group of SSRIs which is used to treat mild to moderate depression. This review was undertaken on the basis of safety concerns relating to these products. The Board actively participated in this review, which involved a complete benefit/risk re-assessment, and concluded that the benefit/risk profile of products containing paroxetine remains positive.</P>
        <P>The documentation used for these products includes special warnings and precautions for use, particularly in relation to the need for close monitoring of patients using these products who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 659, 763 and 816 together.</P>
        <P>A consultancy study jointly commissioned by my Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Belfast (DHSSPS) on the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of a dedicated Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) for the island of Ireland was published in 2004 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The study concluded that the introduction of a dedicated inter-hospital air ambulance service would be appropriate in an all-island context.</P>
        <P>In considering the report, the DHSSPS advised that its priority at present is the need for further investment to improve the ground ambulance service.  On foot of the report my Department had detailed discussions with the Department of Defence regarding the future provision of air ambulance services by the Air Corps.  Arising from these discussions, a detailed Service Level Agreement has been prepared and signed.  The signatories to the agreement are the Department of Defence, the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive, the Defence Forces and the Air Corps.</P>
        <P>The agreement sets out the range services to be provided by the Air Corps, specifically:</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Inter-hospital Transfer for spinal and serious injury and illness</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Air Transport of Neonates requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">A Steering Group comprising representation from each of the signatories to the Service Level Agreement has been established.  The Group is monitoring the operation of the agreement and will amend, if necessary, the provisions of the agreement to take account of service developments, including the new fleet replacement programme currently being put in place by the Air Corps.  The Air Corps introduced two new EC 135 helicopters into service in 2006 and intends to introduce four AB 139 helicopters into service in 2007.  Each of the new helicopters has a specific air ambulance capability.  The new fleet will also have a far greater flying capacity than was previously available.</P>

	<P>The Primary Care Strategy aims to develop services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.</P>
        <P>It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams <Col N="606"/>can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.</P>
        <P>The HSE received an additional &euro;10m in funding in 2006 to enable the establishment of up to 100 Primary Care Teams in development; a further &euro;22m is being provided in 2007 to meet the full year costs of the 2006 developments and to enable a further 100 Primary Care Teams in development to be established.  The Government has committed under the Towards 2016 agreement to the establishment of 300 Primary Care Teams by 2008; 400 by 2009; and 500 by 2011.  A review of these targets will be undertaken in 2008.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 665, 740 and 845 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware that an issue has arisen around the availability of employment opportunities for recently qualified physiotherapists and I have asked the Health Service Executive to give the matter its urgent attention.</P>
        <P>Let me say at the outset that it is a matter for the Health Service Executive, as part of the management of its employment ceiling, to determine the appropriate staffing mix required to deliver its service plan priorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to note that there is not an oversupply of physiotherapists in Ireland. The Bacon Report (Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists) March 2001 recommended an increase in physiotherapy training places, following which additional training places were provided.  There continues to be a growing demand for physiotherapy services and this is likely to continue as was highlighted in the Healthcare Skills Monitoring Report (FAS, August 2005) and as evidenced by the number of development posts planned for the physiotherapy profession in the coming years.</P>
        <P>At present, it is acknowledged that there is a higher demand for senior physiotherapists but, less opportunities for newly qualified graduates.  I am advised that the Health Service Executive has a number of panels in place from which basic grade physiotherapist vacancies will be filled.  A further national competition to employ basic grade physiotherapists was advertised this month and a number of recently graduated physotherapists were contacted by the Health Service Executive to advise them of this opportunity to broaden their employment options.</P>
        <P>The provision of additional physiotherapy services through developments in a number of service areas has been prioritised in recent years.  A number of physiotherapists will be employed as a result of the additional funding allocated in both 2006 and 2007 to extend the home care package scheme.  An additional &euro;55m (full year cost) was allocated to the scheme in 2006 with a similar amount in 2007 providing 2,000 extra packages in both years, benefiting some 4,000 people.</P><Col N="608"/>
        <P>Home care packages deliver a wide range of services, including the services of physiotherapists and are aimed at older people who need more assistance to continue to live in their community.  As part of the development of primary care there has been a very significant increase in resources and capacity for delivery of physiotherapy services in primary care settings, with 77.5 new physiotherapy posts being created with the funding made available in 2006.  The Primary Care Strategy aims to develop services in the community to give people direct access to locally-based integrated multi-disciplinary teams which include physiotherapists.  It is anticipated that physiotherapy capacity will be further expanded in 2007 as a result of the planned establishment of a further 100 Primary Care Teams.</P>
        <P>Funding was provided in 2006 to support the provision of clinical training in physiotherapy and will result in the recruitment of 18 Physiotherapy Practice Tutors.  In the 2007 Budget a sum of &euro;75m for revenue purposes was provided to the Health Service Executive for the Disability Services and represents the 2007 element of the Government&rsquo;s multi-annual investment programme for the National Disability Strategy.  The Strategy is committed to enhancing the level and range of multi-disciplinary support services, including physiotherapy, and will require the recruitment of a significant number of physiotherapists.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Health Service Executive are continuing to take steps, in consultation with relevant stakeholders which include the physiotherapy professional body and the physiotherapy managers, to find a satisfactory and sustainable approach to the allocation of posts between senior and other grades that will lead to greater employment opportunities for newly qualified graduates in both the short and longer term.  Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.</P>
        <P>My Department does not set employment quotas at national level for any grade in the public health service. Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appro<Col N="609"/>priate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services.

        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.

In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>

	<P>Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the number of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future. </P>
        <P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of the Actual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 686, 687, 693, 749, 750, 764, 774, 776, 820, 830, 831, 841, 906, 915, 916, 926 and 927 together.</P>
        <P>In 2005, a process was begun to examine all aspects of the drugs supply chain, with a view to achieving greater value for money in the pricing and supply of drugs and medicines to the health services and the GMS and community drugs schemes, consistent with patient safety and continuity of supply. This process was agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health.  A joint HSE/Department of Health and Children negotiating team was put in place to advance this process.</P>
        <P>In mid-2006, the negotiating team reached agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI). Discussions then began with the wholesaler representative body, the Pharmaceutical Distributors&rsquo; Federation (PDF), as part of the agreed process.</P>
        <P>Early in discussions, PDF advised the State that a legal issue precluded it from negotiating a new <Col N="621"/>margin for distribution to community pharmacies.  The negotiating team then obtained legal advice, which subsequent legal advice to the Department confirmed.  This issue also had implications for negotiations with community pharmacists.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The position is as follows:</P>
      <P el="3"><Miles com="bull66" /> Section 4(1) of the Competition Act, 2002 prohibits all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the restriction or distortion of competition, including agreements to fix prices, unless the agreement, decision or concerted practice meets certain conditions. Those conditions are not met in this case.</P>
        <P el="3"><Miles com="bull66" />Wholesalers and pharmacy contractors are undertakings.  PDF and the IPU are associations of undertakings under Section 4(1) of the Act.</P>
        <P el="3"><Miles com="bull66" />The coming together of wholesalers under PDF or pharmacy contractors under the IPU to negotiate prices would be a breach of Section 4(1).</P>
       <P el="3"><Miles com="bull66" />Entering into an agreement, making a decision or being involved in a concerted practice in contravention of Section 4(1) is a criminal offence and would expose those parties, their directors, managers and officers to the risk of criminal prosecution.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="3">In light of this advice, it is not possible for the HSE to engage in negotiations with PDF or the IPU in relation to fees or margins.</P>
        <P>In the interim, in order to determine new arrangements for wholesale services and remain in compliance with competition legislation, the negotiating team has begun a public consultation process, which includes an invitation to make submissions, coupled with an independent economic analysis of the Irish and EU markets.  This process is based on an assumption of continuation of current service levels.</P>
        <P>The negotiating team will consider, following completion of the wholesale sector review, how best to  address this issue for pharmacy contractor services.  It is noted that the competition issues do not preclude negotiation on contractual arrangements by the IPU other than in relation to fees.</P>
        <P>The HSE has written to all community pharmacy contractors setting out the position in relation to these issues in detail.</P>
        <P>Information regarding fees and mark ups paid to community pharmacists in the year ending December 2005, the latest date for which this information is available, is contained in the Statistical Analysis of Claims and Payments 2005, which is compiled by the HSE National Shared Services Primary Care Reimbursement Service.  This report is available on the HSE website under publications.</P><Col N="622"/>
        <P>There is, and will continue to be, ongoing dialogue with the IPU, within the constraints of the legal advice provided. I wish to see that dialogue continuing in a constructive manner.</P>

        <P>The Irish Expert Body on Flourides and Health (known as the Expert Body) was set up in 2004. The terms of reference for the Expert Body are:</P>
        <P el="3"><Miles com="bull66" />to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the Forum on Fluoridation;</P>
        <P el="3"><Miles com="bull66" />to advise the Minister and evaluate ongoing research &mdash; including new emerging issues &mdash; on all aspects of fluoride and its delivery methods as an established health technology as required;</P>
        <P el="3"><Miles com="bull66" />to report to the Minister on matters of concern at his/her request or its own initiative.</P><Col N="623"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I have been advised that the Expert Body is aware of the interim guidance statement from the American Dental Association in relation to the use of tap water to reconstitute powdered infant formula.</P>
        <P>In the United States, drinking water may contain fluoride at levels up to 4mg/litre, and thus there is a possibility of infants receiving a larger than optimal amount of fluoride through infant formula that has been mixed with water containing high levels of fluoride.</P>
        <P>It has been established that the appropriate amount of fluoride in tap water is effective in controlling tooth decay. However, fluoride intake above optimal amounts can create a risk of enamel fluorosis in teeth. Enamel fluorosis has no known adverse health consequences.</P>
        <P>Because water in the USA may contain fluoride in varying amounts, up to 4mg per litre, parents in the USA have been advised by the American Dental Association (ADA) to only use water that is fluoride-free or contains low levels of fluoride to reconstitute powdered or liquid concentrate infant formula. Parents and caregivers  have been advised to consult by the ADA with their pediatrician, family physician or dentist on the most appropriate water to use in their area to reconstitute infant formula.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, 1.0 mg per litre is the current limit for artificially fluoridated tap water. Therefore, the Expert Body continues to advise that infant formula should be reconstituted with boiled tap water in accordance with manufacturers&rsquo; instructions, and they consider that fluoride in Irish tap water in the concentrations used poses no known medical problems for infants or the population in general.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the new Nursing Home Support Scheme &ldquo;A Fair Deal&rdquo; which comes into effect from January 1st 2008. The new scheme will ensure that care is affordable for all and that there is the same level of support for public and private nursing home residents. It means that older people will not have to sell or re-mortgage their home during their lifetime in order to meet the costs, and that they can plan ahead, secure in the knowledge that an equitable, affordable system is there for them should they need it.</P><Col N="624"/>
        <P>In the interim, the Minister announced an initiative to make the existing subvention scheme fairer. The standard subvention has been increased to a maximum of &euro;300 a week.  In addition, the HSE may pay an enhanced subvention to people who cannot afford to meet the cost of care. An extra &euro;30 million has been provided in 2007 for this purpose.</P>

	<P>Regulation (EC) 1408/71 provides for the coordination of social security systems, including healthcare, among EU member states. Under its provisions, inter alia, those who are covered by the healthcare system of one member state and who become ill or injured while staying temporarily in another member state, are entitled to receive treatment in the public healthcare system of the member state of stay. The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) provides evidence of such entitlement. The aim is to ensure that a person who becomes ill or injured can continue his or her stay as planned under safe medical conditions. The EHIC does not provide evidence of entitlement to planned treatment in another member state. </P>
        <P>EHIC holders are treated on the same basis as any covered person living in the member state of stay and the treatments available and charges, if any, will depend on the public healthcare system in question. As some costs may be incurred, as the Card does not cover the cost of repatriation, and as illness abroad may result in other unforeseen costs that are not medical costs, all those planning a visit to another member state may wish to consider taking out insurance.</P>
        <P>The same rules apply for Irish visitors to Bulgaria and Romania as for all EU member states. It is intended that information about the public healthcare systems of Bulgaria and Romania will be made available on the ehic.ie website very shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future. </P>
        <P>A particular priority for my Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates, including physiotherapists.  In response to concerns regarding labour shortages, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions to 2015 in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists (Bacon Report).  The report was published in 2001 and arising from its recommendations an additional physiotherapy course providing 25 places was established in the University of Limerick in 2002.  This investment built on increases, in 2000, of approximately 50 training places.  The total number of physiotherapy training places now stands at 152, the level at which the Bacon Report recommended as being sufficient to meet current and future demand to 2015 for physiotherapists.  The current priority in terms of graduate supply is to match the skills of these highly trained graduates with the demand for physiotherapy practitioners within the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <P>An effective national cervical screening programme will result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer. It is my objective to have such a programme rolled out, beginning late this year, based on an affordable model. For that purpose, on the 1st January 2007 I established a National Cancer Screening Service which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme. This will maximise the expertise in both programmes, ensure improved efficiency and develop a single governance model for cancer screening. I have allocated additional funding of &euro;5m for 2007 to the Service to commence roll out of the Cervical Screening Programme. The total allocation to the new Service is &euro;33m, this is a 71% increase in the 2006 allocation to these Programmes. Significant preparatory work is well underway involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation for a national population register. The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services must be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service.</P>

	<P>The decision to transfer St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital was taken by the Government in the context of its consideration of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology Services.  The decision is based on expert advice and is designed to ensure that radiation oncology, one element of cancer care, is integrated with all other aspects of care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  I am convinced that this model will provide better patient centred treatment with improved quality of service and outcome for patients.  The Board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government&rsquo;s decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology.

        <P>A key issue highlighted in the report was that blood from persons with haemochromatosis was being not being used by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service(IBTS). The IBTS has re-examined its policy on this issue and has decided to establish a pilot venesection programme for haemochromatosis patients in one of its clinics. Subject to the usual screening protocols, blood from haemochromatosis patients will be used by the IBTS. It is anticipated that the programme will commence in the coming months.</P>
        <P>Arising from the publication of the report, the Irish Insurance Federation has agreed to investigate any complaint about life or health insurance cover linked to diagnosis with haemochromatosis.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 704 and 777 together.</P>
        <P>The decision to transfer St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital was taken by the Government in the context of its consideration of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology Services.  The decision is based on expert advice and is designed to ensure that radiation oncology, one element of cancer care, is integrated with all other aspects of care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  I am convinced that this model will provide better patient centred treatment with improved quality of service and outcome for patients.  The Board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government&rsquo;s decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology.  A transfer on similar lines took place last year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred to Belfast City Hospital, a major academic teaching hospital.</P>
        <P>In progressing the transfer, I will build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke&rsquo;s.  I have ensured that experts at St. Luke&rsquo;s are centrally involved in the planning and delivery of the National Plan.  The plan consists of large centres in Dublin (at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals), Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.  The Chief Executive at St. Luke&rsquo;s will lead the management team of the new facility at St. James&rsquo;s.  I also appointed the Chairman of St. Luke&rsquo;s to chair a National Radiation Oncology Oversight Group to advise me on progress on the implementation of the plan.</P>
        <P>Discussions on transfer, facilitated by the HSE, are taking place involving the Chief Executives of both hospitals. A working group is in place to develop close working relationships and ensure a smooth transition. In addition and in recognition of the role for St. Luke&rsquo;s in the new facility at St. James&rsquo;s, I will pursue discussions with the Boards of both Hospitals about its governance and a re-configuration of the Boards. The twin goals are to ensure continuity of expertise and ethos in the care of cancer patients and the effective integration of multi-disciplinary patient care at the one site.</P>
        <P>The tender has recently been awarded for two additional and two replacement linear accelerators at St. Luke&rsquo;s to provide much needed <Col N="633"/>interim capacity pending the roll out of the national plan.  I expect these services to commence late this year.</P>
        <P>As regards the future use of the site and facilities at St Luke&rsquo;s, my objective is to ensure that these resources are utilised in the best interests of the health services. I will discuss this issue in due course with the Health Service Executive and the Hospital Board following progress on the governance issues to which I have referred.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Most acute hospitals collect information on health care associated infections (HCAIs) in their institution at a local level.   Currently there is no  national surveillance scheme that collects comparable data on health care associated infections at a national level.  However, the appointment of the SARI infection control nurses, surveillance scientists and antibiotic pharmacists who are due to be recruited in early 2007 will provide extra staffing required to commence a national surveillance programme.  Once these staff are in place, national surveillance of HCAIs  will commence, in line with SARI recommendations and international best practice.</P>
        <P>However, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects data on MRSA bacteraemia as part of the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS).  EARSS collects data on the first episode of blood stream infection per patient per quarter.  The Irish data for EARSS, which is published on a quarterly basis by the HPSC, showed that there were 445 cases in 2002, 480 cases in 2003, 553 cases in 2004, 586 cases in 2005 and 435 reported cases in the first three quarters of 2006.</P>
        <P>Clostridium difficile is not a notifiable disease and as a result it is difficult to quantify the extent of infection in the health care system.  In 2006 the Hospital Infection Society (HIS) UK carried out its Third Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections in acute hospitals.  The survey covered Ireland, England, Scotland and <Col N="635"/>Wales between March and May 2006, and the preliminary results have been published.  The overall prevalence of health care associated infection in the UK and Ireland study (these figures exclude Scotland) is 7.9%.  The England figure is 8.2%, Wales 6.3%, Northern Ireland 5.5% and the Republic of Ireland 4.9%.  The prevalence of health care associated infection was highest in regional/tertiary hospitals at 6% and lowest in specialist hospitals at 2%.   Clostridium difficile infection was examined in this survey and it was found that thirty-six patient had clostridium difficile representing 0.85% of patients studied.  Clostridium difficile infection increases with age and is eight times more common in patients over 65 years compared to those under the age of 65 years.  The emergence of more virulent strains of Clostridium difficile which is partly due to over use of antibiotics underlines the importance of strict antibiotic stewardship in our health care system.</P>
        <P>Infection due to norovirus (also known as NLV, Small Rounded Structured Virus (SRSV) or &ldquo;Winter Vomiting Disease&rdquo;) is extremely common within the community and the outbreaks in health care settings are simply a reflection of what is happening in the community.  Outbreaks due to the norovirus are not eradicable but they are controllable and having an agreed hospital/residential home outbreak plan in place is the best method for ensuring uniformity and effectiveness of response.  Norovirus infection was also examined in the Third Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infection (HCAIs) in acute hospitals in 2006.  The survey found that seven patients had norovirus infection representing 0.4% of patients studied.</P>
        <P>The results for the HIS prevalence survey are currently being validated in the UK and once this is completed a final report on the Irish results will be published.</P>

        <P>In 2006 arrangements for the transfer of midwifery and children&rsquo;s nursing to the third level sector were agreed.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 714 and 720 together.</P>
        <P>An effective national cervical screening programme will result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer. It is my objective to <Col N="638"/>have such a programme rolled out, beginning late this year, based on an affordable model. For that purpose, on the 1st January 2007, I established a National Cancer Screening Service which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme. This will maximise the expertise in both programmes, ensure improved efficiency and develop a single governance model for cancer screening.  I have allocated additional funding of &euro;5m for 2007 to the Service to commence roll out of the Cervical Screening Programme. The total allocation to the new Service is &euro;33m, this is a 71% increase in the 2006 allocation to the Programmes. Significant preparatory work is well underway involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register. The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service.</P>
        <P>I am aware of reports of delays in obtaining results of cervical smears.  These delays have not arisen under the Irish Cervical Screening Programme but relate to smears referred by General Practitioners to hospital laboratories, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department  has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter in question examined and to respond directly to the Deputies.</P>

The appointment of the SARI infection control nurses, surveillance scientists and antibiotic pharmacists who are due to be recruited in 2007 will provide the extra staffing required to commence a national surveillance programme.  Once these staff are in place, national surveillance of health care associated infections (HCAIs) will commence, in line with SARI recommendations and international best practice.</P>
        <P>The HSE has appointed Dr. Kevin Kelleher, Assistant National Director of Health Protection, as the lead person nationally, for MRSA in the HSE.  He is supported by senior representatives of the NHO, PCCC and Risk Management as well as senior clinicians.</P>
        <P>Measures to control the emergence and spread of HCAIs are necessary because there are fewer options available for the treatment of resistant infections and because these strains spread amongst vulnerable at-risk patients.  The prudent use of antibiotics underpins any approach to the control of antibiotic resistant bacteria, including MRSA.  This, together with good professional practice and routine infection control precautions, such as hand hygiene, constitute the major measure in controlling and preventing healthcare-associated infection, including that caused by MRSA, both in hospital and in community health care units.  While many HCAIs are not preventable, we can make every effort to reduce the rates of infection and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>
        <P>Hospital cleanliness, while not always an immediate hazard to patients, is part of an overall picture whereby multi-resistant infections are acquired in our hospitals.  To date, two National Hygiene Audits have been carried out in acute hospitals under the auspices of the National Hospitals Office.  The Irish Health Services <Col N="645"/>Accreditation Board (IHSAB) is due to carry out a third Hygiene audit this year.</P>
        <P>Last year, Ireland participated in the Hospital Infections Society&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections&rdquo; in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  The survey, which included 45 Irish acute adult hospitals, including 8 private hospitals, provides accurate and comparable data on the prevalence of Health Care Associated Infections (including MRSA) and can also be compared with similar data being obtained in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Preliminary results of this study are now available.  The overall prevalence of health care associated infection in the UK and Ireland study (these figures exclude Scotland) is 7.9%.  The England figure is 8.2%, Wales 6.3%, Northern Ireland 5.5% and the Republic of Ireland 4.9%.  The prevalence of health care associated infection was highest in regional/tertiary hospitals at 6% and lowest in specialist hospitals at 2%.  There is no room for complacency and the HSE must continue to work with hospitals to control HCAIs.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.

In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>

	<P>The Crisis Pregnancy Agency was established in October 2001 under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, with a statutory remit to prepare a strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy, the strategy to provide, inter alia for:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a reduction in the number of crisis pregnancies by the provision of education, advice and contraceptive services;</P>
  <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a reduction in the number of woman with crisis pregnancies who opt for abortion by offering services and supports which make other options more attractive; and</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the provision of counselling and medical services after crisis pregnancy.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Strategy was published in 2003 and a follow-on Strategy will be prepared in 2007.</P>
        <P>Since the Agency&rsquo;s establishment significant resources have been committed towards improving services and supports to women experiencing crisis pregnancy.  Approximately 80% of the Agency&rsquo;s funding programme has been devoted to this.</P>
        <P>The Agency has funded the expansion of crisis pregnancy counselling services by approximately 50% so that there are now thirteen counselling service providers operating in just over 50 towns/cities nationwide. It has put particular emphasis on spreading services across the country and in some cases to more remote locations. Much of this has been achieved by forming effective partnerships with the Health Service Executive. The Agency has also ensured that all crisis pregnancy counselling is provided free to women regardless of their income, age or where they live.</P>
        <P>The Agency has also funded the expansion of post abortion counselling and medical supports nationally. Such counselling is provided free of charge by all thirteen service providers in just over 50 towns and cities nationwide. The Agency also funds seven services to provide free post abortion medical check-ups and contraceptive advice.  It is the Agency&rsquo;s intention to focus more on post abortion counselling and services in 2007.</P>
        <P>In relation to STI services, over &euro;7m additional funding has been made available to the former health boards and the Health Service Executive since 1997 to address the treatment of STIs and HIV/AIDS. This year alone has seen &euro;1m of this <Col N="649"/>additional funding allocated to HIV and STI service developments.</P>
        <P>The additional funding has resulted in a substantial increase in the facilities in place. At present there are seven consultants specialising in the treatment of HIV/AIDS and STIs in Ireland.   Five of these are in Dublin (one of which deals with children), one in Cork and one in Galway.  The Care and Management sub-committee of the National AIDS Strategy Committee (NASC) has reviewed the development of HIV/AIDS and STI treatment services throughout the country and published a report with a number of recommendations in relation to these services.</P>
        <P>On foot of a recommendation of the NASC, my Department and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency commissioned the Irish Study of Sexual Health and Relationships (ISSHR) in 2003. The information in this study, and the three sub-reports still to be published, will inform our approach to sexual health policy in the future.</P>

	<P>The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care.  All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive will have their charges repaid in full.  The estates of all those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged for publicly funded long term residential care and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full.  The scheme does not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died prior to that date.</P><Col N="650"/>
        <P>Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.</P>
        <P>The repayment scheme was launched publicly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald in August 2006.  The Scheme Administrator has commenced scanning the records of long stay facilities around the country and to date 160 locations have been visited for this purpose.</P>
        <P>In relation to dates of repayments to applicants, the HSE has informed the Department that over 24,000 forms have been submitted to the scheme administrator applying for repayments and these applications are being processed at present.  The timeframe for repayment is predicated primarily on whether the applicant is alive or whether the application is being made by the estate of a deceased person.  Living people who were wrongly charged will be the first to receive payments under the scheme.  It is estimated that there are now in the region of 14,000 people within this category.  Queries in relation to individual applications should be referred to the scheme administrator.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Health Service Executive has put arrangements in place whereby it can make applications on behalf of living persons in long stay institutions where there is no other connected person to make an application and where the applicants are unable to apply themselves due to ill health, or mental or physical disability.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that offers of repayment commenced in November and that the first payments have already issued with further payments continuing on an ongoing basis. It is expected that the bulk of payments to estates will commence in the Spring.   Provision has been made for applications to be received up to 1 January 2008.  It is anticipated that final repayments will be made by mid-2008.</P>
        <P>A dedicated website <i>www.repay.ie</i>, an information phone line 1890 886 886 and an e-mail facility queries@repay.ie have been established by the scheme administrator to assist the public in accessing claim forms and general information on the scheme.  The information line operates between the hours of 8.00 am and 9.00 pm from Monday to Saturday.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>EU member states are the main purchasers of medicines in their domestic markets.  They naturally seek to control drug prices, but the extent of this control varies widely.  Higher priced countries, such as the UK and Germany, rely more on market forces to set prices.  Spain and Portugal, on the other hand, closely regulate and control prices.  Ireland&rsquo;s pricing policy is somewhere in the middle of the European league as, with its relatively small market, it must seek to balance value for money in state drug spending with reliability and continuity of supply for essential products.</P>
        <P>Price comparison in different markets is difficult.  Patent protection in Ireland allows originator companies exclusive rights to the market for ten years for new medicines.  In Spain, until 1992 there was no intellectual property protection for medicines and no patent protection for new products.  This kept prices down, but may change with patent and intellectual property exclusivity.  In addition, some products that are prescription-only in Ireland are available without prescription in some other states.  While the removal of prescription-only status for certain products may produce lower prices in Ireland, these products would no longer be reimbursed by the State.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be pleased to know that my Department and the Health Service Executive concluded negotiations in 2006 with pharmaceutical manufacturers on important new agreements setting out the pricing and supply of medicines for the Irish health service.</P>
        <P>These agreements provide increased value for money for the State and the consumer through a reduction in the price of existing drugs and medicines coming off patent and through the use of a wider basket of countries for pricing new drugs.  Over the period of the agreements, which run to 2010, it is expected to achieve savings of the order of &euro;300 million across the GMS and community drugs schemes, and in the cost of drugs to hospitals, through off-patent price cuts of 35% for drugs with substitutable alternatives.  In addition to the savings quantified, there will be further savings as generic manufacturers respond to the lower price of branded drugs.</P>
        <P>There will also be savings through the use of a wider basket for pricing new medicines, along with two price reviews for new medicines over the term of the agreements.  The new basket includes some traditionally lower priced countries, including Spain and Belgium, which will benefit the consumer over the medium term.  Finally, for the first time, reimbursement of new drugs in Ireland can now be informed by pharmacoeconomic assessment, in line with other EU countries.</P>
        <P>These agreements are the first stage in a process approved by the Cabinet Committee on Health to examine all aspects of the drug delivery system, from the manufacturer to the patient, in order to achieve greater value for money from <Col N="652"/>the State&rsquo;s spending on drugs and medicines and in the operation of the drugs schemes, consistent with patient safety and continuity of supply.</P>
        <P>I must stress that no single measure will contain the rate of increase in expenditure on medicines and drugs.  Indeed, international experience has shown that this is a very difficult task, as the sophistication and range of treatments continue to increase along with increased expectations on the part of patients.</P>

	<P>In late 2005, the Health Service Executive (HSE), at my request, undertook a review of tertiary paediatric services.  McKinsey &amp; Company were engaged by the HSE to advise on the future strategic organization of tertiary paediatric services <Col N="656"/>in line with best practice and in the best interests of children.</P>
        <P>The resulting report &mdash; &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s Health First&rdquo; &mdash; International best practice in tertiary paediatric services: implications for the strategic organization of tertiary paediatric services in Ireland &mdash; included a number of key recommendations:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The population and projected demands in this country can support only one world class tertiary paediatric hospital;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />It should be in Dublin, and should ideally be collocated with a leading adult academic hospital;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />It should also provide all the secondary (i.e. less complex) hospital needs of children in the Greater Dublin area;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />It should be supported by a strategically-located urgent care service.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">A joint HSE / Department of Health and Children Task Group was established to advise on the optimum location of the proposed new hospital.  As a key recommendation of &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s Health First&rdquo; was that the new paediatric facility would ideally be collocated with an adult academic teaching hospital in Dublin, the Task Group invited six major adult hospitals to make submissions.</P>
        <P>Proposals were also received from a number of private hospitals, property developers and site owners.  None of the proposals presented by the private interests satisfied the requirement of collocation with an adult academic teaching hospital.  The site of the Central Mental Hospital at Dundrum was also brought to the attention of the Task Group.  However, as this site similarly does not include an adult academic teaching hospital, it was not considered suitable by the Task Group as a possible site for the new National Paediatric Hospital.</P>

	<P>The HSE has informed my Department that it is aware of the problems referred to by the Deputy.  The HSE tries, at all stages of the process, to reduce or eliminate the problem. The current high level <Col N="657"/>activity in the construction sector poses obvious challenges in getting contractors for small jobs.</P>
        <P>As early as the application stage many HSE staff &mdash; social workers for older persons, community welfare officers, environmental health officers and public health nurses &mdash; are involved in the process, initiating applications and acting as advocates for the client.  In the case of every approved application, the approval letter invites the client, if they have any difficulties in having the work carried out, to contact a named member of staff. At the time of initial assessment staff will often identify that assistance is needed and will, where necessary, help the client to source a contractor after the application is approved.</P>

	<P>The objective of this Government is to ensure the provision of a world-class hospital to serve the children of this country.  It was for this reason, and for no other, that the Government strongly endorsed the recommendation of the Joint Task Group and the decision of the Board of the Health Service Executive to locate the new National Paediatric Hospital on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital.   The decision to proceed with the development at the Mater has recently been reaffirmed by the Government.</P>
        <P>The next stage of the process, which is being overseen by a joint Department of Health and Children/Health Service Executive Transition Group, involves the preparation of a high level framework brief for the new hospital.  The brief is being developed for the Transition Group by Rawlinson Kelly &amp; Whittlestone Ltd (RKW), an established UK-based health care planning com<Col N="665"/>pany.  RKW will be advising on a range of issues which will help to inform the design of the new hospital.  They will be advising, for example, on the preferred model of care, on the core services to be delivered at the new hospital, and on the additional range of services to be provided outside of the main hospital. RKW have also been requested to advise, as a priority, on the range of  services which should be provided outside of the main hospital through the urgent / ambulatory care service, taking account of international best practice in the planning of children&rsquo;s hospital services.</P>
        <P>RKW will be consulting widely in the course of its work, and the input of stakeholders will be of benefit in ensuring the delivery of our shared objective of providing a world-class hospital for the children of this country.</P>

	<P>Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, <Col N="666"/>conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.</P>
        <P>Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients.  Other products are available according to the patient&rsquo;s eligibility.</P>
        <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.</P>
        <P>Non-medical card holders and people whose illness is not covered by the LTI can use the Drug Payment Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month, or approximately  &euro;20 per week, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.</P>

In that regard, it is a matter for the executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of <Col N="668"/>health and personal social services to the public.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 791 and 868 together.</P>
        <P>The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care.  All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive will have their charges repaid in full.  The estates of all those fully eligible persons  who were wrongly charged  for publicly funded long term residential care and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full.  The scheme does not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died prior to that date.</P><Col N="669"/>
        <P>Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.  The repayment scheme was launched publicly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald in August 2006.  The Scheme Administrator has commenced scanning the records of long stay facilities around the country and to date 160 locations have been visited for this purpose.</P>
        <P>In relation to dates of repayments to applicants, the HSE has informed the Department that over 24,000 forms have been submitted to the scheme administrator applying for repayments and these applications are being processed at present. The timeframe for repayment is predicated primarily on whether the applicant is alive or whether the application is being made by the estate of a deceased person. Living people who were wrongly charged will be the first to receive payments under the scheme. It is estimated that there are now in the region of 14,000 people within this category. Queries in relation to individual applications should be referred to the scheme administrator.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Health Service Executive has put arrangements in place whereby it can make applications on behalf of living persons in long stay institutions where there is no other connected person to make an application and where the applicants are unable to apply themselves due to ill health, or mental or physical disability.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that offers of repayment commenced in November 2006 and that the first payments have already issued with further payments continuing on an ongoing basis. The HSE has indicated that over &euro;17 million has been repaid to date and that the average repayment is approximately &euro;21,000. It is expected that the bulk of payments to estates will commence in the Spring.   Provision has been made for applications to be received up to 1 January 2008. It is anticipated that final repayments will be made by mid 2008.</P>
        <P>A dedicated website <i>www.repay.ie</i>, an information phone line 1890 886 886 and an e-mail facility queries@repay.ie have been established by the scheme administrator to assist the public in accessing claim forms and general information on the scheme.  The information line operates between the hours of 8.00 am and 9.00 pm from Monday to Saturday.</P>
        <P>In relation to the number of appeals, no appeals have been received by the Appeals Office to date.  The Health Service Executive has responsibility for administering the Repayment Scheme and specific information sought by the Deputy relates to matters within the area of responsibility of the Executive. My Department <Col N="670"/>has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the beginning of 2005 the medical card assessment guidelines  have been increased by a cumulative 29%.  Other significant changes which I have introduced are that applications are now considered on the basis of income net of tax and PRSI and that allowance is made for reasonable expenses  incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work. In June 2006, I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those used in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>My Department and the HSE are at present considering whether any further changes to the guidelines are required, having regard to factors such as changes in income levels generally, the nature of typical household outgoings and also changes to the various social welfare schemes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 804, 807, 857, 907 and 929 together.</P>
        <P>The Irish Nurses Organisation (INO) and the Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA) are pursuing a number of cost increasing claims in respect of pay and conditions, including a reduction in working hours from 39 to 35 hours per week.  The claims were heard by the Labour Court on 20 June 2006 and a recommendation (LCR 18763) issued on 9 November 2006.  This Recommendation has been accepted by health service employers.</P>
        <P>In its recommendation the Labour Court noted that the social partnership agreements have brought significant benefits to workers, employers and to the economy overall and they provide a fair mechanism within an agreed framework by which workers can obtain improvements in pay and conditions of employment. The Court did not recommend concession of the major cost increasing pay claims. Instead the Court urged the Unions concerned to reconsider their position with regard to Benchmarking so as to have their pay claims examined through that process.</P>
        <P>In relation to the claim for a reduction in working hours the Court stated that concession of this claim at this time would have profound consequences for both health care delivery and costs unless effective countervailing measures could be put in place. The Court did recommend that the parties explore the possibility of initiating an appropriate process aimed at achieving a major reorganisation of working arrangements within the health service generally. Such a process would have to involve representatives of a variety of grades and professions across the health service.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Health and Children I would like to place on record that I hold the nursing and midwifery professions in high esteem and view the care they provide to patients as a critical component of our health services. I believe that a solution to the current dispute can only be found within the context of the Labour Court Recommendation and the prevailing national agreements. In this regard I  arranged for exploratory discussions to be held between all the parties concerned at the offices of the HSE-Employers Agency on 19 January 2006.</P><Col N="675"/>
        <P>While I understand the discussion provided clarity as to the respective positions of the parties the meeting adjourned without agreement on the way forward. However, I remain hopeful that a resolution to this dispute can still be found and I believe it remains open to the INO and PNA to enter the Benchmarking process and have their pay claims processed through this forum. Two other unions, SIPTU and IMPACT, which also represent nurses are currently participating in the Benchmarking process and have made a submission for improvements in pay and conditions on behalf of their members. In addition the INO and PNA could also decide to accept the national agreement, Towards 2016. If they accept this agreement their members would be eligible for pay increases of 10%.</P>
        <P>I believe that industrial action by the unions concerned would not be in the interests of patients, staff or employers and I would urge the Unions to give further consideration to the proposals contained in the Labour Court Recommendation.</P>

	<P>The Health Bill 2006, published in December 2006, which is being debated in the D&aacute;il, provides for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services with specific statutory functions.  The Authority will incorporate the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board.  HIQA&rsquo;s main role will be to reinforce internal quality within the health system and at the same time to bring external quality assurance to bear in an objective manner.</P>
        <P>However, it should be noted that the Health Bill 2006 does not give authority to HIQA to limit access by patients to expensive drugs or technologies. One of the functions of HIQA, as outlined in the Health Bill 2006, is to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of health technologies, including drugs and provide advice arising out of this evaluation to the Minister for Health and Children and the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Clinicians have always had to make decisions on the basis of both clinical need and resources available.  However, as regards resources available to the services it might be noted that in the past six years (excluding the Office of the Minister for Children) gross current funding for the health services has increased by over &euro;7 billion to &euro;13.8 billion in 2007, or an increase of over<?oasys _jy ?>100%.  It is, of course, important that the health services are using these resources in an efficient and effective manner and, in that context, one of HIQA&rsquo;s functions  will be to carry out reviews  and make recommendations as the Authority thinks fit in respect of the services, to ensure the  best outcomes/value for money  for the resources available to the HSE.</P>

In 2006, a sum of &euro;26.2 million was allocated for the development of mental health services in line with &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;.  A further sum of &euro;25 million has been allocated in 2007 to continue this development.

        <P>Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.</P>
        <P>My Department does not set employment quotas at national level for any grade in the public health service. Subject to overall par<Col N="680"/>ameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 826, 827, 855 and 941 together.</P>
        <P>I have identified the enhancement of services for people with cystic fibrosis as a key priority in <Col N="684"/>2006 and again in 2007.  Development funding of &euro;4.78 million was provided to the Health Service Executive in 2006 to facilitate the recruitment of additional medical, nursing and allied health professional staff to improve services for cystic fibrosis patients. Additional funding of &euro;2 million has been allocated this year to build on the investment provided in 2006.</P>
        <P>Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the HSE has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, in accordance with Section 22(4) of the Health Act 2004, my Department notified the HSE of a revised employment ceiling for the health service to end-2006 taking account of approved service developments.  It is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.</P>
        <P>I understand the specific issue relating to AMNCH Tallaght was raised at a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and the HSE advised that approval issued in 2006 to the Hospital for the recruitment of the additional staff.</P>

	<P>The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for a new regulatory system for twelve health and social care professionals, including social workers.  The establishment of this system of statutory registration is essential to the delivery of the quality and accountability objectives of the Health Strategy and will ensure that members of the public are guided, protected and informed, so that they can be confident that health and social care professionals providing services are properly qualified, competent and fit to practise.  This is the first time that fitness to practise procedures will be put in place for these professionals on a statutory basis and will provide a modern structure to deal effectively with complaints and other disciplinary matters.</P>
        <P>The legislation provides for the establishment of a Health and Social Care Professionals Council, whose object will be to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of the designated professions.</P><Col N="685"/>
        <P>I will shortly be announcing the membership of the Council which is provided for in the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  Following the appointment of the Council, work will commence on the establishment of each of the registration boards including the Social Worker Registration Board.  It will be a matter for the Council, having regard to the establishment of the individual boards, to put in place the fitness to practise structure.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware talks on a new contract commenced on 24 November 2005 under the independent chairmanship of Mr. Mark <Col N="692"/>Connaughton SC. These talks were adjourned following the meeting on 9 February 2006.</P>
        <P>In January 2006, management tabled a position paper outlining proposals on a new employment contract for consultants working in the public health system. These proposals include a public-only contract, 24/7 provision of services by consultants, a move from a consultant-led to a consultant-provided service, improved research, education and training, and greater accountability for consultants.</P>
        <P>Talks resumed in November 2006 on the basis of a formula devised by the Chairman. Further documents were tabled by management.  Difficulties were encountered, however, in these negotiations due to objections by the medical organisations to arrangements adopted by the Health Service Executive in relation to Category 2 Consultant appointments.  Because of this, a further plenary meeting has not been convened.</P>
        <P>The chairman has recently issued a report to the parties which conveys his opinion that in order for constructive talks to take place:</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />there should be an unequivocal agreement between the parties that there would be unconditional negotiations for a defined period of time;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />an agreed agenda must be drawn up by the parties;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />outline responses must be exchanged in writing between the parties on the various issues;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a mechanism must be established to deal with issues arising in relation to the current contract;</P>

However, in 2005, at my request, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF)  set up a number of out-patient pilot projects.  The pilot programme operated successfully and 4,500 out-patients were seen in that year.   In 2006, a further 6,250 patients were provided with out-patient appointments.  The NTPF expects to increase the number to 9,000 in 2007.  I am very pleased with the success to date of the out-patient programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <P>On 31 July, 2006 I received a report from the Health Service Executive (HSE) on progress in implementing the Government&rsquo;s National Plan <Col N="697"/>for Radiation Oncology. Significant progress is being made supported by substantial additional investment, both revenue and capital. The main developments are as follows:</P>
        <P>The procurement of additional capacity (2 linear accelerators) for St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Rathgar.  This is scheduled to be delivered around the end of 2007.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provision of interim facilities at Beaumont Hospital (2 linear accelerators) and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital (2 linear accelerators).  These facilities will be delivered by early 2009. The capital requirements amount to &euro;45m.</P>
        <P>A Clinical Output Specification Group has completed an assessment of population needs, linear accelerator requirements by site, bed issues, specialty distribution, supplier mix, equipment specification, functional specification and contract flexibility.</P>
        <P>The HSE has appointed a Project Director.  A project team was also established comprising representatives from the HSE, National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) and the Hospital Planning Office.  The team meets twice monthly and is progressing all procurement and planning issues.</P>
        <P>Four leading international experts have been appointed to validate the population needs assessments, technical specifications, process mapping and other outputs.</P>
        <P>A Project Board has been appointed by the HSE to provide overall governance and resolution of policy issues as they arise.  It includes HSE, NDFA and Departmental participants as well as expertise from outside the State.  The Project Board meets six weekly.</P>
        <P>The Project Director is working with the HSE National Hospitals Office to ensure appropriate integration of the privately operated facility in Limerick.</P>
        <P>A Senior Project Manager in HR/Workforce Planning has been appointed to deal with recruitment, training and retention issues.</P>
        <P>The HSE has contracted an international Radiation Oncology Expert to advise on process re-engineering and improved workforce efficiencies.  The HSE is to utilise the opportunities presented by the Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016  to progress more flexible working arrangements including an extended working hours model, to improve the delivery of  radiation oncology.</P>
        <P>The Project Team is establishing nationally standardised operating and ICT systems and national data and Quality Assurance systems will be developed.</P>
        <P>Additional revenue funding of &euro;3.25m has been provided in 2007 to support the implementation of the National Plan.  This funding will support the appointment of five additional Consultant Radiation Oncologists, 7 Specialist Registrars and five support staff.  The funding will also support <Col N="698"/>the two linear accelerator capacity expansion at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
        <P>In December, 2006 I met with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the HSE and I agreed that the Executive should examine options to speed up the pace of delivery.  The Executive will make recommendations to me shortly on the earliest delivery of the Plan in the best interests of cancer patients throughout the country.</P>
        <P>As regards the referral of patients from Donegal to Belfast City Hospital (BCH), a Service Level Agreement is now in place for the referral of about 50 radiation oncology patients annually and a number of patients have already been referred for treatment. It has also been agreed that the number will be increased if there is sufficient demand from patients in Donegal.  In November 2006, I met with the Minister for Health for Northern Ireland and we discussed progressing consideration of a satellite centre in the North West linked to BCH.  Further discussions will take place at official level involving both Departments.</P>

	<P>The aim of the National Cancer Control Strategy, which was published in June 2006, is to reduce our cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality rates relative to other Member States of the European Union.  The Strategy encompasses all aspects of cancer control, including prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, supportive and palliative care.  This Government is committed to investing significantly in the implementation of the Strategy.  I have made available an additional &euro;20.5m this year for cancer control.  This is an increase of 74% on the comparable 2006 investment.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) is establishing a National Cancer Control Programme to manage, organise and deliver cancer control on a whole population basis.  The Programme will have a strong emphasis on prevention and early detection, integrated across primary, hospital, supportive and palliative care.</P>
        <P>Evidence based population based screening programmes are an essential element of the <Col N="701"/>Strategy.  I established a National Cancer Screening Service Board on 1 January this year.  It takes over responsibility for BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme.  The total allocation to the new Service is &euro;33m, a 71% increase on the funding available in 2006.  This includes &euro;8m for the roll out of the national breast screening programme to the West and South which will commence this Spring and &euro;5m to commence the roll out of a national cervical screening programme later this year.  The Service will also advise on the implementation of a national colorectal screening programme, specifically on the population to be screened, at what intervals screening should take place, and the requirements for a quality assured and well organised cost effective symptomatic service.</P>

	<P>Obesity is a major public health problem both for Ireland and for our European neighbours.  The National Taskforce on Obesity published a report in 2005 containing 93 recommendations to halt the rise in levels of overweight and obesity.</P>
        <P>The Taskforce recognises that a multi-sectoral approach is necessary, involving other state agencies and government departments and real engagement of the public and private sectors to implement all of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  It is proposed to utilise social inclusion structures already established as well as other working groups as required to facilitate this.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Health Service Executive has established a Working Group to implement those recommendations of the Task Force on Obesity for which the HSE has the lead responsibility and for which &euro;3 million has been allocated.  In 2006 eight additional posts focussed on obesity were secured and a number of new initiatives commenced and are continuing.  In conjunction with the Irish Sports Council, the HSE is supporting local sports partnerships.  Research and surveillance are progressing through partnerships with Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance, the National Nutritional Surveillance Centre, UCD and NUI Galway.   At present a North &mdash; South conference is being planned on this issue and a new obesity campaign for 2007 is being developed by the HSE.</P>

        <P>Increased investment in mental health services has accelerated the move from institutionally provided services to community-based services and has provided for increases in the number of consultant psychiatrists in the public health service.  The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, entitled &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;, was launched on 24th January 2006.  It provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over the next 7 to 10 years.</P>
        <P>In 2006, a sum of &euro;26.2 million was allocated for the development of mental health services in line with &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;.  A further sum of &euro;25 million has been allocated in 2007 to continue this development.  A significant amount of this year&rsquo;s funding &mdash; &euro;7.95m &mdash; is for the development of child and adolescent psychiatric services.  This funding will bring about significant improvements in community, hospital-based and early intervention services.  Existing multi-disciplinary teams will be enhanced and new child and adolescent mental health teams developed.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care.  All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive will have their charges repaid in full.  The estates of all those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged for publicly funded long term residential care and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full.  The scheme does not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died prior to that date.</P>
        <P>Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.</P>
        <P>The repayment scheme was launched publicly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald in August 2006.</P>
        <P>The Scheme Administrator has commenced scanning the records of long stay facilities around the country and to date 160 locations have been visited for this purpose.</P>
        <P>In relation to dates of repayments to applicants, the HSE has informed the Department that over 24,000 forms have been submitted to the scheme administrator applying for repayments and these applications are being processed at present. The timeframe for repayment is predicated primarily on whether the applicant is alive or whether the application is being made by the estate of a deceased person. Living people who were wrongly charged will be the first to receive <Col N="710"/>payments under the scheme. It is estimated that there are now in the region of 14,000 people within this category. Queries in relation to individual applications should be referred to the scheme administrator.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Health Service Executive has put arrangements in place whereby it can make applications on behalf of living persons in long stay institutions where there is no other connected person to make an application and where the applicants are unable to apply themselves due to ill health, or mental or physical disability.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that offers of repayment commenced in November 2006 and that the first payments have already issued with further payments continuing on an ongoing basis. It is expected that the bulk of payments to estates will commence in the Spring.   Provision has been made for applications to be received up to 1 January 2008. It is anticipated that final repayments will be made by mid 2008.</P>
        <P>A dedicated website www.repay.ie, an information phone line 1890 886 886 and an e-mail facility queries@repay.ie have been established by the scheme administrator to assist the public in accessing claim forms and general information on the scheme.  The information line operates between the hours of 8.00 am and 9.00 pm from Monday to Saturday.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services.  In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P><Col N="714"/>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <P>In 2006, a sum of &euro;26.2 million was allocated for the development of mental health services in line with &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;.  A further sum of &euro;25 million has been allocated in 2007 to continue this development. A significant amount of this year&rsquo;s funding  &mdash; &euro;7.95m &mdash; is for the development of child and adolescent psychiatric services.  This funding will bring about significant improvements in community, hospital-based and early intervention services. Existing multidisciplinary teams will be enhanced and new child and adolescent mental health teams developed.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to  arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The expert advice from BreastCheck and from the National Cancer Forum, as contained in its National Strategy for Cancer Control, is that following the national extension of the current programme, the upper age limit should be extended to women aged 69 years. The priority of BreastCheck is to screen women who have not yet been screened and accordingly it is fully focussed at present on the commencement of the first round of screening in the West and South.  I will consider extending the age limit, as recommended, when the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered. Any woman irrespective of her age or residence who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>
        <P>I am committed to ensuring that the BreastCheck service is rolled out to the remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible.  I have allocated additional revenue funding of &euro;8 million for this year to meet the additional costs involved.  I have also made available an additional <Col N="726"/>&euro;26.7m capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and five additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment. The first round of screening will commence in the South and West in the Spring which will take around 27 months to complete. The BreastCheck Programme is designed to offer repeat screening within an interval of 21-27 months.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 945 to 947, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>There are 25,518 people registered on the National Intellectual Disability Database for 2006. There are 24,511 people registered on the National Physical and Sensory Disability Database for 2005. The Deputy should note that the 2006 Report for the National Physical and Sensory Disability Database will be published in the next few weeks. However, given that entry on both databases is voluntary the total number of people with disabilities (intellectual or physical and sensory) is not available.</P>
        <P>Under current registration criteria entry onto the databases is voluntary. The Department of Health and Children has currently no plans to amend the registration criteria. The Department of Health and Children has allocated funding to the Health Research Board to audit the  National Intellectual Disability Database. It is envisaged that this will be carried out in 2007.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question in relation to waiting lists relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 950 and 951 together.</P>
        <P>The &euro;900 million Multi-Annual Investment Programme announced in 2005 demonstrates that the needs of people with disabilities are a priority for the Government. The publication of the Sectoral Plan in July 2006 is further evidence of this commitment. The plan outlines the future direction of investment in services for people with disabilities. Specifically the plan outlines the arrangements for the implementation of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, which provides for an <Col N="730"/>independent assessment of need and a service statement, a complaints and an appeals system.</P>
        <P>The arrangements for Part 2 of the Disability Act 2004 cannot be considered in isolation from the arrangements for the implementation of the EPSEN Act 2004 which is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science and provides for educational services for people with disabilities. Part 2 of the Disability Act will commence for children aged under 5 with effect from 1st June 2007. Part 2 will be commenced in respect of children aged 5-18 in tandem with the implementation of the EPSEN Act 2004 and the statutory requirement of Part 2 will be extended to adults as soon as possible but no later than 2011.  Regulations are currently being drafted by my Department to give full effect to Part 2 of the Act and I expect to sign the commencement order in this regard in the near future. From June 1st 2007 an independent assessment of need may be applied for in respect of all children under the age of 5 with a disability.</P>
        <P>The operational aspects of Part 2 of the Disability Act are a matter for the Health Service Executive. Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme is administered by the HSE on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The primary aim of the scheme is to provide financial assistance to older people who reside alone and who, from their own resources are not in a position to carry out urgent necessary repairs to their own homes.  Basically, aid is made available for repairs to make a dwelling suitable for the older person, by providing a warm, safe, secure and healthy environment for the lifetime of the older person, thereby enabling older people to continue living in their own homes for as long as possible.</P>
        <P>The type of works carried out include the following: replacement of windows/doors, roof repairs, provision of heating and sanitary facilities and necessary electrical works. Applications for Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme are assessed by HSE personnel.  Whilst the means of the applicant and spouse/ partner may be considered, eligibility for this scheme is not based on means only &mdash; the following are the guidelines for the scheme:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Be aged 65 years or over</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Be living on their own or with another older person or person with a disability</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Be living in unfit or unsanitary conditions</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Have no able bodied person available to carry out essential repairs</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Housing Aid Scheme applies to privately owned accommodation only.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Due to the nature of the client group, their individual circumstances and the extent of need, considerable latitude is taken in applying the guidelines. The works that may receive grant aid may <Col N="733"/>be undertaken by private contractors engaged by the applicant or by voluntary organizations working in conjunction with HSE staff.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The budget allocation received by the HSE from the Department of the Environment,  Heritage and Local Government has been increasing substantially year on year over the past number of years. In 2006 the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly in the Department allocated a total of &euro;17.02 million for the operation of the scheme by the HSE regions. This has allowed the HSE to increase the number of grants being made available under the scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>An effective national cervical screening programme will result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer. It is my objective to have such a programme rolled out, beginning late this year, based on an affordable model. For that purpose, on the 1st January 2007, I established a National Cancer Screening Service which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme. This will maximise the expertise in both programmes, ensure improved efficiency and develop a single governance model for cancer screening. The total allocation to the new Service is &euro;33m, a 71% increase in the 2006 funding levels for the Programmes.  This includes funding of &euro;5m to commence roll out of the Cervical Screening Programme. Significant preparatory work is well underway involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality <Col N="734"/>assurance training and the preparation of a national population register. The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service.</P>
        <P>In relation to the roll out to specific counties, my Department has requested the Chief Executive Officer of the National Cancer Screening Service to respond directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 972, 1007 and 1021 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</P>
        <P>My priority remains that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country and accordingly I recently announced my intention to introduce a scheme to ensure broadband is available throughout Ireland. This Scheme, which will supersede the Group Broadband Scheme, will, when it is fully rolled out, ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met. A Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently considering all elements of the proposed scheme. This scheme will be confined to areas of the country that are not yet served by any broadband service provider, currently thought to be 10-15% of the population.</P><Col N="742"/>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s website www.broadband.gov.ie gives full details of broadband availability in all areas, including ADSL, cable, fibre, satellite and fixed wireless. The website also lists prices of the various service levels on offer and contact details for each service provider.</P>

	<P>I am advised that originally, an indicative budget of &euro;21.4million of Exchequer funding was identified for the Tourism and Recreational Angling Measure (TRAM) for the Border, Midland and Western Regional Operational Programme of the National Development Plan (2000-2006). The launch of the measure was delayed pending State aids clearance from the EU Commission, which was received in March 2002.</P>
        <P>I understand that a decision was made during 2002 in the context of other budgetary priorities to curtail the actual allocation to the measure. There was, however, a limited call for applications where over 60 applications were received. A number of these projects were approved for funding by the Tourism Product Selection Board and expenditure of &euro;504,025 for the BMW region was incurred towards the end of 2002.</P><Col N="743"/>
        <P>The mid term evaluation by the ESRI of the NDP 2000-2006 in respect of the Marine Tourism sub-measure recommended that the indicative budget for this scheme be reallocated to other priority tourism measures. As a result there was no further expenditure for the remainder of the term of the programme.</P>

	<P>The situation currently in relation to Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle is that they are both formally designated as Restricted Areas for the movement of molluscan shellfish following the confirmation of the presence of Bonamia ostreae in both Loughs.  All requests for movement licences for molluscan shellfish considered susceptible to Bonamia ostreae for re-immersion outside the Loughs in bonamia free areas are refused by the Department.

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department received notification from its scientific advisors, the Marine Institute, on October 27 th 2006, of a possible positive test for Bonamia ostreae in Lough Swilly. Bonamia osteae is a disease which affects oysters, but consumption of oysters affected by the disease has no human health impacts. Following the Marine Institute notification, as a precautionary measure, it was decided that any applications made to move native oysters and other shellfish susceptible to Bonamia ostreae originating in Lough Swilly for on-growing in areas free of the disease would be refused.</P>
        <P>When results of tests on samples forwarded to the Community Reference Laboratory, La Tremblade, France, confirmed the initial suspicion on 15 November 2006, this ban on movements of susceptible species from L. Swilly to Bonamia free areas was made permanent.  Lough Swilly was formally designated as a Non-Approved Zone for the parasite B.ostreae.</P>
        <P>On December 3rd 2006 the Department forwarded, by post, to operators in the Lough, Guidelines for the Management of Shellfish Operations in Lough Swilly.  The objectives of these measures were to restrict the transmission and spread of the parasite Bonamia ostreae within the native oyster stocks in Lough Swilly and to prevent the transmission and spread of the parasite from native oyster stocks in Lough Swilly to other bonamia free areas.  Incorporated within <Col N="748"/>the Guidelines is the requirement that all fishing boats operating in Lough Swilly must be cleared of all shellfish and decks, holds, dredges and equipment must be cleaned with freshwater prior to their leaving the Lough, for a Bonamia free zone.  However, the Guidelines do not affect the harvesting of molluscan shellfish from Lough Swilly for human consumption.</P>
        <P>Statutory Instrument No. 614 which added Lough Swilly to the Schedule 11 of the European Communities (Aquaculture Animals and Fish) (Placing on the Market and Control of Certain Diseases) Regulations 1966, S.I. 253 of 1996, was signed into law by Minister Dempsey on 11 December 2006.</P>
        <P>While the presence of the parasite Bonamia ostreae has been confirmed within Lough Swilly, to date, no reports of actual mortalities in the oyster stock due to the parasite have been reported to the Department or to our scientific advisors.  However, scientific advice suggests that should attempts be made to increase stocking rates from present levels it could contribute to increasing the risk of mortalities occurring however given that the native oyster beds in Lough Swilly are wild beds stocking densities are not likely to change appreciably.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos 989 and 1008 together.</P>
        <P>The Standing Scientific Committee of the National Salmon Commission has advised that stocks of salmon in the Rivers Barrow and Nore are below conservation limits.  For this reason no killing of salmon by any method in the River Barrow is permitted during the 2007 season in accordance with the Conservation of Salmon and Sea Trout Bye-Law No C.S. 287, 2006.  Fishing on a catch-and-release basis only is permitted by the Conservation of Salmon and Sea Trout Bye-Law No. 815, 2006 on the waters of the river Nore.  This reflects the relative status of the stocks of both rivers.</P>
        <P>The regional Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute will monitor the stocks in developing a management plan for each of the rivers with a view to identifying the extent of the recovery, if any, arising from the cessation of the mixed stock commercial fishery and any stock rehabilitation works undertaken.  The application of the above by-laws will be kept under constant review.</P>

The target of 13.2% approximates to 1450 megawatts (MW).  The reserve lists in the onshore categories of the AER VI are closed.  Last year I launched a new support mechanism, the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT).  Any capacity withdrawn from the AER V and onshore categories of the AER VI competitions was allocated to REFIT to ensure that the overall target of 1450 MW is delivered. </P>

Regarding coastal erosion at Inch, the Department has recently received an application for funding from Kerry County Council and are currently considering this application.

The proposed development includes the provision of additional pier berthage of 64 metres, a working area of 2,300 square metres, an extension to the existing slipway (for fishery use) and a new slipway which would be dedicated for leisure use thereby alleviating pressure on the existing slipway.</P>

        <Quest> if he will allow the fishermen of the River Feale, County Kerry, five tags before 12 May 2007, in view of the fact that the river is a recognised spring fishery and the additional tags have been proposed by the Shannon Board; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Conservation of Salmon and Sea Trout Bye-Law No. 814, 2006, which came into operation on 1 January 2007, provides for an annual bag limit of 10 fish for 2007 and a season bag limit of 1 fish during the period 1 March to 12 May in those rivers open for salmon fishing this year including the river Feale.</P>
        <P>The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board has reviewed the available scientific data and has recommended that a relaxation on the bag limit could be introduced on the river Feale.  I am considering the recommendation of the regional board along with advice obtained independent of the board and in the context of the clarity of the regulation if this measure was applied.  I will make a decision on this matter before the angling season commences on the River Feale on 1 March.</P>

	<P>The Biofuels MOT Relief Scheme II was publicly advertised as a competitive call for proposals open to anyone who could fulfil the criteria laid out in the Guidance Note relating to the scheme which was provided to all prospective applicants.  There were 102 applications received overall under the scheme.  The range and quality of applications was exceptionally high.  The assessment panel comprised officials from my Department, Sustainable Energy Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  Each application was marked individually in accordance with the evaluation criteria outlined in the Guidance Note provided to all applicants for the Scheme.</P>
        <P>My officials recently met with representatives of the company in question to give them feedback on the scoring of the application they submitted under the scheme.  While the application from the company was of high quality, the project did not score as highly as the successful applicants in the category and as with all other categories demand exceeded availability.</P>

	<P>The Department has overall responsibility for the implementation of the Shellfish Waters Directive (79/923/EEC).  This directive has been enacted through SI 268/2006 and Clew bay is designated as a Shellfish Water under these regulations.  As a designated water, an ongoing action plan has been implemented to protect and improve these waters, consisting of a testing regime and ongoing analysis of the pressures on the bay.  This protection extends to the listed parameters in schedule 2 of the regulations.</P>
        <P>The Department became aware of the discharge of leachate through the Westport Waste Water Treatment plant on the 18th December 2006.  An investigation was instigated, which determined that this discharge was licensed by the EPA as a temporary measure in response to an emergency situation at Derrinumera landfill site, due to the volume of rainfall in December 2006.  This discharge commenced on 7/12/06 and ceased on 20/12/06.</P>
        <P>Local Authorities and the EPA are listed in the regulations (SI 268/2006) as relevant Public Authorities and therefore were aware of their duties in regard to the protection of the shellfish waters in Clew Bay when deciding on the discharge of the leachate.  The Department contacted the EPA on 18/12/2006 and were assured that the leachate did not exceed any of the parameters in SI 268/2006, from which Shellfish waters are protected.</P>

	<P>The Department has responsibility for the licensing of aquaculture activities in accordance with the terms of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997 as amended.  Aquaculture licences have continued to be granted and renewed since the introduction of the Statutory Instrument referred to by the Deputy. </P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is a statutory consultee in relation to all applications for an aquaculture licence under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997.  That Department considers all such applications from an archaeological and nature conservation perspective taking into account the proximity of the proposed aquaculture operation to an area designated, or a candidate area for designation, under the EU Habitats Directive.</P>
        <P>All applicants for fish breeding installations with a proposed output in excess of 100 tonnes per annum or 1 million smolts and all seawater salmon farming proposals, irrespective of production limit, are required to prepare an environmental impact statement and an environmental impact assessment must also be carried out.  In addition to fulfilling the requirements of the EU EIA Directive, any statement must also encompass the requirements of the EU Habitats Directive where the location of the proposed aquaculture operation lies within a Natura 2000 Site or a candidate area for designation.  Applicants for land based aquaculture licences are also required to obtain planning permission from the relevant local authority in the first instance.  In the case of applications for shellfish aquaculture licences, where a potential impact on a Natura 2000 site or a candidate site is identified, the Department engages the Marine Institute to carry out an assessment of the potential impact on the site in accordance with Article 6 of the EU Habitats Directive.</P>
        <P>In addition the Department has established a Working Group to develop a methodology that can be used to assess at the outset those shellfish aquaculture licence applications that may have a potentially significant impact on a designated Natura 2000 site or a candidate site and may therefore require further detailed assessment.

Leases and licences have continued to be granted since the introduction of the Statutory Instrument referred to by the Deputy.  Leases and licences are granted, as appropriate, for a wide variety of structures and activities on or uses of the foreshore.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is consulted in relation to all applications for foreshore leases and licences.  That Department considers all such applications from, inter alia, an archaeological and nature conservation perspective taking into account the proximity of the proposed aquaculture operation to an area designated, or a candidate area for designation, under the EU Habitats Directive.</P>
        <P>Applications for development on the foreshore, not being exempted development, also require planning permission where the proposed development adjoins the functional area of a planning authority or any reclaimed land adjoining such functional area.  Applications in respect of proposed projects which require an Environmental Impact Statement are also examined by <Col N="760"/>the Marine Licence Vetting Committee (MLVC).  The MLVC is a body of technical, scientific, marine, safety and engineering experts which advises the Minister regarding the appropriateness of issuing a lease or licence in respect of cases referred to it.</P>

	<P>The Department has responsibility for the granting of Dumping at Sea Permits in accordance with the terms of the Dumping at Sea Act 1996, as amended by the Dumping at Sea Act 2004.  Dumping at Sea permits have continued to be granted and renewed since the introduction of the Statutory Instrument referred to by the Deputy.  The issue of dumping at sea permits is now largely confined to the disposal of dredged spoil.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is a statutory consultee in relation to all applications for Dumping at Sea Permits.  That Department considers all such applications from an archaeological and nature conservation perspective taking into account the proximity of the proposed aquaculture operation to an area designated, or a candidate area for designation, under the EU Habitats Directive.</P>
        <P>All applications for permits are subject to a rigorous assessment of their possible effects on the environment.  Applicants are routinely required to submit detailed sediment analyses of the material proposed for dumping, and to prepare impact hypotheses and any other assessments considered necessary having regard to the nature and location of the proposed dumping.</P>
        <P>All applications for a Dumping at Sea permits are referred to the Marine Licence Vetting Committee for evaluation.  The MLVC is a body of technical, scientific, marine, safety and engineering experts which advises the Minister regarding the appropriateness of issuing a permit in respect of cases referred to it.  The Committee&rsquo;s evaluation takes account, inter alia, of all relevant environmental considerations and issues, including the requirements of the EU Habitats Directive and the Regulations referred to by the Deputy, as appropriate.  The conditions and requirements attached to a permit would, as necessary, require further monitoring, or specify the times at which, or the manner in which, dredging or dumping may take place.</P>

        <P>No State Mining Facilities (Leases or Licences) have been issued over areas which include sites specified in the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations (i.e. Special Areas of Conservation or SACs).

        <P>Applicants are advised of the existence of any SACs or SPAs in a Prospecting Licence area before it is granted and may not undertake any restricted activity in such an area without the written permission of my Department.  Any such permission will only be given following consultation with the National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service (NPWS) and will be subject to any conditions recommended by the NPWS in order to ensure that there is no adverse impact on the habitat in question.</P>

Figures are not yet available for the actual market penetration of biofuels for 2006. Ireland has reported a target of 2.2% market penetration of biofuels by 2008 and this has been accepted by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>The Government is firmly committed to the development of an Irish biofuels market and to the increased development of bio-energy generally in Ireland. A range of initiatives are in place to support the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland.  The 2005 pilot mineral oil tax relief scheme for biofuels has resulted in eight projects being awarded excise relief for a two year period under the scheme. Building on the success of this scheme a further Biofuels Mineral Oil tax Relief Scheme II was introduced in 2006, valued at over &euro;200m. Under this scheme sixteen projects have been awarded excise relief to the period 2010. The scheme will enable us to reach the initial target of 2.2% market penetration of biofuels by 2008. When fully operational the relief is expected to support the use and production of some 163 million litres of biofuels each year.</P>
        <P>In addition to the support programmes in place for current technologies, my Department will continue to support research and development in this area. The resulting biofuels and bio-products, while not yet at a commercial stage, will have significant economic potential once fully developed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In tandem with the roll-out of the Schemes, my Department has been working on further initiatives to stimulate the development of biofuels in Ireland. The Bio-energy Ministerial Task Force has been considering options for the development of future Biofuels policy initiatives. The National BioEnergy Action Plan will be published shortly. The forthcoming White Paper on Energy Policy will also set out actions and targets to 2020 having regard also to EU developments.</P>

	<P>Under EU regulations, landings of pelagic species (e.g. herring, mackerel, horse mackerel) in excess of 10 tonnes may only be permitted into designated ports.

	<P>The designation of ports for landing of pelagic species (herring, mackerel, etc.) is necessary in order to satisfy EU requirements and also for the purpose of appropriate control of landings. </P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s list of designated ports for the Celtic Sea Herring fishery was revised in late 2006 to include Baltimore and Dunmore East, bringing the total number of designated ports around our coastline to nine.  Furthermore, in view of the adverse weather conditions in recent weeks and the tragic events off the south-east coast, I have instructed that Duncannon be designated to receive landings of herring of under 10 tonnes from vessels under 50 feet in length.</P>
        <P>All vessels under 65 feet in registered length in the polyvalent segment are allowed to participate in the Celtic Sea Herring fishery. Vessels are required to book into the fishery at a stipulated time in advance of the fishing period, and vessels booked in are given an allocation of quota for that fishing period. A vessel booking in will not normally be refused an allocation because of previously unused allocations; at the same time the objective of the booking-in system is to ensure that vessels that can and will participate successfully in the fishery are allocated a viable quota.</P>
        <P>I would point out that it is a matter ultimately for the master of each individual vessel to determine the type of fishing operation that is appropriate having regard to the capability of the vessel and the operational and navigational conditions it will have to contend with in order to participate in any given fishery.  At the same time, I am satisfied that, regardless of the legal framework governing the landings of fish, whether demersal or pelagic, there are no circumstances where the control authorities would give precedence to their regulatory responsibilities over consideration for the safety of a fishing vessel or its crew.</P>

	<P>The Irish <Col N="766"/>National Petroleum Corporation Limited (INPC) business and commercial assets were sold on 16 th July 2001. An undertaking by the purchaser, and its successors, to operate the facilities on a fully commercial basis for at least 15 years was a key element of the transaction. This undertaking is underpinned by a Deed of Guarantee.  While the headline figure was $100 million (&euro;117 million) for the 2001 transaction, it was always accepted that the net cash return arising from the transaction would be considerably less as, for example, the INPC had to use some of the proceeds to discharge the Company&rsquo;s significant debt (circa &euro;88 million).  After taking account of all the Company&rsquo;s matured liabilities it was estimated that the INPC would have funds of the order of &euro;30 million.</P>
        <P>The INPC has paid &euro;20 million to the Exchequer (2002) but is not in a position to pay over remaining balances as, under Company Law, it must retain sufficient assets to meet potential liabilities.  The INPC retains both rights and obligations under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) relating to the 2001 transaction.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</P>
        <P>It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country. However, despite Government investment, I am aware that there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband. I would like to see the roll-out of broadband to these remaining areas that cannot receive a commercially viable service. To that end, I recently announced my intention to introduce a scheme which will ensure that there is broadband coverage available throughout Ireland. It is intended that this scheme will be confined to areas of the country that are not yet served by any broadband service provider, currently thought to be 10-15% of the population. This scheme will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met. A Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently considering all elements of the proposed scheme and work on the design of an appropriate tender will commence in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s website www.broadband.gov.ie gives full details of broadband availability in all areas, including ADSL, cable, fibre, satellite and fixed wireless. The website also lists prices of the various service levels on offer and contact details for each service provider.</P>

The study is nearing completion and its findings will be examined in detail at which stage any resource limitations will be addressed.  Responsibility for coastal protection lies with the individual property owner whether it is a Local Authority or private individual. All requests for funding from Local Authorities are considered on a case by case basis and subject to Exchequer funding requirements.

A subsequent amended licence also showing the correct figure was issued to the individual in 2005 on the re-measurement of the vessel. It was not the practice at the time to keep copies of registration certificates on file, however there appears to be no reason why amended registration certificates should not have issued along with the amended licences in 2002 and 2005.

	<P>All staff employed in Ireland by the Department of Foreign Affairs, or by bodies under its aegis, currently earn more than one Euro per hour above the national minimum wage. This also applies to staff on posting at Irish Missions abroad.  The practice followed by the Department in relation to locally employed staff abroad is to provide salaries and conditions of employment in accordance with local legal requirements, and on terms which correspond to the prevailing market rate for such forms of employment. Salaries are set at levels which comply with any local statutory minimum wage requirements, where such provisions apply, and are usually benchmarked against remuneration paid by other EU Embassies in the relevant capital.</P>
        <P>Bearing in mind the breadth of its activities worldwide, the Department does not have specific details on the remuneration of staff employed by contractors to it but would emphasise that, through its public procurement activities, it will comply fully with Section 20 of the Social Partnership Agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; to support the maintenance of employment standards, including in respect of wage levels, while also ensuring competitive tendering and value for money in public expenditure.</P>

I am not aware of any reason to believe that the conduct of officials at the Chinese Embassy is not fully in conformity with their obligations.

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Any decision by the Canadian Government to end its annual human rights dialogue with China is a matter for the Canadian authorities and it would not be appropriate for me to comment. The EU cooperates closely with Canada in seeking to promote respect for human rights throughout the world.</P>
        <P>The EU-China Human Rights Dialogue (HRD), which was established in 1996, has served as the main forum for discussion of human rights issues at the European Union level. However, human rights are a constant point of discussion with the Chinese authorities, both at the national and at the EU level.</P>
        <P>The HRD, the most recent round of which took place in Beijing in October 2006, has allowed the EU to engage with China on such issues as freedom of expression, the death penalty, the independence of the judiciary and freedom of religion. The EU has used the Dialogue to press its case for Chinese ratification of such international instruments as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and, in that context, reform of the criminal justice system. The EU has also urged China to continue cooperation with, and to implement the recommendations of, the UN Special Rapporteur on <Col N="775"/>Torture, including in particular the abolition of the &ldquo;re-education through labour&rdquo; system. The EU continues to use the HRD to raise significant individual human rights cases.</P>
        <P>Equally, the EU provides support for the Dialogue process, for example through regular EU-China Human Rights Seminars, the most recent of which took place in Beijing in October. These seminars give EU human rights experts, including Irish representatives, the opportunity to share their expertise on human rights related topics with Chinese representatives. Seminars have focused on issues such as labour rights, freedom of access to information, human rights education and implementing the recommendations of human rights mechanisms. An expert level meeting of the Ireland-China Human Rights Academic Exchange took place in Galway on 31 March/1 April 2006, with the participation of six Chinese academic experts.</P>
        <P>In our view, the process allows for genuine dialogue and a constructive and pragmatic approach to improving human rights standards. Obviously major concerns remain, but I believe that in the case of China it is only through dialogue that genuine pressure for change can be sustained.  The EU keeps the functioning of the Dialogue under review to seek to ensure the greatest possible effectiveness.</P>
        <P>On a bilateral level, of course Ireland continues to raise human rights issues with China at every possible opportunity. In a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing on 12 May, during a visit to Beijing, I brought up our concerns in the area of human rights. Foreign Minister Li referred in particular to China&rsquo;s commitment to the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue. Most recently, the T&aacute;naiste held official talks on 25 September with visiting Chinese Vice-Premier Zeng Peiyan in the course of which he also raised human rights issues and concerns.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has made its position very clear on this issue, both publicly and directly to the Iranian authorities. As the Deputy will be aware, I have strongly condemned a series of statements by President Ahmadinejad calling for the destruction of the State of Israel and claiming that the Holocaust is a historical fabrication. The Government, together with our EU partners, unreservedly condemned the recent Holocaust conference in Tehran, together with all attempts to deny or question the Holocaust in any way.</P>
        <P>To emphasise the strength of the Government&rsquo;s concern, the Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires of the <Col N="776"/>Iranian Embassy in Dublin was called in to the Department of Foreign Affairs on 13 December 2006. He was informed that the Government unreservedly condemned the efforts of the Government of Iran to cast doubt on the events of the Holocaust, and to connect this issue to the repeated and totally unacceptable remarks of President Ahmadinejad in relation to Israel. He was reminded that there is no reputable historical opinion which questions the Holocaust, and that Resolution 60/7 adopted by the UN General Assembly in November 2005 rejects any denial of the Holocaust as a historical event. The Charg&eacute; was asked formally to convey the Government&rsquo;s clear views to his authorities.</P>
        <P>On 12 December 2006, the Finnish EU Presidency issued a strong statement condemning the Conference on behalf of the European Union. On 14 December, the meeting of the European Council, which I attended with the Taoiseach, issued a Declaration condemning any denial of the Holocaust as a historical fact, whether in whole or in part, and firmly rejecting the underlying premise and the objectives of the conference organised by the Iranian authorities.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1032, 1041, 1042 and 1044 together.</P>
        <P>The case to which the Deputy refers relates to five Cuban citizens who were convicted in the US in 2001 on charges ranging from espionage to first degree murder. A panel of three judges from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta overturned the 2001 convictions on 9 August 2005 and ordered a retrial based on new evidence. The Miami District Attorney duly filed an appeal against the decision of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Following an appellate hearing on 14 February 2006, a 10-2 decision to uphold the 2001 convictions was issued on 9 August 2006.</P><Col N="777"/>
        <P>As regards the question of unfair detention, the Deputy will be aware that, in its 2005 Report on this aspect, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stated that its determination does not imply a consideration regarding the innocence or guilt of the concerned person, and that the Working Group does not substitute itself for the domestic courts. It is my understanding that a number of appeals lodged on behalf of the defendants remain under active judicial review within the framework of the US domestic legal system.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the Amnesty International call for temporary visas to be granted to the wives of two of the accused. However, visa applications from members of the families of the accused in order to visit the accused are a matter for the US authorities, and it would not be appropriate for me to raise the matter with those authorities.</P>
        <P>Although the report of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is a matter of concern, the Government has no standing in this matter. As I have previously informed the House on a number of occasions, this is a bilateral consular question between the US and the Cuban authorities and, consequently, I do not intend to raise this matter at EU or UN level, nor otherwise to pursue this issue, including through meeting the individual referred to by the Deputy.</P>

Ireland, with our EU partners, takes this matter very seriously, and the situation of the Falun Gong, within our wider concerns about human rights in China, is a constant and important point of dialogue with the Chinese authorities at both bilateral and European Union levels.  </P>
        <P>On a bilateral level, Ireland has taken every opportunity to raise human rights issues with the Chinese authorities, including my meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing in Beijing last May where I stressed the importance we attach to freedom of speech and freedom of religion. The T&aacute;naiste raised human rights issues and concerns during his meeting with Chinese Vice-Premier Zeng Peiyan during official talks in Dublin last September.</P>
        <P>The EU-China Human Rights Dialogue is the agreed formal framework through which the EU raises human rights issues and concerns with China. Through this dialogue, the EU has raised issues such as the protection of freedom of religion and expression, which have a particular impact on Falun Gong practitioners. The EU has also raised its strong concerns about the persecution of persons on grounds of their peaceful expression of belief, in particular members of the Falun Gong.</P>
        <P>At the latest round of the Dialogue in Beijing in October, the EU took note of the commitment of China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as soon as possible and, in that context, to reform its criminal justice system. The EU urged China to continue cooperation with, and implementation of the recommendations of, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, including the rapid abolition of the &ldquo;re-education through labour&rdquo; system. The EU expressed its deep concern over the continuing restrictions on freedom of expression in China, including on the use of the internet. The EU further expressed concern at the high number of human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists in prison and urged China not to harass or punish individuals exercising their right to freedom of expression in a peaceful manner.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1037 and 1040 together.  </P>
        <P>Under the National Archives Act, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has no involvement in determining which files should be withheld; that is entirely a matter for the authorised officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P>The Department is committed to meeting its statutory obligations in regard to its historic files under the National Archives, the Data Protection and the Freedom of Information Acts. In this regard, its annual deposit of files to the National Archives is much the largest of any Government Department and it also sponsors the &ldquo;Documents in Irish Foreign Policy&rdquo; series, published by the Royal Irish Academy.</P>
        <P>In carrying out its archival duties, the Department must nevertheless comply with the provisions of the National Archives Act governing the withholding from inspection of certain records. In this regard, it should be noted that only a small proportion of these are actually withheld.</P>
        <P>The files which are the subject of the Deputies&rsquo; questions were part of a series of consular files originally withheld from the National Archives in 1992; all of them deal with named individuals and contain personal details. They were withheld under Section 8 (4) of the National Archives Act, 1986 on the basis that (a) to make the records available for public inspection would or might constitute a breach of good faith on the ground that they contain information supplied in confidence, or (b) would or might cause distress or danger to living persons on the ground that they contain information about individuals. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the decision to withhold was certified by the authorised officer in the Department of Foreign Affairs and was consented to by an officer in the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>In September 2006 a request from the media was received to make the material available for public inspection. The relevant files were again reviewed by the authorised officer in my Department. It was concluded that there was no basis to change the original decision withholding these files. In addition, it was further determined that the files in question contained information of a personal nature about individuals, to which the provisions of the Data Protection Act, 1988 may also apply. For these reasons, the authorised officer decided to uphold the original decision taken in 1992.</P><Col N="781"/>
        <P>In handling Departmental files that are over 30 years old, I am conscious that there ought to be an appropriate balance between the need to release material that is of public and historic interest and the right of individuals to be protected from distress or danger that the release of personal information might cause. In this regard, I have now asked my officials to carry out a further review of the historic files in question. In carrying out this review, my officials will consult, as appropriate, with other relevant bodies, including the Department of the Taoiseach and the National Archives.</P>

        <Quest> if he will make recommendations to put measures in place to overcome the problems which frequently arise when Irish citizens travelling abroad for business purposes, frequently arrive at airports here without their passport. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to say that there are already effective measures in place to deal with such situations.  The Passport Office in Molesworth Street, Dublin and at South Mall in Cork provide an Emergency Service whereby members of the public, who upon arrival at the airport have mislaid their passports, whose passports have been lost or stolen or who find at the last minute that they are out of date, can have a passport issued to them that day or the following day, provided they have proof of travel. This is not an &ldquo;on demand&rdquo; service and is subject to a fee. This service operates Monday to Friday from 9.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.</P>
        <P>The Duty Officer services provided by the Passport Office were extended in June 1999 and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, David Andrews T.D., wrote to all members of the Oireachtas on 25 June of that year outlining the features of the new scheme.  The Department operates two services whereby passport facilities are provided outside of working hours (a) by the Passport Duty Officer Service in Dublin and Cork and (b) by the Diplomatic Duty Officer Service.</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) The Passport Duty Officer Service is provided on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays year round (except on Christmas Day and New Years Day). It operates from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Sundays and public holidays. During the peak travel season, April to August inclusive, the service is extended in Dublin and operates from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Fridays, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays and from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Sundays and public holidays. The Passport Duty Officer provides full facilities to persons who have mislaid their passports, whose passports have been lost or stolen or who find at the last minute that they are out of date.</P>
        <P LI="1">(b) The Department&rsquo;s Diplomatic Duty Officer, who also has other duties, continues to attend to applications for passports outside these hours but only in genuine emergencies. Genuine emergencies are (i) situations of genuine and substantial distress such as the death or funeral of a relative or a relative dying abroad; (ii) urgent business abroad, particularly where Ireland is a beneficiary; or (iii) marriage abroad or a couple going on honeymoon when one of them finds a passport to have been lost or stolen. The Diplomatic Duty Officer is not <Col N="784"/>authorised to issue passports in other circumstances.</P>
        <P FLI="0">For reasons to do with security and with the legal position of minors, the Diplomatic Duty officer is not authorised to issue passports to minors or first-time applicants outside of normal hours except in situations of genuine emergency as outlined above.  Since the introduction of the Passport Duty Officer Service, in excess of 7000 passport have been issued through this service.</P>
        <P>I wish to acknowledge the commitment and dedication of both the Passport office staff and the Diplomatic Duty Officers in providing this highly valued service to the travelling public.</P>

	<P>The Government has made the issue of collusion a constant theme of our discussions with the British Government. It is consistently raised by both the Taoiseach and myself, and in meetings at official level. As recently as last evening, the Taoiseach discussed the issue with Prime Minister Blair at their meeting in London. It has also been raised in all recent meetings which I have had with Secretary of State Hain. Given the importance of the issue, a single summit meeting on the issue does not seem the most appropriate way to proceed.</P>
        <P>The discussions with the British Government have focussed in particular on the findings of the Barron and Oireachtas Reports and, in recent days, on the deeply disturbing findings of the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s report into the circumstances surrounding the murder of Raymond McCord junior. The Government will also take into account in these discussions the Report of the MacEntee Commission of Investigation into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, scheduled to be presented on 14 February next. We will continue to press the British Government to address the serious issues to which these reports give rise, and to stress the absolute importance of ensuring that the recommendations in the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s report are implemented in full.</P>

	<P>The video the Deputy refers to was filmed by a member of a group of Irish citizens who travelled on a fact-finding visit to the Occupied Palestinian Territories in October 2006. The group was in contact with officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Representative Office in Ramallah and the Embassy in Tel Aviv during and after the visit. They have maintained contact with the Department, which is providing advice in relation to possible future visits to Israel and the Occupied Territories.</P>
        <P>The video records incidents at an Israeli Army checkpoint near Bethlehem on 13 October 2006. Officials from my Department have met with members of the group to discuss the incident, and they have viewed the video. The Government&rsquo;s concerns in relation to this particular incident have been drawn to the attention of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs by our Ambassador in Tel Aviv. More broadly, I have continued to make very clear the Government&rsquo;s strong concerns about the effects on the Palestinian population of security operations by the Israeli Army in the Occupied Territories.</P>
        <P>The Government and our EU partners have consistently called on all parties to abide by their obligations under the Quartet Roadmap and under international law. We are particularly concerned about the continued construction of the separation barrier on occupied Palestinian land, the expansion of settlements and a series of Israeli activities and policies in and around East Jerusalem which are in contravention of international law and which threaten to undermine the prospects for a negotiated two-State solution.</P>

        <P>Our Embassy in Berne, which is accredited to Algeria, has also been fully briefed on the case.

	<P>The Government has consistently been a strong supporter of the right to self-determination of the people of the territory of Western Sahara. Ireland played a prominent role in seeking a solution to the Western Sahara dispute during its term on the UN Security Council. The Government has remained closely engaged on the issue, at the United Nations and in discussions at EU level. Ireland played a leading role in working with our EU partners and all interested parties to ensure the adoption of the resolution on Western Sahara at the UN General Assembly in December 2006.</P>
        <P>We continue to monitor the human rights situation in the Western Sahara in cooperation with our EU partners, and we maintain contact on the issues involved with representatives of the Sahrawi people and with the Moroccan authorities.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to support actively the efforts of the United Nations to broker a political solution in the Western Sahara, based on the principle of self-determination. We continue to believe that the plan presented in <Col N="787"/>2003 by the former US Secretary of State, James Baker, acting as the Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary General, represents the best framework available for a negotiated settlement. The plan has been endorsed by the UN Security Council, but has not been implemented. It envisages a preparatory phase under UN supervision, leading to a referendum to determine the future of the territory. The Government strongly supports the continuing role of the UN in working to encourage the parties towards an agreement, under the Special Representative of the Secretary General, Peter Van Walsum.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very satisfied with the assurances given to us by the Bosnian authorities, including those in Medjugorje and the surrounding districts, that everything possible was done to locate the body of the person mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>A number of large scale searches were undertaken since the deceased person went missing while on a pilgrimage to Medjugorje in early September. The last such search was timed to coincide with the growing back of vegetation and the resultant much enhanced visibility for the searchers.</P>
        <P>The Hunting Clubs in the Region supported the search effort in every way possible, and indeed it was a hunter who eventually located the remains of the missing person earlier this month.</P>
        <P>Members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and of our Defence Forces on EU service in Bosnia and Herzegovina also participated actively in the searches for the deceased person.</P>
        <P>The husband of the deceased person has expressed his warm appreciation for the extensive efforts of the Department and the Embassy, both in Dublin and on the ground in Medjugorje, and for the widescale searches that were undertaken in an effort to find his wife. The Department was particularly touched that its efforts were warmly recognised from the pulpit, on behalf of the family, at the funeral.</P>

However, a total of 11 members of staff in one of my Department&rsquo;s agencies and 1 in another are currently earning not more than one euro per hour more than the minimum wage.   It should be noted that the 11 members of staff, who have recently been recruited, are at the minimum point of their pay scale. The other member of staff referred to is on the second point of his pay scale.  All will, through incremental progression, exceed the threshold mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>My Department does not have any scheme under which this group could apply for funding.  The main channel for the State&rsquo;s funding of the arts, including music, is through the Arts Council.  It is my understanding that the Arts Council is currently considering putting in place a programme of support for community music, in partnership with Local Authorities, and <Col N="797"/>it would be to this programme that projects like the one referred to in the question could look for funding.  It is not anticipated that the programme will be in place before 2008.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the completion of the Shamrock Rovers stadium in Tallaght; if it remains his position as set out in reply to an adjournment debate on 9 February 2006, that the stadium should be used primarily for soccer and that there would be considerable cost implications and further delays if the stadium had to be adjusted to cater for Gaelic games; the discussions he has had with either the FAI or the GAA with a view to resolving the current dispute; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>In supporting the provision of a soccer stadium at Tallaght, I am seeking to bring to completion a long-standing project that has been assisted under the Sports Capital Programme.  &euro;2.44m has already been provided between 2000 and 2002 towards the development of this facility. In response to approaches from South Dublin County Council, the FAI and Shamrock Rovers FC, I gave a commitment on behalf of the Government that funding would be provided towards the completion of this project as a soccer stadium and I stand over this commitment.</P>
        <P>I am advised that a pitch larger than that required for soccer cannot easily be accommodated within the present site. In order to facilitate a pitch suitable for senior Gaelic Games in the stadium, some demolition of existing building work would have to take place or alternatively, the design of the stadium would have to be adjusted and  capacity would be reduced. Either of these two paths would clearly lead to further delays and increased costs and some of the expenditure already incurred would be written off if demolition had to take place.</P>
        <P>While the stadium is scheduled for completion as a soccer facility, I wish to make it clear once again that I would have no objections to South Dublin County Council, which will manage the facility, sanctioning its use by other sporting bodies compatible with it remaining available for senior soccer fixtures. I understand that the question of underage GAA activities at the completed stadium has been raised and I would welcome such activities, again subject to the compatibility of a soccer pitch with the requirements of the sporting body in question.</P>
        <P>I have made my position clear to the GAA at both national and Dublin County Board level on more than one occasion.  I am available to meet at any stage with representatives of the Association if it will help to bring this pointless dispute <Col N="798"/>to an end but I will not countenance any dilution of my long-standing commitment to Shamrock Rovers FC.  I am deeply disappointed at the continuing intransigence being displayed by a local GAA club which is persisting with legal action to overturn a decision taken by South Dublin County Council.  It is clearly in the best interest of the harmonious development of all sports in the Tallaght area that the club in question should terminate immediately these legal proceedings.</P>

	<P>Most of the major capital projects for which my Department has responsibility are managed by the Office of Public Works or by companies or bodies established for that purpose.</P>
        <P>Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects, such as the development of the National Conference Centre, the National Theatre and the National Concert Hall, are being progressed in line with the Department of Finance &ldquo;Guidelines for the Provision of Infrastructure and Capital Investments through Public Private Partnership&rdquo; which are available on the Government PPP website &mdash; www.ppp.gov.ie.  In advancing these projects the Department relies heavily on the Office of Public Works and the National Development Finance Agency who provide the appropriate technical and financial expertise, which is supplemented by consultancy support where necessary.</P>
        <P>While I am not aware if any officers in my Department hold recognised qualifications in project management, several senior officers have taken part in project management training courses organised by my Department as part of its ongoing staff training and development programmes and many have considerable practical experience over the course of their careers in dealing with major capital projects.</P>

	<P>The current position under the Companies Acts 1963 to 2006 is that every company must appoint an auditor to examine and report on the accounts of the company unless the company comes within a class of company entitled to avail of exemption from this requirement. A number of classes of company are currently entitled to avail of such exemption, subject to certain conditions being met. Companies pursuing community or voluntary activities tend not to fall within the scope of these classes of company.</P>
        <P>Bearing in mind the role of the preparation and auditing of company accounts in providing assurance to interested stakeholders, I am not convinced that it would be in the public interest to extend further the current categories of audit exemption.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The handling, use and disposal of explosives are covered under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Extractive Industries) Regulations, 1997, the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965 and its related regulations, and the Explosives Act, 1875.</P>
        <P>The Quarries (Explosives) Regulations 1971 as amended (S.I. No. 237 of 1971), which are made under the Mines and Quarries Act 1965, make provision for the storage, care, issue, transport and use of explosives in quarries. They regulate the duties of quarry managers and other persons involved in blasting operations and in firing explosives. They prescribe the type of equipment to be used and the safety measures to be adopted in using this equipment.</P>
        <P>The Mines and Quarries Act provides that quarry managers ensure that quarrying operations are so carried on as to avoid danger from falls whether within or outside the quarry; thus the overall effect of compliance with the Act and the Regulations in protecting persons at work in a quarry would also be to ensure the safety of persons and property as a consequence.</P>
        <P>The Regulations require quarry managers, for the purpose of securing the safety of all persons when shot-firing is being carried out, to make shot-firing rules allotting to competent persons and specifying the duties to be performed by them on any occasion on which shot-firing is about to be or is being carried out.</P>
        <P>Those shot-firing rules must specify a suitable system to ensure by means of the posting of notices or sentries or otherwise that adequate warning is given to all persons within, near or approaching the danger zone that shot-firing is about to commence and must specify a suitable system to ensure that adequate signals are given for the purpose of notifying persons employed at the quarry that shot-firing has, for the time being, ceased.</P>
        <P>Under the Regulations, it is the responsibility of the shot-firer to determine the danger zone required to be created and to ensure that the warning required by the relevant shot-firing rules has been given and that no person is in the danger zone without having taken proper shelter.  The distance covered by the danger zone will depend on a number of factors, including the specification of the blast and the nature of the material being blasted, and must be determined as part of a hazard identification and risk assessment process. <Col N="806"/> However, according to advice from the Health &amp; Safety Authority, a danger zone should be as large as reasonably possible and should ensure that material from the blast is not projected beyond it.</P>
        <P>A person posted as a sentry in pursuance of shot-firing rules may not leave the place to which he or she is posted until signals have been given or until directed to leave that place by the person who posted him or her there.</P>
        <P>Quarry managers are required to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that sufficient and suitable shelters are provided for the use of the persons employed at quarries who are within the danger zone likely to be created when shots are fired.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Health and Safety Authority advises that, if during the course of an inspection of the blasted area, or at some later date, it is discovered that materials were projected beyond the defined danger zone for a blast and that persons, either employed at the quarry or other persons who may be affected, were placed at risk of injury then the details must be reported to the Authority as a specified &ldquo;dangerous occurrence&rdquo;. As soon as is reasonably practicable, the explosives supervisor must investigate the cause of such projection of fly rock and ensure that all measures are taken to prevent recurrence at subsequent blasts.</P>
        <P>The shotfiring rules referred to are intended to ensure that shotfiring operations at the quarry take place without endangering persons. They should take proper account of local circumstances, for example any risk of accidental initiation. The determination of the danger zone likely to be created by the firing of each shot, evacuation of the danger zone and the provision of effective shelters when a shot is tested or fired are all essential elements of the shotfiring rules. Furthermore, shotfiring and related activities should only be undertaken by competent persons.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s merchandise exports to Taiwan for 2005 were &euro;333million and imports were &euro;921million. Full year figures for 2006 are not yet available, but for the 10 months January &mdash; October, merchandise exports were &euro;252million and imports were &euro;822m.  Statistics for services trade are not as well developed, but in 2004, the latest year for which data has been published, our services exports to Taiwan came to &euro;297m but the <Col N="807"/>figure for service imports for that year is not available.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that Taiwan is a significant market for Irish exporters and, through Enterprise Ireland, the Government is facilitating developing our trade links there. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s work in relation to the Taiwan market is handled by their office in Hong Kong and the agency  also uses the resources of a local consultant based in Taipei, when and as required. There are no plans to open an office in Taiwan in the immediate future.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to bring Taiwanese and Irish business communities into more regular contact, introducing Irish companies to export opportunities in Taiwan and raising the awareness of Ireland among the Taiwanese business community. The agency is proactively developing the sectors where clear opportunities have been identified for its Irish client base such as the education and IT sectors.</P>
        <P>The Irish Education Services sector will again visit Taiwan this year when Enterprise Ireland will participate at a major Education fair in Taipei in November. It is hoped that a number of the Irish Universities and Colleges will attend.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland will continue to arrange individual itineraries for Irish companies interested in exploring opportunities in Taiwan &mdash; companies are assisted with setting up itineraries, logistics, sourcing interpreters, general business advice, introductions to local experts and partners and related issues.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> if he will introduce measures to properly regulate professional services to allow for greater transparency in pricing, better representation of consumer interests where a conflict of interest exists and tougher fines compensation from service providers that fail to meet their responsibilities; and <Col N="808"/>if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would advise the Deputy that the statutory regulation of specific professional services is the responsibility of a number of different Government Departments and Agencies. For example the Deputy will be aware that the regulation of medical practitioners is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children and the regulation of financial services is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and the Financial Regulator. The Deputy will appreciate that the activities of the various regulatory agencies are not the responsibility of my Department.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, all traders, including those providing professional services, are subject to consumer law. Specifically traders have particular obligations in relation to the information that they give to consumers and also in relation to the nature and quality of goods and services that they sell to consumers. Consumer law obliges that goods offered for sale must be of merchantable quality and that in the case of services, suppliers must have the necessary skill to render the service and that the service is supplied with due skill, care and diligence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Consumer Protection Bill 2007, which will be published in the next few days, in addition to establishing the new National Consumer Agency on a statutory footing, also includes a number of specific provisions strengthening the protections afforded consumers in their day-to-day transactions with traders, including in relation to the provision of transparent information on pricing. The Bill contains a general prohibition on unfair, misleading or aggressive practices. The Bill further prohibits traders from engaging in over 30 specific practices, which are forbidden in all circumstances. The type of practices prohibited by the Bill are:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Persistent cold calling of customers</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Pyramid selling</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Prize draw scams</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Making false claims in relation to a product or service</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Traders who engage in prohibited practices are liable on conviction to significant fines and terms of imprisonment. The Bill provides the National Consumer Agency with a number of additional enforcement options. For example, the Bill provides that the Agency may, where it considers it appropriate, issue fixed payment notices and compliance notices to errant traders. The Bill also provides that the Agency and individual consumers can seek injunctions to stop traders from engaging in prohibited practices. The Agency will be permitted under the Bill to seek compensation orders before the courts on behalf of consumers <Col N="809"/>who have suffered as a result of a trader engaging in a prohibited practice.</P>
        <P>The Bill will also require the new National Consumer Agency to enter into co-operation agreements with certain prescribed bodies, including other sectoral regulators, with a view to avoiding duplication of activities and guaranteeing effective protection of consumer welfare.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the Consumer Protection Bill will provide significant additional protections for consumers in their day-to day transactions with traders, including traders providing professional services and that the new National Consumer Agency will have all the necessary powers to ensure that Irish consumers enjoy the highest level of protection.</P>

        <P>In addition, the Bar Council of Ireland has recently introduced a Small Claims Arbitration System, on a trial basis, for claims up to &euro;7,500, which is aimed at reducing the administration costs for all parties involved. The cost of the arbitrator is limited to &euro;750. This scheme allows businesses to claim small amounts, which might otherwise be written off, because of the time and costs associated with court proceedings.  Under the scheme, the decision of an arbitrator, selected and agreed by both sides from a trained pool of barristers, is binding.</P>
        <P>My Department is responsible for the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 388 of 2002).

	<P>As advised in my reply to the Deputy on 14th December 2006, my Department does not have any function or responsibility in relation to Regtel. Regtel was not set up by statute and does not as far as I am aware derive any regulatory role on foot of any statute. I am not in a position to advise the Deputy as to how the Company is funded or as to how it should most appropriately be described.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> if the EU will offer least developed countries a round for free under WTO talks; if the EU is making trade liberalisation requests of LDCs under the EPA negotiations; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 2001, the EU provides duty and quota free access for all products from least developed countries.  At the WTO Ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in December, 2005, it was agreed that all products exported by least developed countries into developed countries would receive this treatment.</P>
        <P>As provided for in the Cotonou Agreement of 2000, Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) are trade agreements under negotiation between the EU and the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of states.  They seek to replace current unilateral trade preferences into the EU under the Lom&eacute; Conventions, which are in contravention of World Trade Organisation rules.  They are intended to foster the gradual and smooth integration of ACP states into the world economy, which will promote sustainable development and contribute to poverty eradication.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With this objective in mind, the EPAs comprise a package of measures encompassing trade liberalisation, regional integration, development assistance and co-ordination of new rules.  The EPAs will require a degree of trade liberalisation, including LDCs, but Article 37.7 of the Cotonou Agreement states that negotiations shall take account of the level of development and the socio-economic impact of trade measures on ACP countries and their capacity to adapt and adjust their economies to the liberalisation process.  It outlines that negotiations will be as flexible as possible in establishing the duration of a sufficient transitional period, the final product coverage, taking into account sensitive sectors and the degree of asymmetry in terms of the timetable for tariff dismantlement, while remaining in <Col N="814"/>conformity with WTO rules then prevailing.  I have been working closely with my colleague Conor Lenihan, Minister for Development Cooperation and Human Rights to monitor progress on these and other Cotonou commitments as the negotiations proceed and we have been actively raising issues on behalf of LDCs and the other ACP countries with a view to supporting a pro-development outcome to this process.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that if LDCs ultimately decide not to opt for the EPA package offering security, rules, regional integration, larger markets and solidarity with regional neighbours it will be open to them to retain their current duty and quota free access to the EU.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1104, 1114 and 1118 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware that Junior Achievement Ireland made a presentation to the Joint Oireachtas <Col N="816"/>Committee on Enterprise and Small Business in June 2006 outlining the range of enterprise education activities in which the group has been involved.  I should also inform the Deputy that I met with Ms. Della Clancy, Executive Director of Junior Achievement Ireland in April, 2006 at which she outlined the work and objectives of the organisation.</P>
        <P>Junior Achievement Ireland is already in receipt of funding from my Department.  In 2006, the organisation was paid &euro;70,000 under my Department&rsquo;s &ldquo;Discover Science and Engineering Awareness Programme&rdquo;.  Another &euro;20,000 has been approved for payment this year while a further application for funding from Junior Achievement for its Science Challenge 2007 initiative is currently under consideration.</P>
        <P>State funding for enterprise promotion at all levels is presently channelled through the relevant State Agencies.  The County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), funded by my Department, already have a well established role in the delivery of a wide range of enterprise education initiatives as part of their role in promoting and developing indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulating economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware the Report of the Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) acknowledged the importance of education and training in contributing to the future strong economic development of Ireland.  This was subsequently reiterated in the Report of the Small Business Forum.  In this context, the present arrangements for the delivery of enterprise education are currently being reviewed.  The role of Junior Achievement Ireland will be borne in mind in this context.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been no developments in this case since my response to the Deputy&rsquo;s previous question.  The Department referred the file in this case to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office in October 2005 to institute legal proceedings against the employer.  The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office in turn referred the file to the State Solicitor for the area in which the employer concerned normally resides.</P>
        <P>As explained in my previous response the Department has no function in relation to the operation of the Chief State Solicitors&rsquo; Office or in the services provided by the State Solicitors.  The Department has, however, maintained contact with the Chief State Solicitors&rsquo; Office and the relevant State Solicitor to monitor progress and developments.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances I cannot accept the Deputy&rsquo;s assertion that the Department has been ineffectual in this case.  Indeed, in 2006, my Department&rsquo;s Enforcement Unit successfully concluded over 60 enforcement cases and collected associated arrears of almost &euro;200,000.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am, however, aware that difficulties arise in certain cases in relation to the enforcement of determinations of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court.  Indeed there is widespread recognition that compliance with legal requirements needs to be enhanced and underpinned by adequate enforcement.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the commitment by the parties in Towards 2016, a New Compliance Model is being developed which seeks to maximise the effectiveness of the substantially increased compliance effort and simplify the adjudication and redress mechanisms available in the employment rights area.  The general principles of the new compliance model will be that matters be resolved at the level of the workplace where possible; that interactions between employers and employees and trade union representatives, as appropriate, be supported by the enhanced employment rights promotional and educational efforts directed at them; and that initiation and ownership of cases will rest with the complainant, insofar as possible.</P>
        <P>The legislative provisions necessary to provide for this and other commitments agreed in Towards 2016, in the area of employment rights, are currently being considered by the Department.</P>

        <P>The determination of any payments due to creditors of IFI is a matter solely for the liquidator.

At this stage, the assets of the company have all been realised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is understood that all claims from secured and preferential creditors have been paid at this stage, while interim payments which amounted to 37.5% of their claims was made to unsecured creditors.  I understand that it is hoped to resolve the small number of outstanding issues within a few months.  At that stage, the liquidator will be in a position to determine the extent of any further dividends to unsecured creditors.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is committed to the development of County Carlow and is actively promoting Carlow Town for new foreign investment in international services and high value manufacturing activities.</P>
        <P>IDA&rsquo;s strategy for Carlow is to market the town&rsquo;s strategic location close to Dublin which provides all of the advantages of an urban location along with the additional advantages of a readily available pool of skilled workers and excellent quality of life. Carlow&rsquo;s two third level colleges, the Institute of Technology Carlow and St. Patrick&rsquo;s College are critical to ensuring that Carlow and the region has a supply of highly qualified graduates and continues to develop edu<Col N="822"/>cational and research capabilities to support existing and new investment.</P>
        <P>IT Carlow has been very proactive in terms of establishing links with industry in the region.  For example, it has developed a customised funds administration module as part of a Bachelor of Business Studies course in close co-operation with PFPC in Wexford.  This course is delivered on site at its outreach campus in Wexford.  This is the kind of relationship that IDA is strongly encouraging in third level institutes in the region.</P>
        <P>The continued commitment by IDA Ireland to Carlow is evidenced by the development of the Flagship Business and Technology Park on the Dublin road, an investment of almost &euro;11.5m to date.  The Technology Park is part of a national network of high specification business parks throughout Ireland developed by IDA that will enhance the attractiveness of the gateways, hubs and county towns for overseas investment.  A 17,600 sq ft Advance Office Building on the Technology Park with 100% expansion capability was completed in November 2005.</P>
        <P>IDA is actively marketing the building and park through its network of overseas offices and has hosted a number of prospective investor visits to Carlow town.  The Agency continues to actively engage with potential investors in co-operation with Carlow County Council, IT Carlow and Carlow Chamber of Commerce.  While these visits have not yet resulted in a project for Carlow, IDA continues to promote the town and the Technology Park to potential investors, particularly in the international services and life sciences sectors.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is actively working with the existing overseas companies in Carlow.  IDA is also working closely with local groups, utility providers and other agencies to ensure the County has the appropriate infrastructure to enable these companies to grow and develop and to make the area sufficiently attractive for new investment projects.</P>

        <QRef>[2821/07]</QRef><Col N="825"/>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that the Health Services Executive (HSE) is concerned that through its negotiations on the subject of professional fees with representative bodies, such the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU), that it may be in breach of the Competition Act 2002.</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s concerns appear to relate to its interpretation and application of the Competition Act, 2002, and in particular Section 4 of that Act which prohibits anti-competitive practices, such as price fixing, by &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo;.  An &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; is defined in the Act as &ldquo;a person being an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged for gain in the production, supply, or distribution of goods or the provision of a service&rdquo;.  This definition has been in use in Irish competition law for some time and is supported by EU case law.</P>
        <P>If the HSE is concerned that, through its negotiations with the IPU, it could be in breach of the Competition Act, it is a matter for the HSE to decide how to act so as to comply with the provisions of the Act.  Under the 2002 Act, the Competition Authority is the independent statutory body responsible for enforcing competition law.  While the Authority investigates and prosecutes breaches of the 2002 Act, it does not issue advice or opinions on individual cases which may arise under the Act.  Occasionally and, in accordance with its mandate under section 30(1)(d) of Act, the Authority issues guidance of a general nature on how the Act may be complied with.  For example, I understand the Authority recently issued guidelines in respect of collective negotiations relating to the setting of medical fees.</P>
        <P>If the IPU disputes the HSE&rsquo;s interpretation of the Competition Act, it is open to that body to seek legal advice on the matter.  Section 4(5) of the 2002 Act provides a defence to the prohibition on price-fixing contained in section 4(1).  The IPU could consider making a submission to the Competition Authority that the defence provided for by section 4(5) applies in this instance.  However, in a somewhat similar case, the Authority has previously found that self-employed persons are to be classed as &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; for the purposes of the 2002 Act, that collectively bargained agreements concluded by trade unions on behalf of such persons are prohibited agreements under section 4 and that the section 4(5) defence did not apply in that instance.</P>
        <P>In relation to that case, the Competition Authority view was, that while it was perfectly legal for a trade union to represent employees in collective bargaining with their employers, its trade union mantle could not exempt its conduct when it acts as a trade association for self-employed contractors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In considering the question of whether an exemption from competition law should be provided for self-employed individuals, the consequences of such an exemption are significant.  It <Col N="826"/>would mean that almost any group of self employed contractors, such as barristers, publicans, doctors, by coming together, adding &ldquo;union&rdquo; to their name and getting a negotiating licence, could circumvent the protections afforded to consumers by the Oireachtas in the Competition Act.  Consequently, I have no plans to amend the Competition Act to address this issue.</P>
        <P>In any event, the decision the Deputy refers to is a decision of the HSE and as that body falls within the remit of the Minister for Health and Children, I have no function in this matter.</P>

	<P>The current law on pyramid selling is the Pyramid Selling Act, 1980.  The Act defines pyramid schemes and makes it an offence to induce anyone to become a member of such a scheme.</P>
        <P>This law will, however, be updated significantly by the provisions of the new Consumer Protection Bill, 2007 which will be debated in the Oireachtas over coming weeks.  This Bill will establish the new National Consumer Agency as well as transposing the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (Directive 2005/29/EC).  The Bill contains a list of prohibited practices including that of &ldquo;establishing, operating or promoting a pyramid scheme&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Bill redefines pyramid schemes and makes it an offence to promote or participate in a scheme.  The offence is punishable by fines of up to &euro;150,000 or imprisonment for a period up to 5 years.  Furthermore, the National Consumer Agency or a public body prescribed for the purpose or a private individual can apply to the Courts for an order to prohibit a trader or a person from engaging in pyramid schemes.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the new legislation will provide a better protection for the consumer against this type of activity.</P>

	<P>While I do not have any direct responsibility for this matter I understand that the question refers to a presentation given by the Consumer Director of the Financial Regulator to its Consumer Panel in November 2005. The presentation featured a table showing Herfindahl-Hirschman indices in key segments in the Banking and Insurance industries. The Herfindahl-Hirschman indices (HHI) are a measure of the size of different firms in relationship to their industry and are an indicator of the amount of competition among them. The Herfindahl-Hirschman indices are calculated by squaring the market share of each participant in a market and then summing the results. The higher the HH number, the more concentrated is market power. Increases in the index occur as the number of competitors in a market decreases and/or the disparity in size between firms increases.</P>
        <P>I should firstly point out that the latest data in the table concerned relates to 2004. I agree that the concentration indices displayed in the table do show that the credit card market in Ireland <Col N="828"/>is concentrated. However, the overall trend since 2000 shows that the market has become less concentrated and since the table was published a number of significant new entrants have also entered the Irish credit card market thereby further reducing concentration in the market-place. This trend is reflected in a further decrease in the HHI in 2005 (Annual Report of Financial Regulator 2005).</P>
        <P>The Government firmly believes that a competitive credit card market benefits consumers through increased choice, innovative products, lower interest rates and charges and better service. Regulation of the financial services industry is, of course, primarily a matter for the Minister for Finance and the Financial Regulator.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> his views on whether it is time for his Department and for Government to address the issue of rising energy costs for industry here in view of the fact that since 2001 there has been a cumulative price increase of over 100% in electricity and 170% in gas and acknowledging that these increases cannot be passed on in an ever increasing market place; the options available for companies based here who hope to continue manufacturing despite the high costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Energy cost competitiveness is a vital aspect of national competitiveness. Global energy markets have seen sustained price increases in recent years and these have led to similar increases to energy users in free market economies. No consumer, whether industrial, commercial or personal is immune from the impact of higher oil, gas and electricity prices as a result of price changes on international markets. With 80% of our natural gas requirements and all our oil needs currently imported we are price takers in the market. The extent to which energy production and distribution costs are passed on to individual users is the function under legislation of the independent Commission for Energy Regulation.</P>
        <P>My colleague the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources published a Green Paper on Energy in October 2006, setting out the three pillars of energy policy as being supply, sustainability and competitiveness. This, along with the forthcoming White Paper on Energy will help address energy cost developments faced by enterprise. Furthermore, considerable progress has been made in developing the all island electricity market that will provide a larger and more attractive market for new generating operators. The Single Electricity Market (SEM) will promote competition and with <Col N="829"/>strengthened interconnectivity contribute to a more competitive energy regime on the island.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Enterprise Ireland (EI) operates the Competitiveness Improvement Programme (CIP) to help indigenous firms improve productivity. Energy projects may be supported under this initiative for EI clients on the CIP. Allied to this Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), through extensive funding by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, has been vigorously promoting and advising on energy efficiency through a range of programmes over the last number of years. It now has a strengthened and better resourced role in advising all energy users on the potential for conservation and efficiency measures to offset higher energy costs. SEI is anxious to provide its skills and experience to firms, particularly in the manufacturing sector, to find new ways to limit their energy costs and become more competitive in energy use. In addition, the recently announced National Development Plan will provide &euro;270 million for sustainable energy initiatives as well as &euro;149 million for energy research to help mitigate the long term impact of higher energy costs and improve security of supply.</P>
        <P>The Government has been active in other areas. Incentives to the renewable energy sector over the past number of years are helping promote and expand indigenous energy sources. We have more than doubled the renewable generating capacity in the past two years and are now well on target towards having 15% of the electricity we consume coming from renewable sources by 2010. By the end of 2006 a further 55 new renewable powered electricity generating plants were approved for support under the Government&rsquo;s new Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff Programme.</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to my participation on the recent trade Mission led by An Taoiseach, to the Gulf region &mdash; Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates &mdash; earlier this month.  The Gulf region is not, in fact, an area to which Irish jobs relocate, this issue mainly arises in relation to some far eastern countries, principally China.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s industrial policy concentrates on building up higher technology industry <Col N="830"/>and the knowledge economy.   Ireland&rsquo;s comparative advantage has therefore evolved to activities based on the generation and exploitation of knowledge based companies.  In circumstances where there is a more attractive low cost environment abroad, it will inevitably attract some companies that are unable to produce in the high-wage environment of modern industrial economies.  Where actual relocation has occurred to date, it should be noted that this has been largely limited to relatively low-technology, labour-intensive activities &mdash; those least suited to the economy that Ireland has become.</P>
        <P>The continuing structural transformation of our economy is inevitable and indeed essential.  The significant growth in trade in recent years has fundamentally contributed to our economic success and we are now one of the most open economies in the world.  We are therefore a very strong supporter of the World Trade Organisation process to open up markets and we obviously support the strengthening of the multilateral trading systems and a further reduction in barriers to trade in goods and service.  This policy has brought huge benefits to the Irish economy and while there are some inevitable difficulties in relation to sectors and jobs moving to lower wage economies in Asia, the overall process has, on balance, been hugely beneficial to Ireland.  There is an inexorable and unstoppable trend toward more and more globalization of production and Ireland has to seize the opportunities this presents, despite the inevitable difficulties it generates in some areas.</P>
        <P>To help address some aspects of this issue, Enterprise Ireland client companies are offered a range of supports of strategic importance as alternatives to outsourcing, including, automation, upskilling and product and process development.  These initiatives assist companies to increase their exports, sales and employment, and develop a more competitive and self-sufficient industrial structure.</P>

        <Quest> the reason State level of redundancy was never awarded in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Dublin in view of the fact that all other employees of the firm in question received their payment excluding the person due to the fact that they were on sick benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>There is no record of a redundancy claim having been received in this Department in the respect of the person concerned. Illness alone is not a valid reason for redundancy.  However, if a redundancy situation obtains in the employment, it would be in order for the employer to make the person concerned redundant, although he is on sickness benefit.  The person concerned should approach his employer for the appropriate statutory redundancy lump sum payment.</P>
        <P>On making the person concerned redundant, it is up to the employer to pay the statutory payment in the first instance.  If the employer is unable to pay the statutory amount but gives the employee the necessary documentation to claim the statutory lump sum from the Social Insurance Fund (completed RP50 Form) then the employee can be paid direct from the &lsquo;Fund&rsquo; on foot of the form RP50.</P>
        <P>If the employer fails to give the necessary form to claim the lump sum, then it is open to the employee to bring a claim against his former employer before the Employment Appeals Tribunal for a decision in the matter.  If the Tribunal decides in favour of the employee, then he can be paid his statutory lump sum out of the Social Insurance Fund on foot of the Tribunal order.</P>
        <P>Form T-1A should be used for bringing a claim before the Tribunal.  A copy of the form is available on the Tribunal&rsquo;s website at <i>www.eatribunel.ie</i> or on request from this Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1138 and 1140      together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">According to figures supplied by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland there were a total of 331 job gains and 240 losses in companies supported by the industrial development agencies in Mayo in 2006.  A breakdown of these figures is supplied in the following table. In addition there were 110 net job gains in the micro enterprise sector supported by Mayo County Enterprise Board.</P>
        <P>Specifically with regard to IDA Ireland activity in 2006, there were 19 IDA Ireland grant assisted companies employing 2,973 permanent positions and 441 contract positions in County Mayo.  Within this period there were 37 new jobs and 122 job losses.  As information on job gains and losses at company level is provided on a confidential basis it is not possible to provided details of job gains and losses at company level.</P>
        <P>Job creation and job losses are a feature of economic development in all countries as various sectors expand and contract in response to market demand for goods and services, competitive forces, restructuring and technological change.  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s current sectoral emphasis for Mayo is on attracting new knowledge intensive projects in the Medical Technologies, Life Sciences, Information Communications and Technology and International Services sectors.</P>
        <P>A central goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development.  The National Spatial Strategy provides a framework for achievement of this goal through the prioritization of development and investment in the gateway and hub locations.  On this basis, IDA Ireland seeks to attract Foreign Direct Investment into the gateway and hubs, as well as a small number of additional locations, throughout the West.  In relation to Mayo, the Agency is actively promoting the linked hubs of Ballina and Castlebar for additional overseas investment and jobs.</P>
        <P>To enhance the attractiveness of the county for new investment, IDA Ireland is presently developing a 37 acre world class Business &amp; Technology Park in Westport.  The Agency has <Col N="833"/>had extensive discussion with Mayo County Council regarding the provision of a new Business &amp; Technology Park on the Sligo Road in Ballina, and has obtained planning permission for the construction of a 2,000 sq metre Advance Technology Building and three office buildings from Mayo County Council for the IDA Business &amp; Technology Park in Castlebar.</P>

	<P>During the period in question, there were five closures / major job loss announcements in agency-assisted companies in Youghal involving over 700 jobs.  Earlier this month, a further agency-assisted firm in Fermoy announced its intention to close its operation with the loss of 253 jobs.  However, the most recent Live Register figures for Fermoy and Youghal show increases of less than 100 people in each town as against the figures in August, 2002. </P>
        <P>Overall, from 2000 to 2005, I am aware that employment in agency-supported enterprises in Co. Cork increased from 37,898 to 39,658 giving a net gain of 1,760 jobs.  Foreign-owned firms accounted for 986 of these gains and indigenous firms accounted for 774.</P>
        <P>The Industrial Development agencies are promoting Fermoy, Youghal and the greater Cork region for industrial development.  Fermoy&rsquo;s attractiveness has been greatly enhanced by the opening of the bypass which has improved accessibility to Cork city and its airport.  Youghal is marketed as part of the broader East Cork area which includes Little Island and Carrigtwohill among others.  In the last two years alone, there have been a large number of project and job announcements  for Co. Cork.  The recent Amgen announcement of 1,100 new jobs at an &euro;820m facility in Carrigtwohill is of particular importance, being a major global project that has chosen Cork as its development location.</P>
        <P>In addition, North Cork Enterprise Board and South Cork Enterprise Board have been very active in Fermoy and Youghal respectively.  Activities in Fermoy include business development programmes and start your own business programmes.  South Cork is involved in the Youghal Socio Economic Group which is developing a Strategic Plan for the town and surrounding area.</P>
        <P>Finally, the full services of the Industrial Training agency F&Aacute;S are of course available to all workers who wish to avail of the agency&rsquo;s services.

        <P FLI="0">The corresponding expenditure rate for F&Aacute;S programmes for people with disabilities in 2005 was 91.21%.  The increase in take-up last year reflects both political and agency determination to better publicise information and more actively promote State supports to advance training and employment opportunities for this cohort of workers.  A recent example of this activity took place last month when the organisation entitled People with Disabilities Ireland, working in cooperation with F&Aacute;S, organised a series of lunchtime conferences in 18 locations throughout the country &mdash; again with the objective of raising awareness amongst employers and so positively promoting the employment of a greater number of people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>As the success of publicly funded interventions to improve the labour market prospects of people with disabilities, such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme, is largely dependent on the extent to which employers are aware of and avail of the employment incentives that they provide, such promotion and publicity will continue to be indispensable also in the future.</P>
        <P>The Consultative Forum on the Employment Strategy, which is being established in line with provisions of my Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan for People with Disabilities, will add a significant and representative new dimension to this work.</P>
        <P>Finally, the review of the Wage Subsidy Scheme will be finalised in the course of this year.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Since 2002, twenty-five officers in my Department have attended training courses in project management which were funded from the Department&rsquo;s training budget.  These courses were organised to enhance the competencies of the officers concerned and stem from discussions with their managers through the annual Performance Management and Development System (PMDS).  The training provided enhanced officers&rsquo; competencies to manage projects relating to the business activities of individual Units such as IT, HR and e commerce.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s Training and Development Strategy 2006-2008 recognises the need to enhance competency development so that staff can continue to carry out their business objectives and meet the future challenges facing the modern civil service over the coming years.  In accordance with this Strategy, further training in project management will be provided in response to identified needs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1144 and 1191 together.</P>
        <P>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a social assistance payment paid to people who are providing full time care and attention to a person who needs such care.  In order to qualify for the payment the person being cared for must need continuous supervision and frequent help throughout the day with their personal needs such as dressing, eating and drinking to continuous supervision to avoid danger to themselves and full time care and attention for at least 12 months.  A carer may engage in employment, self-employment, education or training outside their home for up to 15 hours per <Col N="837"/>week and still be considered to be providing full time care and attention.</P>
        <P>In line with other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to the carer&rsquo;s allowance so as to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.  This means test has been eased significantly over the years.  Following Budget 2006, the earnings disregard for a couple has been set at &euro;580 per week which is equivalent to gross average industrial earnings.  As a result of further improvements which I announced in the Budget 2007 this disregard will increase to &euro;640 per week for a couple from April 2007.</P>
        <P>When this increase is in place a couple with two children will be able to earn up to &euro;36,240 per year and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.  This measure exceeds the commitment in Towards 2016 to ensure that those on average industrial earnings can continue to qualify for a full carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>In addition, I have increased the rates of carer&rsquo;s allowance to &euro;200 per week for those aged under 66 and to &euro;218 per week for those aged over 66.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care regardless of their income.  Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding Jobseeker&rsquo;s assistance and benefit, are entitled to this payment subject to meeting the full time care condition.  From June 2007 the level of the grant will increase by &euro;300 per year to &euro;1,500 per year in respect of each person being cared for.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that complete abolition of the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance would cost over &euro;140 million in a full year.  The view of some support organisations is that if this level of resources were available, it would be more beneficial to carers if it were invested in further increases to carers allowance and in the type of community care services which would support them in their caring role.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and as a general rule only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual.  Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.  I am aware that this has been a cause of particular concern to people in receipt of a social welfare payment when they become carers.</P>
        <P>For that reason I was very pleased to introduce fundamental structural reforms in this area in Budget 2007.  Under new arrangements which will come into effect in September 2007 people in receipt of certain social welfare payments other than carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit who are providing someone with full time care and attention will be able to retain their main payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be equivalent to a half <Col N="838"/>rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Details as to how this arrangement will operate are currently being finalized and will be set out in legislation shortly.</P>
        <P>Towards 2016 commits the Government to continuing to review the scope for further development of the carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant.  I am committed to working for, and with, carers to deliver increased benefits, supports, and services for them and their families.  The improvements for carers which I announced in Budget 2007 are further evidence of this commitment.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1145 and 1156 together.</P>
        <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.  These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  The vast majority of private contractors providing services under the scheme operate in rural areas.</P>
        <P>I am always willing to consider applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.  However, while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not in a position to provide transport services where none currently exist or to compel operators to participate in the scheme.</P>
        <P>Various alternatives to the existing system, including the use of vouchers, have been examined.  A voucher type system, however, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be extremely difficult to administer, open to abuse and unlikely to be sufficient to afford an acceptable amount of travel.</P>
        <P>The issue of access to public transport in rural areas is being addressed at present through the Rural Transport Initiative, which is being managed by Pobal, formerly Area Development Management (ADM) on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Transport.  My Department contributed &euro;500,000 to the initiative in 2004, &euro;750,000 <Col N="839"/>in 2005 and &euro;850,000 in 2006, to ensure that free travel pass holders continue to have access to community based transport services.</P>
        <P>I will continue to review the operation of the free travel scheme with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.</P>

        <P>The Office of Public Works (OPW) is charged with securing accommodation in Carrick-on- Shannon for this Department under the decentralisation programme.  Following an examination of the availability of accommodation in Carrick-on-Shannon, it was decided that a building under construction would provide the most suitable solution in the short-term and would allow the Department progress its decentralisation programme.  The construction of the building is now complete and the fit-out is underway and is on schedule for occupation in March 2007. The transfer of staff will commence immediately thereafter.</P>
        <P>The most recent progress report from the Decentralisation Implementation Group indicates that this building will provide 186 accommodation spaces.  Initially, it is proposed to transfer the following posts to Carrick-on-Shannon; 3 Principal Officers, 10 Assistant Principal Officers, 16 Higher Executive Officers, 22 Executive Officers, 7 Staff Officers, 66 Clerical Officers and 3 Service Officers</P>
        <P>According to figures received from the Central Application Facility (CAF), through which all applications for decentralisation locations must be submitted, 273 applicants applied for Carrick-on-Shannon before the priority applicant date of 7 September 2004.  Since this date, there have been 23 new applications and 14 applicants have changed their application to record Carrick-on-Shannon as their first preference location.  The 273 priority applicants include 3 Principal <Col N="840"/>Officers, 7 Assistant Principal Officers, 19 Higher Executive Officers, 1 Administrative Officer, 50 Executive Officers, 22 Staff Officers, 166 Clerical Officers and 5 at various other grades.</P>
        <P>The Department is committed to completing the programme in Carrick-on-Shannon and will review the position when the initial moves have taken place.</P>

	<P>If a recipient of a social welfare or Health Service Executive (HSE) payment has exceptional heating costs due to ill health, infirmity or a medical condition which he/she is unable to meet out of household income, it is open to him/her to apply to the local community welfare officer for a special heating supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  In addition, legislation also provides for a single payment &mdash; known as an exceptional needs payment &mdash; to be made to help meet essential, once-off exceptional expenditure.  Both types of payment are subject to a means test.</P>
        <P>The Southern Area HSE has advised that the person concerned initially applied for a heating supplement in February 2005.  The application was refused in February 2005 and subsequently on appeal in July 2005 because the household income is considered adequate to meet their needs in this case.</P>
        <P>The Southern Area HSE Executive has advised that the person concerned re-applied for a heating supplement in September 2006.  The application was refused in September 2006.  The person concerned was advised of his right to appeal and was requested to provide any additional details of his exceptional heating needs.  The <Col N="841"/>Executive has advised that the decision of the community welfare was upheld by the HSE Appeals Office in November 2006.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Executive has written to the person concerned advising of entitlements under the supplementary welfare scheme.  It is open to the person concerned to again make application for a supplement if their circumstances have changed since they last applied.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1148, 1185 and 1186 together.</P>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, which is administered by the Community Welfare Division of the Health Service Executive (HSE), is designed to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.  Under the legislation governing the scheme, the Health Service Executive (HSE) may make an exceptional needs payment to people on social welfare or health board payments.  This is a once-off payment to meet an unforeseen or special need that cannot be met from a person&rsquo;s basic income.</P>
        <P>Assistance in the form of an Urgent Needs Payment (UNP) can be also made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA, to assist, for example in cases of flood damage, with immediate needs, such as food, clothing, fuel, household goods and perhaps shelter.  Assistance can be provided in cash or in kind.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s role in supporting the response to the recent flooding will primarily involve supporting the community welfare service in the provision of ENP and UNP funding in the <Col N="842"/>short term and other supports where applicable to cater for the long term effects of the flooding.  Any support given will relate to damage to a person&rsquo;s home or loss of essential items. It will not extend to business or commercial losses.</P>
        <P>My Department, working through the HSE, has a role in providing immediate humanitarian aid in response to serious flooding incidents. It has no role in providing compensation for losses arising from such incidents.  Local community welfare officers are available to provide assistance on an individual basis where that is warranted.  If any person is experiencing hardship as a result of the recent flooding, they should contact their local Community Welfare Officer in the first instance.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a rent supplement to assist eligible people who are unable to provide for their immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The Executive can also provide assistance with rent deposits to enable people to secure private rented accommodation.</P>
        <P>In order to qualify for a rent supplement a person must satisfy a number of conditions including a means test and a habitual residence condition.  The Executive must also satisfy itself that the applicant has a genuine accommodation need, that the property being rented is suitable to those needs and that a bona fide tenancy exists between the applicant and their landlord.</P>
        <P>Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent has an income equal to the SWA basic weekly payment rate, less &euro;13.  This &euro;13 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
        <P>In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants are required to contribute any assessable means which they have in excess of the appropriate SWA rate.</P>
        <P>As there are a number of factors which need to be considered by the Executive when determining entitlement for assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, it is not possible to say whether the person in question would qualify for assistance.  Should the person in <Col N="843"/>question decide to move to this country she should contact the Executive in the area in which they intend to live who will advise them in relation to any possible entitlements.</P>

	<P>Any person who is receiving a Social Welfare or Health Service Executive payment who has been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition, and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  </P>
        <P>The amount of diet supplement payable in individual cases is calculated to ensure that a single person spends a maximum of one-third of their income on food.  If the cost of their diet is more than one-third of their income, then a diet supplement will be paid.</P>
        <P>The basis for calculating the amount of diet supplement remained unchanged between 1996 and 2004.  In January 2004 the diet supplement scheme was restructured to take account of increases in both social welfare payment rates and the rate of food inflation since 1996.  In April 2006, revised regulations on diet supplements came into effect.  These regulations reflect the findings of the report of the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute (INDI), published in January 2006 and the objective that all social welfare recipients, including those with special dietary needs, should be able to purchase an appropriate diet at a cost of no more than one-third of their income or one-sixth in the case of a couple.</P>
        <P>The diet report priced the cost of diets in a variety of outlets from the cheapest &mdash; large discount stores &mdash; to the more expensive local convenience stores.  The reference cost of diets prescribed in regulations were set at the highest prices surveyed &mdash; those at convenience stores &mdash; in order to protect the position of those who, for whatever reason, are not in a position to shop around.</P>
        <P>The Regulations prescribed a new range of specialised diets, as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. Low-lactose, milk-free, which costs &euro;62.27 per week </P>
       <P LI="1">2. Gluten-free, which costs &euro;65.27 per week</P>
        <P LI="1">3. High-protein, high calorie which costs &euro;68.27 per week and</P>
        <P LI="1">4. Altered consistency (liquidised), which costs &euro;71.77 per week</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The Regulations provided for a payment of a supplement where the cost of the diet as specified in the regulations is more than one-third of the applicant's income.</P>
        <P>Regulations are currently being revised to take account of inflation over the twelve months to November 2006 and I hope to introduce these new Regulations shortly.</P><Col N="845"/>
        <P>I am also mindful to ensure that people on low incomes generally can afford a healthy-eating diet even where they have not been prescribed a specialised diet.  The record increases in weekly social welfare payment rates introduced in Budget 2007 which are well ahead of inflation, will help achieve this by ensuring that suitable food is now more affordable for people who are relying on social welfare payments.</P>

	<P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over.  All carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass.  It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension.  People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel. </P>
        <P>Spouses of travel pass holders may travel on the same journey with their partner at no cost to them.  In addition, the free travel companion pass entitles the pass holder to have any one person, aged 16 years or over, to accompany him/her free of charge when travelling.  Such companion passes are available to persons who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone.</P>
        <P>The main objective of the free travel scheme is to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active in the community, thereby reducing the need for institutional care.  The purpose of allowing pass holders to be accompanied while travelling is to facilitate further this mobility.  The extension of the scheme to allow the pass holder&rsquo;s companion to travel alone would not be in keeping with this objective.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the Health Service Executive.  The scheme provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.</P>
        <P>Under existing legislation the Health Service Executive may refuse, suspend or terminate payment of a rent supplement in the case of a person who has been required to deliver up possession of a dwelling provided by a housing authority or an approved body where the reasons for that requirement include anti-social behaviour or the interests of good estate management.</P>
        <P>The Executive has been contacted and has advised that payment of a rent supplement in this case was refused on the basis that the person concerned had been required to give up possession of a dwelling supplied by a voluntary body, in this instance St Vincent De Paul, on the grounds of anti-social behaviour.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Since taking Office this Government has made the needs of older people a priority and the commitment to ensure that as many people as possible can qualify for contributory pensions is at the core of this policy.  In this context, changes have been made to the qualifying conditions for pensions which make it easier for people to qualify for pensions.  These include the reduction in the yearly average number of contributions required for pension purposes from 20 to 10 and the introduction of pro-rata pensions and a number of special half-rate pensions for those who had marginally failed to qualify for contributory pensions. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I consider it important that those who wish to continue in employment after normal retirement age should, as far as is possible, be facilitated and supported.  Longer working can play an important role in ensuring that our pensions system is sustainable in the future and can be beneficial to the individual.  For this reason, and to improve income support for older people, the new enhanced State pension (non-contributory) for those over 66 years, which I introduced at the end of September 2006, featured an employment earnings disregard incentive of &euro;100 per week for those who wish to earn extra income to continue <Col N="848"/>in employment.  I was happy to enhance this incentive to &euro;200 per week in Budget 2007.</P>
        <P>In a wider context, the National Pensions Review, published in January 2006, includes recommendations from the Pensions Board designed to encourage people to continue working after normal retirement age.  The measures suggested involve allowing people to defer receiving their social welfare pension at normal pension age and to grant them an actuarially enhanced payment when they claim.  The Pensions Board also considered that if this was combined with allowing those with less than full entitlements to count contributions made after age 65 or 66 in order to improve their contribution record, this would complete the incentives for longer working within the social welfare pensions system.  I am in broad agreement with the suggestions and will be seeking to have them introduced as soon as is practical.</P>
        <P>However, issues surrounding social welfare payments represent only one aspect of the problem.  As I have said before, we require a change in attitudes in relation to longer working from both employers and employees.  Employers must seek to retain older employees and create the conditions which will make longer working both attractive and feasible for older workers.</P>
        <P>With regard to pensions generally, the Government is committed to producing a Green Paper on pensions as part of the new social partnership agreement Towards 2016 with a view to developing a framework for future pensions policy.  This will include an examination of the issues surrounding retirement age and the barriers faced by older workers who wish to remain in employment.  It is expected that the Green Paper will be published by the end of March.  A consultation process will then take place and the Government will subsequently publish a framework for future pensions policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1159 and 1171 together.</P>
        <P>In February 2006 the Government decided to transfer certain functions from the Health Service Executive (HSE) to my Department and also decided to consider transferring certain other functions from my Department to the HSE.  This decision included transferring income support and maintenance schemes (including the supplementary welfare allowance 		scheme &mdash; SWA) together with associated resources to my Department, transferring the General Registrars Office (GRO) to my Department, and examining the mechanics of transferring the dental and other treatment benefits from my Department to the HSE.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the transfer of functions is being overseen by a steering group chaired by my Department and including representatives from the Department of Health and Children, the HSE and the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>A programme of this magnitude has profound implications for important services and also affects, on a personal level, the staff delivering those services.  Throughout the implementation programme, there will be direct and extensive consultation with the staff affected by the transfer of functions programme and with other stakeholders.  My Department has already briefed superintendent community welfare officers (SCWOs) on two occasions, in July and <Col N="850"/>November 2006.  A series of regional briefings is now being organised jointly by the HSE and my Department for all staff in the HSE&rsquo;s community welfare service and will take place before the end of March.  They will provide an opportunity for further constructive engagement and feedback on the implementation of this programme.</P>
        <P>The programme has also been discussed at meetings held quarterly between my Department and the trade unions who represent the affected staff in the HSE.  The HSE, as current employers of the staff in question, has also discussed the programme with those unions at its regular Joint Industrial Council meetings.</P>
        <P>No date has been set for the completion of the transfer process.  However I would intend that the transfer would take place as soon as possible when further detailed planning and consultation with stakeholders on this phase of the programme have been completed.</P>
        <P>Separate to the transfer of functions programme, my Department recently published the report of the working group on the review of the supplementary welfare scheme.  The review, undertaken as part of the Government&rsquo;s Expenditure Review Initiative, was an in-depth examination of all aspects of the scheme including the way it is delivered.  The review makes a number of recommendations on the future of the scheme both in terms of its objectives and the way in which it is administered.  In that regard the transfer of the CWS to my Department will allow for improvements envisaged in the report to be delivered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The SWA scheme is delivered by some 700 community welfare officers (CWOs) and 59 superintendent community welfare officers (SCWOs) and supporting clerical staff in the Community Welfare Service of the HSE.  The CWS provide a service that is responsive and flexible in meeting needs.  These are attributes that will continue to be required into the future and I will be ensuring that they are preserved and built upon as part of the transfer process.  In addition, there will be no diminution in conditions of service for the staff concerned.</P>
        <P>The transfer of functions presents fundamental reform and developmental opportunities for a fully integrated and enhanced income support system, including the restructuring and integration of income and wider support services within one entity.  This presents both a challenge and an opportunity for those within the CWS and my own Department in delivering a service to a customer base who are most disadvantaged in society.  In that regard I am confident that the transfer programme is seen as a positive way forward and will be embraced successfully by all as it progresses in the coming months.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 52 independent companies nation-wide operating the service.  MABS National Development Ltd was set up in 2004 to support and develop the network of services throughout the country. Many voluntary and statutory bodies such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Community Welfare Service, Citizens&rsquo; Information Centres, Centres for the Unemployed and local authorities work closely with the programme.  The credit union movement has been a key partner in MABS since its inception and its involvement and support is central to the development and success of the service.</P>
        <P>In 2006, MABS provided services to some 12,300 new clients.  The number of active cases at the end of the year was 14,600.  The demand for the service can be attributed to the increase in the availability of credit generally and to the quality of the service provided by MABS advisors.  The MABS is highly regarded and successful in meeting the needs of its clients.</P>
        <P>There are some 230 staff employed at present by MABS companies throughout the MABS network.  The requirement for additional staff by individual services is kept under review by my Department.  In 2006, &euro;16.4 million was provided to fund the MABS representing an increase of 20% on the previous year mainly in respect of <Col N="853"/>additional staff costs.  In 2007, I have further increased the annual allocation to &euro;17.64 million to assist with the increasing workload.</P>
        <P>I plan to bring proposals to the Government shortly to establish the MABS on a statutory basis.  My proposals for legislation aim to build on best features of the MABS model of service to the public.  The proposals will combine a continuation of local voluntary involvement with strong national leadership and ensure a high quality, coordinated budgeting and advice service for the future, in particular for people on low incomes.</P><Col N="854"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1164 and 1165 together.</P>
        <P>There are a total of six full-time administrative staff assigned to deal with matters in my constituency office.  There are four established civil servants, one Executive Officer on a payscale of &euro;28,523 to &euro;45,262 and three Clerical Officers on a payscale of &euro;22,766 to &euro;36,913.</P>
        <P>I have also appointed, on a contract basis for my term of office, two non-established civil servants, a Personal Secretary and a Personal Assistant.  The annual salary for my Personal Secretary <Col N="856"/>is &euro;41,736.  My Personal Assistant is on secondment from the Department of Education and Science.  That Department will recoup from my Department on an annual basis the cost of a replacement teacher&rsquo;s salary, allowances, PRSI contributions and superannuation contributions. This will be in the region of &euro;44,800.</P>
        <P>There are three established civil servants assigned to my Department&rsquo;s Press Office, including the Press Officer who is a Higher Executive Officer on a payscale of &euro;43,445 to &euro;55,147 and two Executive Officers, one of whom is on a payscale of &euro;28,523 to &euro;45,262 and the other on a payscale of &euro;30,027 to &euro;47,641 (Class A rate of PRSI contribution applies as this person commenced employment after 6 April 1995).</P>
        <P>I have also appointed a Press Adviser on a contract basis for my term of office. The Press Adviser is on a personal salary of &euro;106,670 together with a private pension contribution of 11% of salary.</P>

	<P>The setting of waste management charges and the introduction of waivers in respect of waste charges is, as stated by my colleague the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, a matter for each local authority. </P>
        <P>The introduction of a national social welfare scheme to address the issue would be complex given the wide range of charging regimes and cost structures that exist in respect of waste management throughout the State.  Charges vary across local authorities and within local authorities where there is more than one provider. In addition, some local authorities already operate waiver schemes.</P>
        <P>My officials have discussed this issue with their counterparts in the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  While there are no plans at present for the introduction of a waiver scheme through the social welfare system, I intend to keep the issue under review.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> his views on extending the age limit regarding child benefit from 19 up to the age of 22 when that person is still attending college. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Child benefit is a universal payment, paid in respect of children up to the age of 16 years.  It continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability. </P>
        <P>The policy of the Government over the past number of years has been to substantially increase the amount spent on child benefit for all families.  Commitment to this policy is reflected in the significant resources invested in the scheme since 2001, increasing monthly payments to &euro;160.00 for each of the first two children and &euro;195.00 for the third and subsequent children from April 2007.  According to figures collected by the Central Statistics Office under the Quarterly National Household Survey for the period June 2006 to August 2006, there were an estimated 93,500 students aged 19 to 22 years.  Extending child benefit to this category would entail substantial cost, estimated to be in the region of some &euro;187 million annually.</P>
        <P>However, in recognition of the need to target limited available resources at persons on low incomes with children in full-time education, a number of provisions have been introduced, <Col N="858"/>including the extension of entitlement to child dependant allowance to age 22 where the parent of a full-time student (including third level) is in receipt of either a long-term social welfare payment, or a short-term social welfare payment for six months or more (short-term schemes include such payments as Unemployment Benefit and Assistance, Disability Benefit and Supplementary Welfare Allowance).</P>
        <P>In addition, in-work cash payments are provided to low-paid employees with families through the family income supplement (FIS) scheme.  Under this scheme, a qualified child is any child under the age of 18 or aged 18 to 22 if in full-time education.  This supplement is paid where a family&rsquo;s weekly income is below a specified income limit for the family size, and is calculated at 60% of the difference between the net family income (gross pay less tax, PRSI, health contribution, superannuation) and the relevant income limit.</P>

	<P>When a claim for social welfare benefit or pension is received by my Department, whether, directly from a claimant as in the normal practice or, alternatively, from somebody acting on their behalf, any enquiries in connection with the claim would be made directly with the claimant. Enquiries or representations from public representatives on behalf of constituents are acknowledged but when the claim has been decided, the practice is for the outcome to be notified to the customer.  Where a public representative requests to be notified of the outcome, that representative is also, in the normal course, informed.  Because of the volume of claims and the level of complexity which may be involved, a requirement to notify public representatives in all cases would add an additional layer of work and draw resources from claim processing. Enquiries or representations from public representatives in relation to individual claims are dealt with as promptly as possible.

	<P>Self-employed persons, including farmers &mdash; aged between 16 years and 66 years and with reckonable income that exceeds the current insurable limit of &euro;3,174 per annum must pay PRSI contributions at Class S. In general, payment of class S PRSI is made through the Office of the Revenue Commissioners who act as agents in the collection of PRSI. Self-employed persons return PRSI contributions through the self-assessment process to the Collector-General, along with their income tax and health contribution. The social insurance contribution is due at 3% of reckonable income, or &euro;253, whichever is the greater, in addition to the health contribution &mdash; where applicable. </P>
        <P>The basis of assessment for tax differs somewhat from that of social insurance and, as such, it is possible for a person to be without a taxable income while still having a liability for PRSI. In addition to those who are specifically provided for in legislation, these include cases where a self-employed person is deemed by the Revenue Commissioners not to have a tax liability. In such cases PRSI is not collected automatically by the Revenue Commissioners but referred to my Department to determine if a PRSI liability exists. Where a PRSI liability exists, social insurance contributions are collected by the Self-Employment Section of my Department.  Where a self-employed person ceases compulsory social insurance or where his or her income falls below the &euro;3,174 limit, an application may be made to become a voluntary contributor to maintain his or her social insurance record for pension purposes. To become a voluntary contributor after self-employment, a person must have worked and paid PRSI for at least 260 weeks and must apply within 12 months after the end of the tax year in which he or she last paid PRSI.  There is no provision in legislation to collect PRSI contributions from those who are not insured and in circumstances where they are not properly due. Where a person should have been paying PRSI contributions in their own right but did not, there is scope for the collection of outstanding contributions to establish entitlement to a contributory pension.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s Programme of Decentralisation 118 posts in my Department are to be relocated to Buncrana. According to figures received by the Department from the Central Applications Facility (CAF), through which all applications for decentralisation must be submitted, the number of first preference applicants for Buncrana is 34, of which 17 currently work in the Department. The agreed protocols for the assignment of staff to the positions designated to move to Buncrana, is that offers of transfer are made, in the first instance, to first preference priority applicants on the CAF. Where there is a shortfall in numbers, priority applicants who applied to the CAF before 7 September 2004 and who have included Buncrana as a second or subsequent preference will be given an opportunity to change their first preference to Buncrana. Thereafter, applicants who applied after 7 September 2004 will be considered. Accordingly, it is not possible at this stage to say how many people will eventually exercise the option to relocate to Buncrana. The CAF will remain open for new applications until the full decentralisation programme is complete. </P>

	<P>To qualify for PRSI treatment benefits persons under 25 years of age must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid in the relevant tax year &mdash; the tax year before they claim. The requirement for persons aged 25 years and over is a minimum of 260 weeks paid contributions. In recognition of the difficulties that persons younger than 25 would have in meeting the standard conditions, the contribution condition for those under 25 was reduced in July 1992 to 39 paid contributions. Previously this reduced contribution requirement had applied only to those under 23 years of age. Any further relaxation in the conditions for receipt of treatment benefits would have financial implications and would be a matter for consideration within the constraints of budgetary policy and the best targeting of available resources. </P>

	<P>Under EU regulations 1408/71, an employed person who is working in a Member State is entitled to the family benefits provided by that State even though the family may be residing in another Member State. A claim for child benefit in respect of his children residing in Poland was received from the person concerned on 30 March 2006.  Due to the volume of such claims being received and the complexities that can arise in dealing with claims under EU regulations, there can be a delay in dealing with them.  My Department has written to the Polish authorities seeking necessary information and  when a reply is received, a decision will be made on the claim and the person concerned will be notified accordingly. Following the arrival of the family in Ireland in July 2006, a further claim for Child Benefit was received in November 2006 and  Child Benefit was awarded under Irish legislation with effect from 1 August 2006.  Arrears due from August will be in the nominated bank account on Tuesday, 6 February.</P>

	<P>Carer&rsquo;s allowance is a means tested payment for people who are providing full time care and attention to a person who is in need of such care. Although recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance themselves are not eligible for the national fuel scheme they do qualify for the household benefits package and the free travel scheme. In addition, the person to whom the care is being provided may be in receipt of the free fuel allowance. The household benefits package comprises the electricity/gas allowance, telephone allowance and television licence schemes. In recognition of recent increases in the price of natural gas and electricity I have provided for significant increases to the gas and electricity allowances. I <Col N="867"/>provided for the number of units of electricity covered by the scheme to increase from 1,800 to 2,400 with effect from January 2007. I also made provision for an equivalent increase in the natural gas allowance which came into effect in October 2006. These allowances also cover increased standing charges and the associated VAT. Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. If a recipient of a social welfare or Health Services Executive payment has exceptional heating costs due to ill health, infirmity or a medical condition which he/she is unable to meet out of household income, it is open to him/her to apply to the local community welfare officer for a special heating supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. This supplement is considered the most appropriate and effective way to provide extra resources in circumstances where a person has increased heating requirements due to illness. The position with regard to energy and heating costs generally is kept under review. </P>

	<P>My Department conducted an internal review of payments to carers during the period 2004 to 2006. The review was designed as a vehicle to build on the review of the carer&rsquo;s allowance which was published in 1998 and to develop proposals for improvements in the schemes. The review examined all aspects of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant and made a broad range of proposals covering issues such as the definition of full time care and attention, qualifying conditions for the respite care grant and the operation of the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance. I am very pleased that in recent Budgets I have been able to implement many of the review&rsquo;s recommendations especially in the area of introducing more flexibilities in current arrangements. Although the review was completed in the last quarter of 2006 some updating is now required in order to reflect recent developments in relation to payments to carers. I intend to publish the review in the near future. I am committed to working for, and with, carers to deliver increased benefits, supports, and services for them and their families. The improvements for carers which I announced in Budget 2007 are further evidence of this commitment.</P>

	<P>The function of the Medical Review and Assessment Service (MRAS) unit is to confirm the eligibility for illness, disability and carer schemes, based on medical certification and reports provided by the claimant&rsquo;s medical practitioner, or based on medical examination undertaken by departmental Medical Assessors. An organisation review of the service commenced in October 2005 and was concluded in April 2006. Given the nature of the review, it is not intended to publish the report. The main recommendations in the report related to the future structure of the service including arrangements for the appointment of Medical Assessors and the arrangement of medical assessment centres with a view to maximizing efficiency and providing a better service to customers; the development of a computerised case management system to support Medical Assessors, medical certifiers and administrative staff to reduce the current reliance on largely paper-based systems; and the redesign of business and medical processes, including the development of medical examination protocols and performance management systems for medical assessors and certifiers. My Department has begun work on implementing the recommendations of this report. The process of recruiting additional Medical Assessors is under way.  In addition, a review of the network of examination centres is taking place to see if it can be rationalised and developed along the lines recommended by the report.  Protocols for the conduct of medical examinations are also being developed. Further consideration and consultation is taking place in my Department in relation to other recommendations of the report focused on business processes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1193 and 1194 together.</P>
        <P>Where a person has social insurance contributions from another EEA country, or a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement, these can also be used to qualify a person for a payment. The manner in which contributions from EEA countries are to be used is laid down <Col N="870"/>in Regulation (EEC) No 1408/ 71 and the same general principles are applied in the reciprocal agreements Ireland has with a number of other countries. These Regulations provide that where the conditions required by the legislation of a country for entitlement to old age benefits are satisfied only after counting the contributions made in another country, the first country shall calculate the amount of pension the person would be entitled to if s/he had completed his/her full career of periods of insurance under the legislation of that country. Then the proportional pension is calculated by multiplying the theoretical amount of pension by the ratio of periods of insurance in that State to the person&rsquo;s full career. The pre-53 pension is a special measure designed to provide a pension to people who would not otherwise qualify for any payment. A number of such pensions are being paid in accordance with the arrangements outlined above and I am satisfied that such payments are calculated in accordance with the relevant EU regulations and the reciprocal agreements entered into by Ireland with other States.</P>

	<P>The Road Traffic Act 2006 was passed by the Oireachtas on 6th July 2006 and was signed by the President on 16th July 2006.  A Commencement Order in July brought a number of the provisions in the Act into effect from Friday 21st July 2006.  The provisions which were commenced included the key policy provisions promoted in the Act of Mandatory Alcohol Testing (MAT) checkpoints, a ban on the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving, and the legislative provision supporting the operation of privately operated speed cameras.  The key policy initiatives set out in the Act were commenced without delay, and approximately 30,000 Mandatory Alcohol Testing checkpoints are being operated by the Gardai every month.  In addition, Section 16 of the Act was part-commenced with effect from 1 September <Col N="872"/>2006 in order to enable penalty points to apply to the offence of driving while holding a mobile phone. The remainder of that section, which introduces a number of new penalty point offences, has not yet been commenced.  Section 5 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 provides for the introduction of a fixed charge and disqualification for certain drink driving offences. The implementation of that section requires necessary administrative and enforcement preparations, including adjustments to the Garda Fixed Charge Processing and IT systems and the testing of those systems.

	<P>The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997 empower local authorities, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers Association, to grant a disabled person&rsquo;s parking permit to a person who is suffering from a disability that is of a nature that prevents him or her from walking or causes undue hardship to the person in walking.  The focus of the qualifying criterion is therefore on the issue of a person being a wheelchair user or having significant mobility impairment.  Eligibility has to be determined on a case-by-case basis having regard to the nature of the mobility impairment of the person. The position is therefore that children with autism are ineligible to be issued with a disabled persons parking permit unless the child also has a mobility disability and is unable to walk.  There are no proposals to extend the application of the disabled persons parking permit scheme to include persons who are not mobility impaired. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1205 and 1206 together.</P>
        <P>A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has power under section 20 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 and Regulation 21 of the European Communities (Vehicle Testing) Regulations 2004 to inspect and examine a vehicle which he or she suspects has a defect that makes it a danger to the public and on being satisfied, following the carrying out of such an inspection and examination, that it is a danger to the public, to prohibit its use in a public place until the defect has been remedied.  There is no requirement that such an inspection must take place at a particular place such as a vehicle service garage, a NCT centre or a premises of an authorised tester.  It is understood that in most cases the inspections and examinations are carried out in the immediate vicinity of the place at which a vehicle was stopped by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. However, to assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in carrying out an inspection and examination of a vehicle suspected of having a serious defect, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is empowered under the above-mentioned provisions to do all such things and make all such requirements as are reasonably necessary including requiring that the vehicle be brought to a convenient suitable place, which may not be more than 8 kilometres away in the case of a passenger car and 20 kilometres in the case of a commercial vehicle, to carry out the inspection and examination.  I am satisfied that the existing law in this area is adequate to enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal effectively with defective and unsafe vehicles and I have received no communications from the Garda authorities to suggest otherwise. I have had no discussions or consultations with any Minister in relation to changing the law in this area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1208 and 1273 together.</P>
        <P>The issues raised by the Deputy are day-to-day operational matters for the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA), in which I have no statutory function. I understand from the DAA that the company makes every effort to maximise the use of its runway, contact stands and terminal resources and facilities to meet demand. The DAA considers the designation of Dublin Airport as a coordinated airport, in terms of slot allocation, as essential to support this process.  Without this designation, it is the DAA&rsquo;s view that there will be significant periods of congestion and disruption to the smooth operation of the airport.  DAA is awaiting the decision of the Commission for Aviation Regulation in this regard. In the meantime I understand that the DAA will introduce temporary measures, where necessary, to accommodate aircraft demand during the coming years in order to address the anticipated shortfall in stand availability during the capital investment programme. As a consequence, I am informed that the level of service available to operators and the opportunity to avail of a contact stand will depend on the operating times of new services. The planning of new services outside the peak periods will enhance the opportunity to utilise contact stands and available space within the terminal building.</P>

	<P>The Rural Transport Initiative (RTI) was launched on a pilot basis in 2002.  Under this scheme, thirty-four community transport groups throughout the country are being funded to address the particular transport needs of their rural areas. Pobal administers the scheme on behalf of my Department. The pilot phase of the Initiative concluded at the end of 2006 and in line with Government announcements in the matter, preparations are now being made to mainstream the provision of rural transport from 2007 onwards. In the meantime, existing groups continue to be funded. In line with commitments in Towards 2016 and in parallel with the implementation of Transport 21, Euro 9 million is being provided for the RTI in 2007. This funding will facilitate the transition of the RTI from the end of its pilot phase into the beginning of the mainstreaming process. In making specific allocations to the individual RTI project groups from this funding, I have asked Pobal to work closely with the existing groups to maximise the impact of the funding through, among other things, increased service provision and including areas not already served by the scheme. I hope to announce shortly the details of the mainstreaming of rural transport from 2007 onwards.</P>

	<P>The re-opening the Navan to Drogheda line was considered as part of the Strategic Rail Review in 2003 which concluded that there was no economic case for re-opening it.  I am advised by Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann that the Navan to Drogheda line is a freight only line and significant investment would be required to upgrade the track and signalling and to provide passing loops to permit the operation of commuter trains.  A scoping study is underway at present examining the re-opening of the Navan to Dunboyne line as an extension of the Clonsilla to Dunboyne line which Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are currently designing.</P>

	<P>I announced on 25 January 2007 that I propose to make a regulation to provide for a national maximum vehicle height limit of 4.65 metres.  I have asked the Road Safety Authority to prepare a draft regulation providing for this maximum vehicle height limit and to undertake the necessary consultation with the European Commission <Col N="881"/>regarding its introduction.  Subject to the outcome of the EU consultation, it would be my intention to implement the height limit at the earliest date possible.  I propose to allow a period of two years for the phasing out of the use of existing vehicles that exceed the proposed height limit of 4.65 metres.</P>

	<P>Directive No. 2006/38/EC amending the existing Eurovignette Directive No. 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures was adopted on by the European Council on 27 March 2006 and entered into force on 17 May 2006.</P>
        <P>The amending Directive is designed to supplement the existing rules in respect of tolls and user charges for HGVs and to align national systems on common principles with two purposes in mind: to ensure fair competition in the transport sector; and as a means of including the cost to society in the prices paid by infrastructure users.</P>
        <P>The Directive lays down rules for calculating tolls and user charges for the use of roads on the trans-European road network.  It also enables Member States to apply tolls and user charges on roads not forming part of the trans-European network, for instance parallel roads, with a view to managing traffic flows.  In addition, Member States may choose to apply tolls or charges to only parts of the trans-European network or not to apply tolls or charges at all.</P>
        <P>From Ireland&rsquo;s point of view, the Directive provides that any tolls charged cannot discriminate against international traffic and should not result in distortions of competition between operators.  Fees should be non-discriminatory and their collection should not involve excessive formalities or create barriers at internal borders.</P>
        <P>Member States have up to 10 June 2008 to transpose the Directive into their national legislation.</P>
        <P>The UK Government is currently investigating various proposals for a road pricing scheme.  If firm proposals are announced for any category of charging there will be public consultation.</P>

        <P>Under Section 17 of the Roads Act, 1993, overall responsibility for the planning, design and implementation of national road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority and the relevant local authority concerned.</P>
        <P>Under the Roads Sub-Programme of the National Development Plan, some &euro;13.3 billion will be invested in national roads.  The principal objectives of the Roads Sub-Programme are as follows.  Completion by 2010 of the major inter-urban routes linking Dublin with Belfast, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  The upgrade of the M50 by 2010 which will convert to barrier free tolling in 2008.  Improvement of road links <Col N="884"/>between the main NSS Gateways.  Ongoing development of the Atlantic Road Corridor from Letterkenny through Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford.  Continued upgrading of road links to Northern Ireland.  Targeted improvements of a number of key national secondary routes.  Investment in strategic non-national roads which will compliment the national roads investment.</P>
        <P>Investment in national roads will be utilised to implement the objectives of the National Spatial Strategy. Particular focus will therefore be on investment in road routes which link the Gateways, including major upgrading of the Atlantic Road Corridor, which links many of the Gateways outside Dublin. Among the national secondary routes to be prioritized will be routes between the Gateways outside Dublin including upgrading roads linking the Midland  Gateway centres of Athlone,  Tullamore and Mullingar. In combination with the Sub-Programme there will also be significant  investment in key routes impacting on NSS Gateways, Hubs and County towns.</P>

	<P>While there is no statutory requirement for Ministerial consent for the level of fares on the Luas, the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) provided my Department with prior notice of their proposals for a fare increase in 2007 and I conveyed my approval for a modest average increase of 2.75%. In approving that increase, I was conscious of the requirement to achieve a balance between the impact of the increase on passengers and the need to sustain the financial health of the system.</P>
        <P>Subject to the approved average increase, it was a matter for the RPA to determine the details of the new fares structure which was announced by the Agency on 4th January last. I understand that, for the second year running, the RPA did not increase Luas SmartCard fares and child fares. SmartCard users can avail of average savings of up to 15% compared to single ticket purchases.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish aviation sector plays a vital role in our continuing economic development and is a critical feature of the growth in tourism and trade. Aviation is particularly important for us because we are an island nation.</P>
        <P>The key objectives of Irish Aviation policy and the strategies being pursued to achieve those objectives are set out in my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2005-2007 which was published on 29 July 2005 on the Department&rsquo;s website.  I have no plans at present to publish a Green or a White paper on the subject.</P>
        <P>In broad terms the main objectives of Irish aviation policy are: to facilitate and encourage as wide a range as possible of safe, reliable, regular and competitive commercial air services for Irish tourism, trade and industry; and to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s airports can provide cost competitive and appropriate infrastructure to meet the current and prospective needs of the aviation sector.</P>
        <P>These objectives will be pursued by concluding liberal regulatory arrangements with non-EU States and by seeking to facilitate greater access on transatlantic routes by concluding the EU/US Open Skies agreement. Open Skies offers significant growth and hub opportunities with considerable potential benefit to the Irish economy.   I am seeking to bring this issue to conclusion in an EU-US context.  If agreement on an EU/US agreement cannot be reached in a reasonable timeframe, I will seek to progress this bilaterally with the US authorities.</P>
        <P>The successful flotation of Aer Lingus has provided the airline with access to new equity to enable it to compete effectively and fund the growth of its business. The company now has new equity of the order of half a billion Euro, which provides it with a unique opportunity to pursue its expansion based business strategy.  It will be a matter for the Board of the company going forward to decide on its future strategy.  In relation to the hostile take-over bid by Ryanair, the Government&rsquo;s view is that Ireland&rsquo;s strategic objectives for aviation would not be well served by such a takeover.   The EU Commission recently announced that it has decided to initiate a full investigation of the attempted hostile takeover of Aer Lingus.  The decision of the EU Commission is consistent with my view that the proposed merger would raise significant competition issues. I remain opposed to the attempted takeover as I believe that a merger between the two companies would have a detrimental impact on competition in aviation services.</P>
        <P>With regard to Airports, it is Government policy to foster airport development, particularly at the three state airports, in order to encourage as wide a range as possible of reliable, regular and competitive air services to and from Ireland.  Policy is also aimed at facilitating the contri<Col N="886"/>bution of the regional airports to balanced regional development.</P>
        <P>Airport development in Ireland must take into account the needs of low cost and full service airlines.  Airport development should also enable the development of critical long haul business to North America and to other long haul destinations.</P>
        <P>Major development will be required at our key gateway airport, Dublin Airport, over the next decade. Among the priorities are a new Terminal 2 and pier and apron facilities and a 2nd runway that will allow the airport to respond to demand and to improve the overall passenger experience for all users.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in November 2005 EU and US negotiators concluded work on the text of a first phase EU-US Open Skies agreement that included a transitional arrangement for Ireland, relating to the phasing out of the &lsquo;Shannon Stop&rsquo;.  The draft agreement was unanimously endorsed at the December 2005 Transport Council subject to sufficient progress by the US side on opening up ownership and control of US airlines to EU investors.</P>
        <P>In December 2006, following opposition from Congress, the US authorities withdrew the rulemaking proposal concerning control and ownership of U.S. airlines.  The rule making provision had been a key demand for a number of Member States and its withdrawal by the US side is a significant barrier to concluding the EU US Open Skies agreement.</P>
        <P>Negotiation at EU-US level resumed in January 2007, with both sides reaffirming their commitment to the goal of concluding an EU-US agreement that would open access to markets and maximise benefits on both sides of the Atlantic.  The objective is to reach agreement in time for the next Transport Council in March 2007.</P>
        <P>Negotiations are continuing between the EU and US and my Department is in ongoing contact with the Office of the Attorney General on the legal options.  As I indicated previously, in the absence of progress at EU level, I intend to seek to implement, in accordance with Community law, measures to provide for liberalisation of transatlantic services between Ireland and the US by way of an amendment to the Ireland-US bilateral Air Services Agreement.</P>
        <P>As far as the development of long haul services is concerned, my Department&rsquo;s strategy is to promote, where possible, new long haul services and, where necessary, put in place new or modified agreements.  The Deputy will be aware that my Department last week gave approval, in principle, for Flyglobespan to operate UK/US air services via Ireland West Airport Knock.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1238 and 1239 together.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that my Department received a notification from Bus &Eacute;ireann on 5th May, 2005, in respect of a proposed service between Galway and Dublin Airport.  The processing of that notification was deferred on the grounds that my Department was giving consideration to a number of prior applications from private bus operators for licences or amendments to existing licences for services on and along that route.  In addition, my Department informed Bus &Eacute;ireann that some elements of the proposals were premature where the infrastructure was not yet in place.</P>
        <P>The current position in relation to the notification is that, as the consideration of the prior applications for licences and the amendments to existing licences has now been completed, the <Col N="889"/>examination is now proceeding.  However, the Department can only deal with the elements of the notification that relate to current infrastructure and the premature elements will remain queued for review at a later date.</P><Col N="890"/>

        <P FLI="0">In addition to the licensed services listed above, Bus &Eacute;ireann also operates their Route 20 daily return services between Galway and Dublin.</P>
        <P>Licence applications under the 1932 Act are dealt with on a first come, first served basis.  The processing of applications involves detailed analysis to ascertain, for example, the anticipated demand for the service and the extent of any overlap between the proposed service and existing licensed or other public transport services.  This can include similar licence applications already received or prior notifications received from Bus &Eacute;ireann.  In some circumstances, while the preliminary work may have been completed on a particular application, a final decision cannot be made until other relevant applications or notifications received prior to it have been finalised.  The average length of time for processing an application depends on the route in question, the number of prior applications received and the complexity of the cases.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 13 September 2006 as a consequence of the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 responsibility for matters relating to vehicle standards has passed to the Road Safety Authority.</P>
        <P>Three separate investigations were undertaken in relation to the school bus accident in Kents<Col N="890"/>town, County Meath by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health and Safety Authority and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I have not received any report of these investigations.  The publication of these reports is a matter for the bodies concerned in the first instance.  I am aware that, on foot of the investigations by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health and Safety Authority, legal proceedings were instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions against a number of parties in relation to this accident.  As these proceedings are currently before the courts, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the accident.</P>
        <P>Following the Kentstown accident, the Government decided that, by the end of 2006, the 3 for 2 seating arrangements would be eliminated on State-funded school bus services and that such buses must be equipped with safety belts.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science announced earlier this month that the target date for both these measures had been achieved.  In May 2006 I made regulations   transposing into Irish law EU Directive 2003/20 relating to the compulsory wearing of safety belts.  Essentially, this Directive requires that where a safety belt is fitted to a seat in a vehicle it must be used by the occupant of the seat.</P>
        <P>The Road Safety Authority has engaged consultants to conduct a fundamental review of the scheme of compulsory periodic roadworthiness testing of goods vehicles and buses.  I understand from the Road Safety Authority that it expects to receive the report from the consultants very soon.   In addition, the Road Safety Authority is examining the question of the appropriate standards for buses engaged in the organised transport of children.</P>

	<P>Prior to the establishment of the Road Safety Authority, the National Safety Council commenced, in consultation with my Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and the City and County Managers Association, the development of a template for road safety action plans to be piloted in 10 chosen local authority areas.  </P>
        <P>It was intended that the results of these pilots would inform the development of models which could subsequently be applied in all local authority areas throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The project included an examination of the role of local authority Road Safety Officers by the Council in consultation with relevant Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>To date 6 local authorities have completed their strategic actions plans most of which will be launched in early 2007.</P>
        <P>The RSA will continue to monitor, evaluate and develop the respective plans in conjunction with the various stakeholders.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 299 of 4 October 2006, if the Ireland US bilateral Air Services Agreement is not an existing bilateral agreement and hence subject to the ruling of the European Court of Justice on nationality clauses in 2002 which would preclude any amendments to the said agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>While the decisions made by the European Court of Justice in the Open Skies cases were not specifically addressed to Ireland, the interpretation of Community law contained in those decisions must be respected by Ireland. That said, there is nothing in the Court judgments, per se, that prevents the Member States addressed in those judgments, or Ireland, from amending their bilateral agreements.</P>
        <P>However, following the 2002 judgments, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament adopted Council Regulation 847/2004 on the negotiation and implementation of air services agreements between Member States and third countries. That Regulation does contain provisions in relation to renegotiation or amendment of bilateral agreements. In the case of the US, the Commission has been mandated by the Council of Ministers to negotiate an air transport agreement between the European Union and the United States.  This would clearly have a significant bearing on how the Commission would respond pursuant to Regulation 847/2004 to a possible amendment of the bilateral agreement between Ireland and the US.</P><Col N="895"/>
        <P>Negotiations are continuing between the EU and US and my Department is in ongoing contact with the Office of the Attorney General on the legal options.  As I indicated previously, in the absence of progress at EU level, I intend to seek to implement, in accordance with Community law, measures to provide for liberalisation of transatlantic services between Ireland and the US by way of an amendment to the Ireland-US bilateral Air Services Agreement.</P>

        <Quest> if, in respect of the question of a second Dublin airport since 1995 his Department has been consulted or has considered the use of Casement Aerodrome Baldonnell as a second commercial airport for Dublin; and the conclusion reached for same. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I should say at the outset that responsibility for the scope and scale of operations at Baldonnell are matters for the Minister for Defence and his Department in the first instance. </P>
        <P>The use of Baldonnell as a second commercial airport has been raised on a number of occasions in fact as far back as January 1996 the then Minister for Transport Mr. Michael Lowry T.D., having consulted his cabinet colleagues, reached the conclusion that the project would not be in the interest of the aviation sector and the economy generally.</P>
        <P>The issue of a second airport for the Dublin region was further addressed in the Warburg Dillon Read Report of 1999 on Aer Rianta. Among other things, that report concluded that Dublin does not need a second airport given Dublin Airport&rsquo;s capacity to expand for the foreseeable future. I am satisfied that the analysis remains a valid assessment of the Airport&rsquo;s potential. Because of the prudent policy of acquiring land banks in the environs of the airport to cater for future growth, the Dublin Airport Authority is now in the happy position of being able to construct the proposed second runway and the second terminal on land it already owns.</P>

        <P>It is a requirement for the registration and entry into service of new motor vehicles in the European Union that they have type-approval in accordance with Directive 70/157/EEC as amended by Directive 1999/101/EC, which sets down the permissible sound levels and exhaust systems for motor vehicles.  Vehicle in-service standards are specified in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 which requires vehicles to be fitted with a silencer or other device that is suitable and sufficient for reducing to a reasonable level the noise caused by the escape of exhaust gases from the engine.  Article 85 of these Regulations prohibits the use in a public place of a vehicle which causes excessive noise.</P>
        <P>An examination of the silencer to assess its effectiveness in reducing noise is part of the NCT.  It is an offence to use in a public place a vehicle which causes excessive noise.  Enforcement of the law in this regard is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

	<P>The information contained in the newspaper article referred to by the Deputy  derives from the Department of Finance&rsquo;s PPP website. This website gives an indicative value for PPP projects and in relation to Metro North, Metro West and the Lucan Luas PPP projects, the indicative value for each project is &euro;250 million plus. The indicative value is provided to give potential bidders an indication of the relative scale of PPP projects being undertaken across all sectors. All the website says is that the indicative value of each of these projects will be in excess of &euro;250 million.</P>
        <P>I am not in a position to release details of the costs for the proposed Luas and Metro lines because the details are commercially sensitive from the point of view of protecting public funds and getting best value for money.</P>
        <P>In relation to the remainder of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, it is proposed that the Metro North, Metro West and Lucan Luas projects will be procured as public private partnerships (PPP) and that the cost of the construction and maintenance will be borne by the private consortium selected through a tendering procedure.  The PPP consortia will be paid through annual Exchequer payments. The level of payment will be dependent on the consortium meeting service delivery standards set out in the PPP contract.</P>
        <P>The cost of land acquisition for these projects, together with project development costs incurred by the Railway Procurement Agency prior to applying for the relevant Railway Orders, will be funded by the Exchequer.

	<P>As outlined in replies to previous questions from the deputy on this topic, most recently on 11 October 2006, Dublin Port Company wrote to me as Marine Minister on 18 May 2005 seeking ministerial approval for the company to enter into an arrangement with the Anna Livia consortium, as detailed in draft heads of terms enclosed with the letter. </P>
        <P>The proposed arrangement was in essence that in the event that the consortium was successful in the National Conference Centre competition, and subject to the Minister&rsquo;s consent, Dublin Port Company would make a site available to facilitate the consortium&rsquo;s proposal for a National Conference Centre.  Following approval by the Government, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, John O&rsquo;Donoghue, TD, announced in November 2005 that Spencer Dock International Conference Centre Consortium was being invited to become the Provisional Preferred Tenderer for the provision of a National Conference Centre in Dublin.</P>
        <P>On 31 August 2006, that Minister further announced that this consortium was being invited to become the Preferred Tenderer in this regard.  Since the consortium with whom Dublin Port Company signed the heads of terms was not successful in the competition, the Ministerial approval requested by Dublin Port Company on 18 May 2005 is no longer required.  Furthermore, as per standard commercial arrangements between contracting parties, the draft heads of terms referred to in this reply are, by their nature, considered to be commercially sensitive.</P>

	<P>I understand that the Department of Finance are preparing a National Strategic Reference Framework, which will set out the strategic orientation of the next round of Structural Funds for the period 2007-2013, for presentation to the European Commission by the 6th of March next.  The quantity of Structural Funds available to Ireland is &euro;900 million and its profile over the 7 year period will have an impact on the types of priorities that will be chosen for funding. It is not currently envisaged that major infrastructure projects such as Metro North will be funded but rather niche programmes that will complement the new NDP.</P>
        <P>Funding for transport projects is also available under the Trans European Network (TEN-T) programme. I understand that current EU funding under this programme is focused on 30 priority projects and that the European Commission is giving priority to cross-border road and rail projects. I also understand that the revised Financial Regulation governing this programme is still under discussion. When this regulation has been adopted, further consideration will be given to the possible submission of Irish transport projects for assistance under the TENs programme.</P>

	<P>I understand from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that the frequency of service on the Maynooth line has been increased substantially in recent years and that currently there are, for example, 5 trains from Maynooth between 07.22 and 08.15 in the morning peak to cater for peak demand from Maynooth.  I am informed that the fastest area of growth on the Maynooth corridor is from Clonsilla inwards and that the new services to Docklands Station will be provided to cater for this increased demand which in turn will reduce pressure on the existing heavily loaded trains.  These new services will commence in March 2007.  Later in 2007 Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann plans to further increase the capacity of some of the existing Maynooth line services, through the reassignment of diesel railcars currently being used on the Sligo service following <Col N="904"/>the entry into service of the first of the 150 new intercity railcars.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that my Department received a notification from Dublin Bus on 31st October, 2006, for a service on the route referred to by the Deputy.  Dublin Bus was informed at that time that the Department on 26th October, 2006 had issued an amended licence to a private bus operator for a substantial increase in services along part of the route in question.  Where a notification is received and it is deemed that the initiation or alteration of a bus service would compete with an existing licensed service, the Department advises Dublin Bus in line with the Road Transport Act, 1958, that a Section 25 application is required.  My Department is currently in discussion with Dublin Bus on the matter.

	<P>The RPA, following  consultation with South Dublin and Fingal County Councils and other key stakeholders, has identified two route corridor options for Metro West between its terminus at Tallaght and its connection with Metro North.  I launched the public consultation process for Metro West on 22nd November last.  Some 50,000 newsletters have been circulated to households and other interested parties along the proposed routes as part of this consultation.  The newsletters contain a map showing the two broad corridor options and an assessment of each of these options. </P>
        <P>The RPA is consulting widely with people living and working along the proposed routes, public representatives, local authorities and other agencies. The RPA recently held five open days as part of the public consultation process on route options.  This gave people an opportunity to express their views and have these views taken into account in the implementation of the project. The RPA are inviting submissions from interested parties until the end of February.</P>
        <P>The route finally selected may be a variant or combination of the route options or other options identified during consultation.  It is expected that a preferred route will be identified this year. The sections of the route that will be fully segregated from the road network will be dependent on the preferred route identified.</P>

	<P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, as amended, provides the legislative basis for entry to the public transport market by private bus operators.  In accordance with this legislation, private operators are licensed under a passenger licence to operate scheduled public coach and bus services within <Col N="906"/>the State.  All applications by private operators are considered in accordance with the Act and each application is given individual consideration.  In giving consideration to an application for a licence my Department has issued guidelines in that regard. </P>
        <P>The adequacy or otherwise of existing services and whether the proposed service is required in the public interest, as required under section 11(3)(a) of the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, is assessed by the Department on the basis of the best evidence available to it. Applications are examined for added value to the public in terms of route/locations to be served, the timing of services and the days on which services are available. The assessment also includes a review of existing and proposed service frequency, number of services provided per day/week, duration of daily service provided. Evidence of unsatisfied demand, review of Local or County Development Plans and other relevant publications, for example, Regional Planning Guidelines, transport studies, etc., reports of on-site monitoring, representations, complaints and any case made by an applicant are also taken into account.</P>
        <P>When considering applications for new bus services or amendments to licences for existing bus services, the Department will try to ensure, so far as possible, that the services proposed are separated in time from existing services along the route or in the neighbourhood of the route. Separation of services is considered to be in the public interest in order to ensure the availability of a good range and spread of services to the travelling public including a sufficiently frequent service to meet anticipated demand; preserve good order and safety on public roads; avoid traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas; and maximise patronage of public transport and reduce private car usage.</P>
        <P>New legislation is currently being prepared to replace the Road Transport Act, 1932 by a modern regulatory and licensing regime in line with commitments in the Programme for Government. It is anticipated that the new legislation will address a range of issues including the introduction of a single licensing code for all bus operators.  The legislation will also be designed in a manner consistent with EU law on public service obligations and State Aids and in such a way as to create new opportunities and a level playing field for private operator involvement in the bus market.</P>

	<P>As I advised the Deputy in a previous reply, the recommendations arising from the Blanchardstown Dial To Stop Drug Dealing Campaign are being considered by the National Drugs Strategy Team (NDST).  Such consideration would cover possible time defined campaigns targeted at specific areas in both Local and Regional Drugs Task Force areas.  The NDST have recently been in contact with all Drug Task Forces in this regard.  On receipt of the views of the NDST, and those of the of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I will consider the matter further. </P>

	<P>An application in respect of the Community Centre in question under the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF) was received in November 2006 from Blanchardstown Local Development Group. However, the Development Group subsequently contacted the Department to advise of their intention to withdraw their current application and to submit a revised one, focusing more particularly on the potential of the proposed development in regard to young people at risk in the community. </P><Col N="910"/>

Following appraisal, 126 Projects &mdash; reflecting the amount of funding available &mdash; which scored highest in the appraisal process, were invited to submit business plans.  The application from the project referred to by the Deputy was placed 142 and therefore did not score sufficiently high to be included in the top 126.  An appeal was carried out at the applicant&rsquo;s request. The outcome of that appeal confirmed the original recommendation and, accordingly, the expression of interest was not recommended to business plan stage.</P>

	<P>My Department provides funding for projects through a number of schemes and programmes including &mdash; Community &amp; Voluntary Grants, the LEADER and CL&Aacute;R Programmes and Gaeltacht Schemes.  Funding is also available for projects, such as the one that the Deputy refers to, through the Dormant Accounts Fund.  </P>
        <P>Each of the schemes and grant programmes operated by my Department and by the Dormant Accounts Disbursement Board are governed by rules and eligibility criteria which projects have to meet in order to qualify for funding.  The information attached below may be of assistance to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>A Programme of Grants for Locally Based Community &amp; Voluntary Organisations consists of three Schemes: the Scheme of Refurbishment Grants; the Scheme of Equipment Grants; and the Scheme of Training, Education and Research Grants.  The Scheme of Refurbishment Grants supports the activities of local voluntary and community groups by way of grants for the refurbishment of premises used by such groups. Where disadvantage in the community is being addressed, up to 90% of the cost will be met, subject to a maximum grant of &euro;40,000. Where the application is not from a project which addresses disadvantage but evidence of need has been clearly identified, up to 60% of the cost will be met, subject to a maximum grant of &euro;40,000.</P>
        <P>As such, refurbishment grants are available in respect of existing premises used by locally based organisations. It is not clear, therefore, whether this Scheme would be suitable to the case referred to by the Deputy. Application forms and detailed guidelines, including the criteria against which applications are assessed are available on <Col N="914"/>my Department&rsquo;s website at www.pobail.ie. It is open to the group in question to consider making an application for funding in light of the information regarding eligibility and the assessment criteria.</P>
        <P>Alternatively, it may be appropriate for the project in question to apply to their local LEADER group for funding under the LEADER programme.  If they were to qualify for funding under that Programme, and if they are located within a CL&Aacute;R area, some funding could also be made available from the CL&Aacute;R Programme.  It should be pointed out however, that the LEADER programme is operated in accordance with National and EU operating rules and regulations and any projects funded under the programme must meet the criteria outlined in the programmes rules.</P>
        <P>If the particular project that the Deputy refers to is within a Gaeltacht area, an application could be made under our Aiseanna Caitheamh Aimsire Scheme, and the project in question would be considered for funding.</P>
        <P>Among the funding measures approved by Government for assistance from the Dormant Accounts Fund in 2006 is one which provides small-scale equipment grants and facilities improvement grants to local youth groups and clubs.  The maximum grant available to a group/club under this measure is &euro;5,000.  This funding measure is being administered through local Vocational Education Committees and the process of evaluating applications received is almost completed.  In this regard, it is anticipated that the list of successful applicants will be known shortly.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may access any further information on the grant schemes and programmes operated by my Department on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.pobail.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The extension of Rannach pier on &Aacute;rainn Mh&oacute;r was discussed at a meeting between officials of my Department and Donegal County Council on 18 January 2007.  It was agreed that Donegal County Council should submit an updated fee proposal for consideration by the Department in respect of the appointment <Col N="916"/>of consultants to prepare contract documents and obtain the relevant statutory permissions for the project.  This proposal, when received, will be evaluated in the context of the monies available for island development and the various demands on that funding.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1299 and 1300 together. </P>
        <P>The Irish language centres referred to by the Deputy are a core element of a 5-year language strategy called Gaeilge 2010, which is being promoted by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in co-operation with my Department and local community groups in the Gaeltacht.  The courses available through these centres comprise the graded Teastas Eorpach na Gaeilge/European Certificate of Irish developed by the Languages Centre in the National University of Ireland Maynooth.  This certificate is on a par with accredited certificates for adult language learners in all major European languages.  In 2006, a total of 646 people attended these Irish language courses in 28 centres. 62 teachers have been involved in the delivery of these courses.</P>
        <P>I understand that Tuar Mhic &Eacute;adaigh was included in the first phase of centres that were offered for development by local communities but a difficulty arose in locating suitable premises.  The local community development group, Coiste Pobail Thuar Mhic &Eacute;adaigh, has since identified suitable premises, which is undergoing refurbishment at present.  When the necessary work is completed, Coiste Pobail Thuar Mhic &Eacute;adaigh will be in a position to pursue the setting up of a language centre to cater for 102 people who have indicated an interest in courses in that centre.</P>

	<P>My Department has certain statutory responsibility for the welfare and protection of farmed animals under the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984 and the European Communities (Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. 705 of 2006). In addition there is specific legislation in relation to pigs, calves and laying hens.   Welfare matters are dealt with generally by officers based in my Department&rsquo;s District Veter<Col N="922"/>inary Offices (including Co. Meath) who also have responsibilities in a wide number of other areas related to animal health, disease control etc.  Funding is available to deal with emergency care, feeding, transport etc. of welfare compromised farm animals.   I am satisfied that the resources available within my Department are sufficient to deal with these matters.  </P>
        <P>In 2004 the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council (FAWAC) developed an Early Warning/Intervention System (EWS) for dealing with animal welfare cases.  This involves my Department, Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals.  The objective of the system is to provide a framework within which farm animal welfare problems can be identified before they become critical or overwhelming. The new system allows for concerned individuals to approach their local IFA representatives, their local SPCA or my Department in the knowledge that the matter will thereafter be dealt with in the most effective, timely and sensitive manner.</P>
        <P>The main statutes governing cruelty to animals in this country are the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965. Responsibility for pursuing cases under that legislation rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who may on receipt of a complaint, investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an act of cruelty against an animal. Officers of my Department are regularly involved in assisting the Gardai in such cases.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The area in Meath covered by organic production at the end of 2006 was 785 hectares (1,940 acres), compared with 644 hectares (1,590 acres) in 2005.  While the total area is still small by European standards, 2006 was the second year in succession in which the Irish sector showed significant and encouraging growth.  Nationally, the total area in conversion or with full organic status rose by 15% in 2005 and by a further 14% in 2006.</P>
        <P>My Department already provides substantial financial supports for organic producers, through the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and the Scheme of Grant Aid for the development of the organic sector.  Since REPS began in 1994, it has delivered some &euro;37 million to the sector.  The draft Rural Development Programme for the period 2007&ndash;2013 provides for continued support and increased payments.  In an <Col N="923"/>effort to encourage development in the organic tillage and horticulture areas, I am proposing that organic farmers will be able to obtain organic support payments without having to be in REPS, as they have had to do up to now.  I hope that this initiative will result in a further increase in the land area under organic production throughout the country.  It should be particularly relevant to tillage farmers in Co Meath, who will now be able to convert part of their holdings to organic production without having to put their entire farms into REPS.</P>
        <P>The National Steering Group for the Organic Sector advises me on all policy issues.  Two sub-Groups, the Partnership Expert Working Group and the Organic Market Development Group, support the Steering Group.  The Partnership Expert Working Group is responsible for training, education, advice and research.  The Organic Market Development Group has overall responsibility for developing a national marketing strategy for organic food.  In this regard Bord Bia, in consultation with the Market Development Group, has recently produced a three-year Organic Marketing Plan.  The objective of the plan is to develop the organic sector in Ireland for existing suppliers and new entrants.  My Department has approved funding for the Plan, amounting to a significant sum of &euro;1.5m over the 3-year period.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, has taken steps to raise awareness of organic farming among the mainstream farming community by a demonstration farm programme.  To improve technical expertise among existing organic farmers, my Department and Teagasc arranged for two specialist agronomists from the UK to run a series of farm visits and workshops in 2006, at which they shared their experiences with producers.</P>
        <P>The decoupling of direct payments from production has established a policy framework in which farmers have the freedom to farm in response to market demands.  In this more market-oriented scenario, there is real scope for organic production to expand with the help of the incentives that I have outlined already.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that my Department, in the context of delivering the Single Payment Scheme, is required to carry out on-the-spot inspections on a number of farms covering such issues as eligibility under the Scheme, compliance with EU legislation in the areas of the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health and ensuring that the farm is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition. </P>
        <P>A minimum of 5% of Single Payment Scheme applicants is required to be inspected under the eligibility rule. These checks are carried out to verify that the actual area claimed in the Single Payment Scheme application form corresponds to the area held by the farmer and to ensure there are no overlapping claims, or duplicate claims.  These checks are also designed to confirm that the lands declared for set-aside purposes are maintained in accordance with the provisions of the EU Regulations and that the set-aside obligations are observed. They are also used to verify that the land used to draw down entitlements does not contain land used for fruit and vegetable production, land used for potatoes or land in forestry or other permanent crops in the year of application for the Single Payment.  Up to two-thirds of these inspections are carried out without a farm visit and using the technique of remote sensing.</P>
        <P>The rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance is 1% of those farmers to whom the Statutory Management Requirements (including the Nitrates Directive) or Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition apply. However at least 5% of producers must be inspected under the Bovine Animal Identification and Registration requirements as this level is prescribed under the relevant Regulations.</P>
        <P>In 2006, 7514 farmers have had their holdings selected for on-the-spot inspection out of some 130,000 who have applied for the Single Payment Scheme &mdash; over 100,000 of these are also applicants for the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.  The value of both schemes to Irish farmers is some &euro;1.55 billion in 2006.</P>
        <P>There were 2,271 applicants for the 2006 Single Payment Scheme from Wicklow, a reduction from the 2,422 applications from Wicklow in 2005. Since the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme, there has been a total of 15,849 on-farm inspections in the country as a whole. 422 of these have involved Wicklow applicants and represents 2.7% of all inspections for 2005 and 2006.</P>
        <P>The increase in the number of inspections carried out in Co Wicklow in 2006 over 2005 resulted from the fact that Wicklow was one of <Col N="925"/>the sites chosen for remote sensing in 2006.  Where applicants for the Single Payment Scheme in an area chosen for remote sensing also applied for the Disadvantaged Areas&rsquo; Compensatory Allowance (DAS) my Department had to carry out an on-the-spot inspection to ensure com<Col N="926"/>pliance with Good Farming Practice (GFP) under the DAS scheme.  This will no longer be a requirement from 2007 onwards.</P>
        <P>Nationally the SPS Application and inspection breakdown is as follows:</P><Col N="925"/>

	<P>The person named submitted one application under the 2004 Special Beef Premium Scheme dated 31 December 2004 in respect of thirty-eight animals. Following initial processing, it was found that ten of the animals were non-CMMS compliant, in that they were not recorded as being in the herd of the person named on the date of application, as required under the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme. By letter dated 6 April 2005, the person named was advised of this <Col N="926"/>non compliance and the regulatory penalty to which it would give rise vis the animals in question would be rejected from the application and not paid premium. The person named was also advised of his right to appeal this decision. In the absence of such an appeal, the application was processed for payment and the regulatory penalty, a deduction of 36.36%, applied. The payment issued to the person named on 31 March 2005. In common with other Livestock Premia Schemes, 2004 was the final year of the Special Beef Premium Scheme, with the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme on 1 January 2005. </P>

	<P>The position as regards the welfare and protection of animals is that my statutory responsibility relates to the welfare and protection of farmed animals only and does not extend to other animals. The Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act, 1984 and the European Communities (Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes) Regulations 2000  (SI No 127 of 2000) is the legislation that applies in this area. </P>
        <P>In relation to circus animals, my Department&rsquo;s responsibility relates to ensuring that animals imported for use in a circus are imported in accordance with animal health certification requirements. Licences are issued in accordance with the Rabies (Importation, Landing and Movement of Animals)(Amendment)Orders 1972-1976.   In addition Commission Regulation 1739/2005 lays down registration, passport and animal health requirements in the case of circus animals that move between Member States.</P>
        <P>The Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965 are the principal statutes governing the welfare of animals in this country. The responsibility for pursuing complaints under that legislation rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. On receipt of such a complaint, the Garda&iacute; have a statutory basis on which to investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an act of cruelty against an animal.</P>

	<P>The person named was paid &euro;44,158.18 under the 2005 Single Payment Scheme.  He applied for and was granted a concession under the force majeure provisions of the scheme whereby one year was omitted from the calculation of his reference amount, thereby increasing his overall single payment entitlement.</P>
        <P>He submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category B.</P>
        <P>Category B caters for farmers who made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000-2002.  Investments can include purchase or long-term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.</P>
        <P>The person named applied under Category B(ii)  in relation to the purchase of suckler quota and has been deemed successful under this category.</P>
        <P>However, the Regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme provide that checks must be made to ensure that an allocation from the National Reserve, to an applicant who has already benefited under other measures associated with the Single Payment Scheme, does not result in double benefit. An applicant may only benefit from the measure that is most beneficial. The person named has already benefited from another measure (Force Majeure during the reference period) and an allocation from the Reserve would result in double benefit. Therefore, the National Reserve will not be applied in this case as the Force Majeure measure is more beneficial.  A formal letter outlining this decision will issue shortly to the person named.</P><Col N="929"/>
        <P>The person named has been paid an advance of &euro;21,777.23 in respect of his 2006 Single Payment application.  An application under the Consolidation measure of the 2006 Single Farm Payment Scheme was submitted on 12 May 2006.  It was not possible to process the Consolidation measure prior to the National Reserve measure being finalised.  As this has now been done, the Consolidation measure has been processed and this case is eligible for consolidation. However there is a shortfall of 8.20 hectares because only 4.22 hectares can be accounted for as land farmed during the reference period that is no longer available as a result of the expiry of a rental agreement.</P>
        <P>A letter issued to the person named on 24th January 2007 explaining the position and requesting him to confirm whether he wishes to proceed with his consolidation application or withdraw it. This confirmation is necessary because if the consolidation application proceeds, 3.98 consolidated entitlements to the value of &euro;3,261.13 (in respect of lands not declared on the 2006 Single Payment application) will be lost to the National Reserve.</P>
        <P>The balance of the 2006 Single Payment will issue to the person named when the completed confirmation form is returned to my Department.</P>

	<P>As referred to in my previous response, a herdnumber is an administrative arrangement designed primarily for the purposes of disease control under the disease eradication scheme. Regulation (EC) No. 1760/2000 establishes a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and defines the role of &lsquo;keeper&rsquo; as any natural or legal person responsible for animals whether on a permanent or on a temporary basis including during transportation or at a market. In line with that definition, my Department, as a matter of policy when issuing a herdnumber, registers one individual person as the &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; of the animals. </P>
        <P>The review currently being undertaken involves a thorough assessment of the operational and legal implications of permitting the nomination of more than one person as keeper. This review is not yet completed.</P>

	<P>The compensation package negotiated in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime is worth in excess of &euro;310m to Ireland. It comprises three elements. </P>
        <P>The first element is the sugar beet compensation which has been incorporated into the Single Payment Scheme with effect from 2006. It will be worth approximately &euro;123 million to Irish beet growers over seven years.</P>
        <P>The second element is the EU restructuring aid for the sugar industry, which in Ireland&rsquo;s case is worth &euro;145m approx. In July 2006 the Government made decisions regarding the percentage of this aid to be reserved for beet growers and contractors and the indicative breakdown of the potential allocation of the aid to be followed by Greencore in preparing its restructuring plan. These decisions are now the subject of judicial review proceedings instituted by Greencore in the High Court. Under the EU Regulation, the first instalment of aid would fall to be paid in June 2007.</P>
        <P>The third element of the compensation package is the diversification aid, also provided for in Council Regulation (EC) 320/2006, worth almost &euro;44m in Ireland&rsquo;s case. A national restructuring programme has been prepared and submitted to the EU Commission, in accordance with the EU Regulations, with a view to drawing down the diversification aid. The Regulations provide that payment of this aid would commence in September 2007.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1331 and 1351 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the serious concerns of these poultry producers from my meeting with them last November.  No hardship fund exists to assist procedures in this situation. Many commercial <Col N="934"/>broiler producers, however, who were under contract to Castlemahon have taken the opportunity since the closure of adapting their premises to free-range poultry production units. My Department is in the process of inspecting many of these units with a view to assisting this transition and registering them as free-range producers. I understand that there are more producers showing interest in this area as well.</P>
        <P>In addition to this some commercial broiler producers who were under contract to Castlemahon Foods are now supplying four other major poultry slaughter plants, and this figure may rise.</P>
        <P>The Government and the Industrial Development agencies recognise the need to create employment opportunities in Co. Limerick that will provide sustainable jobs and recent announcements indicate success in this regard.</P>
        <P>A recent example of the attraction of Limerick as a location for new business was the decision by Northern Trust Corporation to create 300 high quality jobs in the financial services sector. Another example is Vistakon which recently announced its intention to expand its Limerick operation and create 120 jobs in high-end manufacturing.</P>

	<P>The position is that my Department, in the context of delivering the Single Payment Scheme, is required to carry out on-the-spot inspections on a number of farms covering such issues as eligibility under the Scheme, compliance with EU legislation in the areas of the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health and ensuring that the farm is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition. </P>
        <P>A minimum of 5% of Single Payment Scheme applicants is required to be inspected under the eligibility rule. These checks are carried out to verify that the actual area claimed in the Single Payment Scheme application form corresponds to the area held by the farmer and to ensure there are no overlapping claims, or duplicate claims.  These checks are also designed  to confirm that the lands declared for set-aside purposes are maintained in accordance with the provisions of the EU Regulations and that the set-aside obli<Col N="936"/>gations are observed.They are also used  to verify that the land used to draw down entitlements does not contain land used for fruit and vegetable production, land used for potatoes or land in forestry or other permanent crops in the year of application for the Single Payment.  Up to two-thirds of these inspections are carried out without a farm visit and using the technique of remote sensing.</P>
        <P>The rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance is 1% of those farmers to whom the Statutory Management Requirements (including the Nitrates Directive) or Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition apply. However at least 5% of producers must be inspected under the Bovine Animal Identification and Registration requirements as this level is prescribed under the relevant Regulations.</P>
        <P>For the 2006 Single Payment Scheme there were a total of 7514 on farm inspections. Breaches found during Cross Compliance Inspections resulted in a total of &euro;706,203.38 being stopped in penalties. This represents just .05% of Ireland&rsquo;s national ceiling of &euro;1.3 billion.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1336, 1337 and 1404 together.</P>
        <P>I would like to assure both Deputies of my continued support for the Native Woodland Scheme. This is an extremely important scheme and I would like to see it enhanced and developed further so that the significant benefits which it brings, particularly in terms of biodiversity, can be maximized.</P>
        <P>The scheme was introduced in 2001 under the terms of the last Rural Development Programme and aimed at protecting and expanding Ireland&rsquo;s native woodland resource and associated biodiversity, through the use of appropriate &lsquo;close to nature&rsquo; silviculture. The scheme provided financial support for landowners to protect and enhance existing native woodlands, and to establish new native woodlands. A detailed manual on the scheme is available from the Forest Service of my Department and I have arranged for a copy to be sent to Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
        <P>The last Rural Development Programme closed on 31 December 2006.  A new Rural Development Plan, covering the period 2007-2013, has been submitted to Brussels and approval is awaited.  Provision has been made in the new Programme to continue the work of the Native Woodland Scheme.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, I am revamping the Native Woodland Scheme and I am considering a number of suggestions to ensure that the scheme remains very attractive. It is my intention to re-establish the Native Woodland Scheme Development Group to guide this process. There will also be detailed consultations with all the relevant stakeholders.</P>
        <P>On the question of consultation, the Forest Service of my Department meets regularly with its stakeholders to discuss a wide range of issues of forestry interest.  The development of the new Forestry Programme for the post-2006 programming period was the focus of much detailed and useful discussion last year and I would be surprised to learn that organizations were unaware that the last Programme ended on 31 December 2006.  In fact, my Department provided specific advice in relation to the preparation and submission of applications for aid under the last Programme in order to ensure that as many as possible could be processed before the end-of-year deadline.</P><Col N="938"/>
        <P>Any approvals which issued prior to 31 December 2006 can be completed in the normal way. Applications in respect of which it was not possible to issue a decision prior to 31 December 2006 continue to be processed by the Forest Service with a view to issuing approvals under the new scheme when agreed, subject of course to the relevant conditions of the new scheme.</P>

Having assessed the application, my Department informed the person named that the circumstances outlined did not fulfill the Force Majeure criteria laid down in Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003.</P>
        <P>The person named then appealed this decision to the Independent Single Payment Appeals Committee. The Committee found that some of the circumstances of the case did constitute Force Majeure and would justify the exclusion of the year 2001 from the calculation of the Single Payment for the person named.  However, on calculation, it was found that the exclusion of 2001 would disadvantage her in terms of the value of her actual entitlement. Accordingly, the Committee recommended that the appeal be disallowed.</P>

	<P>As indicated in an earlier reply to the Deputy, the person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category A.  Category A caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died before 16 May, 2005 and who had leased out his/her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000 to 2002. The person named was not successful under this category as the land acquired was not received free of charge or for a nominal sum.</P>
        <P>The person named submitted an appeal, through his Agricultural Consultant and provided additional documentation in support of his appeal. In all such cases, the procedure is that all contentions put forward in support of an appeal are first of all reviewed within my Department to establish whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant any change to the original decision.  In this regard the documentation provided has been examined and his file has been forwarded to the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee who will carry out a full review of the case and will correspond directly with the person named following the outcome of their review.</P>
        <P>The person named also submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2006 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category B.</P>
        <P>The position is that processing of the 2006 National Reserve applications will commence shortly and a formal letter outlining my Department&rsquo;s decision on the 2006 National Reserve will issue to the person named as soon as his application has been processed.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The person named submitted an application under three measures of the 2005 Single Farm Payment Scheme &mdash; New Entrant, Private Contract Clause and Consolidation.</P>
        <P>The person named was accepted under the New Entrant measure and the number of entitlements granted to him was based on the year 2002. This increased the number of entitlements granted to him from 8.35 standard entitlements to 25.06 standard entitlements. He subsequently had a further 17.88 entitlements added by the way of Private Contract Clause.</P>
        <P>In consequence, the person named increased his entitlements as a result of being accepted under New Entrant and Private Contract Clause. <Col N="941"/>However his Consolidation application has been rejected because there is no loss of land that was farmed during the reference period and which was used to establish his entitlements. To be considered under the Consolidation measure, such lands have to be accounted for as a result of an expired lease/rental agreement; the acquisition of land by a Local Authority for the purpose of a Compulsory Purchase Order  or the afforestation of land under the Afforestation Premium Scheme.</P>

	<P>Most research in the modern biological sciences involves recourse to techniques of biotechnology. Accordingly many of the inter-institutional projects funded by my Department since 1997 under the Research Stimulus Fund Programme (RSFP), the Food Institutional Research Measure (FIRM) and it&rsquo;s predecessor the Non Commissioned Food Research Programme (NCFRP), involved research of a biotechnological nature either in whole or in part.  Consequently over 180 projects funded under these programmes comprise a biotech component, although the extent of that varies considerably from project to project.  In view of the large number of projects involved details will be forwarded to the Deputy when the full list has been compiled. </P>

	<P>The main thrust of the Mid-Term Review proposals of the European Commission favoured the actual farmers, who were farming during the 2000 to 2002 reference period. During the negotiations on the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, Ireland sought accommodation for the successors of retired farmers, whose lands were leased during this reference period. Following the successful conclusion to the negotiations, the implementing Regulations contained provisions, which cater for the allocation of Single Payment entitlements from the National Reserve to the successors of retired farmers when they take over and farm the lands which were leased out during the 2000 to 2002 reference period. </P>
        <P>Furthermore, under the provisions of the Historical Model of the Single Payment Scheme, which was implemented in Ireland, applicants are required to declare an eligible hectare for each Single Payment entitlement held in order to draw down their full payment. Therefore, contrary to expectations this has resulted in an increase in the rental value of leased or rented lands in Ireland since the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme.</P>

	<P>The restructuring aid must be implemented strictly in accordance with the relevant EU Regulations. Under the Regulations, eligibility for the EU restructuring aid for the sugar industry is confined to three categories: processors, beet growers and certain specialised machinery contractors who worked under contract for the growers. Eligible machinery contractors shall be compensated for the loss incurred following the loss of value of specialised machinery, which cannot be used for other purposes. In accordance with the EU Regulations, the Government in July made certain decisions concerning the implementation of the restructuring aid, in particular the percentage to be reserved for beet growers and machinery contractors.  These decisions were announced by press release on 12 July 2006, as I indicated in my reply to the Deputy on 26th July.   The Government decisions are now the subject of Judicial Review proceedings instituted by Greencore Group plc in the High Court.  If the person named was not a specialised machinery contractor who worked under contract for growers, he would not be eligible for compensation under the Regulations.</P>

	<P>The Milk Quota Regime in Ireland is operated at Milk Purchaser/Co-operative level in accordance with the Regulations set by my Department.

        <P>The new Milk Quota Trading Scheme, which has replaced the Restructuring Scheme from the 2007/08 quota year, is also operating at Milk Purchaser level.

This increase was payable to active Scheme participants with effect from 1 November 2006.  However the person named finished his participation in the Scheme on 2 September 2004, and therefore will not benefit from it. </P>

	<P>The European Communities (Natural Habitats) (Amendment) Regulations 2005, had the effect of making the Forestry Acts subject to the provisions of the Habitat Regulations.  In relation to afforestation, all applications are assessed in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Amendment) Regulations, 2001.  This includes screening for EIA.</P>
        <P>Applications for a felling licence are made in accordance with a procedure laid down by the Forestry Act, 1946 (Part IV) Regulations, 1949.  The follow up inspection procedures for approval of licence applications include an assessment of <Col N="952"/>the environmental considerations for the sites in question. This can entail referral of the application to the various consultation bodies such as National Parks and Wildlife Service, Fisheries Boards and Local Authorities for their consideration and recommendations if applicable. Any recommendations made are taken into account by the Forest Service in its decision to grant or withhold a licence.</P>
        <P>Aerial fertilisation of forests must now be carried out under licence.   New Regulations were made in November 2006 to provide for a statutory licensing system for the aerial application of fertilisers to forests.  The Regulations provide for consultation with prescribed bodies and prior assessment where appropriate.</P>
        <P>The Forest Service of my Department continues to keep all of its activities under review to ensure compliance with the habitats legislation.</P>

        <Quest> her plans to address the fact that the national target of 30% broadleaves is a potential threat to Ireland&rsquo;s biodiversity as trees from non-native sources are not necessarily adapted to conditions here and could inter-breed with Ireland&rsquo;s better adapted native stock and weaken its genetic base. </Quest>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1374 and 1375 together.</P>
        <P>I welcome the recognition of these major initiatives to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s environment and biodiversity.  The policy on species in Growing for the Future is to increase the diversity of species in Irish forests.  It includes a target for annual broadleaf afforestation of 20% of the total planted.  This was subsequently increased to 30% in the National Biodiversity Plan published in 2002 and the target was achieved under the last Rural Development Programme.  It remains an objective in the new Programme for 2007-2013.</P>
        <P>The target of 30% broadleaves is not regarded as any threat to Ireland&rsquo;s biodiversity. On the contrary, it represents a major contribution to the creation of a more diverse rural environment and a richer biodiversity.  The most common broadleaf species planted are oak, ash and alder, accounting for circa 90% of total broadleaf planting.  These are all native species.  Furthermore, <Col N="953"/>over 80% of the broadleaves planted under the afforestation programme are now produced from native sources.  The provenances of imported seed are carefully selected to ensure that the progeny can cope with Irish conditions.  I do not accept that there is any threat to the genetic base of our native stock.</P>

	<P>An amount of &euro;818.99 issued on 21 September 2006 in respect of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme 2006.  The person named had no entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme as he was not farming during the reference period. He submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category B.  Category B caters for farmers who made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 &mdash; 2002.  Investments can include purchase or long term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.  </P>
        <P>The person named applied under Category B(i) in relation to investment in land but has been deemed unsuccessful under this category as the date he leased the land was outside the period 1 January 2000 to 19 October 2003.  The person named submitted an appeal against this decision and provided additional documentation in support of his appeal. In all such cases, the procedure is that all contentions put forward in support of an appeal are first of all reviewed within my Department to see whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant any change to the original decision. In this case the documentation was examined by my Department but did not provide grounds for a change to the original decision. This case has since been forwarded to the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee who will carry out a full review of the case and will correspond directly with the person named following the outcome of their review.</P>

I understand from the Department of Finance that the total (gross) receipts were &euro;210.65m, which represents the market value of the assets at the time. I am not in a position to comment on the value of Greencore&rsquo;s assets at the time of closure of its sugar manufacturing operations.</P>
        <P>The compensation provided by the EU by way of restructuring aid for the sugar industry is calculated on a standard basis, namely &euro;730 per tonne of sugar quota surrendered where full dismantling of production facilities is involved.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this amounts to &euro;145m approximately, to be allocated amongst eligible stakeholders in accordance with the EU regulations.  The Government, as required by the regulations, made certain decisions last July regarding the allocation of the aid and in particular concerning the percentage of the aid to be reserved for growers and machinery contractors. These decisions are currently the subject of Judicial Review proceedings instituted by Greencore in the High Court and, in the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</P>

	<P>While the person named submitted an application under the 2005 Single Payment Scheme declaring 36.24 hectares, it was subsequently established that the area which the person named was entitled to claim was 9.15 hectares. The regulatory penalty appropriate in such circumstances, as provided for under Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004, is that the applicant is not entitled to payment in the year of application. In addition, an administrative fine, equivalent to the amount of aid payable on the difference between the area declared and the area found, must be deducted from future payments due to the applicant in subsequent years. As a result of this administrative fine being applied, the person named had his payment under the 2006 Single Payment Scheme reduced by &euro;5,730.62. As the administrative fine has thus been discharged in full, the person named will be entitled to his full payment in 2007, provided he declares an eligible hectare for each entitlement held and otherwise meets the requirements of the Scheme. </P>

	<P>A total of approximately 8,500 hectares was clear-felled by Coillte Teoranta in 2006. All clear-felling of afforested areas by Coillte and others is subject to the licensing conditions as laid down under the Forestry Act 1946.  Licences are issued following detailed inspection and approval of the proposed clear felling sites by the Forest <Col N="960"/>Service Inspectorate and following consultation with the relevant local authorities, who have a particular role where amenity is concerned.  If deemed necessary, on environmental grounds, wider consultations may also be undertaken with other relevant bodies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Fisheries Boards. </P>
        <P>All forestry operations are undertaken in accordance with the principles of Sustainable Forest Management.  Where any area of forest is being felled, a mandatory replanting obligation applies in all but the most exceptional cases.  This is to ensure that the national forest estate is maintained and that the many economic, environmental and public goods which our forests provide are sustained for future generations. The conditions of all felling licences require that the felling and replanting operations must be carried out in accordance with the Forest Service Code of Best Forest Practice and must also comply with the Forest Service guidelines relating to Archaeology, Water Quality, Landscape,  Harvesting and the Environment.   Felling, along with other forestry activities is also subject to the Habitats Regulations.   It should also be noted that Coillte have received Forest Stewardship Council certification in recognition of their commitment to sustainable forest management.</P>

        <Quest> if, in view of the European Council&rsquo;s recent decision to prevent the Com<Col N="961"/>mission overturning genetically modified bans, she will be taking on board the views of the ICSA and local IFA organisations to ensure that agriculture here is GM free. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that legislation governing the cultivation of GM crops in Ireland is based on EU legislation that has been adopted by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament and which, for the most part, is binding on all Member States. Ireland&rsquo;s general position in developing this legislation is informed by the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of the recommendation set out in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Modern Biotechnology that Ireland&rsquo;s stand at EU level and in international fora should be one of being positive but precautionary.  This position acknowledges the benefits of genetic engineering, while maintaining a fundamental commitment to safety and environmental sustainability based on scientific risk assessment and management.  This legislation does not provide for the unilateral declaration of GM free countries.</P>
        <P>I have noted the views of the two farming organisations mentioned by the Deputy on the use of GM technology in agriculture.  The IFA position which is set out in their paper &ldquo;Meeting the Challenges of WTO and CAP Reform &mdash; IFA submission to Government for a Viable Farming and Food Sector and Sustainable Rural Economy&rdquo; (May 2006)  states that &ldquo;Provided that the use and release of GMOs meet all the detailed regulatory requirements, IFA&rsquo;s assessment of GM technology is that, like science and technology generally, it can have many positive implications for agriculture and food production&rdquo;.  The ICSA position as detailed in their submission to my Department on the compilation of the Report  &ldquo;Coexistence of GM and non-GM Crops in Ireland &mdash; Report of the Working Group&rdquo; (September 2005), states that &ldquo;ICSA believe that GM technology offers no benefit and several disadvantages to Irish farmers. The interest of Irish farmers and the wider agri-food sector would, in our view, be better served by developing the clean, green image of the island&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>The position is that an application for <Col N="966"/>the Transfer of Entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme to the person named was submitted on the 8th November 2006.  The application was accepted even though the closing date for receipt of completed applications to transfer entitlements was the 16th of May 2006.  The application has now been fully processed and payment in respect of 18.16 entitlements transferred by way of gift will issue shortly.</P>
        <P>The person named also submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2006 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category B.  Category B caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December, 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.  The position is that processing of the 2006 National Reserve applications will commence shortly and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants at the earliest opportunity.  A formal letter outlining my Department&rsquo;s decision on the National Reserve will issue to the person named as soon as his application has been processed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The position regarding the alleviation of entry fees for the State examinations is that students who are covered by the means-tested general medical services card scheme, either directly or as the dependants of medical card holders, are not liable to pay fees.  Mock examinations are not part of the State examinations system, and therefore my Department has no function in respect of the fees that are charged for these examinations.</P>
        <P>As regards the overall resources available to schools, there have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools.  I wish to draw the attention of the Deputy to my announcement of further significant increases in the context of the 2007 estimates.  From 1 January 2007 the standard per capita grant was increased by a further &euro;18 to &euro;316 per pupil.  In addition, the support services grant was increased by a further &euro;30 for voluntary secondary schools, which includes a further equalisation measure, to &euro;189 per pupil.  For such schools this cumulative increase of &euro;48 per pupil brings the aggregate grant to over &euro;500 per pupil from 1 January.  These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.  For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings the annual <Col N="970"/>grants towards general expenses and support service to over &euro;290,000.</P>

	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance.  The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P>In January 2005, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) issued guidelines to the management authorities of all primary and post primary schools on reporting student absences,suspensions and expulsions.  These guidelines advise that a school must report to the NEWB where a decision has been taken to expel a student. Schools are also required to periodically report to the NEWB on student absences.  There are seven possible categories of absence which are reported on.</P>
        <P>With regard to the specific information requested by the Deputy on the number of children in each county, under the age of 16 years, not attending school, this data is not recorded in the specific format requested.</P>

	<P>The home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that there are currently in the region of 270 children of school going age, who are not attending school, and are availing of home tuition.  The information regarding the breakdown for each county is not readily available in my Department.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance.  The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  The NEWB is a statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) came into operation on 1st January 2005.  One of the specific functions of the NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is to ensure that there is sufficient educational provision available within the primary and post primary sector for all children with special educational needs.  It is open to a parent to contact a school directly with a view to having their child enrolled.</P>
        <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I am most anxious that all children receive an education appropriate to their needs and in co-operation with the relevant agencies ensure that children are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their potential.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1421 and 1435 together.</P>
        <P>My Department is of the view that children with autism, in common with all children should have access to appropriate provision delivered by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where children can mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration. The preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools, a view that is supported by the findings of the Task Force Report on Autism. My Department&rsquo;s ongoing commitment is to ensuring that all children, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders, receive an education appropriate to their needs.</P>
        <P>An application received from the group referred to by the Deputy to participate in the pilot scheme, which has facilitated the establishment of a number of ABA-specific units nationwide, is under consideration by officials in my Department.</P>
        <P>In processing applications for stand-alone facilities, my Department refer the professional reports of the children proposed to be enrolled in the stand-alone facility  to the National Educational Psychological Service.  This is to ensure that the children concerned will be appropriately placed.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) came into operation on 1st January 2005.  The NCSE has a network of local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), whose role extends to ensuring that there is sufficient provision available within the primary and post-primary sector for all children with special educational needs.</P>

	<P>In order to qualify for the special rate <Col N="975"/>of maintenance (sometimes known as the &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; grant) a candidate must meet a number of conditions, including the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. An applicant must qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant.</P>
     <P LI="1">2. Total reckonable income in the relevant tax year must not exceed the lower income limits as set out in the relevant Maintenance Grant Schemes and, where applicable, net of Child Dependent Increase payments.</P>
    <P LI="1">3. As at the prescribed date &mdash; i.e. 31st December each year &mdash; the source of income must include one of the eligible long-term Social Welfare payments.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I understand that the candidate referred to by the Deputy was not eligible for the special rate of maintenance grant as the reckonable income exceeded the prescribed limit for the academic year 2006/2007 which is &euro;16,748.</P>

        <P>This Fund assists students who, having commenced a third-level course, experience financial hardship and, therefore, may be unable to continue their third-level studies. Applications for funding should be made by the individual student to the Access Officer in the institution in which they are studying.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1426, 1427, 1472 to 1477, inclusive, and 1534 to 1536, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware the recent Census preliminary figures confirm the Fingal area of Dublin as the fastest growing area in the country.  The Department is of the view that between primary and post primary level, some 20 new schools will be required there over the coming years.  The challenge is to provide these schools in line with or ahead of demand for pupil places.</P>
        <P>Considerable interventions have already been made by the Department to increase pupil places and these interventions are being backed up by a significant construction programme.</P>
        <P>In this regard, phase two of the building project at Mary Mother of Hope N.S., Littlepace is on schedule to open for September 2007.   This will provide  a new 16 classroom facility for the area.</P>
        <P>In addition, plans are being advanced to provide a new school for Castaheany Educate Together and St. Benedict&rsquo;s National School.  These schools are currently located on a temporary basis on the Mary of Mother of Hope N.S. site.  When they move to their permanent location in Ongar, this will free up the Mary Mother of Hope site considerably.  In the circumstances, the Department has no plans to acquire additional land for the Mary Mother of Hope school.  I would like to point out that this school  will also have the benefit of enhanced shared community facilities under an arrangement with Fingal County Council.</P>
        <P>With regard to the site at Ongar, following pre-planning discussions with the local authority, the 4 acre site is being supplemented with an additional 1.8 acres to improve access and traffic management on the site.  The development of this site for Castaheany Educate Together and St. Benedict&rsquo;s National School will provide a total of 40 classrooms to cater for up 1,000 primary pupils.  These schools will also benefit from enhanced shared community facilities.</P>
        <P>Other developments in the Dublin 15 area at primary level include the planned expansion of St. Brigid&rsquo;s National School in Castleknock, and extensions to St. Brigid&rsquo;s Boys and Girls National Schools in Blanchardstown.  Design teams have <Col N="979"/>recently been appointed for both of these projects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Board of Management of St. Mochta&rsquo;s National School, agreed to expand its school to enable a four stream intake from September 2006.  The extension project for this school as well as one for St Patrick&rsquo;s Junior and Senior Schools, Corduff were also included on the recent list of schools for the appointment of design teams.</P>
        <P>The Department has secured a site in Tyrrelstown to provide permanent accommodation for Tyrrelstown Educate Together NS.   The Department is in discussion with the school in relation to its interim requirement pending the delivery of its new school building which it will be moving to delivery as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>In the Hollywoodsrath area, the Department has requested a site reservation for primary education under the local authority&rsquo;s area development planning process.</P>
        <P>It is intended to deliver a new school there commensurate with the delivery of housing developments.</P>
        <P>Further site reservations will be requested by the Department as the local authority develops out further plans for the general area.  These too will be acquired and developed in line with demand.</P>
        <P>At post primary level, I have given the go-ahead for the delivery of a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school in Phibblestown, Dublin 15.</P>
        <P>This new school will be delivered along with new schools in Donabate and Laytown under a design and build contract that is aimed at delivering 3,000 school places for these rapidly developing areas.  The inclusion of these three projects in one bundle will further facilitate the achievement of value for money.</P>
        <P>The procurement process is well advanced for a Design Team to do the initial design of these 3 new schools. Thereafter, a Design and Build contractor will be appointed to complete the designs and build the new schools.  The Department is working with the relevant parties on the delivery of these projects within the earliest possible timeframe.</P>
        <P>At post primary level in Castleknock, the need for an additional school is being examined.</P>
        <P>With regard to the general situation, the practice has emerged in recent years of parents enrolling their children in more than one school.  This has the result of inflating the number of children apparently seeking places and creates a difficulty in determining the true number of places required.  The Department will monitor the situation closely, as it did in 2006, and liaise with school principals in the area to ensure that all eligible pupils seeking places for 2007 will have access to them.</P>
        <P>In relation to the location of sites being developed by the Department, I have arranged for this information to be forwarded to Deputy <Col N="980"/>Burton separately.  Due to the commercial sensitivities attaching to site acquisition, the Department does not comment on site costs.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the system whereby State examination certificates granted to persons with dyslexia following some modification of the standard exam are qualified by a note of explanation whereas such annotation does not qualify exams taken at university in similar circumstances; the reason she allows the discriminatory practice apply at leaving and junior certificate; and her views on whether similar annotation should apply where students get extra marks for taking an exam through Irish. </Quest>
        <QRef>[43830/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government has shown an unrivalled commitment to ensuring that children and young people with special needs get the extra support they need in order to reach their full potential at school. We have dramatically expanded investment in special education in recent years and we have improved access to the state examinations for young people with special needs.</P>
        <P>Annotations on certificates only apply in situations where a core area of a subject is not assessed, or where the mode of assessment used has the same effect. The scheme was introduced following the report of an expert advisory group, and the introduction enabled opportunities to be provided for exemptions where a candidate was not in a position to demonstrate achievement in a core area of assessment. This change, for example, enabled a hearing impaired student to be exempt for the first time from the aural component of language subjects. His/her marks on the balance of the examination would be grossed up proportionately towards 100%, and the certificate would include a note to the effect that all elements of the subject were assessed except the aural component. Spelling and grammar waivers in language subjects were provided to cater for students with dyslexia on a similar basis, with annotation of the certificates. The aim of these changes was to facilitate the operation of a responsive and flexible system which enables all candidates to demonstrate their achievements, while preserving the integrity and fairness of the exams by ensuring that special arrangements are operated in a transparent manner.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Equality Tribunal&rsquo;s recent findings, the legal position is that they must either be implemented in full or appealed within the specified timeframe under the Equal Status Act 2002. My Department has examined the findings and is concerned both that the widening of access through the use of exemptions coupled with annotations has not been fully understood in this <Col N="981"/>case and that the fundamental nature of the accommodations being provided has been questioned. It has therefore been decided to appeal the findings.</P>
        <P>The policy of awarding bonus marks awards in the state examinations was introduced by the government in the 1920s as one of a number of initiatives to promote the study of subjects through Irish, reflecting the Constitutional position of Irish as the first language. This continues to the present day in the context of wider public policy to promote the Irish language, and is a facility open to all students. In such cases the candidates have been assessed in all components of the examination.</P>
        <P>I am aware that it is not the practice in third level institutions to include notations on certificates. The position is not analogous in that third level awards are not centrally marked and subject to a published marking scheme. As a general rule, third level colleges do not provide for exemptions from a core area of assessment.</P>
        <P>Given that this case is to be appealed to the Circuit Court, it is not appropriate that I make any further comment in the matter.</P>

	<P>The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>If an individual applicant considers that s/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, s/he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
        <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
        <P>However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>

        <Quest> her views on the recently published National Council for Curriculum and Assessment document, Draft Curriculum Framework for Post Primary Guidance; if it is intended to shift the focus of school guidance counselling from one to one encounters to a more classroom based approach; the consultations she has had with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors or other bodies regarding this; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The NCCA has published on its website a draft curriculum framework for guidance in post primary education. This draft document has been sent to all schools and relevant organisations for feedback by the end of February. It was developed through the NCCA&rsquo;s consultative structures, which included representation from the Institute of Guidance Counsellors, and it was approved for consultation by the Council.</P>
        <P>The draft curriculum framework outlines a range of learning experiences for students in the areas of personal guidance, educational guidance and career development.  It reflects the importance of a balanced approach to guidance provision, both in terms of the coverage of a broad range of topics and skills and in terms of student access to guidance across all the years of post-primary education.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the framework is to support schools in developing guidance plans aimed at ensuring all their students have access to appropriate guidance.  It is in keeping with the Guidelines for Second Level Schools on the Implications of Section 9(c) of the Education Act 1998 relating to students&rsquo; access to appropriate guidance published by my Department in July 2005.</P>
        <P>The shift in focus relates to the need to provide guidance to all students and to make it available from the time a student enters second level education.  This calls for balance in the provision of guidance between junior and senior cycle students.  It also requires guidance programmes to be delivered through whole class activities, group work and individual provision.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure that students receive guidance from first year, schools are encouraged to integrate guidance into other areas of the curriculum.  Since many of the expected learning outcomes of guidance programmes are shared by other subject areas, for example, Social, Personal and Health Education, it follows that the planning and delivery of activities to achieve these objectives should take place in a collaborative way.</P>
        <P>Regarding one-to-one encounters, my Department recognises the need for students to have access to individual guidance and counselling either at critical stages in their education or at times of personal crisis.  There is no attempt to diminish the critical role of the guidance counsellor in this process.  Instead, the objective is to ensure that optimum use is made of group settings where these can be effective and that guidance counsellors work collaboratively with subject teachers and other staff members to provide an effective programme for all.  The time available for individual counselling should be determined by the school in the context of the needs of its students and school planning.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new action plan for educational inclusion will focus on addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from preschool through second-level education (3 to 18 years). The action plan provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).</P>
        <P>The DEIS initiative is designed to ensure that the most disadvantaged schools benefit from a comprehensive package of supports, while ensuring that others continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</P><Col N="985"/>
        <P>The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification and review process, 104 schools in the northside of Dublin were invited to participate in DEIS. These comprised 77 urban primary schools and 30 second-level schools. This represents over 13% of all schools included in the DEIS initiative nationwide.</P>
        <P>There are currently 87 of these primary and secondary schools in Rapid or LDTF (Local Drug Task Force) areas on the northside of Dublin.</P>

        <P>Data in relation to waiting lists and the allocation of school places is a matter for the Boards of Management of individual schools.</P>
        <P>Any school can apply to the Department for additional accommodation to meet its needs.  There are a number of ways in which this can be done.  For example, schools were recently invited to apply for capital funding under the Department&rsquo;s Permanent Accommodation Scheme for 2007 to address shortages of accommodation for enrolment increases from 2007/08. Details of successful applications will be published shortly.</P>
        <P>Schools can also submit an application for capital funding under the Department&rsquo;s large scale Capital Building Programme to cater for long term accommodation needs. All such applications are assessed in the context of the existing and projected demographics of an area.</P>
        <P>In addition, where an immediate need for additional accommodation exists, Boards of Management can apply for the provision of temporary rented accommodation.</P>
        <P>The application forms for all of these approaches are available on the Department&rsquo;s website www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>Last week, the Department published its Draft Area Development Plan for school accommodation needs for the North Dublin, East Meath and South Louth area.</P>
        <P>The Draft Plan examines current school provision against projected population growths using, among other sources, local authority area development plans.  It makes recommendations on the extent of additional accommodation needed to meet the long term needs of the areas concerned.  The Draft Plan will show that a significant amount of work is already going on in all the areas concerned including south Louth.  A public consultation process will now be conducted on the Draft Plan by the Commission on School Accommodation.  The Draft Plan is also available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

        <P>The TLT Scheme administered by the VECs on behalf of my Department provide means-tested grants to students who are, generally speaking, pursuing their first undergraduate qualification and who comply with the terms and conditions of the Scheme.</P>
        <P>Clause 3.1 of the TLT Scheme states, inter alia, that: This scheme applies to those who require higher level initial education and training to enhance their employment prospects in line with the Government&rsquo;s sectoral employment priorities and who are entering approved Middle Level Technician (MLT) or Higher Technical and Business Skills (HTBS) courses for the first time in the 2006/2007 academic year or mature candidates re-entering in order to complete such a course.</P>
        <P>Candidates are ineligible if:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />They already hold an Honours Bachelor Degree or equivalent Level 8 qualification</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />They have completed more than the first year of an Honours Bachelor Degree or equivalent Level 8 course</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />they are pursuing a level 8 Honours Bachelor Degree course.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In accordance with clause 3.1 of the TLT Scheme the candidate is ineligible for grant assistance in respect of his current course in Sligo I.T.</P>
        <P>The student referred to by the Deputy may be eligible to apply for the Student Assistance Fund. <Col N="989"/>The objective of the Fund is to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Further information on this fund is available to the candidate from the Student Access Officer in Sligo I.T.</P>
        <P>You will appreciate that the prescribed terms of my Department&rsquo;s Grant schemes are of general application and it is not open to me or my Department to depart from them and make exceptions in individual cases regardless of the circumstances.</P>

	<P>For young parents of school-going age, the most pressing needs are considered to be a sensitive response to their needs, appropriate counselling/mentoring and medical assistance, minimum disruption of tuition, and appropriate access to child care.</P>
        <P>It will be appreciated that no two sets of circumstances will be identical and accordingly, school management practice will vary from case to case. Generally, when it comes to the attention of the school that a pupil is pregnant, the school authorities check to ensure that the girl is receiving appropriate medical assistance and counselling advice. Schools endeavour to be sensitive and understanding to the girl&rsquo;s needs while trying to ensure that her education is not neglected.</P>
        <P>Home tuition is provided to pregnant schoolgirls who are absent from school during the later stages of pregnancy or immediately following the birth of a baby when attendance may be impractical.</P>

	<P>Significant improvements have been made in the staffing of our second level schools in recent years.  In the 2001/2002 school year, there were approximately 24,477 wholetime equivalent teaching posts allocated to second level schools.  For 2006/2007, the corresponding figure is 25,454 wholetime equivalent posts.</P>
        <P>This increase in staffing has dramatically improved the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years.  The pupil teacher ratio has fallen from 13.9:1 in the 2001/2002 school year to 13.2:1 in the 2005/2006 school year.</P>
        <P>Teacher allocations to second level are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment.  In general a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established Junior Certificate, Leaving Certificate, repeat Leaving Certificate and Transition Year Programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Post Leaving Certificate courses and Leaving Certificate Applied.  Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options having regard to <Col N="993"/>pupils&rsquo; needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation.</P>
        <P>The rules for allocating teaching posts provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet essential curricular commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional short term support.  An independent Appeals Committee is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.</P>
        <P>In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1453 and 1648 together.</P>
        <P>In early 2006, I announced an implementation strategy following publication of &ldquo;School Matters&rdquo; the Report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools, and that strategy is now well advanced.</P>
        <P>At the core of the recommendations of the Task Force was the putting in place of a National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS). This has now happened with the appointment of a National Co-ordinator and four Assistant National Co-ordinators. In addition, nine Regional Development Officers and twenty part-time Associates have been recruited to ensure the success of this significant initiative. A key feature of the composition of the National Behaviour Support Service is the assignment to it of a senior psychologist and three psychologists. These have been seconded from the National Educational Psychological Service and their presence will ensure that the team operates in a multi-disciplinary way. A full-time administrator is based in Navan Education Centre.</P>
        <P>Since their appointment, the team has been working on a number of key issues:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. The development of a Draft National Framework for Behaviour Improvement.</P>
        <P LI="1">2. The development of models of good practice for systems in schools which assist with and <Col N="994"/>impact on classroom and whole school behaviour.</P>
        <P LI="1">3. On-going training for the NBSS team.</P>
        <P LI="1">4. Research into and communication with behaviour support systems in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In 2007 Estimates, I am providing &euro;8 million to support the work of the NBSS, in helping schools promote positive student behaviour at second level.</P>
        <P>My Department has issued guidelines to the Management Authorities of second level schools on meeting their obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act to ensure the safety and health of their employees.</P>
        <P>As in other workplaces, staff in second level schools may be victims of violent or intimidating behaviour. During the course of their work, school staff may be at risk in the form of verbal abuse, threats, assaults or other forms of intimidation. This behaviour may come from pupils, parents, guardians, other staff members or visitors.</P>
        <P>While it may not be possible to prevent all such incidents, effective school policies concerning a range of issues can have a positive effect in reducing the risk of such incidents occurring and to minimise their consequences. The close interaction of the school management with staff and parents in developing effective school policies on school discipline, bullying and health and safety contributes to a positive school environment where mutual respect, co-operation and natural justice are accepted features of the school community by all.</P>
        <P>School Management Authorities are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school. The Code should be developed by the Principal and the staff in consultation with parents and approved by the School Management Authority. Parents should be circularised regarding the Code when it is finalised.</P>
        <P>This Code should have as its aim the maintenance of desirable standards of behaviour, particularly in fostering understanding and co-operation between teachers, pupils and parents in helping schools to adapt to the needs of its students while establishing the basis for responsible actions by its students and observing the principles of natural justice. Any sanction imposed on a pupil should be in accordance with the Code of Discipline. Procedures for suspending pupils should be clearly set out in the school&rsquo;s Code of Discipline and should be adhered to. Aggressive, threatening or violent behaviour towards a teacher is regarded as serious or gross misbehaviour and may warrant suspension.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board is currently working on revised Guidelines for <Col N="995"/>Developing School Codes of Behaviour. This work is on-going and I expect that the revised Guidelines will be available later this year.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority has also issued a Code of Practice on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying. It defines workplace bullying as repeated inappropriate behaviour, direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at the place of work and/or in the course of employment, which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the individual&rsquo;s right to dignity at work. An isolated incident of the behaviour described in this definition may be an affront to dignity at work but as a once off incident is not considered to be bullying.</P>
        <P>As a supportive resource, teachers can now access an Employee Assistance Service (EAS) specifically tailored to meet their particular needs. The EAS now available to teachers throughout the country is designed to support the health and well-being of teachers which will in turn positively affect work quality and performance. The service will incorporate confidential counselling on issues such as health, relationships, addictions, bereavement, stress, conflict, critical incident and trauma.</P>
        <P>Services include, single session or short term structured telephone counselling, face to face short term confidential counselling as well as critical incident debriefing.  These services are intended to assist individual teachers and school communities to increase psychological resilience, improve communication, develop positive work relationships and enhance well-being.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yo Si Puedo is a framework for teaching literacy to populations of adults who have had no previous experience of literacy education. It has been adopted or trialled in 22 countries, mainly in Latin America and Africa which have high levels of poverty and low levels of education indicators; their demographic and socio-cultural backgrounds would be largely similar to each other, but very dissimilar to Western Europe.</P>
        <P>According to a UNESCO study on the effectiveness and feasibility of this literacy training method, several of the stakeholders interviewed noted that Yo Si Puedo  &ldquo;lacks the holistic view and approach required to effectively address the diversity in forms of communication, types of languages and varying needs of learners in different sociocultural contexts.&rdquo; It is based on a  very nar<Col N="996"/>row conception of literacy, which excludes numeracy and the wide range of social literacies necessary for participation in a modern complex society.</P>
        <P>Approaches to adult literacy education in Ireland, although sharing some of the audio-visual methodologies of Yo Si Puedos, are based on a model that integrates literacy learning with other aspects of adult education, personal and social development. In contrast, Yo Si Puedo is narrowly focused on teaching and learning discrete reading and writing skills. Therefore it is considered that the Yo Si Puedo approach would not suit the Irish context.</P>
        <P>An increase of &euro;7.5 million, or 21%, is being provided in the budget for Adult Literacy and Community Education, which will allow for 3,000 additional literacy places in 2007. This will bring the total number of literacy places to 38,000.</P>
        <P>With regard to literacy in schools, DEIS, the educational inclusion action plan, is designed to ensure that schools serving the most disadvantaged communities benefit from the maximum level of support available. Achievement of proficiency in literacy and numeracy is a crucial educational objective.</P>
        <P>Under the new National Development Plan 2007-13, the goal is to reduce the proportion of pupils with serious literacy difficulties in primary schools serving disadvantaged communities from the current 27-30% to less than 15% by 2016.  These measures include:</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />additional literacy and numeracy advisers for the Primary Curriculum Support Programme (PCSP) to support and advise schools in adopting an effective whole-school approach.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />extra resources will be made available for intensive professional development programmes for teachers.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />availability of the Reading Recovery and First Steps Programmes will be extended.</P>

     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />whole school literacy strategies under the Junior Certificate School Programme (JCSP) will be further supported and extended (including the extension of the JCSP Demonstration Library Project).</P>

This new school will be delivered along with new schools in Donabate and Laytown under a design and build contract that is aimed at delivering 3,000 school places for these rapidly developing areas. The inclusion of these three projects in one bundle will further facilitate the achievement of value for money.  </P>
        <P>The Phibblestown school has taken longer than expected due to difficulties in acquiring the site. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that as part of my Department&rsquo;s partnership with Fingal County Council the site purchase can now be concluded. The site is almost 8.5 acres in size and the legalities on the site purchase will be completed by County Dublin Vocational Education Committee. My Department has appointed Project Managers to oversee the delivery of these projects and they are currently arranging for the sites to be surveyed.</P>
        <P>The procurement process is well advanced for a Design Team to do the initial design of these 3 new schools. Thereafter, a Design and Build contractor will be appointed to complete the designs and build the new schools.  My Department is working closely with County Dublin and County Meath Vocational Education Committees on the delivery of these projects. Assuming there are no delays during the design and planning permission phases it is envisaged that the schools will be completed as close as possible to the 2009/2010 school year.</P>
        <P>In the meantime my Department has requested the two VECs to submit their interim accommodation requirements so that the new schools can become operational in advance of the com<Col N="999"/>pletion of the new permanent school buildings. The Department will ensure that these interim accommodation requests will be dealt with speedily and positively in order to ensure that appropriate school provision is in place in these rapidly developing areas.</P>

A specific function of the NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) is to identify appropriate educational placements for all children with special educational needs.

        <P>I can confirm that the pupil in question is enrolled in a special class in a mainstream school.

        <P>It is open to the parents to contact the SENO directly regarding the child&rsquo;s needs. Contact details for the SENO may be sourced from the NCSE at (046) 9486400. Alternatively, these details may be accessed on the NCSE website at www.ncse.ie.</P>

	<P>The new action plan for educational inclusion DEIS (Delivering Equality of Oppor<Col N="1002"/>tunity in Schools) aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people, from pre-school to completion of upper second-level education (3 to 18 years), from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. </P>
        <P>Some 873 schools were selected to participate in the new School Support Programme under DEIS.  These comprise 670 primary schools (338 urban/town schools and 332 rural schools) and 203 second-level schools.</P>
        <P>Under the action plan, a continuing emphasis will be placed on the development of programmes by building on the existing work of the Home School Community Liaison Scheme and the School Completion Programme in extending access to in-school, after-school and out-of-school activities.</P>
        <P>Therapeutic supports are offered through the School Completion Programme as part of in-school activities to targeted young people at risk of early school leaving. In addition, grants amounting to approximately &euro;13.4 million for 670 Primary schools and 203 Post Primary schools and 80 Post Primary Schools receiving grants under pre-existing schemes to assist them with their respective levels of disadvantage and a further &euro;4.1 million to 1,900 primary schools to assist them with their respective levels of dispersed disadvantage will have issued in 2006/2007 school year and are administered locally by schools. It is a matter for the individual schools to decide how best to apply the funding in providing activities to address educational disadvantage among their pupils, which can include providing therapeutic supports, particularly if pupils present with emotional and behavioural difficulties.</P>
        <P>Where required specialists are employed by projects/schools to provide play therapy, art therapy, dance therapy and music therapy etc.  These interventions are most commonly provided in schools over a short period of time in an attempt to help young people to identify and manage problems they are facing in their lives.  In many cases the aims of such interventions is to slowly integrate the child back into the classroom, to become a less disruptive force, build more positive relationships with peers and generally develop a more lasting attitude to school life.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1478 to 1516, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The details for the current school year (2006/2007) are currently being compiled by my Department and the information requested is not readily available.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
        <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased <Col N="1009"/>resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

        <Quest> the number of trainee physiotherapists currently being educated; the number of third level bodies that provide training courses in physiotherapy; if she has plans to increase the output of qualified physiotherapists in view of the chronic shortage of such skilled professionals; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In May 2002 my Department approved the provision of 175 additional therapy entrants to tackle the shortages of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists as identified in the report &ldquo;Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists&rdquo;, which was undertaken by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates in 2001.</P>
        <P>Within this provision there was an annual increase of entrants of 25 approved for Physiotherapy. This increased intake will result in a significant increase in the number of Physiotherapists graduating from the third level sector. Courses in Physiotherapy are available in University College Dublin, Trinity College and the University of Limerick.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are no plans to further increase the intake into physiotherapy courses at present. The following table shows the student numbers on physiotherapy courses in the 2005/06 academic year.</P><table><P>Physiotherapy Academic Year 2005-2006</P>

        <asker>Mr. Kenny</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if there are proposals under consideration by her Department to amend the arrangements under which schools can employ secretarial staff; if her Department makes pension arrangements in respect of school secretaries; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[1341/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in the case <Col N="1010"/>of secondary schools under two separate schemes. One is the 1978/79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in secondary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. The 1978/79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.</P>
        <P>The 1978/79 scheme has been superseded by a more extensive school support grant scheme towards the funding of ancillary services in schools including secretarial services. The scheme is flexible in nature giving Boards of Management and schools discretion as to the manner in which these services are provided.</P>
        <P>Under that scheme each school receives a grant from my Department for the provision of secretarial and other ancillary services. It is a matter for each school to determine how best to meet its secretarial requirements. My Department has no direct role in the pay or conditions of service of secretaries employed directly by schools under these arrangements.  There are no proposals at present to change this position.</P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. I wish to draw the attention of the Deputy to my announcement of further significant increases in the context of the 2007 estimates. From 1 January 2007 the standard per capita grant has been increased by a further &euro;18 to &euro;316 per pupil. In addition, the support services grant has been increased by a further &euro;30 for voluntary secondary schools, which includes a further equalisation measure, to &euro;189 per pupil. For such schools this cumulative increase of &euro;48 per pupil will bring the aggregate grant to over &euro;500 per pupil from 1 January 2007. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings the annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over &euro;290,000.</P>
        <P>The provision that I have made, in the context of the 2007 estimates, for these significant increases in the funding of voluntary secondary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

        <Quest> if, further to her Department&rsquo;s decision to admit special needs assistants employed in primary schools to membership of the superannuation scheme, further personnel employed at schools are under consideration for admission to this scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>In 2006 my Department introduced a contributory superannuation scheme for certain caretakers employed in primary schools.  The caretakers concerned are those who are <Col N="1011"/>employed under the 1979 Scheme. The superannuation scheme provides that membership will be effective from 1 September 2001 in the case of eligible caretakers in employment at that time. </P>
        <P>I should add the 1979 scheme is being phased out. It has been superseded by a more extensive school support grant scheme towards the funding of ancillary services in schools, including caretaking services. The grant scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives management authorities discretion as to the manner in which caretaking service, among other services, are provided.  Staff engaged by schools under the grant system are paid by the management authorities of the schools and are non-pensionable.</P>
        <P>Arising from recent pension reforms and in conjunction with the coming into effect of the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act 2001 and the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 arrangements are being finalized to admit to ongoing pensionability part-time staff whose wholetime comparators have already had access to a pension scheme. In this connection substitute service given by primary teachers will be pensionable on an ongoing basis with effect from 1 September 2001. Pensionability is also being extended to unqualified teachers who are in service on or after 1 September 2001. A circular setting out the detailed arrangements is being prepared and will be issued shortly.</P>

	<P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary schools under two separate schemes.  One is the 1978 scheme under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. These secretaries are paid directly through my Department&rsquo;s payroll. The 1978 scheme is being phased out.  The new Ancillary Services Grant scheme has superseded the 1978 scheme. </P>
        <P>The new Ancillary Services grant scheme is a more extensive scheme covering the funding of ancillary services in primary schools, including secretarial services. The scheme is flexible in nature giving Boards of Management and schools discretion as to the manner in which secretarial services are provided.</P>
        <P>Under the new scheme the arrangement is that each school receives a grant from my Department for the provision of secretarial and other ancillary services.

My Department has no direct role in the pay or conditions of service of secretaries employed directly by schools under these arrangements.</P><Col N="1012"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1521 and 1641 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism receive an education appropriate to their needs, preferably through the primary and post primary school network. My Department supports a multi-skills approach in regard to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods are available e.g. Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), ABA (Applied Behavioural Analysis), Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). This ensures that a range of teaching methods can be applied specifically to the needs of individual pupils. In this regard my Department has established:</P>
         <?oasys _cl11- ?><P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />180 special classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />5 special classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />16 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />14 Stand Alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology on a pilot basis &mdash; 2 of these facilities have yet to be established.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My Department is of the view that children with autism, in common with all children should have access to appropriate provision delivered by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where children can mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration. Pupils with autism who are fully integrated into mainstream school receive individual teaching support for a number of hours per week as well as support from special needs assistants and specialist equipment if required. As a further support, many smaller schools which have autism <Col N="1013"/>units can now have an administrative principal to assist with the establishment and running of specialist intervention locally.</P>
        <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s professionals have reviewed research on educational interventions for children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD).  It is clear that this research does not support the exclusive usage of applied behaviour analysis (ABA) as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. Rather the research supports the position that educational intervention for children with ASD needs to be child-centred and individual &mdash; tailored to meet the needs of each child &mdash; rather than matching the needs of a child to one particular version of one intervention.</P>
        <P>Additional training supports for staff engaged in the education provision for children with special needs including autism can be accessed through the Special Education Support Service (SESS). The service will, as appropriate, consolidate, co-ordinate, develop and deliver a range of professional development initiatives and support structures to the relevant staff.</P>
        <P>My Department is of the opinion that teachers need to have a knowledge and understanding of general teaching principles and approaches as well as additional training in the range of approaches which are appropriate for teaching children with ASD.  Teachers who have pupils with autism receive additional training in a range of educational and behavioural interventions including TEACCH, PECS and ABA.  Each of these approaches can assist a child with ASD achieve their potential.</P>

	<P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in second-level schools is the responsibility of the school management authorities. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. </P>

	<P>My Department has no record of receiving complaints in relation to minority religions trying to impose their views on the religious ethos of Catholic schools.</P>
        <P>Pupils and parents enjoy a number of legal rights regarding their choice of school for primary education. These derive from the Constitution, legislation and my Department&rsquo;s rules. Statutory rights to choice of school derives from the Education Act 1998, section 6 of which provides for a number of objects to which those concerned with the implementation of the Act must have regard, including promoting &ldquo;the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents&rsquo; choice having regard to the rights of patrons and the effective and efficient use of resources&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Existing legislation acknowledges the rights of the individual with regard to values and beliefs and makes provision for the wide range that now exists in Irish society. Under Section 30 of the Education Act (1998), no student can be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student. The Act also requires that, in prescribing curricula for recognised schools, as Minister I <Col N="1018"/>must take due account of the characteristic spirit of a school or type of school.</P>
        <P>Section 15 of the Act requires boards of management of schools to uphold and be accountable to the Patron for upholding the characteristic spirit of the school including the moral, religious, social, educational and spiritual values which inform the ethos of the school.</P>
        <P>My Department recognises the rights of the different church authorities to design curricula in religious education and to supervise their teaching and implementation. This right is enshrined in the Education Act (1998).  Consequently, although religious education is part of the Curriculum for Primary Schools and schools are obliged to allocate 30 minutes per day for religious instruction, the content of the religion programme is determined by the Patron of the school.</P>

	<P>The home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home <Col N="1021"/>for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.</P>
        <P>Having reviewed a number of applications for home tuition, details regarding the qualifications of some of the proposed tuition providers gave rise to concern. The Deputy will appreciate, that as home tuition takes place outside of the normal school framework, there is need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned. The usual requirement is a fully qualified teacher. However, other qualifications are acceptable depending on the individual needs of the child. A comprehensive review of qualifications has taken place in consultation with my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate resulting in a definitive list of qualifications acceptable under the scheme as appropriate to the individual pupils. In this context the clarity that now exists in relation to qualifications should assist the parents concerned in sourcing suitable tutors.</P>
        <P>Nominated tuition providers with qualifications other than teaching qualifications have been accepted for the first school term this year to allow time to undertake the review. In cases where the tuition provider is not approved a direction has been given to recruit a tuition provider with suitable qualifications. However my Department is prepared to facilitate parents/guardians who experience difficulties in recruiting a tuition provider with suitable qualifications by extending the sanction with the current tuition provider until the end of the school year 2006/07 to facilitate the recruitment process.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the parents/guardians of all children who are sanctioned home tuition for the 2007/2008 school year will be obliged to recruit a suitably qualified tuition provider in line with my Department&rsquo;s guidelines.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) came into operation on 1st January 2005. One of the specific functions of the NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is to ensure that there is sufficient educational provision available within the primary and post primary sector for all children with special educational needs. It is open to the parent to contact a school directly with a view to having their child enrolled. Contact may also be made with the relevant SENO through the NCSE, Mill Street, Trim, Co.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1546 and 1547 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in accordance with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students in higher education. This will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administration system which will facilitate consistency of application, improved client accessibility and ensure the timely delivery of grants to those who need them most. This is part of my overall plan to introduce service improvements in the administration of the student grant schemes. These will include guaranteed timeframes for the earlier payment of grants, an independent appeals procedure and more efficient arrangements for handling applications and making payments.</P>
        <P>To effect these administrative and service improvements requires the introduction of a new statutory basis for the scheme to replace the existing arrangements which involve a mix of statutory and non-statutory administrative schemes. Accordingly, the Government has approved the drafting of a new Student Support Bill which will place all student support schemes on a statutory footing for the first time, including providing for the designation of an appropriate awarding authority and for the general basis on which grants will be awarded to eligible students.  Work on the Bill is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill early in 2007.  The maintenance grants are reviewed annually and improvements made as necessary, having regard to available resources.</P>
        <P>My Department has, as I have indicated previously, engaged in substantial consultations with the key stakeholders, including students in order to map the most logical and effective arrangements for the future structure and administration of the student support schemes.  This process of consultation is on-going. Implementation of the Bill when enacted, will take place in consultation with the relevant stakeholders to ensure an orderly transition and minimise disruption to students.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made by this Government in both the income limits and the payment levels for third level grants. </P>
        <P>It has been the practice in recent years to increase the level of maintenance grants annually, <Col N="1025"/>at least in line with inflation.  This year, in line with this policy, I  announced increases of 3% in the ordinary maintenance grant to give a maximum grant of &euro;3,110 in the 2006/07 academic year.</P>
        <P>In addition, the reckonable income limits for ordinary maintenance grants have been increased by 5.3% for the 2006/07 academic year. This increase exceeds the increase in the average industrial wage for the September to September reference period. The top limit for grant eligibility where there are less than four dependent children has been increased from &euro;44,350 to &euro;46,700, ensuring that a significantly higher number of students from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the Student Service Charge of &euro;800.</P>
        <P>Special Rates of Maintenance Grant, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, were introduced with effect from the 2000/01 academic year. This year&rsquo;s schemes are giving particular priority to addressing inequities in participation of students from the lower socio-economic groups through both rate and threshold increases in the Special Rates of Maintenance Grant. The annual income threshold for the special rate of grant was increased by 7.18% to &euro;16,748. It is estimated that over 12,500 students in receipt of the special rate element of maintenance grants will see this grant increased by 22.48%, with the maximum rate for the 2006/2007 non-adjacent grant increased to &euro;5,970.   The maximum rate for the 2006/2007 adjacent rate increased to &euro;2,390.</P>
        <P>Under my Department&rsquo;s student maintenance grant schemes, I am committed to ongoing improvements in the student support schemes including increasing the rates and income limits, as resources permit.</P>

	<P>My Department is managing a focused programme of investment in measures from early education to improve access to and participation in higher education by students from under-represented groups in that sector. </P>
        <P>There are clear indications that the increased investment of resources in this area over the last decade and more is now paying dividends and that targets for participation in higher education that were set in the 2001 Report of the Action Group on Access to Higher Education and the <Col N="1026"/>last National Development Plan 2000-2006 have been reached.  For example, participation by mature entrants to full-time higher education has grown from 4.5% in 1998 to almost 10% in 2006. Students with a disability have risen from 0.8% of the undergraduate population in 1998 to<?oasys _jy ?>2.4%. Surveys conducted by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) also indicate that access to higher education by young people from under-represented socio-economic groups continues to improve.  For example, in 2004 between 33% and 40% of young people from the semi- and unskilled socio-economic group nationally went on to study in higher education compared to only 23% in 1998.  These targets will be reviewed and new targets developed in 2007, particularly as linked to the implementation of the new National Development Plan 2007-2013.</P>
        <P>The access programmes of third level institutions are targeting students in the first and second level sector, adult learners returning to education, learners with a disability, members of the travelling community and more recently members of new migrant communities in Irish society.  In 2003, the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education was established as part of the HEA to co-ordinate and develop policy and funding measures to improve access to higher education by under-represented groups to all publicly funded third level institutions.  A new funding model, being phased in by the HEA  from 2006 onwards, will reflect further progress by higher education institutions in improving access for these groups.</P>
        <P>In addition to the very substantial student support measures managed by my Department, including the targeted special rate of maintenance grant, in 2006 the National Office managed the allocation of over &euro;16 million in Third Level Access funding for the direct support of students through the Fund for Students with a Disability, the Student Assistance Fund and the Millennium Partnership Fund.  This led to improvements in the timing and guidelines for the allocation of these funds.  In 2006, over 2,000 students with a disability received funding from the Fund for Students with a Disability &mdash; an increase of some 330 students (20%) over the previous year.</P>
        <P>The National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education is currently implementing a three-year Action Plan for the period 2005-2007.  One of the key outcomes of this plan has been the first national evaluation of higher education access programmes.  A practical framework of policies and initiatives that are required for a successful access programme has emerged from this evaluation process.  This framework will underpin and inform the work both of my Department and of the National Office and its partners in the higher education sector going forward. Implementation and the monitoring of progress will also be linked to the strategic development and allocation of core funding, including access fund<Col N="1027"/>ing, by the HEA and the allocation of increased third level access funding through the new National Development Plan 2007-13.</P>

	<P>The position is that teaching practice is an integral part of the curriculum for the training of both primary and post-primary teachers and, as such, my Department does not provide special financial assistance for students towards costs associated with teaching practice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware that teacher education programmes provided in approved third level institutions are, however, approved courses for the purposes of the Higher Education Grants Scheme. Under the terms of the Scheme, grant holders who are required to participate in off-campus placement as part of their course of study may have their grant entitlement paid in the normal manner.  Accordingly, student teachers who are eligible for grant assistance continue to receive their entitlements while undertaking teaching practice.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department allocates funding each year to third level institutions under the Student Assistance Fund. This fund is available in order to assist students who may be experiencing difficulties in continuing their studies because of financial hardship. The disbursement of this funding is a matter for individual institutions in line with guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that student teachers on teaching practice placements in schools are assessed on the quality of their work.</P>
        <P>My Department has no plans to introduce an additional scheme of financial assistance, over and above the current provision, in relation to the training of teachers.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1552 and 1636 together.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the concerns of school communities regarding vandalism of school property and security. Individual school authorities are responsible in the first instance for health and safety issues, including making adequate security arrangements, at schools. School authorities should liaise with their local Gardai who are best placed to provide practical advice and support and to make recommendations on how best to mitigate the potential risk to the school.</P>
        <P>Primary school authorities may use their minor works grant in conjunction with any insurance policy payments to deal with urgent issues relating to security matters. In November last I increased funding for the minor works grant by 44% on the previous year and around &euro;27m was paid out to primary schools throughout the country to enable thousands of small scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department.</P>
        <P>Other avenues for grant-aid from my Department to provide improved security measures include the Summer Works Scheme and Emergency Works Grants. With regard to the Summer Works Scheme, I recently announced that 1179 projects at close to 1000 schools, both primary and post-primary, will be funded this year at a total cost of just under &euro;120m.</P><Col N="1029"/>
        <P Just="Left">In 2007, &euro;305 million will be spent on projects in primary schools, while &euro;229 million is being allocated to schools in the post primary sector. Since 1997 a total of &euro;3 billion has been invested in school buildings and this has delivered over 7,800 school building projects. This further investment of &euro;534m will build on these achievements and will focus in particular on the provision of school accommodation in areas where the population is growing at a rapid rate.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset, I would like to inform the Deputy that the formal recognition of Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), as per Departmental Circular SP ED 02/05, is a matter for clinical psychologists or other relevant professionals, but not frontline educational professionals such as teachers.  Frontline education professionals are trained to recognise the signs and difficulties associated with ASDs in order for them to facilitate the referral of pupils with ASDs for appropriate assessment. </P>
        <P>The existing pre-service teacher training programmes in the Colleges of Education (primary teacher training) include specific elements aimed at enabling all student teachers to recognise and deal with children with special educational needs, including pupils with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD).</P>
        <P>At second level, there are elements to both the Higher Diploma in Education and the Education Degree programmes in the University of Limerick, as part of a general alertness orientation programme, on the variety of learning difficulties which pupils may have &mdash; this also covers the issue of ASD.</P>
        <P>My Department holds ongoing discussions with the Colleges of Education and Universities to ensure that appropriate responses are made at pre-service level in relation to the continuing needs of all trainee teachers to acquire knowledge of, and familiarity with, the needs of pupils with special educational needs, including ASD.</P>
        <P>I would like to point out that my Department has developed a strategy to meet the continuing professional development of teachers working with pupils with special educational needs.  This strategy has resulted in a major expansion in the range of post-graduate professional development programmes for teachers.  These programmes, which are available annually, include the &ldquo;Masters in Special Educational Needs (MSEN)&rdquo;, &ldquo;Combined Post-Graduate Diploma Programme of Continuous Professional Development for Teachers involved in Learning Support and <Col N="1030"/>Special Education&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Graduate Certificate Course in the Education of Pupils with Autism&rdquo;.  It is a central feature of all these courses that teachers are given the necessary skills and expertise to recognise Autistic Spectrum Disorders as well providing the training to meet the needs of students with ASD and special educational needs in general.</P>
        <P>Ongoing support in the area of Special Educational Needs is provided by the Special Education Support Service (SESS). The SESS was established as part of the Department&rsquo;s overall strategy continuing professional development of teachers working with pupils with special educational needs and it undertakes a number of approaches to address the training needs with a view to enhancing the teaching and learning for children with special educational needs. The SESS provides a dedicated support team of expert teachers delivering a range of supports to schools through seminar delivery and individual school visits. In 2006, over 4,000 training places were funded by the SESS to enable teachers access a range of autism training.  The recognition of Autistic Spectrum Disorders forms an integral part of all supports provided by the SESS.  This support and training in the recognition of ASDs informs training across the educational spectrum, both in mainstream and special schools.  Given the training and support available, I am satisfied that there is comprehensive training and support available to all frontline education professionals in the recognition of Autistic Spectrum Disorders.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware my Department and the Department of Education in Northern Ireland are jointly engaged in the development of the Middletown Centre for Autism in County Armagh. Both Departments have jointly funded the purchase of the former St. Joseph&rsquo;s Adolescent Centre, Middletown and plan to refurbish the property with a view to developing a Centre of Excellence for children and young people with autism throughout the island of Ireland. The Centre will be dedicated to improving and <Col N="1031"/>enriching the educational opportunities of children and young people with Autistic Spectrum Disorders. Four key services will be provided by the Centre:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a learning support service (on a residential basis),</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />an educational assessment service,</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a training and advisory service, and</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />an autism research and information service.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Centre will be run by a limited company and requires a Board of Directors which will be provided for under a Memorandum and Articles of Association.  I am satisfied that these arrangements will ensure the strategic delivery of services from Middletown across the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the CEO for the Middletown Centre has been selected and it is expected that appointment to the position will made in April of this year.</P>
        <P>Officials from both Departments are working closely on this project and this interaction between the two Departments will continue over the coming months with a view to ensuring that the Centre becomes operational as quickly as possible.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>A decision was taken by the Trustees of the school to which the Deputy refers that it will close in June 2007. </P>
        <P>This decision was taken because, in line with demographic changes in the area, the school has experienced a steady decline in enrolments in recent years. Current enrolments in feeder primary schools indicate that this decline will continue.</P>
        <P>In fact, a general decline in enrolments in the area where the school is located has resulted in spare capacity of an estimated 2,300 places at post primary level.</P>
        <P>Coupled with the decline in enrolments, the Department was also concerned about the ability of the school in question to offer a broad and balanced curriculum given the relatively small number of pupils enrolled.</P>
        <P>In all of the circumstances, the Department concurred with the Trustees decision to close the school.</P>
        <P>When it closes, ownership of the school property, which is currently vested in the trustees, will <Col N="1032"/>revert to the Department. In the period leading up to the closure, the Department will consider all available options with regard to its future use.</P>
        <P>Given the extent of spare capacity at post primary level in the general area, the Department does not envisage any difficulty in the residue of pupils securing alternative places.  Normally a closing school assists its pupils to secure places in the event of any difficulty arising.</P>

        <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have approved funding for 641 primary and 324 post-primary schools around the country to complete 1,137 essential small scale capital projects under the 2007 Summer Works Scheme.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the campaign referred to by the Deputy and I wish to stress that the Government and I are committed to continually improving our higher education sector.</P>
        <P>Higher education in Ireland has come through a period of major expansion.  More than 30,000 new third level places have been created since this Government took Office in 1997 and there are now some 168,000 students in the system.  The most recent participation study confirms the continuing trend.  It shows that the national admission rate was 55% in 2004, up from 44% in 1998.  Overall investment in the sector on a per annum basis has more than doubled over that period.  This now stands at some &euro;1.9 billion for this year.</P>
        <P>Support for reform and development at third level and the creation of world class excellence at fourth level are now central Government priorities.  The new National Development Plan 2007-2013, which was announced recently, recognises the critical role of higher education in the national innovation system that will be the basis of Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development. The Plan identifies the full funding of the sector <Col N="1038"/>&mdash; over &euro;13 billion through the period &mdash; as a key strategic investment under the Plan.</P>
        <P>The ongoing development and expansion of the sector under the Plan will be supported by enhanced investments in the development of campus infrastructure &mdash; with an almost &euro;2 billion dedicated building programme &mdash; and through further support for the programme of reform and development that is underway in the sector. Over &euro;510 million has been provided under an extended Strategic Innovation Fund, which will support institutional reforms, promote innovations in teaching and learning, widen access and enable the development of world class Fourth level activity.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have also been made by this Government in both the income limits and the payment levels for third level grants.  This year I announced increases of 3% in the ordinary maintenance grant to give a maximum grant of &euro;3,110 in the 2006/07 academic year. In addition, the reckonable income limits for ordinary maintenance grants have been increased by 5.3% for the 2006/07 academic year.  The top limit for grant eligibility where there are less than four dependent children has been increased from &euro;44,350 to &euro;46,700.</P>
        <P>Special Rates of Maintenance Grant, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, were introduced with effect from the 2000/01 academic year. This year&rsquo;s schemes are giving particular priority to addressing inequities in participation of students from the lower socio-economic groups through both rate and threshold increases in the Special Rates of Maintenance Grant. The annual income threshold in 2006/07 for the special rate of grant has been increased by 7.18% to &euro;16,748. The maximum rate of the &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grant has been increased by some 22.5% bringing the adjacent grant rate to &euro;2,390 and the non-adjacent grant rate to &euro;5,970.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The targeted investments that this Government is now making in our higher education infrastructure, in promoting excellence through system wide collaboration and change, in widening access and in creating a vibrant fourth level sector is a clear demonstration of this Government's support for the higher education sector.</P>

        <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the recent publication of the Mature Student Directory of Irish Third Level Institutions; her views on whether this will become a valuable resource for many; if she will confirm that her Department will support the publication with appropriate funding; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>A Mature Student Directory was published last October by the Network of Irish Mature Student Officers (NIMSO).  It provides information on courses, admission requirements and the financial and academic supports for adults who are considering entry to higher education.  A recent evaluation of higher education access programmes by the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education of the Higher Education Authority (HEA) identifies better communication with prospective students as a key element of best practice and partnership between an institution and the wider community in which it operates.</P>
        <P>In 2006, over &euro;8million in funding for access activities, including the provision of information and guidance resources for mature students, was allocated as part of the mainstream, core grant of the seven universities and other HEA-funded institutions. This funding builds on almost &euro;45million in targeted initiative funding for the development of access programmes and infrastructure allocated to HEA institutions between 1996 and 2005.  Some 30% of this funding was designated specifically for initiatives targeting increased participation by mature students.</P>
        <P>Funding for access and retention activities in the Institute of Technology sector (currently &euro;1.3million per annum) is also allocated by my Department.  Under recent legislation, the institutes have been designated as HEA-funded institutions and in the future, mainstream funding for the institutes, including access funding, will be allocated by the HEA.  Access and life-long learning strategies of the universities and the institutes of technology are also being supported through the Strategic Innovation Fund.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first allocation of &euro;42 million under this fund was made by the HEA in 2006, &euro;10 million of which is for projects supporting access and lifelong learning.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The recommendations of the Task Force on Autism suggest that for planning purposes my Department should assume a prevalence rate of 56 children in 10,000 have Autistic Spectrum Disorders which equates to 1 in 178 children.  This is not dissimilar to the prevalence rate in the United States which is 1 in 166 children.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department and the Department of Education in Northern <Col N="1040"/>Ireland are jointly engaged in the development of the Middletown Autism Centre in County Armagh. The Centre of Excellence will be dedicated to improving and enriching the educational opportunities of children and young people with Autistic Spectrum Disorders. One of the key services to be provided by the Centre is an autism research and information service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The training research and information service division will establish links throughout Ireland with appropriate bodies in the area of autism. This division will provide a forum for the discussion of relevant research findings and a platform for national and international experts in the field of autism. I am confident that the Centre of Excellence with its proposed local and regional links will enhance services for pupils with autism throughout Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the functions of the National Council for Special Education include conducting and commissioning research on matters relevant to the functions of the Council and, as it considers appropriate, to publish in such form and manner as the Council thinks fit the findings arising out of such research.</P>

	<P>At primary level, three new schools have been provided in the Dublin 4 area within the last ten years &mdash; Gaelscoil Lios Na N&oacute;g, John Scottus NS and Ioclainn na Pailirise NS. In addition four new classrooms are being provided at St Mary&rsquo;s Central National School, Donnybrook and one classroom plus ancillary accommodation is to be provided at St Matthew&rsquo;s National School, Sandymount.  In the Dublin 6 area two new schools have been provided in recent years &mdash; Cheeverstown Special School and Gaelscoil Mologa. In addition, an extension project for the Presentation Primary School in Terenure is at an advanced stage of architectural planning.</P>
        <P>These are practical examples of the extent of the extra provision being made in terms of additional school places throughout the area.  These and many other initiatives represent huge capital investment and demonstrate the commitment to meeting the needs of the area concerned. The Department is satisfied that there is considerable spare capacity in the Dublin 4 and Dublin 6 areas. The Department&rsquo;s responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places. <Col N="1041"/>This approach ensures that the use of existing accommodation is maximised and that the development and support of one school over others does not occur.</P>
        <P>The School Planning Section of the Department will keep the position under review to ensure that any additional emerging needs are met as expeditiously as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1590, 1591 and 1667 together.</P>
        <P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In January 2005, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) issued guidelines to the management authorities of all primary and post primary schools on reporting student absences, suspensions and expulsions. These guidelines advise that a school must report to the NEWB where a decision has been taken to expel a student.  Schools are also required to periodically report to the NEWB on student absences. Suspension is one of seven possible categories of absence which are reported on.</P>
        <P>As regards the specific data requested by the Deputy on the matter of suspensions, the total data requested is not available at present. The most recent data available refers to the school year 2004/05. This was also the first year that suspensions data was recorded.</P><Col N="1042"/>
        <P>The NEWB has informed my Department that analysis of the 2005/06 data, is currently ongoing. On completion of this analysis the information will be collated to provide the data requested by the Deputy.  As an interim measure and in response to the question tabled on 5th December I will arrange for a reply to issue to you with the available data. On the remaining data I will reply directly to the Deputy when that data is to hand.</P>

        <Quest> her views on an extra allocation of capitation funding for schools in the northern geographical parts of Ireland as a direct consequence of colder climatic conditions which result in additional usage of fuel consumption in order to provide adequate heating conditions for students; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Schools&rsquo; running costs are met by my Department&rsquo;s scheme of capitation grants. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of schools which would include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges.</P>
        <P>The primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from &euro;57.14 per pupil to &euro;163.58 from 1st January, 2007. This represents an increase of over 186% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.</P>
        <P>The amount of grant paid to an individual school is determined by the enrolment in the school subject to a minimum grant of &euro;8,734.80 in the case of a school with 60 pupils or less and a maximum grant of &euro;72,790 in the case of a school with 500 or more pupils.  Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from &euro;400.00 to &euro;619.50 per pupil.</P>
        <P>The standard rate of capitation grant is paid to all primary schools except Gaelscoileanna located outside of Gaeltacht areas which receive an additional &euro;25.39 per pupil over and above the standard rate grant.  There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools.</P>
        <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Deputy to my announcement of further significant increases in the context of the 2007 estimates. From 1 January 2007 the standard per capita grant was increased by a further &euro;18 to &euro;316 per pupil. In addition, the support services grant was increased by a further &euro;30 for voluntary secondary schools, which includes a further equalisation measure, to &euro;189 per pupil. For such schools this cumulative increase of &euro;48 per pupil brings the aggregate grant to over &euro;500 per pupil from 1 January next. These grants are in addition to the per capita <Col N="1044"/>funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings the annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over &euro;290,000.</P>
        <P>The provision that I have made, in the context of the 2007 estimates, for these significant increases in the funding of schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.  I have no plans to introduce regional variations in capitation rates, as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The application for additional facilities referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning.  In October of 2005 my Department wrote to the School Authorities with issues that needed addressing on a stage 1 / 2 submission (outline sketch scheme with costings). The School&rsquo;s response was examined and discussed at a meeting with my Officials in January <Col N="1046"/>of 2006.  At that meeting the design considerations of the School in question, particularly in relation to the site, highlighted new concerns over the viability of further development regarding effluent discharge.</P>
        <P>In February of 2006, my Department wrote to the School Authorities requesting them to carry out a site suitability test for the discharge of effluent to ground waters indicating that when this was completed my Department would be in a position to further progress the School&rsquo;s building project.</P>
        <P>In August of 2006 a Feasibility Study was carried out by the School&rsquo;s Design Team and this documentation was reviewed by my Department&rsquo;s Technical staff who indicated that the current School site was very small and had a number of constraints.  My Department requested the school authorities to explore the availability of an alternative site that would meet all the criteria, as a contingency plan, should the existing site not prove to be viable.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1601 to 1608, inclusive, and 1625 together.</P><Col N="1049"/>
        <P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  DEIS will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The closing date for receipt of review applications was 31 March, 2006. The Group submitted a report and the review is now concluded. Schools who applied for a review were informed of the outcome in August, 2006.</P>
        <P>Schools which have not qualified for inclusion in DEIS and which are receiving additional resources under pre-existing schemes for addressing disadvantage can be assured that they will continue to receive support in line with their level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under DEIS I recently announced the provision of 80 new posts to add to the 370 posts already in place in order to extend the Home School Community Liaison service to any of the DEIS schools that do not currently have the service. In addition, all schools will continue to receive HSCL services after 2006/2007.  HSCL services will continue to be provided to some 650 schools (370 primary and 282 second level schools).  However, following a full review of HSCL clustering arrangements by the Department in the coming year, levels of service may be varied in some schools to reflect their levels of disadvantage and size and to facilitate local HSCL coordinators working with families of disadvantaged children across both primary and second level.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process and subsequent review, 68 primary schools and 8 second level schools in Mayo have been included in the School Support Programme and nearly 20% of all schools in the rural strand of the programme are in Mayo.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the Primary School Transport Scheme, only eligible children qualify for free transport. In order to be eligible, children must live at least 3.2 kilometres from, and be attending, their nearest national school.</P>
        <P>However children who do not qualify for free transport on distance grounds may be allowed to travel as concessionary fare-payers. This may be allowed subject to the conditions that there are spare seats available after all fully eligible children have been catered for, and provided there is no extra State cost involved by way of altering or extending the route of the service or by providing an additional or larger bus.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where fare-paying transport is sought to a school other than the nearest, the written agreement of the Board of Management of the nearest school is required.  The parents should contact their local Bus &Eacute;ireann office regarding the availability of spare seats.</P>

	<P>The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of those schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme under DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the SSP. These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools. Following on the review process, an additional 40 schools (35 primary and 5 second level) were included in the SSP.  The <Col N="1051"/>total number of schools that made an application under the review process was 341 and this included 228 primary schools and 113 second level schools.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme.  DEIS will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The process of identifying primary and second level schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and was supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through my Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.  The ERC&rsquo;s overall approach was guided by the definition of educational disadvantage in the Education Act (1998), section 32(9), as: &ldquo; &mdash; the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In the case of second level schools, the Department supplied the ERC with centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations Commission databases and from data holdings for the Free Books Scheme.  While retention <Col N="1052"/>rates were one of the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in DEIS, they were not the only measure to be taken into account.  The other determinants for eligibility were:- Medical card data for Junior Certificate candidates (including Junior Certificate School Programme candidates); Junior Certificate exam results aggregated to school level (expressed as an Overall Performance Scale score, which was based on each students performance in the seven subjects in which s/he performed best).</P>
        <P>Overall, for a school to be eligible for extra resources under DEIS, it was considered that there ought to be evidence that a school was experiencing educational problems (e.g. below average on retention rates and/or Junior Certificate performance) and had above average percentage enrolment of students from poor backgrounds.</P>
        <P>Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central to the DEIS action plan and have been given high priority at both national and EU level. The EU have set a target of not more than 10% early school leavers by 2010 and the new National Development Plan has set a high-level goal for improving attainment at second level.</P>

        <Quest> the effect the loss of disadvantaged status will have on school development planning in view of the fact that the planning was based on the premise that such schools would retain this status; if the policies and procedures developed in consideration of the resource allocation entitlements under disadvantaged status will be rendered null and void; and if so, the way schools which have been informed that they will lose disadvantaged status can plan forward. </Quest>

	<P>The DEIS initiative is designed to ensure that the most disadvantaged schools benefit from a comprehensive package of supports, while other schools continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils. I wish to assure the Deputy that schools which have not qualified for inclusion in DEIS and which are receiving additional resources under pre-existing schemes for addressing disadvantage will continue to receive support in line with their level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>For most schools local circumstances including enrolment levels, staffing, resources and pupil backgrounds can change quite significantly over time and consequently aspects of their school development plans will need to be continuously amended in light of these changes in circumstances.  While the majority of school plans, including administrative policies and procedures as well as curricular plans, should not be in need of major re-drafting in schools whose disadvantaged status has changed, assistance is being provided by Facilitators from my Department&rsquo;s School Development Planning Support Service to these schools to identify, amend and implement such changes to plans as may be necessitated by any change in local circumstances.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1615, 1617, 1620, 1621 and 1632 together.</P>
        <P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  DEIS will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The new action plan represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multi-faceted and more integrated approach. This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for 3-18 year olds in this country.  Targeting resources at the most disadvantaged schools who are working to counteract educational disadvantage will continue to be a priority for the Government.</P>
        <P>The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The closing date for receipt of review applications was 31 March, 2006. The Group submitted a report and the review is now concluded. Schools who applied for a review were informed of the outcome in August, 2006.</P><Col N="1057"/>
        <P>As a result of the identification and review process, 873 schools have been included under the DEIS action plan. These comprised 670 primary schools and 203 second-level schools.  Schools which have not qualified for inclusion in DEIS and which are receiving additional resources under pre-existing schemes for addressing disadvantage, can be assured that they will continue to receive support in line with their level of disadvantage.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if she will immediately review the DEIS in view of the fact that there is no continuation of support for the students or parents and families of students progressing from primary to secondary level. </Quest>

	<P>Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central to DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, which is being implemented at present in 873 schools comprising 670 primary schools (338 urban/town schools and 332 rural schools) and 203 second-level schools. This represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multi-faceted and more integrated approach. This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for 3-18 year olds in this country.</P>
        <P>The key principle of early intervention, to identify and help children at risk of leaving school early, is a major component of DEIS, with a continuing emphasis being placed on the development of effective transfer programmes for pupils making the transition to second-level, by building on the existing work of the HSCL scheme and the School Completion Programme in this area.</P>
        <P>The School Completion Programme was established to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and is a key component of my Department&rsquo;s strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. In line with current thinking, the Programme favours an integrated cross-community and cross-sectoral approach based on the development of local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in educational access, participation and outcomes. A key component of the School Completion Programme (SCP) is developing strong links between primary and post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
        <P>The Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) Scheme is a key intervention to improve the educational outcomes of children from disadvantaged areas by promoting active cooperation between <Col N="1058"/>their parents and teachers and encouraging community involvement. Through their work with parents, HSCL officers seek to raise parents&rsquo; awareness of the need to encourage their children to work hard at school and to help parents to improve their own capacities to enhance their children&rsquo;s educational progress and to assist them in developing relevant skills.</P>
        <P>Progression from primary to second-level is recognised as a crucial transition period in a child&rsquo;s education. Initiatives such as Familiarisation Days and week-long transfer programmes for new entrants to second level have been shown to have very positive results in helping children to make a smooth transition to their new school. The strengthening of such programmes are being prioritised under DEIS.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1618, 1619, 1622, 1623, 1644, 1645 and 1698 together.</P>
        <P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  DEIS will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.  The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>The ERC&rsquo;s overall approach was guided by the definition of educational disadvantage in the Education Act (1998), section 32(9), as: &ldquo; &mdash; the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out by the ERC in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved.  The analysis of the survey returns from primary schools by the ERC identified the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in the School Support Programme. The variables involved were: % unemployment; % local authority accommodation; % lone parenthood; % Travellers; % large families (5 or more children); % pupils eligible for free books.</P>
        <P>In the case of second-level schools, the Department supplied the ERC with centrally-held data <Col N="1060"/>from the Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations Commission databases. Based on an analysis of these data, the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the School Support Programme were as follows: Medical card data for Junior Certificate candidates (including Junior Certificate School Programme candidates); Junior Certificate retention rates by school; Junior Certificate exam results aggregated to school level (expressed as an OPS &mdash; &ldquo;Overall Performance Scale&rdquo; &mdash; score).  This was based on each student&rsquo;s performance in the seven subjects in which s/he performed best &mdash; Leaving Certificate retention rates by school.</P>
        <P>The identification process was in line with international best practice and had regard to and employed the exiting and most appropriate data sources available.  A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of some schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  As a result of the identification and review process, 873 schools have been included under the DEIS initiative.  These comprised 670 primary schools (338 urban schools and 332 rural schools) and 203 second level schools.</P>
        <P>The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.  The review Group submitted a final report and the review process is now concluded.</P>

	<P>As the deputy will be aware all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</P><Col N="1061"/>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s immediate concern in relation to a school closure is to ensure that there will be sufficient accommodation available in the general area for pupils who would have normally enrolled in the closing school.  Following the announcement of a phased closure of the school referred to by the Deputy by the Trustees, my Department met with a local Action Group and more recently Gort Community School who outlined their concerns in relation to the announcement by the Trustees.  The examination of the information received is underway in the Department.  As part of this examination, an analysis is also being carried out on matters such as population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the immediate demand for accommodation.</P>

        <P>The application for grant assistance for the candidate referred to by the Deputy must be assessed under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s Maintenance Grant Scheme for Students Attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses 2006.  Clause 3.2 of the PLC Scheme sets out the condition under which a candidate is deemed to be ineligible to apply for funding, it states that:&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;Candidates are ineligible if they already hold a FETAC Level 5 qualification (formerly known as a FETAC (NCVA) Level 2 qualification), a FETAC Level 6 qualification <Col N="1071"/>(formerly known as a FETAC (NCVA) Level 3 qualification) or a third level qualification at Level 6 or higher.  However, notwithstanding this condition candidates who already hold a qualification no higher than FETAC Level 5 (formerly known as a FETAC (NCVA) Level 2) and are now pursuing a course that offers progression may be deemed eligible for grant aid.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">Under this provision, students holding a qualification no higher than a FETAC Level 5 (formally known as a FETAC (NCVA) Level 2 qualification) may receive grant assistance in respect of an approved PLC course which offers progression.</P>
        <P>I understand from officials in my Department that the candidate referred to by the Deputy has completed the Photography Level 2 Progression Award  and the Photography Level 3 Progression Award at Limerick Senior College which are both on the PLC approved list.  Unfortunately, the Higher Professional Diploma course in the Limerick Senior College is not an approved course under the Department&rsquo;s PLC Scheme and therefore I regret that under the above provisions of the PLC Scheme the candidate in question is ineligible to be considered for grant assistance under the Post Leaving Certificate Scheme.</P>

	<P>I announced details of my Department&rsquo;s 2007 Summer Works Scheme for primary and post-primary schools on the 8th January 2007.</P>
        <P>I have provided funding of just under &euro;120m to close to 1000 schools around the country to complete 1137 essential smaller scale capital projects under the Scheme.  The list of schools approved for funding under the Scheme includes 641 primary and 324 post- primary schools.  The projects funded include gas, electrical and mechanical works, roof replacements and repairs, windows replacement, toilet upgrades, structural improvements and access works.</P>
        <P>The funding available for 2007 shows a major increase of over &euro;40m in excess of that provided in 2006.  These works are deemed to be absolutely necessary and I am pleased that I have been able to provide more Boards of Management and Tru<Col N="1075"/>stees with funding to deal with the expanded scheme this year.</P>
        <P>The increase in numbers of schools applying and projects involved is proof that this scheme works well for all.  The projects approved have been assessed as being priority projects by the individual schools themselves.  There is also the minimum of disruption for the school community as work is carried out during the summer months.</P>
        <P>It is evident that the scheme has proved to be a great success since it was first introduced in 2004.  By this summer over 3,000 projects will have been carried out in our primary and post primary schools across the country at a cost of just &euro;300m.  The works taking place are of enormous benefit to the whole school community.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1661 and 1662 together.</P>
        <P>There are 72 cases involving children with special educational needs currently ongoing in which my Department is a named party.  The Deputy will be aware of my position on the issues of litigation in special educational needs and can be assured that neither I nor my Department take lightly any decision to defend cases concerning children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>Cases are generally only litigated where no potential settlement is acceptable to both sides and the Government&rsquo;s authority to decide issues of policy is in question.  The State has an obligation under the Constitution to provide for primary education.  In the context of children with <Col N="1077"/>special educational needs, that education must be appropriate to their requirements.</P>
        <P>The State decides on an appropriate form of provision, having regard to the advice available to it from relevant experts in the National Educational Psychological Service, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the inspectorate and independent experts.  The Department is not complacent in dealing with these cases and attempts, wherever possible, to reduce the potential for litigation and the levels of legal costs where they arise.</P>
        <P>I would like to emphasise that legal costs incurred by the State in defending those cases which are brought to court, are not met directly by my Department.  In accordance with financial procedures in cases involving damages or compensation against the State, costs are generally charged to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office Vote as sanctioned by the Attorney General.  With reference to the costs incurred by my Department which are payment of legal costs of solicitors acting on behalf of children with special educational needs the costs for the last five years are as follows:</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1665 and 1666 together.</P>
        <P>Under the current Wicklow Town Development Plan approximately 510 acres of land have been zoned for residential purposes.  The Local Authority is expecting a population increase in the town of 11,704 persons as per the County Development Plan 2004 &mdash; 2010.</P>
        <P>Following a full analysis of the Census for 2002, it emerged that, nationally, 11.3% of the population was of primary school going age and 8.5% was of post primary school going age (these percentages will be revised if necessary when a full analysis of the Census for 2006 becomes available).  Using the projected population increase this means that there will be a requirement to provide an extra 1,323 primary school places and 995 post primary school places.  As in all cases, the Department will be seeking to maximise existing provision where this is possible to meet the shortfall.  The Department has as part of the review Wicklow Town Development Plan 2002 requested the local authority to reserve two sites and these will be developed according as the need arises.  Taking existing school expansion and potential green field site development together, the Department is satisfied that adequate provision will be made for the area.</P>

        <P>I am aware that Naas like many areas located within close proximity to Dublin, continues to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a range of significant measures has been undertaken by the Department to address the current and future need for pupil places in the area.</P>
        <P>In the Naas locality, at primary level, an entire new school has been provided at Killashee while temporary accommodation has been provided at Scoil Corbain, St. Conleth&rsquo;s &amp; St Mary&rsquo;s NS and St. Conleth&rsquo;s Naofa.  Temporary accommodation has also been approved at Caragh NS, Gaelscoil N&aacute;s na R&iacute;ogh and Scoil Naomh Brighde.</P>
        <P>A brand new state of the art sixteen classroom school together with a double autistic unit was also opened in September 2005 in Naas town.  Another brand new sixteen classroom school is planned for Gaelscoil N&aacute;s na R&iacute;ogh.  This project commenced architectural planning this year.  Additionally, there are proposals to improve accommodation at St. David&rsquo;s National School and Two Mile House National School.  The long term accommodation needs of the national schools at Ballycane, Caragh and the Convent of Mercy are also currently being assessed.</P>
        <P>The indications are that, between them, these developments will be sufficient to meet the needs of the area into the future, however, as with all areas experiencing significant population growth, the Department will be keeping the situation under review.  It is open to the school authorities to apply for additional accommodation where necessary.</P>

While draft contracts have been exchanged, I am advised that the conveyancing process continues to be delayed pending an outcome of a planning application by the vendor.  </P>
        <P>In the meantime, I announced, in November 2006, that this project is to commence architectural design so that preliminary progress can be made on the delivery of the new primary school in Kill.  Subject to the securing of the site, my School Building Section is examining options, including the use of generic design, to speed up delivery of this project.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1676 and 1677 together.</P>
                <P>The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism receive an education appropriate to their needs, preferably through the primary and post primary school network.  My Department supports a multi-skills approach in regard to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods are available e.g. Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), ABA (Applied Behavioural Analysis), Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).  This ensures that a range of teaching methods can be applied specifically to the needs of individual pupils.  In this regard my Department has established:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />180 special classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />5 special classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome.</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />16 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum.</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />14 Stand Alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology on a pilot basis &mdash; 2 of these facilities have yet to be established.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My Department is of the view that children with autism, in common with all children should have access to appropriate provision delivered by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where children can mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration.  Pupils with autism who are fully integrated into mainstream school receive individual teaching support for a number of hours per week as well as support from special needs assistants and specialist equipment if required.  As a further support, many smaller schools which have autism units can now have an administrative principal to assist with the establishment and running of specialist intervention locally.</P>
        <P>Additional training supports for staff engaged in the education provision for children with special needs including autism can be accessed through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  The service will, as appropriate, consolidate, co-ordinate, develop and deliver a range of professional development initiatives and support structures to the relevant staff.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that my Department received an application from a group in Limerick for funding to establish an ABA facility under the pilot scheme.  The application is being considered in the context of all such applications.  It is expected <Col N="1085"/>that a decision on this application will be made shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1681, 1743, 1754 and 1755 together.  </P>
        <P>The Department has decided to make vacant accommodation in a State owned building being partly used by one primary school available to another for a period of two years.  Under the correct protocol, this decision was communicated to the respective Patrons in April 2006.  It is a matter for the Patrons, as the ultimate authority in a school, to address the matter with their Boards of Management.</P>
        <P>There are three advantages to the move.  Firstly, the school moving in will be removed from temporary accommodation.  Secondly, both schools will be able to share the running costs of the building &mdash; a source of concern for the current tenant school.  Thirdly, a multi-million euro State owned asset will be fully used sooner than anticipated bearing in mind that it is incumbent on the Department to ensure that the use of State owned assets are maximised at all times in the taxpayers&rsquo; interest.</P>
        <P>The Department and the Patron jointly appointed a facilitator to plan for and effect the move.  In planning the move, the facilitator took next September&rsquo;s intake requirement for both schools into account.  The Department is satisfied that both schools will fit comfortably this year and next and that there is no basis for any suggestions that the schools will not be able to enrol junior infants next year.  The Department hopes that the Boards of Management concerned will work together to allay any fears which their respective parent bodies might have in this regard.  The Department also hopes that the Boards will work together to ensure the success of this short term measure in the best interests of the children concerned.</P>

        <P>When this stage 1/2 submission is received in my Department, my Officials will arrange a meeting with the School Authorities and their Design Team in order to evaluate the documentation.  It is envisaged that unless there are very exceptional circumstances involved, the meeting will be sufficient to authorise the project to progress to the next stages of architectural planning.

If necessary my Officials will arrange a meeting with the School Authorities and the Design Team on the project in order to evaluate the documentation and it is envisaged that unless there are very exceptional circumstances involved, the meeting will be sufficient to authorise the project to progress to tender and construction as per my announcement of the 29th November last.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The position regarding the alleviation of entry fees for the State examinations is that students who are covered by the means-tested general medical services card scheme, either directly or as the dependants of medical card holders, are not liable to pay fees.  Mock examinations are not part of the State examinations system, and therefore my Department has no function in respect of the fees that are charged for these examinations.</P>
        <P>As regards the overall resources available to schools, there have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools.  I wish to draw the attention of the Deputy to my announcement of further significant increases in the context of the 2007 estimates.  From 1 January 2007 the standard <Col N="1094"/>per capita grant was increased by a further &euro;18 to &euro;316 per pupil.  In addition, the support services grant was increased by a further &euro;30 for voluntary secondary schools, which includes a further equalisation measure, to &euro;189 per pupil.  For such schools this cumulative increase of &euro;48 per pupil brings the aggregate grant to over &euro;500 per pupil from 1 January.  These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.  For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings the annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over &euro;290,000.</P>

	<P>Catchment boundaries are not used to determine eligibility for school transport to primary schools.  Catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post-primary education in the late 1960&rsquo;s and were determined following consultation with local educational interests.  For planning purposes, the country was divided into geographic districts, each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools. The intention was, and continues to be, that these defined districts facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs. </P>
        <P>Reviews of specific catchment boundaries may be carried out where appropriate.  A number of reviews have been carried out over the years where, for example, a new post-primary school is established in an area where previously there was none or, conversely, where a &ldquo;sole provider&rdquo; school closes due to declining enrolment.</P>
        <P>The Area Development Planning Initiative, involving an extensive consultative process carried out by the Commission on School Accommodation, will also inform future revisions to catchment areas.  An Area Development Plan takes account of demographic changes and projects future enrolments for existing schools and new schools if required.  Catchment boundary changes will be made where the implementation of the recommendations in an Area Development Plan requires such adjustments.  I do not propose <Col N="1098"/>at this stage to have a general countrywide review of catchment boundaries.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1711 and 1713 together.  </P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s support package for the July Education Programme is available to all special schools and mainstream primary schools with special classes catering for children with autism who choose to extend their education services through the month of July.  The Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability.  The package includes special nationally agreed rates of remuneration for teachers and special needs assistants involved in the July Programme. Participating schools also receive a special rate of capitation funding in respect of pupils participating in the programme.  Funding is also available to facilitate the provision of school transport and escort services for the children.</P>
        <P>All relevant schools are encouraged to participate in this initiative in the interest of the children in question.  If schools are not participating in the July Education Programme, home tuition is offered as an alternative for the pupils who would normally attend such schools.  My Department is currently considering proposals to extend the July Programme service to post primary schools catering for pupils with autism.  In this regard, the development of appropriate support measures to facilitate post primary schools in participating in this programme is being examined.  My Department is evaluating existing arrangements with a view to formalising a programme in consultation with all concerned.</P>

	<P>The provision of appropriate educational intervention and supports for children and young adults with special educational needs is a key Government priority.  At primary level, there are now over 5,500 teachers working directly with children with special educational needs against fewer than 1,500 in 1998.  At post-primary level, over 2,300 wholetime equivalent teachers support special needs students against 200 in 1998.  In addition, there are over 8,200 whole time equivalent Special Needs Assistants in primary and post-primary schools supporting the care needs of these students.</P>
        <P>As well as this significant increase in the numbers of additional teachers and special needs assistants directly providing appropriate education and care supports for children with special educational needs, further investment has taken place in the provision of specialist school accommodation, assistive technology and equipment.  In addition, specific focussed training and school support is available through the Special Education Support Service &mdash; which now has 14 full time seconded teachers and 25 part-time associates &mdash; and which had contact with some 15,000 teachers in the last year.  The National Council for Special Education has also been established and is in operation since 1 January 2005 with over 90 members of staff working exclusively in supporting students with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>Within my own department, staff in a number of areas are assigned to duties in relation to special needs education.  There are 34.5 officers who are working exclusively with special needs provision.  This figure is inclusive of administrative staff and school inspectors. These officers are responsible for the administration of a range of special education programmes as well as the development of departmental policy on special education.  There are a further number of officers in other areas of my Department who deal with special education matters as part of their wider brief.  These areas include Teacher Education Section, Post Primary Teachers Section, School Transport, Planning and Building Unit, School Inspectorate etc.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department supports the personal, social and educational development of all children in Primary and Post-Primary schools, having particular regard for children with special needs.  Currently some 127 Psychologists are employed directly by NEPS providing, in general, cross-sectoral support to both Primary and Post-Primary schools and pupils.</P>

	<P>The 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers for the 2007/2008 school year.  About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes. </P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>
        <P>There will be approximately 1,280 graduates from the Colleges of Education and it is also estimated that there will be circa 400 graduates from the Hibernia College in 2007.  The level of student intake to the Colleges of Education is determined annually by my Department and it takes account of the supply of, and demand for, primary teachers while also having regard to available resources.  The demand for primary teachers is influenced by a number of factors including: the application of the agreed staffing schedule; demo<Col N="1102"/>graphic trends; the number of teachers opting to take career breaks; the number of secondments approved; and the age at which teachers opt to retire on a voluntary basis.  The creation of additional posts in a particular school year and the retention of posts arising from the allocation of the demographic dividend also affect the demand for teachers.  It is considered necessary for my Department to regulate the intake to the colleges as they are fully funded by the taxpayer.  Finally, my Department does not have authority to regulate the intake of students to private institutions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1717 and 1719 together.  </P>
        <P>As the deputy will be aware all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not  currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</P>
        <P>Under the SCPA an allocation of assessments is made annually to schools commensurate with 2% of its pupil enrolment and it is in the first instance the responsibility of the school Principal to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process. No waiting lists are therefore available to NEPS in this regard.</P>
        <P>It has always been the policy of NEPS, within the normal boundaries of finance and process, to endeavour to respond positively and flexibly to extraordinary need and circumstance as presented by school authorities on occasion and I would suggest Principals who have urgent needs for pupil assessment in excess of their allocation should discuss the matter with the local NEPS Regional Director.</P>
        <P>It does mention however that the introduction of the General Allocation Model for primary schools last year, supported by the provision of over 600 extra resource teachers, means that children with high-incidence special needs now longer have to undergo an individual assessment before they can get access to extra support. Notwithstanding this benefit level of assessments allowed to each school has not changed allowing school Principals extra flexibility in the range of pupils that can be assessed.</P>

        <P>All primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessment either directly from the National Educational Psychological Service of my Department or through the Scheme for Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  In addition to psychological assessment <Col N="1104"/>NEPS provides assistance to all schools and school communities that experience critical incidents regardless of whether or not they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them, it is worthy of mention that some 100 such incidents took place and were responded to by NEPS in this regard in 2005/06.</P>

	<P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students which are administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees.</P>
        <P>Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses at undergraduate or postgraduate level for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Department&rsquo;s maintenance grants schemes, and in accordance with the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act 1992, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on the 1st January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s 2006 Third Level Student Maintenance Grant Schemes the position is that, generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the prescribed conditions with regard to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.  A mature student is defined for the purposes of the schemes as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on the 1st January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</P>
        <P>Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents or guardians.  An independent mature student is defined as meaning a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents or guardians from the October preceding their entry to an approved course.  Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents&rsquo; or guardians&rsquo; income or address.</P>
        <P>When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the means test provision of the scheme specifies that the students&rsquo; means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit.  This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student.</P>
        <P>Generally speaking, candidates continue to be assessed under the terms and conditions of the Scheme appropriate to their year of entry. Accordingly, candidates who where not classified as Independent Mature Students at the time of entry, or re-entry, to an approved course may not <Col N="1106"/>generally be assessed as such for the duration of their course.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware the new <Col N="1107"/>school to which he refers opened in September 2005.  The school was given approval to enrol two Junior Infant Classes per year and, when fully occupied, will operate as a two-stream 16-classroom school.  This incremental development is common to all newly established schools to ensure that a shortage of accommodation at the school is avoided by an over enrolment in the early stages and crucially, to ensure that the enrolments and staffing levels in other schools in the area, where older pupils would inevitably be drawn, are not adversely affected.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this position and as an exceptional matter, the school authority has been given approval to enrol three junior infant classes for the 2006/07 school year only, on the grounds that this will not impact negatively on the other schools in question.</P>
        <P>Approval was also been given to enrol an additional 40 pupils up the classes that could not obtain places in other schools in the area. Pupils moving into the area in the course of the school year can also enrol in the school on the same basis. In this way all eligible pupils seeking places should be accommodated.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the Department has decided to make vacant accommodation in the building in question, which is State, owned available to another school for a period of two years.</P>
        <P>The Department and the Patron have jointly appointed a facilitator to plan for and effect the move.  The Department hopes that the Boards will work together to ensure the success of this short term measure in the best interests of the children concerned.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the Department of Education and Science Post Primary School Transport Scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport <Col N="1108"/>if he or she resides 4.8 kilometres or more from his or her local post primary education centre, that is, the centre serving the catchment area in which he or she lives. The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside.</P>
        <P>There have been no changes to the catchment boundary map used for determining eligibility for school transport in Co. Wexford. No instruction has been given to the Transport Liaison Officer in Co. Wexford to use any map other than the definitive catchment boundary map originally drawn up by my Department&rsquo;s School Planning Section.</P>
        <P>I do not propose at this stage to carry out a review of catchment boundaries in Co. Wexford.</P>

        <Quest> the action she has taken or proposes to take to reduce class sizes in all primary and second level schools throughout County Kildare having particular regard to the disadvantageous pupil teacher ratio that currently prevails; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, there are now no less than 4,000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Furthermore, there are nearly 7,000 more primary teachers than there were in 1997. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. The number of primary teachers in Kildare has increased by 60% under this Government.</P>
        <P>The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate the need to make further progress in reducing class size, it should be acknowledged just how much has been achieved.</P>
        <P>In recent years, priority has rightly been given to providing extra support for children with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those that need help with their English.</P>
        <P>Special education provision in particular has undergone a level of expansion the extent of which nobody could have predicted a few years ago- and this was only right. If we had put all 4,000 of the teachers hired since 2002 into classroom teaching, our average class size would be a lot smaller than it is now. But we would have done a great disservice to those children who need extra help the most. I am sure the Deputy would accept that we have taken the right approach.</P>
        <P>Now that children with special needs are finally getting the support they deserve, we are providing extra teachers this year and next specifically to reduce class sizes, through a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</P>
        <P>This has meant that, whereas all primary schools were staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the 05/06 school year, in the current school year there is a general rule of at least one teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year, we are committed to hiring even more extra teachers in order to reduce this to a general rule of at least one teacher for every 27 children.</P>
        <P>But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>I want to assure the Deputy that I am very conscious of the particular pressures on schools in Kildare and that addressing their needs is a priority for me.</P>
        <P>We also acted this year to specifically address the needs of growing schools by making it easier to qualify for a developing school post. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned for the 2006/07 school <Col N="1118"/>year, compared to 170 in 2005/06. This change specifically addressed the needs of schools which are seeing large increases in their enrolments year on year.</P>
        <P>On the Post Primary side allocations are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment. In general a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established Junior Certificate, Leaving Certificate, repeat Leaving Certificate and Transition Year Programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Post leaving Certificate courses and Leaving Certificate Applied.</P>
        <P>Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils&rsquo; needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation. Significant improvements have been made in the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996/97 school year to 13.2:1 in the 2005/06 school year.  The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

	<P>The home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate <Col N="1120"/>tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.</P>
        <P>Having reviewed a number of applications for home tuition, details regarding the qualifications of some of the proposed tuition providers gave rise to concern. The Deputy will appreciate, that as home tuition takes place outside of the normal school framework, there is need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned. The usual requirement is a fully qualified teacher. However, other qualifications are acceptable depending on the individual needs of the child. A comprehensive review of qualifications has taken place in consultation with my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate resulting in a definitive list of qualifications acceptable under the scheme as appropriate to the individual pupils. In this context the clarity that now exists in relation to qualifications should assist the parents concerned in sourcing suitable tutors.</P>
        <P>Nominated tuition providers with qualifications other than teaching qualifications has been accepted for the first school term this year to allow time to undertake the review. In cases where the tuition provider is not approved a direction has been given to recruit a tuition provider with suitable qualifications. However my Department is prepared to facilitate parents/ guardians who experience difficulties in recruiting a tuition provider with suitable qualifications by extending the sanction with the current tuition provider until the end of the school year 2006/07 to facilitate the recruitment process.</P>

	<P>My Department has in the past operated a number of schemes to tackle educational disadvantage and reduce class sizes in schools in disadvantaged areas. These existing schemes are being integrated into the new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) which I launched in 2005, one aspect of which will be more staffing for the most disadvantaged schools. Under the plan, there has been a reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in the 190 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Participating schools in the Giving Children an Even Break programme which was launched in 2001 were supported to implement a maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes.</P><Col N="1121"/>
        <P>The Breaking the Cycle project which was launched in 1996 provided staffing supports to implement maximum class size of 15: 1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes for 32 schools in designated areas of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Prior to that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme which was launched in 1984 benefited participating schools by providing ex-quota concessionary posts which were not determined by reference to enrolment. The recommended guideline for the maximum class size for schools that were designated disadvantaged was 29:1. When a designated disadvantaged school exceeded this guideline an additional mainstream teaching post, referred to as a maximum class size post, was sanctioned by my Department.</P>
        <P>Class reductions in the 32 schools under the Breaking the Cycle project and in the 211 schools under the Giving Children an Even Break will continue in operation in the schools concerned.</P>
        <P>School authorities have been reminded that my Department allocates adequate staffing to schools to ensure that the maximum class size guidelines under DEIS are implemented in both junior and senior classes. If schools are unable to operate within these guidelines, due for example to increased enrolments, they may make a submission on the matter to my Department for consideration.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1762 and 1763 together.  </P>
        <P>The Department has acknowledged the need for a site for a permanent building for the school referred to by the Deputy.  The site on which the school is currently located is not available, however, a 0.93 acre site adjacent to the school was offered. This is even smaller than the current school site and is not adequate to provide a modern purpose built 16 classroom school with the full range of ancillary accommodation which all new schools enjoy.  Circa 2.5 acres is the minimum amount of land required.</P>
        <P>Enormous difficulties were encountered in trying to acquire a site in what is a built up urban area.  In fact, no suitable site at all emerged under the acquisition process.  In the circumstances the Department had to consider other options and was fortunate that the County of Dublin <Col N="1122"/>Vocational Education Committee not alone had land that could be developed but was willing to make this land available.</P>
        <P>There are any number of schools up and down the country that start in one location and are permanently located in another.  It also has to be remembered that unlike other primary schools, Gaelscoileanna do not have catchment areas and are not, therefore, confined to being accommodated in specific locations although the Department will always try to re-locate schools as close to an original location if this is possible.  It is not realistic, however, in a large urban area to expect this to be easily achieved.  School communities themselves are usually aware of local land issues so re-locations are rarely if ever a problem particularly when what is on offer is a multi million Euro investment to ensure that the children concerned have a comfortable high quality learning environment.  The Department will be providing transport for eligible pupils when the move takes place.</P>

	<P>The decreasing numbers of males entering the teaching profession is an issue that is of concern to me. I believe that it is important to attract more men into teaching for a number of reasons, not least of which is the positive role models that teachers provide in children&rsquo;s lives and the desirability of having both male and female role models in our schools.</P>
        <P>I genuinely believe that teaching is an attractive profession for both men and women. Teaching is fulfilling work which makes a huge social contribution.</P>
        <P>This Government wants to attract and reward the best teachers. In addition to increasing teachers&rsquo; salaries, we have also undertaken other initiatives to enhance the status of the profession. Not least of these is the establishment of the Teaching Council as a professional regulatory body.</P>
        <P>In November, 2005 I launched the Report of the Primary Education Committee, &lsquo;Males into Primary Teaching.&rsquo; The Primary Education Committee was established in order to examine a range of issues in relation to males entering primary teaching, and to make recommendations on short-term and long-term strategies to increase the numbers in this regard.  The Report draws on the professional insight of key experts in this area as well as drawing on a number of relevant research studies.</P><Col N="1123"/>
        <P>One of the key recommendations in the Committee&rsquo;s report is that a co-ordinated promotion campaign, which would encourage boys as well as girls to enter primary teaching, should be undertaken. This promotion campaign commenced on 24 January, 2006 and is currently ongoing. The campaign focuses on a number of key target audiences, including students, parents, teachers and guidance counsellors.</P>
        <P>All other recommendations contained in the report have also received consideration within my Department, and the level of males entering primary teaching will continue to be closely monitored.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>In February 2006 the Chief of Staff appointed Col. Tom Behan to examine all aspects of the Niemba ambush.  I accepted the findings of his Report and addressed the matter during Priority Questions on 16 November 2006.  I would like to reiterate my congratulations to Col. Behan for the time and effort he has expended in researching this <Col N="1125"/>sensitive and harrowing episode in Irish Military History.</P>
        <P>The ambush occurred almost forty-six years ago. It was the first such action involving the horrific deaths of Defence Forces personnel on a scale which still remains unique.  It has never been very far from public consciousness and I would like again to publicly acknowledge the sacrifice made by all the members of the patrol at that time and extend my deepest sympathies to the families of all those who died.</P>
        <P>On the 8th of November, 1960, an eleven man patrol, commanded by Lt. Kevin Gleeson was attacked by a large number of Baluba tribesmen while on patrol from their base at Niemba and were quickly overwhelmed.  There are two principal areas of controversy in regard to the record of this ambush both concerning Trooper Browne and Private Kenny. The first question is where exactly did Trooper Browne die.  From the extensive research and interviews carried out by Col. Behan, his final conclusion is that Trooper Browne fired his weapon to distract the Baluba attackers from their task of beating Private Kenny to death.  He further concludes, on the balance of probabilities, that Trooper Browne managed to then escape his pursuers, wounded or otherwise, making his way to the village of Tundula only to be killed by hostile Balubas two days later.  Therefore, the previous supposition that he died at the ambush site and that Baluba tribesmen carried away his remains cannot be substantiated.  Likewise, the conclusion outlined above that he died at Tundula cannot be definitively substantiated.</P>
        <P>The second area of controversy in regard to the record of the Niemba ambush is what did Trooper Browne do to contribute to the survival of Private Kenny.  The report clearly concludes that prior to his escape from the ambush site, Trooper Browne fired his weapon at the Balubas who were intent on beating Private Kenny to death, thereby distracting them and saving his life.  The Medal Board convened in 1961 awarded Trooper Browne the Military Medal for Gallantry.</P>
        <P>While I am aware that  a survivor of the Niemba Ambush is not satisfied with the official report, I refer again to the fact that Col Behan sets out in his report that he is satisfied that there is no material extant which he did not uncover and which would provide new evidence capable of proving conclusively any one version of the events which are the subject of dispute in relation to the Niemba Ambush.  Equally he is clear of the lack of definitive material, which could establish beyond doubt all that occurred in the course of the Niemba Ambush.  It must be borne in mind that only two known living persons could every have known what exactly happened in this action and it is a certainty that neither of them were aware of all the events which took place in the course of the action.</P><Col N="1126"/>
        <P>I wholeheartedly recognise and acknowledge that both Private Kenny (particularly in view of the serious wounds and injuries he sustained), and Private Fitzpatrick survived a horrific encounter with hostile forces, displaying courage, fortitude and tenacity in order to survive until finally rescued.  I commend them both for the selfless service they have given their country.</P>

        <P>Seven Irish personnel are currently serving with the force.  Three personnel are serving as staff officers with the ISAF HQ in Kabul and four personnel are deployed in Liaison Teams in the Regional Command Capital (RC(C)) Kabul.  The Liaison Teams specifically liaise between the RC(C) and the Afghan National Directorate of Security, Kabul Police and the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA).</P>
        <P>The annual cost to the State of this mission is approximately &euro;225,000.</P>

	<P>The Government decision on decentralisation, announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement on 3 December 2003, provides for the transfer of all of my Department&rsquo;s Dublin based civil service staff to Newbridge, Co. Kildare.  The number of staff to be relocated to Newbridge is 200.  A total of 338 personnel, of which 60 are from within the Department, have opted to move to Newbridge.  An additional 38 staff from outside my Department have been assigned to this Department from the Central Applications Facility for the purpose of relocating to Newbridge.  Twenty-two members of staff who opted not to move to Newbridge have volunteered to transfer to other Government Departments that have units that are proposed for decentralisation, and some have already moved to their new Departments. Of the remaining personnel in my Department who have opted to remain in Dublin, nineteen have been reassigned.  </P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works is in advanced negotiations with Kildare County Council in relation to the acquisition of a site in Newbridge and a decision regarding the acquisition of the identified site in Newbridge is expected shortly. The tenders for the design and construction of the buildings in Newbridge were received by OPW on 24 October 2006 and 7 tenders are currently being evaluated. Once this site is acquired, I would anticipate that my Department will relocate to Newbridge by late 2008.</P>
        <P>The Government decision also provides for the transfer of 300 Defence Forces Headquarters staff to the Curragh, Co Kildare. OPW conducted <Col N="1130"/>a briefing on 18 Dec 2006 in McKee Barracks, Dublin at which the chief architect of the OPW project team made a detailed presentation covering aspects of site location in the Curragh, building design and proposed access routes to the new building.</P>
        <P>This project is a &ldquo;client-led design and build&rdquo; programme with a contract being placed for construction of the &ldquo;shell and core&rdquo; of the building and OPW then conducting full fit-out at the final stage.</P>
        <P>The following is the current schedule of dates for the project:</P>

	<P>Periodic interest by the private sector has been expressed during the past decade or so in relation to the use of Casement Aerodrome for Civil Aviation purposes.  The establishment of facilities for civil aviation purposes is, however, primarily a matter for the Minister for Transport.  Under the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, aerodromes under my authority are precluded from regulation by the Irish Aviation Authority.  Only the regulation of military aviation activities at military aerodromes comes within my remit.  Before any consideration could be given to having commercial aviation at Baldonnel it would be necessary to bring Casement Aerodrome within the licensing and regulatory control of the Irish Aviation Authority, this would require an amendment to Section 3 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993.  This is a matter for consideration in the first instance by the Minister for Transport.</P>

	<P>A meeting of EU Defence Ministers in GAERC formation took place in Brussels on 13 November, 2006.  In tandem with the Defence Minister&rsquo;s meeting, there was a Ministerial level meeting of the EDA Steering Board.</P>
        <P>The meeting began with a discussion on the development of Military Capabilities.  The Director General of the EU Military Staff (DGEUMS) updated Ministers on the process towards the development of Headline Goal 2010.  Ministers heard that EU Battlegroups will achieve full operational capability in January 2007 with two Battlegroups continually on stand-by for 6 month periods.  Commitment are fully in place up to the end of 2008 and for the first semester of 2010.  Among other issues discussed was the Maritime Dimension of ESDP.  DGEUMS informed Ministers that an overview paper on the Maritime Dimension Study would be completed by the end of 2006.   Ministers were also informed of the development of the Rapid Response Air Initiative (RRAI) study.  This study is to bring forward proposals allowing for the rapid generation of the air capabilities listed in the Headline Goal 2010.  The study is due to be completed by end-2007.  DGEUMS advised Ministers that a proposal by France on Sharing Training Facilities within the EU would provide the opportunity for EU Member States to share national military training and education facilities.  The initiative aims at reinforcing ESDP and enhancing interoperability.</P>
        <P>The meeting also discussed EUFOR RD Congo mission, which was launched in support of MONUC, the UN mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).  The effectiveness of the EU mission in supporting MONUC was instrumental to the success of the recent elections in the DRC.  On the issue of Civil Military Co-ordination (CMCO), the Presidency reported on the outcome of the CMCO Seminar held on the 7th and 8th September, which stressed the importance for improved sharing of information amongst all EU actors so as to increase the overall effectiveness and coherence of the EU&rsquo;s contribution to crisis management operations.</P>
        <P>At the meeting of the EDA Ministerial Steering Board, the Agency&rsquo;s Financial Framework 2007 &mdash; 2009 was discussed.  While the Budget 2007 had been agreed in principle at the Preparatory Committee on 3 November (and agreed by the Steering Board on this occasion), agreement was not reached in relation to the Agency&rsquo;s Financial Framework 2007-2009.  Ireland together, with a number of other member States, could not support the level of increase in the amount of the operational budget being <Col N="1133"/>sought by the Agency, which would see a rise from &euro;5 million in 2007 to &euro;10 million in 2009 in the R&amp;T Operational Budget.  Ireland, in tandem with a large number of other member States, is of the view that, for the most part, R&amp;T defence projects which do not have general application, should be funded through the ad-hoc project mechanism by those member States which have an interest in the particular project and not through the general operational budget.  The general operational budget should mainly be used to fund initiatives which are of common interest to the member States as a whole.  Against this background and in the absence of a detailed work programme for the framework period, Ireland could not support the Financial Framework proposal.</P>
        <P>The Steering Board approved the work programme 2007  and agreed on a major Joint Investment Force Protection Project as well as a programme for the development of Software Defined Radio (SDR).  The Steering Board also agreed to the revision of the Financial Rules of the EDA and the modalities for the establishment of the EDA Staff Committee.  In relation to a discussion on Indicators and Strategic Targets, Ireland suggested that, in tandem with the further work proposed on the strategic targets, work on the indicators and on the purpose and meaning of these indicators should continue with a further report to the Steering Board in May 2007.</P>

	<P>Comhar &mdash; the Sustainable Development Council is a forum for national consultation and dialogue on all issues relating to sustainable development.  The members of the Council are drawn from fiver pillars; the State sector, economic sectors, environmental NGOs, social/community NGO&rsquo;s and the professional/academic sector.  Comhar has as its mandate to advance the national agenda for sustainable development, to evaluate progress in this regard, to assist in devising suitable mechanisms and advising on their implementation, and to contribute to the formation of a national consensus.  In performing this role Comhar contributes to policy making on a broad range of matters either directly or on request from the Government.   </P>
        <P>By way of a recent example, Comhar was requested by the Minister for Finance to make a submission on the National Development Plan. The resulting submission was informed by Comhar&rsquo;s three day conference National Development Plan &mdash; towards sustainability held in October, 2006 which engaged academics, policy makers and a range of other stakeholders on the theme of sustainable development in prospect of the new NDP. The NDP moreover has now endorsed sustainability as one of its key cross-sectoral concerns.</P>
        <P>The role of Comhar war also reaffirmed in Towards 2016. This explicitly commits to strengthening the role of Comhar in the ongoing process of policy development in the context of environmental sustainability.</P>
        <P>Comhar will, over the coming months, be an important partner in the review of the National Sustainable Development Strategy being coordinated by my Department.</P>

	<P>The Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1992 place statutory <Col N="1135"/>responsibility for dog control and licensing services on local authorities.

        <P>Information supplied by local authorities to my Department for 2005 &mdash; the most recent year for which statistics are available &mdash; shows that the number of individual dog licences issued was 195,769 and the number of general dog licences issued was 391.  The income which accrued to local authorities in 2005 from licence fees, on-the-spot fines and pound fees etc. was in excess of &euro;2.5 million.   253 prosecutions were taken by local authorities for breaches of licensing requirements.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1781 and 1782 together.</P>
        <P>Overgrazing of livestock has given rise to environmental problems, particularly loss of vegetation and soil erosion in commonages.  In this regard, damage to the habitat of the Red Grouse in the Owenduff/Nephin Beg Complex Special Protection Area (SPA) in County Mayo, has <Col N="1136"/>been the subject of a continuing infringement case, under the Birds Directive, taken against Ireland by the EU Commission in the European Court of Justice.  A Commission Reasoned Opinion of 18 October 2006 states that the Irish authorities must implement measures and demonstrate improvements in this area and in other commonages.</P>
        <P>My Department, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and Food and the European Commission, has been working to resolve the issue of appropriate commonage management, which is made complex by the multiple shareholdings involved.  This will be achieved through the amendment of existing REPS plans, or the preparation of an agri-environmental farm plan through a special National Parks and Wildlife Service scheme.  General principles applicable to these amended plans have already been agreed with farming interests and are as follows:</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />All active farmers who wish to continue to farm with the SPA must be in an approved agri-environmental plan.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The full destocking as provided for in the commonage plans will be delivered.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />There will be a closed period in commonages (and adjacent unfenced privately owned SPA) for five months (November to December and February 15th to May 15th) during which there will be no stock allowed go to the hills.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Farm planners have been issued with guidelines on appropriate stocking regimes based on the condition of the commonages to which farmers wish to return stock.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Compensation is payable in the NPWS scheme for destocked sheep (&euro;27 per ewe) and offwintered sheep (&euro;40 per ewe).  Where their existing REPS plans do not provide for this destocking, NPWS will also pay &euro;2000 per annum to each farmer.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The purpose of the initiatives is to ensure that ecological recovery takes place in damaged commonages in the area.  The number of sheep that are allowed return to the commonage is based on the best available scientific advice.  Farmers will be given a summer allocation of stock to the hill for seven months, which may be increased if returned for a period shorter than seven months.</P>
        <P>I fully expect that the destocking measures negotiated locally and summarised above will be implemented and that the infringement proceedings taken by the European Commission can also be resolved on this basis.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1783, 1811 and 1835 together.</P>
        <P>The Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1992 place statutory responsibility for dog control and licensing services on local authorities.  The implementation of the Acts is vested in local authorities who have power to appoint dog wardens, to provide shelters for stray and other dogs, to impose on-the-spot fines for a number of offences and to take prosecutions.  Local authorities may also may bye-laws in relation to the control of dogs within their functional areas.</P>
        <P>The Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 made under the above Acts, place controls on ten breeds of dogs including the American Pit Bull Terrier, the English and Staffordshire Bull Terrier breeds.  The controls, which must be observed when the dog is in a public place, require that these dogs, or types and crosses thereof, must be kept on a short lead by a person over 16 years of age who is capable of controlling them and that they are securely muzzled.  Furthermore, the Control of Dogs Act 1986 gives specific powers to the courts to order that a dog, which the court considers dangerous, must be kept under proper control or be destroyed.</P>
        <P>I consider that these arrangements provide a workable regulatory framework for enforcement by local authorities and I do not propose to ban the owning of any particular dog breed at this stage. However, I propose to review existing control measures to consider, for example, if the micro-chipping of dogs could bring benefits to dog control. I have also asked Dublin City Council for a report of the recent incident in Finglas.</P>

        <P>The route of the proposed M3 road development has been archaeologically assessed through geophysical surveys and test trenching and all of the identified areas of archaeological interest have been or are being fully excavated and recorded as required under directions given in accordance with the provisions of the National Monuments Acts.</P>

        <P>On the 4 of January last an archaeologist from my Department inspected sites where both tree felling and archaeological works are being carried out.  Based on a report of that inspection, I can confirm that, while there was some surface disturbance caused by machinery, no archaeological material or objects have been disturbed by the recent tree felling operation.  These tree felling operations, which were a necessary part of the advance preparatory works for the road scheme, only took place within the land-take for the road scheme. The trees were cut to stump level. The removal of the tree stumps will be carried out under archaeological supervision during the construction phase of the project.</P>

	<P>There have been a number of key developments in the area of landscape character assessment since the publication of the draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Landscape and Landscape Assessment for public consultation in 2000.  These include Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the European Landscape Convention in 2002, which aims to promote landscape protection, management and planning, and to organise European co-operation on landscape issues.  The rationale of the Convention is to encourage public authorities to adopt policies and measures at local, regional, national and international level for protecting, managing and planning landscapes throughout Europe so as to maintain and improve landscape quality, to bring the public, institutions and local and regional authorities to recognise the value and importance of landscape and to take part in related public decisions.</P>
        <P>More recently, my Department has undertaken extensive consultations with key relevant stakeholders with an interest in Landscape Character Assessment, such as the Heritage Council and other Government Departments and agencies with a view to seeing how landscape issues should be taken forward further in the context of planning policy.</P>

        <P>A range of factors influence the economic performance and competitiveness of cities, their capacity to attract geographically mobile activities and skilled workers, and to support innovation and entrepeneurship.

        <Quest> his views on introducing more simplified planning application requirements for persons proposing to widen their gateway onto the public road. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Generally, planning permission is needed for any development of land or property unless the development is specifically exempted from this requirement.  Under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, the provision of a hard surface within the curtilage of a house is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission, subject to certain conditions.    However, this does not include the widening of a gateway or access to the property.</P>
        <P>The widening of a gate or access to a property may seem like a relatively minor development; however it may have significant impacts on road safety, neighbouring properties or the appearance of a house or row of houses. Where this is the case, I consider it appropriate that these issues should fall to be considered by the planning code.  Equally, I do not think that the introduction of different planning application processes for different types of development would deliver a more streamlined or simplified planning system overall.</P>
        <P>Indeed, where possible I have taken steps to standardise procedures for the making of planning applications. The Planning and Development Regulations 2006 provide, among other things, for a standardised application form for use in all instances, in all planning authority areas.  This standardisation will provide clarity in the system and in the processing of applications and will ensure that all relevant information is available to the planning authority in making its decision.</P>

	<P>Sections 34(4)(g) and 180(2)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 Act provide that a planning authority may attach a condition to a planning permission requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of a development, and, if the development is not subsequently completed satisfactorily, may apply the <Col N="1145"/>security to that satisfactory completion.  The matter of what is an adequate amount to complete any particular development is a matter for the local authority involved to determine, having regard to the circumstances pertaining in its area.  However, in the interests of those purchasing a property in a development, it is essential that the bond be significant to enable the local authority carry out the work if the developer defaults.</P>

        <P>Primary responsibility for dealing with law and order issues rests with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in this regard, the powers of the Garda&iacute; in dealing with anti social behaviour were enhanced under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.

Section 144(1) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that, subject to the approval of the Minister, An Bord Plean&aacute;la may determine fees in relation to appeals, referrals and other matters coming before the Board. An application from An Bord Plean&aacute;la for approval to a fee structure was approved in March 2003. The current fee for the making of third party appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la is set at &euro;210.</P>
        <P>Section 144(1) also provides that a determination in relation to fees may provide for an exemption, waiver, remission or refund in particular circumstances. The question of making a further determination to allow for a waiver of fees in specific circumstances is therefore a matter for the Board in the first instance. However, it is important to note that any proposals to waive or reduce fees for any group have to be balanced against the necessity to ensure that the planning appeal system is adequately resourced and that the cost is fairly distributed among the users of the system.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, producers &mdash; i.e. manufacturers and importers &mdash; of farm plastics (silage bale wrap and sheeting) are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes to recover the waste in question. The Irish Farm Film Producers Group (IFFPG) is currently the sole approved body in Ireland for the purposes of implementing a compliance scheme for the recovery of farm plastics waste.  IFFPG has now launched a new labelling system for farm plastics placed on the market by its members to support compliance with the requirements of the scheme and to reduce scope for unfair competition from &lsquo;free riders&rsquo; in the market.  Compliance with the labelling system is now a compulsory condition of membership of the approved scheme.</P>
        <P>The labelling of levied farm plastic is part of a package of measures agreed in May 2006 between my Department and the IFFPG to ensure improved farm plastics collection services for farmers.  Under the new arrangements, the scheme is funded by a combination of the levies paid by the producer members of IFFPG who run the scheme and funding from weight based collection charges paid by farmers availing of the service.  This is improving the operational efficiency of the scheme by incentivising the presentation of clean, dry plastic by farmers.  In addition, to address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic, designated facilities are being provided on a temporary, once-off basis by local authorities where farmers may deposit stockpiled farm plastic.</P><Col N="1155"/>
        <P>The final element in the agreed package of measures is the implementation of new systems by IFFPG to improve traceability of levied farm plastic.  I have taken a personal interest in the development of the IFFPG scheme. It is ambitious and seems to be well designed. I believe the new arrangements being put in place carry a sufficient incentive for compliance on the part of producers and, while the operation of the scheme is kept under continuous review, there are no further legislative proposals at this stage.</P>
        <P>The level of recycling of farm plastic is very impressive. As the Deputy will be aware, I introduced a system to provide further support for the collection of farm plastics last year. This has further boosted the collection of plastic waste in Ireland.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 182 of 27 April 2006, if he will meet a delegation from Roscommon, Sligo and Mayo County Councils regarding their proposals for the R294 which was submitted to his Department; if he will approve funding for the project; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>In March 2005, Sligo County Council submitted to my Department a copy of a report prepared jointly by Sligo, Mayo and Roscommon County Councils regarding the condition of the R294 between Ballina and Boyle.  The report proposed a number of both short and long term improvement works to the route.  My Department responded that it would be open to the relevant county councils to include the short term Restoration Improvement Works in their Restoration Programmes for 2006 onwards.  In addition, it would be open to the councils to prioritise appropriate works on this route for funding under the Specific Improvements Grant Scheme in subsequent years.</P>
        <P>In June 2005 local authorities were invited to submit proposals to my Department for inclusion in the 2006 to 2008 Restoration Improvement Programme. Sligo County Council has included three schemes on the R294 under its Restoration Improvement Programme for 2007. This year the Council has received Restoration Improvement grant allocations totalling &euro;234,179 for works on these three schemes at Lough Talt, Knockalass and Rathscanlon.  Roscommon County Council has included one scheme on the R294, for works at Tinacarra-Drumanone, under its 2007 Restoration Improvement Programme, for which it has received a grant allocation of &euro;60,000 this year.</P>
        <P>In August 2006, local authorities were invited to submit applications for consideration for funding under the 2007 Specific Improvements Grant <Col N="1156"/>scheme.  Under the 2007 Specific Improvements Grant Scheme Sligo County Council has been allocated a grant of &euro;366,000 for improvement works on the R294 at Mullaghroe. This was the only application for the R294 submitted to my Department by any of the three councils for consideration for funding in 2007 under the scheme.</P>
        <P>My Department will again be seeking applications under the Specific Improvements Grant scheme later this year and it will be open to Sligo, Mayo and Roscommon County Councils to submit applications for consideration for further funding under this scheme in 2008.  Further meetings on this matter are not planned at present.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.  However, my Department has asked local authorities to engage with commercial waste collectors to agree on arrangements to assist lower income households by offering alternatives to periodic lump-sum payments.</P>
        <P>In August last year, I published a consultation paper on options for future regulation of the waste sector. Submissions were invited on whether there is a need for a regulator for the sector, if so on what model of regulator might be most appropriate and on what powers any such regulator should be given. Among the possible powers discussed in the paper is the power to impose a public service obligation so that services can be extended to situations which do not provide a fully economic return.  Following consideration of the submissions received, which is currently underway, I intend to finalise further policy proposals.</P>

	<P>In 2006, my Department commissioned Oxford Archaeology Ltd to undertake a conservation study to inform future policy-making on the care, maintenance and conservation of the nationally important archaeological monuments in the Rathcroghan area.</P>
        <P>To date, site visits have been undertaken by the consultants and the required public consultation process has taken place.  It is anticipated that the report on the conservation study will be completed in the first quarter of 2007.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the suggestion that private landlords are reluctant to register with the PRTB as it exposes them to a tax liability; if this apparent reduction in registrations is having an affect on the availability of rental properties in the private sector; if it is having an impact on rent levies; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Registration of tenancies is a matter for the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).  My Department has no indication from PRTB of a failure by landlords to register tenancies due to concerns about tax liability.  I understand that there has been a steady increase in the number of tenancies registered with the <Col N="1161"/>Board since its establishment and that further increases have resulted from a requirement in the Finance Act 2006 that landlords must register a tenancy with the Board in order to claim qualifying refurbishment expenditure and interest relief against rental income.  Tenancy registration fees are also tax deductible.</P>
        <P>It is an offence under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 for a landlord to fail to register a tenancy with the PRTB.  Such an offence would, on summary conviction, be subject to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 and a term of up to six months in prison.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In general, planning permission must be sought for the erection of an antenna support structure or mast.  The Planning and Development Regulations 2001 set out certain exemptions in this area.  These include, subject to certain conditions, works carried out by a statutory undertaker authorised to provide a telecommunications service comprising:</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the attachment of additional antennae to an existing antenna support structure (subject to a maximum of 12 antennae),</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the erection of an antenna support structure in place of an existing antenna support structure, and</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, such as lamp posts, flag poles, CCTV poles, electricity pylons and certain public or commercial buildings.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">One of the conditions that a statutory undertaker must comply with in order to avail of any of the exemptions referred to above is that the field strength of the non-ionising radiation emissions from the site must not exceed the limits specified <Col N="1162"/>by the Commission for Communications Regulation.</P>
        <P>In the case of the third exemption, that is the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, there is a requirement on the statutory undertaker to notify the planning authority, in writing, of the proposed location of any such structure at least 4 weeks before the attachment of antennae to an existing structure.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Communications Regulation is responsible for ensuring that telecommunications operators comply with their licence conditions relating to non-ionising radiation.  It is also the function of the Commission to ensure that all operators are compliant with the international guidelines for general exposure to electromagnetic fields from telecommunications masts and antennae.  Planning authorities have no function in this matter.</P>
        <P>Under the standard licence conditions, a telecommunications operator, must notify the Commission for Communications Regulation of the location (including geographic coordinates) of new base stations.  The locations of the sites are published by the Commission for Communications Regulation in map form for public viewing on the website http://www.askcomreg.ie/ mobile/ View<u><Miles com="is0p4" /></u>Mobile<u><Miles com="is0p4" /></u>Sites.36.LE.asp.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1840, 1851 and 1910 together.</P>
        <P>The administration of the Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant schemes is a matter for the local authorities within the framework laid down in statutory regulations which, as far as <Col N="1166"/>practicable, is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility at local level.  Local authorities are encouraged to operate the schemes in a sympathetic and flexible manner, having regard to the needs of the applicants.</P>
        <P>In recent years local authorities have made significant improvements in the range of customer care services and supports they supply.  Among these improvements are web-based customer support services, lo-call customer care phone services and customer care desks.  Older persons experiencing difficulties with grant application processes or any other services offered by local authorities can access the customer care supports offered by their own local authority.  The services of Citizen Information Centres can also be utilised by applicants experiencing difficulties applying for the Disabled Persons or the Essential Repairs Grant schemes.</P>
        <P>A review of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme, which incorporated the conditions governing the Essential Repairs Grant scheme and the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly scheme, has been completed within my Department.  The aim of the review was to ensure that the available resources are targeted to those in most need of assistance, to streamline, as far as possible, the procedures governing the operation of the grant schemes, and to introduce a level of consistency in operation across local authorities.</P>
        <P>Proposals for the future operation of the schemes will be announced shortly in the context of a new Housing Policy Statement.  The specific needs of older applicants will be further considered in the context of the administrative guidance on the revised grant schemes, which I intend to issue to local authorities later this year.</P>

This programme sets targets of 60,000 new units of social housing together with some 40,000 affordable homes to be delivered <Col N="1168"/>over the plan period. In addition, further households will benefit under contractual arrangements with landlords for existing properties transferring from the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Rent Supplement Scheme to the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</P>
        <P>This level of output, together with accommodation made available through vacancies and other social housing measures, means that an estimated 140,000 new households will have their accommodation needs met over the coming seven years. Action under the NDP to rejuvenate existing social housing will be intensified and the provision of grant aid to adapt private housing to meet the needs of people with a disability and the needs of older people will also be supported.</P>

        <Quest> the action taken in relation to plastic bottle waste from the time it is collected from a local authority recycling bin. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>National waste statistics for all waste streams are published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), most recently in National Waste Report 2005.  National Waste Reports do not provide separate data for plastic bottles but successive reports have shown increases in the recovery rate for plastic packaging; this is recovered both through segregated collections in some areas and through the expanded national network of bring banks and civic amenity sites put in place in recent years.   The recovery rate for plastic packaging increased from 0.6% in 1998 to 24.1% in 2005, which exceeds the material specific target for 2011 set for plastic packaging recovery in the Directive 2004/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the original Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste.</P>
        <P>The National Waste Report 2005 also indicates the Ireland relies significantly on foreign based materials recycling infrastructure.  The Report states that of 50,859 tonnes (86.7%) of plastic waste &mdash; including plastic packaging &mdash; were exported for recycling in 2005 while 7,828 tonnes (13.3%) were recycled in Ireland.  30,522 tonnes were exported to the United Kingdom, the principal destination for plastic waste exported from Ireland, while a further 16,467 tonnes were exported to China, the next most common destination.</P>
        <P>The export of waste is regulated by local authorities, in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259/93 of 1 February 1993 on the supervision and control of waste within, into and out of, the European Community. Shipments of waste for recovery which are in compliance with the EU Waste Shipment Regulation are permissible to non-EU destinations subject to any applicable restrictions of that Regulation.</P>
        <P>While there has been recent progress in the provision of more infrastructure within Ireland to <Col N="1172"/>process materials recovered for recycling, for example in the development of new facilities to process waste electrical and electronic equipment, it should be noted that clean segregated materials are a sought after resource which are freely traded under EU and international law.  This is supported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Decision of C(92)39 Final on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Wastes Destined for Recovery Operations which notes that the recovery of valuable materials and energy from wastes is an integral part of the international economic system and that well established markets exist for, and can contribute to, the collection and processing of such materials within OECD member countries.</P>
        <P>While international trade in waste is consistent with Government policy insofar as it supports improved performance in recycling, the Government also recognises the value of a more developed recycling infrastructure in Ireland.  To this effect, a Market Development Group was established by Government in 2004 with a view to identifying market opportunities for materials recovered for recycling.  A Market Development Programme &mdash; focusing on the priority waste streams of paper, plastic and organics &mdash; is currently being finalised and will be published shortly.</P>

        <P>In June 2005, local authorities were invited to submit proposals to my Department for inclusion in the 2006 to 2008 Restoration Improvement Programme. As part of its proposed programme of works for 2008, Mayo County Council included a scheme for improvement works on the R314 at Derrynameel, between Belmullet and Barnatra, at a cost of &euro;315,000. The significant funding provided by my Department in 2007 to Mayo County Council under the Restoration Improvement Programme will enable the Council to carry out works on this scheme this year, a year ahead of schedule.</P>
        <P>Mayo County Council may also use the discretionary improvement grant, provided by my Department, towards the carrying out of works on the road between Belmullet and Barnatra.

	<P>The improvement and maintenance of non-national roads in county Kerry is a matter for Kerry County Council to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State Grants provided by my Department.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded from these grants is a matter for the Council. In 2007, the initial non-national roads grant allocation to Kerry County Council is &euro;22,281,800, which represents an increase of 8% on the initial 2006 allocation.</P>
        <P>Over the period 2000-06 Kerry County Council has received grants of over &euro;4.3 million from my Department for improvement works to the R561 under the Specific Improvements Grant scheme. In 2007 an allocation of &euro;250,000 has been made to the Council under the scheme for improvement works on the R561 from Castlemaine to Annascaul &mdash; from Ardroe Cross to Redcliff.</P>
        <P>In December 2006, Kerry County Council approached my Department seeking funding for works at the R561 between Inch and Annascaul. The council was informed that any application for funding for coastal protection works should be directed to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. As regards road works, the Council was advised that my Department would be prepared to consider any proposal from the Council to adjust its 2007 specific grant proposals, originally submitted to my Department by the Council in September 2006, to include eligible works at this location. In the event, such a proposal was not submitted by the Council.  Kerry County Council has not submitted an application to my Department in respect of works to the Trench Bridge.</P>
        <P>Kerry County Council may also use the Discretionary Improvement grant provided by my Department to fund eligible improvement works on non-national roads and bridges. In 2007 a Discretionary Improvement grant allocation of &euro;1,186,000 has been made to Kerry County Council. This is an increase of 3% on the 2006 allocation to the Council.</P>

	<P>In general the Government welcomes the proposal of the EU Commission for a Directive establishing a framework for the protection of soil.  We agree that it is appropriate to have an EU-wide initiative but, given the diverse nature and conditions of soils in Member States, policies need to be flexible and adaptable.</P>
        <P>This proposal for a directive is part of a package adopted by the Commission in September 2006 arising from the 6th Environmental Action Programme. Although soil protection provisions exist in the body of Community legislation there is no specific legislation on soil protection. The package aims to fill this gap and has the objective of establishing a common strategy for the protection and sustainable use of soil based on the principles of integration of soil concerns into other policies, preservation of soil functions within the context of sustainable use, prevention of threats to soil and mitigation of their effects, as well as restoration of degraded soils to a level of functionality consistent at least with the current and approved future use.</P>

	<P>Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities may provide, in their development plans and local area plans, general planning standards to be met in the provision of neighbourhood facilities.  When granting planning permission for a neighbourhood shop, planning authorities may impose conditions relating to the standard and upkeep of shop fronts and landings.  Furthermore, local authorities have powers to maintain and regulate such areas under waste management and litter legislation. </P>
        <P>In addition, where a planning authority deems a particular area to be of special importance to the civic life or the architectural, historical, cultural or social character of a city or town, section 84 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for the preparation of a scheme setting out specific development objectives for the area.  Such schemes can include objectives for the renewal, preservation, restoration, development or redevelopment of the streetscape including the coordination and upgrading of shop-frontages.</P>

        <Quest> the accountability he envisages against planning authority officials who have failed to enforce the planning laws resulting from An Bord Plean&aacute;la determinations in view of the fact that the Ombudsman highlighted the lack of enforcement on unauthorised quarries in his 2000 Annual Report. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1871 and 1872 together.</P>
        <P>Enforcement of planning control is a matter for the appropriate planning authority, which can take action if a development does not have the required permission, or where terms of permission have not been met.</P>
        <P>The Planning and Development Act 2000 gave substantial additional powers to planning authorities in the enforcement area: for instance, they are now entitled to retain fines imposed by Courts for planning offences to help finance more active planning control.  The 2000 Planning Act, as amended by the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, also provides that planning authorities may refuse to grant planning permission to any developer who has seriously failed to comply with a previous planning permission. The effect of the 2006 amendment has been to reverse the burden of proof so that the applicant must now apply to the High Court if he or she wishes to have the decision overturned.</P>
        <P>The 2000 Act also imposed new obligations on planning authorities in the enforcement area: there is now a statutory obligation on a planning authority to issue a warning letter in relation to written complaints regarding unauthorised development.  There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued.</P>
        <P>The draft Development Management Guidelines, which I will issue in final form shortly, and which will be statutory guidelines to which planning authorities must have regard in the exercise of their functions, emphasis the importance of planning enforcement, stating that the introduction of a culture of enforcement is critical to ensure that the planning control system works <Col N="1182"/>properly and for the benefit of the whole community.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department is currently exploring possibilities with City and County Managers for the establishment of a planning enforcement network.  This would be designed to enable practitioners in planning authorities to share practical experiences and expertise to help equip them to carry out their enforcement role as effectively as possible and to develop new perspectives on best practice in planning enforcement.</P>
        <P>In relation to quarries in particular, section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which was commenced with effect from 28 April 2004, introduced a once-off system of registration for all quarries, except those for which planning permission was granted in the last 5 years.  Under the registration system, quarry operators were required to register with planning authorities by 27 April 2005.  Following registration, a planning authority can impose conditions on the operation of a pre-October 1964 quarry or may require such a quarry to apply for planning permission and submit an Environmental Impact Statement in certain circumstances.  Authorities can also restate, modify or add to conditions on the operation of a quarry that has received planning permission more than 5 years ago.</P>

All known landowners, Heritage Officers of local authorities and relevant NGOs are notified and advertisements are placed in local media.  Meeting are normally held in a clinic style, to facilitate the best exchange of information and views. A 3-month period is allowed for receipt of submissions on the content of the plan, after which the plan is finalised and published.</P>

        <Quest> the compensation agreed under the special areas of conservation and special protection areas with landowners; and the further compensation envisaged. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 the owner or user of land in a special area of conservation (SAC) or special protection area (SPA) is  entitled, by way of compensation, to an amount equal to the loss suffered as a result of restrictions imposed due to designation of the land.  There are a number of compensation schemes in place, such as: </P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Cessation of Turf Cutting Scheme whereby my Department will purchase raised bog at the rate of up to &euro;3,500 per acre; an incentive payment currently standing at &euro;4,800 is also available to applicants under this Scheme;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the NPWS Farm Plan Scheme whereby my Department draws up and pays for an individual farm plan for landowners in designated areas.  This Plan will include a specific payment for costs and losses incurred due to restrictions imposed as a result of designation;   and</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Shannon Callows Agreement which sets out certain prescriptions for farming practices in the Callows and provides compensation for the costs to farmers in applying these prescriptions.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As new SACs and SPAs are designated, or should further restrictions be required on farming practices in existing designated areas, my Department will continue to ensure that the landowners concerned are compensated for actual losses they suffer as a result of any restrictions imposed on the current use of the land.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
<Col N="1190"/>        <Quest> the arrangements whereby his Department may on request reduce an area adjacent to sensitive nutrient poor lakes designated as part of a special area of conservation or special protection areas if the landowner agrees to put down permanent markers of the area excluded. </Quest>
        <QRef>[2512/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no standardised or formal arrangement in place along the lines suggested in the question.  Each case involving a nutrient poor lake or habitat must be considered on its scientifically based merits.</P>
        <P>In general, a landowner may have a proposed designation of land as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) or a Special Protection Area (SPA) reviewed through making an objection to designation on scientific grounds in writing to my Department along with a clear map of the land in question. Such objections must be made within a three-month period of the site being notified.</P>
        <P>The area will then be reviewed within my Department. Should the landowner be dissatisfied with the outcome they have an option to refer their case to the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1893 and 1902 together.</P>
        <P>Proposed sewerage works in Blenheim are ranked 4th of six sewerage schemes included in the list of schemes submitted by Waterford City Council in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to all local authorities last year to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.</P>

        <P>The operation of the Rural Water Programme is confined to the administrative areas of county councils and, consequently, this form of Programme funding is not available to urban authorities.</P>

	<P>The Heritage Council requested special funding from my Department in 2004 to permit them to grant assist emergency repairs to the roof of this property which has the status of a demesne of national <Col N="1194"/>importance. Total grant assistance of &euro;1,149.000 has been allocated over the past three years, with the final tranche to be drawn down shortly, (upon certification of completion of work scheduled for 2006). In addition, the project has also received special payments totalling &euro;44,500 over this period from the Heritage Council towards a conservation report and for architect&rsquo;s fees. </P>
        <P>The Heritage Council has estimated that completion of the roofing works will cost a further &euro;1m in 2007 and grant assistance for the entire amount is being sought. This proposal was recently received in my Department and is being considered. The Heritage Council is in consultation with the owners of the property regarding other conservation work which is required and to ensure that adequate provision is made to protect the structure for the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.  I have asked local authorities to engage with commercial waste collectors to agree on arrangements to assist lower-<Col N="1197"/>income households by offering alternative payment methods to an annual lump-sum.</P>
        <P>I have also recently published a consultation paper on the possible economic regulation of the waste sector. Submissions have been invited on whether there is a need for a regulator for the sector, on what model of regulator might be most appropriate and on what powers any such regulator should be given. Among the possible powers discussed in the paper is the power to impose a public service obligation which might facilitate the provision of a waste collection service to households where there is a geographical or financial barrier to service provision. When I have considered submissions in response to the consultation I will determine what policy proposals to take forward.</P>

	<P>The Local Government Act 2001 modernises the legislative framework, supports community involvement with local authorities in a more participative local democracy and underpins generally the programme of local government renewal.  The 2001 Act also facilitates improved access, interaction, linkages and service provision for all towns and areas with their respective county councils.  Local authorities, as part of the local government modernisation programme, have extensive capacity to innovate and adapt to changing circumstances and local demands, including those of economic and population growth.</P>
        <P>I am considering the steps necessary to commence the relevant provisions of the 2001 Act in respect of new town councils and I am in discussion with local government interests in this regard, as the opportunities arise.  I continue to keep the position under review, while consolidating progress on quality customer service measures, with the aim of ensuring good accessible local government service delivery for all towns.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works, in association with Dublin City Council and Fingal, Kildare and South Dublin County Councils, commissioned ERM to draw up a strategy for the Liffey Valley.  The report, Towards a Liffey Valley Park was published in November 2006 and it is being considered by the implementing authorities concerned.</P>
        <P>The report does not recommend the designation of the Liffey Valley as a National Park nor would this be possible at present given that only State lands are comprised in Irish National Parks.</P>
        <P>The development plans of the relevant local authorities provide the primary land use protec<Col N="1206"/>tion policies for the Liffey Valley.  In addition parts of the Valley are covered by special designations.  The area between Chapelizod and Lucan is protected by a Special Area Amenity Order and part of the valley is designated as a proposed Natural Heritage Area (site code 128).</P>

	<P>The improvement of non-national roads in County Mayo is a matter for Mayo County Council to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State grants provided by my Department. I announced the 2007 non-national road grant allocations on 18 January 2007. Grants totalling &euro;27,274,625 were allocated to Mayo County Council, representing an increase of 12% on the 2006 initial allocation to the Council. </P>
        <P>In 2006, my Department sought applications from local authorities for consideration for funding under the 2007 Specific Improvements Grant scheme.  The initial selection of projects under this scheme is a matter for local authorities.  Mayo County Council submitted 9 applications, all of which received an allocation in 2007.  The Council&rsquo;s submission did not, however, include an application for works on the R312 between Castlebar and Erris.</P>
        <P>Mayo County Council may also use the discretionary improvement grant provided by my Department towards the carrying out of such works.  In 2007 the discretionary improvement grant allocation to Mayo County Council is &euro;1,651,000, an increase of 3% on the 2006 initial allocation to the Council.  The selection of works to be funded from this allocation is a matter for Mayo County Council.</P>
