	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I was very pleased to continue the series of meetings in the structured process of dialogue between the Government and the churches, faith communities and non-confessional organisations in Ireland.  With Government colleagues, I met the Humanist Association of Ireland, the Religious Society of Friends and the Baha&rsquo;i community on 11 October last.  The meetings were very positive and addressed a wide range of issues relating to the role of churches and non-confessional groups in society, education and health services, migration and integration issues, peace and reconciliation and the environment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Humanist Association of Ireland had been invited to prepare an agenda for this inaugural meeting that would have facilitated an initial discussion at the meeting.  A comprehensive docu<Col N="658"/>ment was prepared and published by the association on its website in advance of the meeting.  It was not possible to address all the issues of concern to the Humanist Association on this occasion.  Our discussion concentrated on issues relating to education and health.  In education, it is specifically looking at parental preference in schools, issues of capacity and choice, teacher training and the role of chaplains in education.  In health, it has broadly similar issues relating to patient services, ethics and certain concerns with regard to chaplains and symbols.  Many other issues such as constitutional change, marriage registration and charities legislation were also discussed.  The full range of issues is set out in the submission received from the Humanist Association and I recommend interested parties to consult it directly.</P>
        <P>Our meeting was very positive with a lively discussion in which the proposals of the association were addressed in the light of established circumstances.  It was not anticipated that the meeting would give rise to immediate initiatives towards change.  Nonetheless, it was a welcome opportunity to exchange perspectives and develop a better appreciation of the Humanist view.</P>
        <P>The bilateral meetings are oriented towards the exchange of views on these important subjects.  The dialogue process is not intended as a negotiation forum or towards decision making on immediate issues.  These are matters that would be addressed with individual Ministers and Departments having regard to their functional responsibilities.  Our purpose in the process is to afford an opportunity for the expression and consideration of the faith perspectives and principles of all the partners.  It is particularly useful at a time of rapid change in society.  Recent years have brought new cultures and identities to be included in our society.  There have also been significant changes from the patterns of previous generations of the Irish people with regard to their faith identities and observance.</P>
        <P>Deputies will recall that the process of dialogue was launched at Dublin Castle in February last with a plenary assembly of the dialogue partners.  Bilateral meetings took place with the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Jewish community and the Islamic community prior to the general election.  I am looking forward to meeting other partners in the process shortly.  My officials are engaged in making the arrangements for those meetings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach must have said some other prayers before the general election.  Will he arrange to meet representatives of the Sikh community to discuss the wearing of turbans in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  As it is a matter of some considerable interest, does the Taoiseach intend to meet the people in question?</P><Col N="659"/>
        <P>It is perfectly obvious that the churches in Ireland have responsible attitudes towards their own communities and the country in which they live.  As the Taoiseach is aware, some Muslim clerics in Britain have attempted to whip up a certain amount of fervour about issues which they deem to be important.  Has the Taoiseach discussed the questions of tolerance and peace in the future with representatives of the various communities in Ireland, including representatives of the Islamic faith here?  The Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il two years ago that representatives of al-Qaeda cells were operating in Ireland.  Did he raise that matter with the representatives of the various groups when he met them?</P>
        <P>When the Taoiseach met representatives of the Catholic church, which owns many schools in this country, did he discuss the future of our education system with them?  Organisations like Educate Together have called for a stronger focus on multidenominational education.  Did the Taoiseach discuss the matter with the representatives of the Catholic church?  Does he have a view on where our education system is heading?  Did this issue arise at the meetings in question?  I welcome the elevation of Cardinal Se&aacute;n Brady to the hierarchy of the Catholic church.  It is a great honour for him, his family and the country as a whole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I had meetings earlier this year with a group that operates as a single representative body for the Islamic faith in Ireland.  As Deputy Kenny knows, there are different segments and associations within that faith in this country.  They operate in a single group for this purpose.  I had those meetings earlier this year.  I also had meetings with representatives of the Catholic church as part of that round of meetings.</P>
        <P>I recall the meetings.  The Garda Commissioner is responsible for the turban issue as it is an operational matter for the force.  We had an extensive debate about Islam and the education system in Ireland.  We spoke about the requirements of the schools in Clonskeagh.  We discussed the practices of people of that faith who are being educated in other educational establishments.  A number of educational issues raised by the group in question are being followed up within the Department of Education and Science.  We had a number of discussions about the need for the Islamic community to integrate into Irish society as fully as possible.  As Deputy Kenny knows, I have always had a practice of engaging with them and going to their Clonskeagh mosque on important occasions.  I have done that for a number of years.</P>
        <P>They are following those issues with the various Departments.  Both they and I are very anxious to ensure that mistakes &mdash; or at least perceived mistakes &mdash; which were made in other jurisdictions are avoided and that they integrate <Col N="660"/>into social life and organisations.  The Constitution entitles them and any other faith group to their own practices but wherever possible there should be integration and dialogue.  Their leadership is very anxious that this be the case.</P>
        <P>They have a number of issues which are being dealt with by other Departments.  As we have already stated, where possible, the different new communities in the country should be represented within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, such as the Chinese and other nationalities as well as other groups such as the Islamic groups.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case of the Catholic church, there is ongoing dialogue between church representatives and officials of the Department of Education and Science regarding the school patron system.  A number of pilot systems are currently being operated.  I suggest the Deputy put down a question to the Minister for Education and Science as I have not been dealing with those issues.  It is quite clear the churches will not be able to sustain and manage schools in the way they have done traditionally and there is a move towards a system of lay boards of management.  Even so, there will be quite a number of changes within the structures over the next number of years and this is an ongoing major issue which is being dealt with by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that next year, 58 new schools will be required in the greater Dublin area and that a total of 18,000 more children will commence primary level than will leave it.  This means there will be a need for 18,000 new places.  The challenge for the country, for Departments and for the collective churches is enormous.  Those discussions with the Departments are ongoing and will continue for quite some time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Taoiseach that it is obvious changes in the structures, particularly at primary level, are required, considering the ownership of so many schools lies in the hands of the church.  In that context, did the Taoiseach discuss the undoubted difficulties that many boards of management face in that they are voluntary and under the auspices of a patron?  Is the church aware of the difficulties at this level?  Was this included in the discussions on the changed structure to be adopted for future years?  </P>
        <P>One of the significant difficulties faced by the Taoiseach on behalf of the country is the confusion and lack of understanding between the Christian world and the Islamic world which comes to a head with the issue of Turkey&rsquo;s accession to the European Union, the issues to do with Iran and Iraq and the Middle East in general.</P>
        <P>I refer to the University of Alexandria which has a significant cultural dimension to its education programme by examining the differences and difficulties which exist between religions and <Col N="661"/>how a more profound and broad understanding can be achieved.  Given that we are now dealing with a huge number of different nationalities due to immigration, is there a role for the involvement of education in some shape or other in dealing with cultural issues to promote understanding by persons of different religions and those who may be of the Christian faith?  An understanding of culture and tradition would go a long way towards breaking down some of the barriers that clearly do exist.  Was that issue raised, or does the Taoiseach see the Department of Education and Science, universities or the academic world having some role and dimension in that important area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the new community-type primary schools and the issue of multi-faith, I hope we will see a number of these developments moving next year.  In west Dublin we have pilot schemes in place.  Work is well under way on that and people are working hard to try to achieve integration in primary schools.  Deputy Kenny is aware, as are other Members of the House, of the enormous progress that has been made.  Several schools now have more than 20 nationalities and seven or eight religious or faith groups.  Integration is taking place at that level.  Schools receive additional resources to address class size, language training etc.  By and large they are working out.  Once there is not over-segregation, they can manage and are managing.  I have visited a number of these schools in recent years and they are carrying out their job well.</P>
        <P>We have come from a position of having a very small Muslim community.  From the various groups and imams to whom I have spoken, I understand the community has grown to something in the region of 40,000 people and that is a considerable challenge.  Many of them choose to go to Catholic schools but opt out for religion while many others attend colleges.  This is something we will have to work hard at managing.  It was easy enough to do it when the numbers were smaller.  It is a big challenge for the Department but, in fairness to the imams and community leaders with whom I have had a number of meetings, apart from the one on which I am reporting here, they are very conscious of their role and clear about how they can work with the Department and engage with it to address the issue.  This is probably working out also at third level.</P>
        <P>This is an issue of which we must be very conscious.  We are all familiar with many of the churches involved in the structural dialogue but there are many new ones and it is a question of managing all of these together.  A large proportion of the immigrant population is from Africa now and we must try to integrate it into the schools.  Both the pupils and their parents have been hugely supportive of doing that but it does require a hands-on effort.  The Minister of <Col N="662"/>State with responsibility for integration, Deputy Conor Lenihan, has had a number of meetings with these groups.  We have to continue to work very closely with them.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Kenny is aware, some groups and organisations have asked about separate schools and curricula.  To be honest, I have not been forthcoming on that.  I do not see it as being the way forward.  We cannot do that.  We do not have the resources to go down that road now or in the future.  I am a strong believer in integration.  This is Ireland and we have an Irish way of life.  We will do the best we can to integrate people, to understand them and be considerate and thoughtful about that, and to engage in this process.</P>
        <P>Regarding the chances of setting up schools, I do not wish to refer to one group or another but I have been asked by some groups and I have been asked by the politicians in their countries also to provide them but I have not given a shred of support to that.  It is not something with which I agree.  It is not possible for us to resource it.  Only a limited number ask for it anyway.  I have rejected it in all cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the structured dialogue process that has been initiated between the Government and the churches.  Does the Taoiseach plan to widen that process to include the body politic as a whole?  The process at present is confined to the Government and the churches.  I understand that the churches have set out their priorities and concerns about issues they wish to have addressed as part of that process.  The Taoiseach said some of the churches and faith groups had published some documents in that regard.  Has the Government prepared or issued any documents in response to the issues they raised?  I refer in particular to the education area, specifically the comments and suggestion made by the Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, that his church was open to a new discussion with the State in respect of educational provision and how the patronage of schools might be organised in the future.  In that context, has there been any discussion of the issues raised by some of the Protestant churches in respect of the proposed transfer of teachers from Catholic schools, which are closing down, to the panels from which Protestant schools draw their teaching staff?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s support for the initiative.  We are only eight months into it, which covers the general election and the summer break, so we do not have plans to extend it at this stage.  We are trying to get it up and running.  The agenda is enormously wide, ranging from the Humanist, Baha&rsquo;i, The Religious Society of Friends or Quakers, Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, the Lutheran Church and the Moravians to the more traditional groups we <Col N="663"/>have been dealing with.  It is a job keeping it together.  We can perhaps engage more with Parliament ultimately, but at this stage we are just trying to build it up and fix the agenda.  I am structuring it through a secretariat in my Department meeting and dealing with the issues and then trying to put them into a departmental structure where direct engagement will follow.  It will ensure the issues are followed up and are not simply dropped.  I hope that by next summer we will have a good process in that regard.</P>
        <P>Obviously, some of the bigger groups seek more meetings and dialogue.  The Deputy mentioned the comments of the Archbishop of Dublin.  The archbishop has a huge diocese and huge physical resources in terms of his Catholic priests and his staff.  The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, has been involved in meetings at the Archbishop&rsquo;s Palace to consider how to proceed with this and examining the pilot scheme for opening up a new system.  However, that must be dealt with carefully.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For the other groups, the main issues relate to education.  Issues surrounding the registration of marriages and the forms of marriage is another large category, led by the Humanists.  However, the large issue is education and how children can be protected and continue their role in society while maintaining their values and at the same time integrating into society.  They want to play their part in society and they support the integrated model.  However, on the matter of educating their children in the Jewish tradition or any other, they cannot all have their own schools.  The cost would be prohibitive.  That is a big challenge for the Department of Education and Science at a time when there is quite a large increase in the numbers entering the education system.  As Deputies know, in recent years there has been a decline in the numbers attending primary and secondary school.  That has now changed dramatically.  This year, 15,000 additional children entered primary school and next year it will be 18,000.  The increase has not yet hit our secondary schools but it will in a few years.  At a time when members of many new religious groups are entering the country, there is pressure on our schools due to the additional pupils.  It is a major challenge for us.  We are engaging in discussions with all of these groups and trying to keep higher grants for the minority schools, as we always have done as a society, and provide maintenance grants for minority religions.  Thus, the Department of Education and Science represents the largest part of the structural dialogue and also faces the biggest challenge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Taoiseach consider it a good idea to establish a national education forum?  As he said, the majority of the issues being discussed as part of the structural <Col N="664"/>dialogue, not surprisingly, centre around the area of education.  He has given a good outline of the current situation, in which there is a large range of churches and an increasing demand for separate provision.  Whether it is desirable from the point of view of integration, separate provision is not something that can be achieved from the point of view of resources.  However, if separate provision cannot be made for some churches, this raises wider issues.  These should be addressed in a new education forum where the needs of parents and their children are put on the table along with the wishes of the respective churches and the capacity of the State to respond to the different demands and aspirations for educational provision and a resolution arrived at.</P>
        <P>There is not a great deal of time for discussion of these issues because, as the Taoiseach said, the children are already coming into the schools.  We saw some evidence of the resulting pressure on primary schools this year.  This will quickly work its way through to second level.  Could this discussion be advanced more rapidly by a new national educational forum than by the structured dialogue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not rule out Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s suggestion, although I need to put it to the Minister for Education and Science, who deals with this on a weekly basis.  All of the non-confessional organisations, faith communities and churches have set out their positions now and for the next few years.  We have discussed this with the Department of Education and Science and incorporated it into the process.  There is an educational forum within the Department in which dialogue is conducted directly with the trade unions and the patron bodies, although this may need to be extended.  Thus, a forum exists in which these discussions can take place.  However, I will put the point to the Minister.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is close liaison between the various bodies and the process is a demanding one because it is new.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is something that did not exist five years ago, but it is now a substantial part of the work of the Department.  The issue is whether the forum in the Department, which deals directly with the patron bodies and the trade unions, needs to be extended and I will put the Deputy&rsquo;s point to the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Deputy Kenny in extending congratulations to Cardinal Se&aacute;n Brady on his elevation at the weekend.</P>
        <P>On the Taoiseach&rsquo;s dialogue with the various churches and the different faith communities, the issue of education which previous speakers addressed in some depth is a vast and complex area.  Can the Taoiseach give us a sense of the time he can devote in terms of these engagements to such an important and complex area?</P><Col N="665"/>
        <P>In his respective engagements, is he meeting with the churches and faith communities individually or collectively to discuss this matter?  Is this matter discussed collectively with representatives of the churches or is it on a one-on-one basis with the Taoiseach and representatives of the churches or the faith communities concerned?</P>
        <P>I ask the Taoiseach to note that I concur with Deputy Gilmore regarding his proposal for a specific forum in which to address this matter more substantively.  Will the Taoiseach elaborate on his disposition to this request?  Given the position in north County Dublin in the late summer and early autumn period with the advent of the new school term, when children were not afforded schoolplaces because the management of the schools was under Catholic control and they accorded first access to children baptised into the Catholic religion and giving those children precedence over children of other faith communities, does the Taoiseach accept that this indicates there is an urgency in this area?</P>
        <P>There is a universal acceptance &mdash; it goes without saying, given all the points made &mdash; of the tremendous role the Catholic church and other churches have played in the provision of education for the greater number of us.  It simply would not have been provided otherwise because the State has clearly failed in its role and function of providing State education at all levels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I met Cardinal Brady before he left and I will meet him on his return later in the week.  His elevation to Cardinal is a great honour for the island, North and South.</P>
        <P>To answer Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in regarding the structure and how I have handled these meetings, it is a new position.  We only held the inaugural meeting of everybody in Dublin Castle at the end of February last.  I and a number of Ministers relevant to the agenda meet representatives of the church.  As the churches cover the entire island, it is usually a sizable delegation with representatives from their various communities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>A church.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A church.  The next group will be the Presbyterian Church, which will be a separate meeting.  The Methodist Church will be next followed by the Orthodox churches, which are being met as a group.  I also meet the Islamic faiths as a group.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will be aware, there are different bodies but I try as much as possible to bring the Imams together for these purposes.  We have most, although one group may not be represented.</P>
        <P>That is the order and we take it as per the agenda with the relevant Ministers.  For example, there have been communications with the Catholic church, Presbyterian church, Methodist church and, to a lesser extent, the Baptist church and they have their own structures built up over <Col N="666"/>many years, but the others do not.  There has never been much dialogue with the Humanist Association.  I have visited the Religious Society of Friends, the Quakers, who have played a significant role in the State, but the Baha&rsquo;i community is relatively new.  We try to bring them together in a national body.  While some have small memberships, their members and communities are active.  I have spent a year trying to organise this and to move their agenda items into their communities.</P>
        <P>Education is a big part of this issue.  The Islamic faith is seeking to make arrangements with local authorities to build new mosques and get land.  Some other churches are trying to seek limited assistance.  On education, a number of things have happened.  A new integration unit has recently been established around the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, in meeting communities and attending meetings with me to co-ordinate the work of the new communities.  The new unit is important.  There are new multi-faith community primary schools, of which we hope to have one up and running next year.  Co-ordination is happening in respect of the schools in the four Dublin local authority areas and the surrounding areas of Meath, Louth, Kildare and Wicklow where a lot of the growth is happening.</P>
        <P>There is a forum in the Department of Education and Science, but I do not deal with it and I am not totally familiar with its workings.  It deals with trade unions and patron bodies.  That is operating it.  The conference of bishops at Maynooth recently stated the Catholic church&rsquo;s positive preference towards facilitating diversity and that they are open to change.  Due to the growth in these schools and the population generally, many of these schools will have a large number of multinational, but also multi-faith, pupils.  It is a challenge.  Much good work is being done and many schools in Dublin West, the centre of the city and in other places have worked well.  Good models are being built up.  There has been a very large increase in the number of teachers.  The number of language teachers has increased by 400% in the last few years, including 800 teachers this year.</P>
        <P>Most of these issues are ongoing.  I do not deal with the day-to-day educational details, but we are managing these issues.  In so far as we possibly can, we must keep the new communities integrated in our schools.  These schools will move to a new model and, in some cases, new patrons, which is probably inevitable because the churches, due to resources, will not be able to play their traditional parts.  Like the Deputy, I agree with the enormous role they have played, but because of their numerical strength, they will not be able to play it.  The Department is conscious of this, but the structure and patronage issues are being dealt with by the Department of Education and Science.  Models are being rolled <Col N="667"/>out, which is important.  Educate Together and other bodies are being well facilitated by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I accept the Taoiseach has dealt with this issue comprehensively, giving examples of the education side of integration policy.  Will he agree there is a strong need for education for those immigrants from different faiths and ethnic backgrounds beyond school-going age?</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Cork city there is a large demand for English language teaching.  Several voluntary organisations provide it but are just scraping funds together to do so.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is working on the issue but I appeal to the Taoiseach to examine it in a proactive way.  There is a large appetite for such education.  Immigrants must be encouraged to learn to speak English so they can integrate in a more proactive way socially and in the workplace.</P>
        <P>It is important for us to accommodate different faiths, cultures and languages within the education system.  It is also important to reassure those religious organisations, be they Presentation Brothers or Christian Brothers or other religious orders, which have made a fantastic contribution to education.  Within some schools, there are concerns that the potential exists to undermine a religious ethos in education which they have built up over a prolonged period.  It is important to ensure parents have an opportunity to choose to send their children to a school with a certain background and religious ethos.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach said, this is Ireland.  We need to invest in accommodating difference and diversity as the modern Ireland continues to change.  We also need to reassure those who have built up a positive religious ethos in schools that it will continue to be supported by the Government.</P>

	<P>On the less heady aspect of education, a fundamental question arises as to the role of the teacher, which seems to me to have slipped away.  Teachers are anxious to retain the integrity of the professional relationship with the child.  Whoever is being taught, the relationship between the teacher and the pupil is the important one.  Surely teachers would want to aspire to an equality of prospects for permanent employment and promotion within whatever mixed model emerges.  This relates to an earlier question.  If either of the two denominations were to hold out on the exemption they have achieved in the Equality Act an absurd situation would arise whereby the most highly qualified teachers, who may be specialists in teaching difference or difficulties associated with English as a foreign language, would not have the assurance of permanency, promotion or establishment.  Their professional prospects would be heavily compromised and one would preside over inequality within what purports to be a system accommodating new difference. </P>

	<P>I agree 100% with Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s views.  We must maintain, support and encourage those who have made such a significant contribution.  They have stated that they are open to change because of their own position and because they want to facilitate diversity.  That change must, however, accommodate their ethos and what they have done.  Traditionally, they belong to the church and have fought for their ethos but they have never stopped people joining classes in their schools and have accommodated them and made arrangements for religious difference, excluding people from parts of the curriculum while allowing them to attend the schools.  That good practice is being used in many schools around the country where we never expected to have multi-denominational schools with people from various religious backgrounds and faith communities.  We must build on what we have and keep our religious people involved in the changing structure because they have achieved this over the years.</P><Col N="669"/>
        <P>The former Deputy de Valera, when she was Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, built up significant resources for the unemployed and others and I have been made aware in the past year that much of that resource has been moved to cater for the new Irish, the people who come here.  The demand for English language tuition exceeds supply by a fairly high factor and we must improve capacity.  We should encourage it and make sure that we have space for it.  Given that demand for English language tuition is very high, it is eating into the resources set aside for the long-term unemployed.  It now assists the new Irish, which is good, but we must keep the resources there because it is stretching the system.</P>
        <P>I do not want to put the Cork-Swansea ferry into a tunnel because it would not float very well.  I have seen the state-of-the-art airport in Cork, one of the most modern to be seen anywhere.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no doubt that a very small contribution would resolve these issues so Deputy P.J. Sheehan might put in a good word to contribute to the hundreds of millions of euro that have been invested in it.  If the Deputy used his considerable powers in the area that could all be wrapped up before the Christmas period. </P>
        <P>In response to Deputy Higgins, the role of the teacher is crucial because the teacher must deal with the changed situation whereby in many schools it is not uncommon to have 15 or 20 nationalities and seven or eight religions.  That is happening and doing well in schools with Catholic boards of management.</P>
        <P>The Ceann Comhairle has greater knowledge of the equality issue than I do and it is a matter that involved a great deal of negotiation with the churches.  I am aware of the historical difficulties that relate to ethos and power of employment and they do not apply only to one church, as the churches bind together tightly on this matter, but the subject may not be as difficult to address as previously because the system has changed from what it traditionally was.  There are now more religions represented in Ireland and schools and boards of management are showing more flexibility.  In individual cases issues such as morals and standards may arise but one will not receive much of a response from the churches on such matters.  I went through this issue with the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, when he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and it is one on which the churches act collectively.</P>
        <P>I take the point that we must embrace the fact that 10% of the population, over 400,000 people, <Col N="670"/>come from other communities.  The process of successful integration into Irish society must begin with education.  The teacher plays the main role in making this happen.</P>

        <Quest> the Government policy with respect to the future of Kosovo; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The difficult and sensitive issue of Kosovo&rsquo;s future status is the legacy of the Balkan wars of the 1990s.  The framework for post-conflict Kosovo was set out in UN Security Council Resolution 1244 which established an interim United Nations civilian administration and authorised an international security presence, Kosovo Force, KFOR.  The resolution also provided for a gradual transfer of competence from the United Nations civilian administration mission to provisional institutions of self-government. </P>
        <P Just="Left">In November 2005 the former Finnish President, Martti Ahtisaari, was appointed as the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s special envoy to lead the political process to determine the future status of Kosovo in a final settlement.  Following more than one year of consultations and direct talks with the parties, Mr. Ahtisaari submitted his comprehensive proposal to the Secretary General in March this year.  He recommended that Kosovo&rsquo;s status should be independent and supervised by the international community.  The proposal includes detailed provisions concerning the promotion and protection of the rights of communities and their members.  A key element of the proposed settlement would be a continuing international civilian and military presence in Kosovo, with the KFOR military force remaining and a new civilian European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP, mission created.</P>
        <P>Ireland welcomed this proposal but, regrettably, intensive efforts within the UN Security Council to agree on a new resolution on the basis of the Ahtisaari proposals ended in failure.  On 1 August the Secretary General announced that an international troika would facilitate a further four months of direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina.  No agreement has yet been found and the Troika is due to report to the UN Secretary General on the outcome of these talks on 10 December.</P>
        <P>During his recent visit to the Balkans the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, met leaders in Belgrade and Pristina.  He expressed Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for the troika <Col N="671"/>process and urged both parties to take a constructive approach to try to find an agreed solution.</P>
     
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
<P>It was clear from these discussions that the positions of the two sides remained diametrically opposed.  We hope the talks may yet produce a positive outcome, but if they do not, we recognise that difficult choices will need to be made which deal with the reality of the situation on the ground.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With our partners in the European Union and the international community, Ireland is ready to play its full part in the efforts to resolve this important European issue.  Since August we have increased our commitment to KFOR to 270 troops, following our assumption of command of task force centre which covers the capital Pristina and the surrounding area.  While we will face a more complex and uncertain political and legal environment in the event that there is no agreement on final status, we very much hope to be in a position to maintain our presence in KFOR, to consider contributing members of the Garda to an ESDP mission and to support the future economic development of Kosovo.</P>
 </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State but I am not fully satisfied with his reply; perhaps there is more information in the part he did not read out.  What is the Government&rsquo;s policy on the future status of Kosovo?  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, stated Europe would be united on the issue.  Will there be agreement on it by 10 December?  Will there be a united European position?  It is probable that a unilateral declaration of independence will be made in Kosovo.  Will the Government support it?  What will be the implications for Irish participation in KFOR of the probable unilateral declaration?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the speculation alluded to by the Deputy, agreement will be difficult to reach and if it is not reached, hard choices will have to be made.  Ireland is ready to play a full part in efforts to resolve this issue with our European partners and the international community.  Since August we have increased our presence on the ground; 270 troops are now attached to KFOR and Ireland has taken command of the task force centre.</P>
        <P>The Deputy mentioned our position on the UN resolution.  It is clear that, in the absence of a new resolution, there will be complex political and legal issues to be considered by member states.  To answer another of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions, I hope the European Union will adopt a single cohesive approach because to do otherwise would be damaging.  Like other member states, we will have to reflect carefully on all the issues that arise <Col N="672"/>and prepare to deal with whatever situation will face us.  We do not wish to be diverted by speculation and are committed, not only because 270 troops are on the ground but because we have made a commitment to put members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in place.  One hopes sanity will prevail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it fair to assume, based on the Minister of State&rsquo;s response, that the Government does not have a position on the future status of Kosovo?  It appears that the only solution comes under the European Union&rsquo;s umbrella.  An indication could be given to Serbia that it will eventually gain EU membership and that Kosovo&rsquo;s declaration of independence will be recognised.  Does the Minister of State have a view on this?  I would like to agree with him that a united EU front is possible on this issue but I do not believe it is.  There has been much procrastination on the matter.  As we face a stumbling block, it is important that the Government outlines its position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>If the European Union sticks together between now and 10 December and makes its expectation clear to the parties in the region, this will be far better than independent speculation.  The Government is committed to finding a solution and sees this as a European problem that must be solved by Europeans.  The best way for the European Union to make a concrete contribution is to stick together.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The international meeting taking place in Annapolis today represents a crucial opportunity to restore momentum to the Middle East peace process.  The Government and its partners in Europe have strongly supported the preparatory work for the meeting and the political dialogue between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas.  It is important that these discussions now lead to meaningful and urgent final status negotiations for a lasting and just two-state solution.  The negotiations will have to address the most sensitive issues at the heart of the conflict, including borders, settlements, security, refugees and the status of Jerusalem.  This should provide the opportunity for serious move<Col N="673"/>ment towards a comprehensive regional settlement, building on the historic Arab peace initiative which was launched in Beirut in 2002 and reaffirmed by the Arab summit in Riyadh in March this year. </P>
        <P>The European Union will have an important role to play in the coming months, working directly with the parties and as an active member of the international Quartet.  The Government has for some time been among those member states that have sought to strengthen the Quartet and the European Union&rsquo;s role in it.  Depending on developments, it may be that a proposal for the establishment of a permanent secretariat could be considered to add focus to the work of the Quartet.  The Government would judge any such proposal on the contribution it might make to the achievement of the strategic objective of a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</P>
        <P>To be credible the renewed political process must be bolstered in the weeks ahead by decisive action to improve the daily lives of the people most directly affected by the conflict.  This must involve an end to all violence in and from the occupied territories, a genuine freeze on the building of settlements and the lifting of checkpoints.  Prisoner releases will also make a vital contribution to the reduction of tensions.  We are strongly of the view that the two-state solution is the only viable option, a point I made recently at a meeting of EuroMed in Lisbon.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The Government is particularly concerned by the humanitarian situation facing the 1.4 million people living in Gaza and by the serious disruption to vital economic activity in the territory.  We have called for the ending of all policies aimed at isolating the people of Gaza and for the urgent re-opening of crossing points for people and goods.  We strongly agree with the statement of the UN Secretary General that the interruption of essential services to the civilian population would be contrary to Israel&rsquo;s obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law and to its own interests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Several questions immediately arise from the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  Will he consider the Annapolis meeting a failure if its final statement does not address the issues he mentioned, including the future status of Jerusalem, illegal settlements and so on?  Does he agree that the credibility of the European Union is badly damaged by, in the first instance, the clearing house decision that added Hamas to a proscribed list, with no accountability to this Parliament or any parliament in Europe, and, following that, its failure to recognise the result of the election, which was acknowledged as free and fair by several international bodies, including the Carter Centre?  All we had from the EU was a mealy-mouthed statement expressing gratitude that no lives had been lost in the course of the <Col N="674"/>election.  It is absolutely absurd to suggest it is dealing with all the parties.  What contact has the EU with Hamas?  Most commentators, including the British Foreign Office, agree the only solution will involve talks that include both Hamas and Fatah.  Where is the semblance of that recognition in anything the EU says?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, suggested in a previous reply to a question on this issue that he had made the Irish position known.  However, we do not know what the Irish position is.  Is it our position not to recognise the results of the election?  Is it our position not to have any contact with Hamas?  Is it our position never to remind Israel that as an occupying force, it is in breach of international law by cutting off vital structures for Gaza?</P>
        <P>It seems some slow and tedious progress is being made through the permanent secretariat.  I am pleased the Minister seems to be following my suggestion in this regard.  However, the notion that we should rely on a press release from a meeting in Annapolis as an alternative to such a secretariat is depressing, as is the operation of an exclusion policy towards some of the participants in the conflict.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>We hope that all of the issues mentioned, particularly the rights of the 1.4 million people who are suffering in Gaza, will be dealt with in Annapolis.  The reality that has informed the attitude of the EU is somewhat misrepresented by Deputy Higgins, although I recognise that he makes his points with goodwill.  In the aftermath of the election, the EU&rsquo;s position is that there can be no twin track position that offers politics and violence in equal balance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>We in this country have learned something about ballot boxes and armalites.</P>
        <P>Our general position is that the policy of isolation of Gaza and its people is neither just nor politically sustainable.  With regard to the divisions among Palestinians, we are of the view that there is a need for reconciliation between Fatah, Hamas and the other political factions.  Reconciliation efforts should be encouraged.  However, the timing is delicate and that is an issue for the Palestinians.  Encouragement for both sides to come together is the right approach.</P>

        <QRef>[29346/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister attaches the highest priority to the economic work of diplomatic missions.  In the past year, a review of the Department&rsquo;s work in this area was carried out.  A set of guidelines was issued to advance the economic objectives set out in the programme for Government.  These guidelines reiterate that all missions have a role to play in promoting trade and investment; and that this role should be discharged in a dynamic manner.  My experience is that this is the case.  In addition, officials taking up diplomatic postings abroad in 2007 received intensive training in economic and trade related matters.  Follow-up to these initiatives is continuing.</P>
        <P>Embassies and consulates typically engage in a range of economic and trade work, including awareness-raising and promotional work, networking, identifying new market opportunities, maintaining and extending market access for Irish goods and services, and supporting business and young professional networks.  Missions lobby on a government-to-government basis on issues of concern.  Every opportunity is used, including high-level visits and bilateral meetings, to raise and advance Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests abroad.  Although often the subject of negative comment in this State, in this regard the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day phenomenon provides a unique and effective opportunity.  I attended an ASEAN conference in <Col N="676"/>Singapore last week.  Upon reaching my hotel, I learned that the ambassador, Mr. Richard O&rsquo;Brien, and his small staff had already arranged a series of bilateral meetings, to discuss such issues as Irish beef exports, educational matters and young and emerging Irish companies in the area.  A significant effort is being made to advance our economic interests in this way.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs cannot be here because he is visiting Japan to celebrate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries.   Among the objectives of the visit is to take forward the Ireland &mdash; Japan bilateral economic agenda.  The limited numbers of staff in most embassies are being used to great effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>On a recent visit to the Irish mission to the UN in New York, I was greatly impressed by the courtesy and professionalism of the staff.  The work of the diplomatic corps should be acknowledged in this House.</P>
        <P>One of the high-level goals of the Department of Foreign Affairs is to promote trade and investment opportunities for the State.  Since December 2000, Irish cost competitiveness has deteriorated by 30% against our trading partners.  Since 2002, our share of world merchandise trade has declined by one quarter.  For a country that relies on export trade and attracting foreign direct investment, particularly from the United States, it is vital that the Department of Foreign Affairs provides assistance to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in promoting Ireland abroad.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned in his reply that training in economic and trade related matters had commenced in 2007.  What is the location and duration of this training?  Does the Department have any plans to increase the number of embassy staff in the United States?  The falling dollar and our reliance on investment from that country make it imperative that we continue to attract such investment in coming years.  The diplomatic corps does an excellent job, but it is often the case that we must go outside regular diplomatic relations and adopt a more pro-investment and pro-business approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree absolutely with Deputy Timmins, particularly his last point.  That is already happening.  In Singapore, for example, the embassy has a small staff, but we have Ireland House there, along with Enterprise Ireland.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment also has staff on the ground in Singapore.  This is precisely the point being made by the Deputy of approaching in an holistic way the promotion of Ireland.  The Deputy also asked about training, which was more formalised in 2007 than it had been previously.  There is a now a very specific course put together with TCD and the <Col N="677"/>IMI which makes it even more professional and focused.</P>
        <P>The other issue dealt with by the Deputy is Irish cost competitiveness.  Although it is very important it is slightly beyond the remit of our embassies abroad.</P>

	<P>I will allow a very brief supplementary question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Some time ago I remember mentioning a concept to which the Department of Foreign Affairs has not warmed.  This is the idea of looking outside the diplomatic corps for assistance for these missions.  Retired politicians or people from the IDA could be used, either through secondment or other ways of assisting the missions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Timmins is making a very valid point.  For example, there is abhorrence in Ireland to using retired politicians for anything.  John Bruton currently represents Europe very well in Washington DC.  Many people with much skill could be called upon.</P>
        <P>With regard to networking and using the resources available on the ground, Irish embassies are unsurpassed.  The networks being established are extraordinary, as the Deputy will know from his recent visit to New York and the United States.  We have made a very small investment over the years in the East but we are punching way above our weight, doing very well with few resources.</P>

	<P>United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has assigned the task of monitoring implementation of the millennium development goals, MDGs, to the United Nations Development Programme.  This programme compiles information against each of the MDG targets in collaboration with national governments, regional groupings and experts, other UN partners, the World Bank, the IMF and the OECD.  The objective is to come up with a country and regional picture of progress on each of the goals.  The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs then draws on this material to issue regular reports on progress towards the goals.</P>
        <P>The latest MDG progress report, issued in July, gave us a snapshot of the progress achieved at the midpoint of the 2015 MDG target date, broken <Col N="678"/>down by goal and region.

Progress has also been made globally in reducing child mortality and increasing school enrolment rates.  However, there is significant geographical disparity, with sub-Saharan Africa at particular risk of falling behind.  It was for this reason the UN Secretary General convened an MDG Africa steering group in September of this year.  His initiative has brought together high level representatives of the African Union, European Union, African Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, IMF and World Bank, who will meet regularly to examine how to strengthen Africa&rsquo;s efforts to meet the goals.</P>
        <P>A further initiative aimed at measuring progress towards the MDGs has been taken by British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who has proposed that a Heads of State and Government meeting take place at the UN in September 2008 to revitalise the pledges made in 2000 and provide the impetus for more intensive efforts in the period up to 2015.  The British Prime Minister wrote to the Taoiseach about his proposal and the Taoiseach has replied indicating Ireland&rsquo;s strong support.  The Taoiseach has also indicated he would be willing to attend a preparatory meeting in Britain in spring 2008, as well as the New York event.</P>
        <P>Ireland is participating fully in efforts to achieve the MDGs.  As set out in the White Paper on Irish Aid, the millennium development goals are the overarching framework for our overseas aid programme.  By delivering on the commitment to reach the 0.7% UN target for development funding by 2012, Ireland is also seen as being at the forefront of their implementation internationally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  The Minister of State may be aware that a number of Irish aid agencies met with the EU Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid in the past couple of days.  They had a concern in looking at the millennium development goals.  In the health and education areas, for example, the EU has fallen way behind in its millennium development goal commitments.</P>
        <P>The concern is that the emphasis seems to be shifting to a trade agenda from a purely aid agenda.  In some of the categories the percentages are very low compared to set targets.  Will the Minister of State respond to this or indicate the kind of talks which have been held with his counterparts in Europe to ensure the set targets are maintained?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="679"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland is very much aware of the role it must play in reaching the millennium development goals and we are focusing very much on reducing poverty and supporting the provision of basic services to the poorest people in the world.  Clearly our goal is reaching 0.7% of GDP by 2012, three years earlier than the agreed European Union deadline of 2015.  The interim target this year was 0.5% and we are going for an interim target of 0.6% by 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy raised an issue regarding trade which is very relevant now because we are discussing economic partnership agreements.  We have had two meetings of development Ministers, with the last meeting in Brussels.  I put the point that I do not want any ACP country to be worse off on 1 January than when we met on 20 November.  There will be a report back to the Council in December.</P>
        <P>It is vitally important to secure arrangements which would allow trade to continue without interruption, and the least we can expect is for arrangements to be put in place which will not disadvantage developing countries.  Ireland has often stated that the development aspects of economic partnership agreements, EPAs, must take priority and I put that point to the Commission at the recent meeting.  EPAs will be the major instruments of our relations with ACP countries and they should fully reflect both trade and development aspects.  I called upon the Commission to conduct negotiations in the spirit of goodwill, flexibility and understanding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the Minister of State understands my point.  Concerns were raised by aid agencies when they met the Commissioner that the agenda is becoming more trade-oriented, as opposed to purely aid-oriented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the issue been raised in the Minister of State&rsquo;s meetings in Europe?  How will the Minister of State assure people that, from our standpoint, a purely aid agenda is carried on instead of a trade agenda?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s support on this.  That is the very point I have been making at the meetings, first of all in Madeira and more recently in Brussels.  We are pressing very hard, particularly in Africa, which the Deputy would accept has fallen behind.  There has been more progress in China and other Asian countries.</P>
        <P>We can also consider with some satisfaction that some 6 million schoolchildren are now attending schools in Uganda, for example, where only 2 million were attending those schools 13 years ago.  We have made very good progress with regard to home-care packages in countries such as Mozambique, which I visited recently.  A high <Col N="680"/>proportion of the funding there goes to tackling HIV-AIDS.</P>
        <P>We are very keen on the development issues, which I stressed at all our meetings should be the direction we, as a country, would like to go.  We will work on that, particularly with the funding through the United Nations, NGOs and missionaries and the bilateral programmes with the seven programme countries, particularly in Africa.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The reform treaty will be signed by Heads of State and Government, including the Taoiseach, on 13 December and is expected to be ratified by each member state before 1 January 2009.  The Government has sought formal legal advice from the Attorney General on whether ratification of the treaty requires an amendment to the Constitution.  It is anticipated that this question will be answered positively.</P>
        <P>A date has not been set for the referendum but the Irish people will have an opportunity to express their vote on the treaty, probably in the middle of next year.  Before a referendum can be held, the Oireachtas must pass the necessary enabling legislation.  I assure the House that I intend to use both Houses of the Oireachtas to ensure we have the fullest possible debates on the treaty.</P>
        <P>As Members will know I have already written to every Member in the House, those who are for the treaty and those likely to be against it, providing a summary of the treaty&rsquo;s main provisions and offering further briefing as desired.  A number of Deputies have already taken up that offer.  We will shortly be in contact with party spokespersons to arrange formal consultations on the treaty and its ratification.</P>
        <P>A referendum campaign should be preceded by a very active information effort.</P>
        <P>To this end a short explanatory pamphlet on the treaty will be published next month.  A dedicated website will be established, dealing with the most frequently asked questions on the treaty.  The Government will publish a non-technical guide to the treaty in January and a White Paper in January or February.  We should make the language associated with this treaty as simple as possible, because the treaty approach is more complex than the constitutional approach.</P><Col N="681"/>
        <P>In accordance with established practice, a well-resourced referendum commission will be created to give objective information to the public and encourage citizens to exercise their right to vote.  As with the previous EU referendum in 2002, significant resources will be ear-marked for the use of the referendum commission.  The National Forum on Europe will also be active and in the last few days I have written to the social partners, who will be involved, as well as all sides of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister this question at the European affairs committee last week and there is little more clarity now on the date of the referendum.  At the committee meeting the Minister said he had a date in mind, which he would put to the Taoiseach.  Has the Minister had that conversation with the Taoiseach and how has he responded?  I am concerned because a TNS MRBI poll found that 25% of people were in favour of the reform treaty, 13% were opposed and 62% had no opinion.  This side of the House is in favour of the treaty.  Its institutional reforms and democratisation of the EU are right for Europe.  However if people are to decide in a positive manner, the onus lies on the Government, which has negotiated and agreed to this and will sign on 13 December, to ensure there is an adequate information campaign.  The Minister said he has written to every Member of the Oireachtas and that is true and welcome.  However, I imagine most Members have decided how they will vote on this and I hope and anticipate most Members are well informed on it, although I do not assume anything.  It is imperative that members of the public be informed.  I am not sure what the Minister has in mind.  He mentioned a leaflet next month.  I do not know how much detail will be in that, but we need an active debate.  There has been more media coverage of the &ldquo;no&rdquo; side than the other side and the Government has not shown adequate commitment to this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I disagree with Deputy Creighton&rsquo;s last point.  I agree there must be a vigorous campaign and more positive media coverage.  Last week&rsquo;s full debate, facilitated by Deputy Creighton&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Durkan, got virtually no media coverage.  That reality faces us.  One broadcaster I approached told me it was too complex.  I do not agree it is too complex. The treaty is a complex issue, but it is not difficult to sort out the issues: a more democratic Europe that can make its decisions in a clearer and better approach, that will better protect its citizens&rsquo; rights and that will be more efficient in dealing with the external world and in which the smaller member states are protected.  I thought this would interest our media, but sadly it has not happened.  With the glorious exception of <i>The Irish Times</i>, <Col N="682"/>to which I give full credit, minimal cover has been given to this.</P>
        <P>There is an information gap and we all have a responsibility to fill it.  That is why I made the point that I want every Deputy, for and against the treaty, properly briefed so that there is no mythology on this treaty and we do not hear nonsense about tanks on the streets and our neutrality, taxation or sovereignty being undermined.  This is about making Europe work better for every citizen, Irish and European.  I agree we have a task but we are up to it and will focus on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has again avoided the question on the date for this referendum.  The Taoiseach said it will be in the first six months of next year.  He announced it at the forum for European journalists rather than this House, which is unacceptable.  Deputy Roche said he has a date in mind.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has indicated it could be any time next year.  Can Deputy Roche give us a timeframe for this?</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 94, 111, 112, 114, 122 and 328 together.</P>
        <P>The Government welcomes the second visit by UN special envoy Dr. Ibrahim Gambari to Burma on 3-8 November, and his report to the UN Security Council on 13 November.  Dr. Gambari has been able to point to some progress, with the regime&rsquo;s continued co-operation with his mission, particularly its appointment of a liaison minister to meet with Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, and Ms Suu Kyi&rsquo;s own firm commitment to constructively pursue negotiations with the regime.  We understand that a role for the UN in later substantive talks has not been ruled out.</P>
        <P>Ms Suu Kyi has now had three meetings with the government&rsquo;s liaison minister, which are said to have been productive, and that is welcome.  The regime has also allowed Ms Suu Kyi meet with other figures from the National League for Democracy and ethnic groups.  However, she remains under house arrest, which is unacceptable, and it is vital that all restrictions on her be lifted to assist her in preparing for talks.  Ireland&rsquo;s full commitment to Dr. Gambari&rsquo;s view that the burden is now on the Burmese Government to show it is moving in a positive direction has been made time and again by the Minister and me recently at the ASEAN conference.</P>
        <P>The Government welcomes the visit to Burma by the UN special rapporteur on human rights, Mr. Pinheiro, on 11-15 November, after four years of refusals by the regime.  The situation there is still unacceptable.  While the special representative appears to have had good access to the authorities, we regret that limitations were placed on his meetings with non-government fig<Col N="684"/>ures and arrests continued during his visit.  We urge the Burmese authorities to co-operate fully with Mr. Pinheiro to develop the process.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The EU continues to follow closely developments in Burma.  EU Foreign Ministers adopted a further set of conclusions on Burma on 19 November.  At last week&rsquo;s ASEAN meeting in Singapore nine EU ministers took the floor to lead with comments on Burma and Ms Suu Kyi.  Relevant EU bodies are doing more work to elaborate further restrictive measures, should they be necessary.  While EU measures are important, the Government believes wider international measures are also needed.  Regrettably, there is insufficient consensus in favour of such action among Security Council members, though we welcome the fact the Council continues to be engaged on the issue.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
       <P>It has been the Government&rsquo;s consistent position that no steps will be taken to develop diplomatic relations with Burma until Ms Suu Kyi is released.  While the issue was examined in 2004, on the basis of promised political and human rights progress by the Burmese authorities, including the release of Ms Suu Kyi, the lack of progress on these issues saw the process quickly stopped.  Given the current situation, it would be unimaginable that, even were Ms Suu Kyi released, we would establish relations without significant and sustained improvements on the ground.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State said that Ireland initiated contact in 2004 with the Burmese authorities.  What was the extent of that contact?  Would he now agree that on reflection it was a very unwise decision because it gave legitimacy to a regime that clearly does not have the support of the people and has been involved in many human rights violations and atrocities, particularly in recent months?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I was making with regard to the latter was that no further activity would be dealt with on the terms of diplomatic relations until there are substantial and sustained improvements on the ground.  On whether it was wise to make contact in 2004, the benefit of hindsight is always great.  However, the reality is that our ambassador designate went and met Aung San Suu Kyi and caused the Burmese authorities some angst.  Last week, I was very pleased to make the same point that this House, if we unite on very few other points, unites on the issue that the behaviour of the Burmese junta has been totally unacceptable.</P>

	<P>It is important to note that the Government&rsquo;s actions in 2004 were opposed.  It was pointed out at the time that the assumption that constructive dialogue would change the Burmese junta&rsquo;s actions was unlikely to reach a result.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask about the mandate of Mr. Pinheiro which differs from the mandate of Dr. Gambari.  Will Mr. Pinheiro&rsquo;s mandate in practical terms be able to ascertain the location of those arrested, particularly those who have left their monasteries and have not returned?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the latter item is covered.  However, whether he will be successful is another issue.  As the Deputy has repeatedly and correctly pointed out in the House, we are dealing with extraordinarily obdurate people in the Burmese junta, who care little for the international view of them, whether it is positive or negative.  The reality is that in the Security Council and in that region large states adjacent to this country will have a significant role to play in bringing the peace and democracy that the people of Burma so urgently require.</P>

        <Quest> when the Government will ratify the international conventions prohibiting trafficking in human beings. </Quest>
        <QRef>[30881/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The House will be aware from answers to previous questions, most recently on 23 October 2007, that the struggle against the heinous crime of trafficking in human beings is a matter of grave concern at national, EU and international level. </P>
        <P>On 11 October, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced a programme of measures on human trafficking that will lead to Ireland ratifying all relevant international instruments.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill 2007 is currently on Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to criminalise the trafficking of persons into, through or out of Ireland for the purposes of their sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of their organs.  Enactment of the legislation will ensure compliance with the criminal law aspects of the various international instruments.</P>
        <P>It is intended that the proposed immigration, residency and protection Bill will provide a framework whereby a victim of trafficking can be afforded an immediate period of recovery and reflection in the State.  This is a requirement of the Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human Beings.  In addition, the Bill <Col N="686"/>will, in certain circumstances, provide for a further period of residence for victims of trafficking.</P>
        <P>As well as the legislation on criminalisation and reflection periods, many other provisions are required under the Council of Europe convention, particularly regarding victim care.  These will be implemented administratively rather than legislatively.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is establishing a new high-level group on combating trafficking in human beings.  This high-level group will oversee the development and drafting of Ireland&rsquo;s first national action plan to prevent and combat human trafficking.  It is envisaged that the national action plan will be developed under four main headings: prevention and awareness raising; prosecution of traffickers; protection of victims; and child trafficking.  As stated earlier, all these measures will enable Ireland to ratify all relevant international instruments in the area of human trafficking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear from the reply that four quite separate categories of action are required to satisfy the international convention.  It would shorten the period in which ratification would be possible if the protection and care of the victim were included in the fundamental Act prohibiting trafficking, that is, the one directed at the criminal law.  If one must wait for the immigration, residency and protection Bill followed by ministerial order followed by administrative practice, one is talking about a timescale of potential ratification, particularly of the European convention, that is unnecessarily delaying and cumbersome.  Would the Minister of State consider making a recommendation to Cabinet and his colleague in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to facilitate the amendment on Committee Stage of the basic Bill outlawing trafficking so as to achieve an earlier ratification?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy mentioned the possibility, it struck me that it undoubtedly has some merit.  However, I do not know of any technical problem that might arise.  I will certainly draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the suggestion, which is helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State have details of the extent of human trafficking in this country?  I concur with my colleague.  It is important for us to review the criminal law in order to put in place the protection of the victims of human trafficking, as they have no such protection at the moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>

	<P>The EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, which dates back to 1998, is a politically binding document which governs the handling by member states of export licence applications for military goods and technology.  The code contains eight criteria against which each application must be assessed before a licence can be issued.  The EU has established best practice for the interpretation of each of the criteria under the code and member states consult regularly on the application of the code. </P>
        <P>In Ireland, the licensing authority is the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which acts in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>Under criterion 2 of the code, member states evaluate the current and past record of the country concerned regarding its respect for and observance of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.  They are required to exercise special caution and vigilance, on a case-by-case basis and taking account of the nature of the equipment, where a licence is requested to export arms to countries where serious violations of human rights have been established by the competent bodies of the UN, the Council of Europe or the European Union.  An export licence must not be issued if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression.  Among the other criteria are internal stability, regional stability and the risk of diversion.  It should be borne in mind that the nature of the equipment concerned is relevant in determining whether its export would be in breach of one or more of the criteria.</P>
        <P>As implementation of the code of conduct depends on the exercise of judgment by member states regarding the application and interpretation of the criteria in each specific case, there can be differences of view.  However, while we would take seriously any allegation of breaches of the code, we are not aware of any major difference of approach among member states in its application.</P>
        <P>Separately from the code of conduct, there are specific EU arms embargoes in regard to Burma, China, Sudan, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe.  Following a review of the code of conduct, there is general support within the Council for certain changes to it, most importantly its conversion into a legally binding common position.  Ireland strongly supports this approach.  However, it has not yet been possible to reach final agreement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State acknowledge the hypocrisy of moral suasion being regarded as the means for implementing such a code, for example, sticking with the area we were just discussing, German exports to the Burma junta, which are clear to everybody?  Equally, for example, having listened to the statement we might regard it as having become a piece of wind, considering that the National Pensions Reserve Fund has invested in companies that produce cluster bombs.  I gather from the reply given by the Minister of State that he would favour a legally binding code.  Is the Government in favour of an end-use regime, in other words, a system of sanctions built on identifying end use?  Second, can he tell us when this code was last examined?  Where can I find a published document that looks at the massive breaches of human rights, in several different places, on the part of the German, Italian, French and British Governments?  Is it not quite dangerous for one to say one would like all of this to happen, but it will not be implemented?  The foreign ministers are aware of many of these breaches.  At the next meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, can some of those who were in charge of these major breaches be confronted about what has taken place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give the Deputy details of when the last review of the code took place.  There is a process of keeping the operation of the code under review.  I do not disagree that there is something extraordinarily hypocritical about nations arguing about weapons of mass destruction when they are involved in the trade of small arms, which are the biggest weapons of mass destruction on this planet in that they kill more people than any other type of weapon.  I firmly believe that a common approach represents the best way forward.  I agree with the approach advocated by Deputy Higgins, who said the EU should confront its internal demons in this regard by putting in place a code of which we all can be proud.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 87 together.</P>
        <P>The Government continues to be deeply concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe.  The disastrous economic policies of that country&rsquo;s government have led to severe hardship for ordinary people.  Those who seek democratic change in Zimbabwe are facing enormous obstacles.  The efforts of opposition parties in Zimbabwe to organise are being hampered by the selective enforcement of harsh security laws, restrictive media laws and government efforts to politicise aid distribution and access to state services.  The Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum stated this month that politically motivated violence has increased throughout 2007.  Opposition activists and supporters, including those from the Movement for Democratic Change, continue to be intimidated and harassed.  International efforts must focus on pushing for a level playing field for the March 2008 elections to allow the people of Zimbabwe to decide who can best lead their country out of its economic and political crisis.</P>
        <P>Ireland and the EU strongly believe that African leadership is the key to encouraging progress towards economic and political stability.  We support the talks between the government and opposition in Zimbabwe which are being mediated by President Mbeki of South Africa under the mandate of the Southern African Development Community, SADC.  Agreement has been reached on making certain constitutional changes and updating the electoral register.  It is hoped that such changes can be made.  When the EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Zimbabwe in October, they agreed they might need to follow up the SADC initiative when it has been completed.  At a meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 19 November last, it was agreed that President Mugabe will hear a tough and clear message on the EU&rsquo;s abhorrence of his policies if he travels to Lisbon for the EU-Africa Summit next month.  The EU is ready to respond substantively to any positive change in Zimbabwe.  It regularly raises its strong views on Zimbabwe&rsquo;s internal situation with that country&rsquo;s neighbours and with the SADC.</P>
        <P>The Irish Embassy in Pretoria monitors allegations of human rights abuses in Zimbabwe on an ongoing basis.  It raises issues of concern with the Zimbabwean authorities at every opportunity.  During his visit to Harare in September 2007, the Irish ambassador and other EU heads of mission met the director for Europe and the Americas of the Zimbabwean Ministry for Foreign Affairs.  Our strong views on the human rights situation in Zimbabwe and our concerns about poor governance in that county were <Col N="690"/>restated at the meeting.  The ambassador again outlined these concerns to the Zimbabwean ambassador to South Africa on 5 November.  The Government, through Irish Aid, has provided assistance of &euro;17.8 million to the people of Zimbabwe since the start of 2006 in partnership with NGOs, missionaries and UN agencies.  These programmes have a direct and positive effect on the lives of thousands of unfortunate Zimbabwean citizens.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Although there is very little time remaining, I will allow Deputies Higgins and Deasy to ask a couple of brief supplementary questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The consequences of Britain&rsquo;s decision to walk away from its commitments under the Lancaster House Agreement, which are rarely highlighted, should be mentioned during the Lisbon Summit.  Is the Minister of State disappointed that the leaders of the South African Government, which we all support, have stayed unacceptably silent for so long about the human rights breaches in Zimbabwe?  Given that more that 75% of electoral abuses tend to take place during the registration process, would the Government be in favour of establishing an early process of observation of the Zimbabwean elections?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>President Mugabe has indicated he will attend the EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon.  I understand the British Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown, has said he will not attend the summit if President Mugabe is there.  What is the Government&rsquo;s stance on President Mugabe&rsquo;s attendance in Lisbon?  If he shows up at the summit, will an official delegation from Ireland be in attendance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Higgins is right to argue that the silence of a neighbouring country, particularly a neighbour like South Africa that has significant influence in the region, is regrettable.  The Deputy also suggested that EU member states which have some power in the region should use it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I also suggested that we should start to monitor the electoral process at an early stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I will mention that point to the Minister.  While it has not been considered, it has significant merit.  On Deputy Deasy&rsquo;s point, I do not think the merit of the forthcoming EU-Africa Summit should be assessed on the basis of the attendance of any given individual.  It should go ahead regardless.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, I take it the Government will be represented.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="691"/>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  We will be represented at the summit because we appreciate its significance.  Relations between Europe and Africa are not determined by the actions of an individual.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of cancer services is the central issue in the debate about the current debacle that has highlighted the incompetence of the Minister for Health and <Col N="692"/>Children.  While I have asked questions about this matter on a number of occasions, little clarity has been given in response.  I hope the communications difficulties in this regard have been resolved now that the Minister&rsquo;s job is on the line.  I would like to ask specifically about reports that a review was commissioned into the work of a pathologist who spent six weeks working at Cork University Hospital in July and August of this year.  According to an extract from the review, which was published in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>, the pathologist in question was guilty of &ldquo;serious diagnostic errors&rdquo;.  The review goes on to state:</P>
        <P LI="1">From a review of 166 cases, 15 were reported as negative or inadequate when in fact these samples contained malignancy or features suggestive of malignancy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I want to make it clear to the Taoiseach that I am not referring to the Health and Information Quality Authority&rsquo;s report.  I am referring to a report into the work of the pathologist in question that was commissioned by the hospital.  It is separate from the authority&rsquo;s report.  When was the report received?  Does it confirm that there were 15 misdiagnoses?  When were the patients whose cases were misdiagnosed informed of their misdiagnoses?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I can tell the Deputy what I know about the matter.  I got some information from the statement issued by the Health and Information Quality Authority.  The authority announced earlier this year that it was undertaking reviews of symptomatic breast disease services at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick, including the pathology services at Cork University Hospital and Galway University Hospital.  Those reviews commenced in June and September respectively.  I am not aware of any other reports.  These reviews are currently<?oasys _jy ?>under way and are expected to be completed shortly.  One review is expected to be completed in December and the other in January 2008.  HIQA is the organisation responsible for the reviews.  It informed the Minister that if any patient identified in either review requires further review or follow-up treatment, this will be communicated to the HSE immediately which will provide appropriate services to the patient forthwith.</P>
        <P>Since September the management at Cork University Hospital has been carrying out a review of the pathology services at the hospital.  This is perhaps what was being referred to by Deputy Kenny.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="3" />
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  This is a separate review from that of HIQA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This began in September, three months after the review I mentioned.  It was as a result of concerns about the work of a single <Col N="693"/>pathologist who worked in the hospital on a locum basis for a short period.  As it does not form part of the HIQA review, I presume it is the review to which Deputy Kenny refers.  The Department and the Minister were informed of this review on 23 November.  The Minister understands that in the course of this review, so far several patients have already been recalled for review and appropriate care by their doctor.  The HSE has informed departmental officials that it will conclude this review shortly.  The Minister understands that patients requiring review will be contacted and offered appropriate care as soon as they are identified.  The HSE had informed the Minister that this pathologist no longer works in any of its hospitals.  Steps have been taken to ensure that the regulatory authorities in this jurisdiction, where it is believed this person resides, have been informed so that appropriate action can be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Taoiseach&rsquo;s briefing note allows him confirm that this was not part of the HIQA report and that this was a special separate report commissioned by Cork University Hospital into the work of a pathologist.  If I recall correctly, the Taoiseach stated that the Department was notified on 23 November that this review was in train.  Can he inform me from his briefing notes when the first misdiagnosis was identified and when that first patient was contacted?  Since this report into the work of a pathologist was first commenced, will the Taoiseach confirm that to date, 15 misdiagnoses have been identified by that separately-commissioned review?  Of those 15 misdiagnoses, what was the period between the patients being identified and receiving treatment, counselling or other assessment that might be necessary?  Will he confirm there are now five separate reports in train?  I refer to the report from the review in Portlaoise, the HIQA report on Cork, the HIQA report on the pathology unit in Galway, the inquiry into Barrington&rsquo;s Hospital and this specially-commissioned report by Cork University Hospital on pathology.  This information is fundamental to the motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health and Children.  These questions must be answered.  I was truly shocked to hear during the course of this week that the Minister for Health and Children was unable to acquire details about questions such as this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The HIQA report announced earlier in the year was on a review of symptomatic breast disease in both Limerick Regional Hospital and including the pathology services at Cork and at Cork University Hospital.  This was one part of the review.  The CUH review is a separate review of the same hospital.  There is also a review at Portlaoise.  Other changes have taken place in the system during the course of the year, <Col N="694"/>including decisions made about cases from Mullingar General Hospital being referred to the Mater Hospital and about which I answered questions some weeks ago.  However, if I recall correctly, that decision came about as a result of the pending retirement of the consultant rather than a review of work.</P>
        <P>The Department and the Minister were informed of the review on 23 November.  It seems that the review began some time in September since when the hospital management at CUH have been carrying out a review of the pathology services at the hospital as a result of concerns about the work of a single pathologist who worked in the hospital on a locum basis for a short period.  As I do not have an exact number of patients, I cannot confirm whether it is 15 patients as requested by Deputy Kenny.  In the course of that review, several patients have already been recalled for review.  It is not stated what the purpose of the review is but it is obvious some of the work was considered and these patients were recalled.  They were given appropriate care by their doctor.  The HSE has informed departmental officials that this review will be completed shortly and that patients who need review will be contacted and offered appropriate care as soon as they are identified.  Anyone who has been identified in that review to date has been dealt with and the work is ongoing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On 23 November 2004, almost three years ago to the day, the Minister for Health and Children introduced the Health Bill in this House.  She stated that, &ldquo;the two ways Government health policy should be judged; better outcomes for patients and better value for taxpayers&rsquo; money.  To achieve them, we badly need clarity of roles and accountability, political responsibility for the Minister and management responsibility for the management.&rdquo;  She specifically stated, &ldquo;as it is, the Minister and the Government is responsible for setting overall health policy and it is essential that the Minister has the power to inform the executive of policy decisions made and to direct it to carry out its duties in compliance with Government policy.  The executive is also required to provide the Minister with any information or statistics relating to the functions of the executive which may be requested.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Whatever we got in recent weeks, or whatever the Minister got from the Health Service Executive, she appears to have got very little information or statistics.  Later this evening, we will come to the question of the political and management accountability that she herself so accurately described and set the parameters for when she introduced the Health Bill three years ago.</P>
        <P>When the scandal in Portlaoise came to public attention, both Deputy Kenny and I raised questions with the Taoiseach in the House about what <Col N="695"/>happened in Portlaoise.  He told us that Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty had been appointed to carry out some kind of an inquiry or review into what happened in Portlaoise and that he could not give us or the public any explanation for the events in Portlaoise and the misdiagnoses until that report was completed and available.</P>
        <P>On 6 November 2007, the Taoiseach informed us specifically that the review would be completed that week and would be published by the end of the month.  Is it true that the report has been completed and, if so, where is it?  When will it be published? Why has it not been published before we debate this issue in the House this evening?  Is it true that Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty did not interview the consultant radiologist who has been put on administrative leave?  Three months after it came to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children, do we now have an explanation for the misdiagnosis which took place in Portlaoise and which has been added to by the truly horrific addition of 97 other cases in the course of the past week?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of questions were asked about Portlaoise.  The Minister learned on Wednesday of last week about the existence of a separate review of ultrasounds that was under way in Portlaoise, in addition to what had been previously announced, namely, a review into radiology services in the hospital being undertaken by Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  That review is being undertaken by a team led by Peter Naughton, a consultant surgeon in Portlaoise.  Deputy Gilmore is aware of the circumstances of how that came to light last week.</P>
        <P>I previously stated in the House that Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty is examining the earlier cases, and that is the position.  That report is not completed but is in draft form.  I cannot give Deputy Gilmore information on who Ann O&rsquo;Doherty spoke to.  I will inform him when we see the completed report.  I understand the report will be published but, obviously, as with all medical reports, it will have to be examined for the purpose of legality and redacting of issues.  That will not happen until the final report is available.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has appointed an advanced nursing practitioner who will co-ordinate the initial nine cases.  Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty&rsquo;s job was to go through the 3,707 mammograms.  As Professor Arnie Hill said yesterday, extraordinary work was done by Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty.  It would be considered a very good work rate for a top class professional to do that many in a year but she did that in a short period of time.  I do not think Deputy Gilmore meant it, but I do not wish it to be implied in any way that there was a delay of three months.  Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty did the work of any other top class professional in a very short time and I praise her <Col N="696"/>for that.  She went through 3,707 mammograms and nine cases require to be followed up.  An advanced nurse practitioner has been appointed to co-ordinate further treatment for these initial nine cases as a result of the review of the mammograms in the hospital.</P>
        <P>As I said on Friday, I thank Professor Arnie Hill and his team for working all day on Saturday.  They saw more than 80 patients in that time.  Those whom they thought would require further clinical treatment were sent to Beaumont Hospital where a breast clinic was set up on Sunday morning.  Staff were also on stand-by in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  The other people whom they were not able to contact were seen yesterday.  A final special clinic will be provided by surgeons this evening for the remaining people who have been contacted and are available.  A small number of people still require surgical review and this will be provided on a priority basis.</P>
        <P>Given that this is something which came to light on Wednesday night or Thursday, it is an indication of the extraordinary dedication by the team involved to have contacted, seen and undertaken a review of the clinical records and diagnostic assessments of these people, with the remaining few being seen tonight.  I thank the team involved.  I thank also the person who brought all this to light in the first place.  Otherwise, we would have known nothing about it in late August.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not reflecting on Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty, as the Taoiseach well knows.  The Minister stated in the House in a reply in early November that Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty&rsquo;s investigation would examine the mammographies and the ultrasounds.  By whom or where was it decided that there should be a separate investigation by Peter Naughton into the ultrasounds?  The issue I raise does not relate to Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty&rsquo;s work, but when we raised the matter with the Taoiseach earlier this month, he told us Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty&rsquo;s report would be ready in a week and that it would be published by the end of the month.  It is now three months since the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and Children first became aware of the problem in Portlaoise and neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Health and Children appear to be in a position to give the House or the public any coherent explanation as to what exactly happened in Portlaoise.  All we seem to find out is that the problem is getting worse with each passing week.</P>
        <P>Later this evening we will address the Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s accountability for all this.  If the Taoiseach were to give his Deputies a free vote on this issue this evening in the House, I do not think there would be any doubt about the outcome.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>This House does not have confidence in the Minister for Health and Children, nor does the public and the staff of the health service.  When will an explanation be given to the public and to the women concerned about what happened in Portlaoise, or is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s concern now related to protecting the Government and the State from any possible claims for compensation that might arise?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My only concern from the outset, as it is with any medical, surgical or health issue, is for the individual, that we provide the best service at any time and the best medical standards we can, and, if something goes wrong for whatever reason, that we try to correct that to the very best of our ability in the interest of patient health and safety.  That is my only concern.</P>
        <P>I do not know why Mr. Peter Naughton, the consultant surgeon in Portlaoise, decided to carry out a review of ultrasounds separate to the work being done by Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty on the mammograms.  I am not a consultant but, from what other consultants have said, I assume Dr. Peter Naughton was trying to be sure.  He was checking and going back over issues where he thought perhaps something was missed.  That is what it seems he was doing.  That does not appear unwise, given that other people were involved and in the circumstances of somebody&rsquo;s work being called into question.  Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty is an expert in this area and she has been praised by all her colleagues for the work she has done.  I accept Deputy Gilmore would add his praise to that.  I am sure she has been trying to go through the 3,707 mammograms.  Writing the report is important but it is secondary to that job.  When we have her report, we will deal with it.  I will not put pressure on her, other than to do that.  We will have the report when it is available and then we will deal with the issue.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to take great issue with Deputy Gilmore, but if he checks the record of what I said on the first day when this came up, I said I would not stand up in the House as a non-medical expert and start making comments about what one did not have to be much of an expert to see.  The consultants who examined this did not believe that the service given by somebody who had misread a number of these mammograms was satisfactory.  That was their view and that is what I said.  However, I said that was not a judgment I was in a position to make, nor was I going to blame somebody I did not know.  I was not competent to do so.  What I said was that I believed there were issues surrounding the medical competence of somebody reading these mammograms and it appeared that others, who were experts, believed that this rate of error was not acceptable.  Rather than a judgment being made by me or any other lay person, Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty was brought in to make it.  We will <Col N="698"/>see what that judgment is in due course.  That is the position.</P>
        <P>I do not agree that this was left sitting for months.  Decisions have been made about moving services, reviewing cases and bringing in experts to assist the unfortunate people who had to go through the shock and hurt of what happened, for which everybody has expressed regret.  I do not believe that the Deputy&rsquo;s comments are fair.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s remark about a free vote.  He would have a problem in respect of some of his Deputies, who are away, if it were to apply across the board.  I have no problem with a free vote on an issue such as this.  The Labour Party has tabled a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health and Children.  The Fine Gael Party has also tabled a motion of no confidence in the Minister.  This is the most important business before the House.  It affects the ability of the Government to do its job.</P>
        <P>Members were told last week by the Minister for Health and Children that this debacle and demonstration of incompetence arose because of a communications issue.  In the speech quoted by Deputy Gilmore, when the Minister introduced the Health Service Executive, she said that the Minister has the power to inform the executive of policy decisions and to direct it to carry out its duties in compliance with Government policy.  That clearly did not happen in the interests of the patients in Portlaoise.  Earlier I asked the Taoiseach some straightforward questions about communications and whether there were 15 wrong diagnoses in Cork University Hospital, which were brought to my attention by Deputy Coveney and Deputy Clune.  The Taoiseach did <Col N="700"/>not have a detailed answer even though this is about communications.</P>
        <P>As this matter is central to the continuation of the Government, we should deal with it now.  We should use Government time to deal with the motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health and Children.  It is important for every person in the country.  I object to Nos. 7, 8 and 9 being taken now.  The most important business before the House is the motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health and Children.  We should debate it now, in Government time, and the Taoiseach should agree to the proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with Deputy Kenny.  I return to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s suggestion that we have a free vote on this matter.  What is happening in the health services and the anxiety and pain that have been caused to so many patients, particularly in recent weeks, should not be subject to a whip.  Individual Deputies should be able to express their points of view on the health service and the performance of the Minister and the Health Service Executive without fear of the <?oasys _dc28- ?>Whip and they should be able to vote accordingly.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s suggestion of a free vote across the House is one I and Deputy Kenny happily accept.  Let us have a free vote.  Deputies are privately expressing their lack of confidence in the Minister for Health and Children in their constituencies.  When issues arise about hospitals or health services in those constituencies, they say it is due to the Minister and that she has nothing to do with them and is from a different party.  This is about the health and lives of people in our communities.  Let those Deputies come to the House now and vote according to what they think, not what they are told by the party Whip.  I agree with Deputy Kenny that the debate on this issue should commence after the Order of Business.  The Order of Business should be amended accordingly.</P>

	<P>Deputy Kenny indicated that the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party have motions of no confidence in the Minister for Health and Children on today&rsquo;s Order Paper, and so does Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is important to note that Sinn F&eacute;in previously expressed no confidence in this Minister and its shock at her reappointment following the election.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposal to allow a free vote is the only way to give Members an opportunity to participate properly as representatives of their respective constituencies.  There are Members of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s party who do not agree with the Government amendment and are of one mind with the selection of no confidence motions put down by each of the three Opposition parties.  I have no doubt that there are others who will ignore the reflection of <Col N="701"/>the mandate they secured in their respective constituencies and vote confidence in the Minister in all circumstances.  However, the undeniable fact is that the people, across all opinion and none, have no confidence in her, but it goes beyond her.  They also have no confidence in the Taoiseach because of his stewardship, in tandem with the Minister, of the delivery of health care in the State.  This is the single most important issue affecting the daily lives of ordinary citizens.  The template visited on the north east and the people of County Monaghan, in particular, will be coming shortly to a town near you.</P>
        <P>Those representing constituencies throughout the length and breadth of the State should be mindful of the intentions of the Government, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  The nightmare that the community I am proud to represent has had to live through in recent years will be part of the reality they will face in the years ahead.  It is time to say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  It is time to stop looking at the agony of the people of County Monaghan and other Border counties and to stand up and say &ldquo;Enough is enough.&rdquo;  Tonight, the way to demonstrate it is to test the position.  The Government should open the opportunity for a free vote.  If it is so confident&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Under Standing Order 26, the Deputy is entitled <Col N="702"/>to make a brief statement about the item before the House, but he is not entitled to expand on it and drift into a debate on a motion of confidence in a Minister.  He is only entitled to make his views known on this matter.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach needs to test his belief and have confidence in his assertion.  I would have every confidence in Labour Party Members and every other Opposition Deputy in circumstances where there was a free vote.  I also have confidence in the fact that members of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s party would not support the Minister, Deputy Harney, or her pursuit of health policy if a free vote were applied by the Taoiseach.  I support the demand to have this debate immediately following the Order of Business.</P>

	<P>I note there is a designated land Bill on the Government list of Bills.  The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme last night highlighted the issue of irresponsible and unsustainable rezonings.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, mentioned that he might introduce regulations to require councillors to give reasons for zoning decisions, which would be weak.  As part of that Bill, will the Government introduce <Col N="706"/>stronger powers to overturn unsustainable zonings, particularly in light of the need to prevent future flooding and urban sprawl, and to address climate change issues?</P>

	<P>I wish to raise two issues.  Following from Deputy Stagg&rsquo;s comments, is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce the new fair deal scheme by 1 January as the HSE is stating?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>If so, this implies the legislation will be taken before Christmas.  In the light of the fact that the seven organisations representing older people have come together to raise serious concerns about the scheme&rsquo;s provisions and that there has been no consultation, will the Taoiseach consider deferring debate on the legislation to allow meaningful consultation to take place with all the groups concerned?</P>
        <P>Regarding the Government&rsquo;s paper published some time ago on proposals to support lone parents, we were promised the publication of legislation this session to provide for the changes in welfare payments for lone parents.  Is it the intention to go ahead with the legislation or when can we expect to see legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>On the fair deal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be named the unfair deal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;legislation is due this session before the end of January.  We will have plenty of time for&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Taoiseach whether he would consider deferring the debate to allow for consultation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be a matter for the Whips.  They will decide the order.  I have heard <Col N="707"/>what the Deputy said.  The social welfare, lone payment and other low income families legislation is to give effect to the discussion paper&rsquo;s proposals for supporting lone parents.  It is due next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same proposition in respect of the fair deal legislation and the proposals contained in it regarding funding for nursing homes, is the Taoiseach indicating he will not attempt to rush the legislation through the House before Christmas?  Will the Taoiseach confirm there will be the necessary further consultation required to address and assuage the fears of many older citizens?  In tandem with this, will the Taoiseach indicate whether the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill, in which there is a clear overlap and connection, will be brought forward and whether both Bills can be addressed simultaneously or one after the other?  There is a clear relationship between the two.</P>
        <P>It is 12 months since the long-promised debate on collusion was recommended by the Oireachtas sub-committee on the Barron report.  In the absence of legislation, we have had debates and statements on a variety of issues in recent weeks, but this debate has been committed to and there is no signal of intent to accommodate it.  When is it intended to have the debate on collusion and will the Taoiseach accommodate it before the Christmas recess?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in favour of the debate, but it is a matter for when the Whips can order it.  The eligibility for health and personal social services Bill is for next year.  A discussion document is being prepared on the regulatory impact analysis and the public consultation proposals.  I indicated on the first question that the legislation would be published in this session.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>This year, Voluntary Health Insurance, VHI, celebrates its 50th anniversary, having been established under the Voluntary Health Insurance Act 1957.  This Bill provides for the most significant changes to the provisions governing VHI since the board was established 50 years ago.  In the intervening period, there has been only one other substantial amending Act, the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 1996.</P>
        <P>The main provision of that Act provided an enhanced commercial framework for the board providing health insurance cover to its members through provider agreements while maintaining the obligation on the board to provide such cover.  It also provided for ministerial consent to premium increases determined by the board in the context of the board meeting its liabilities and providing for reserves as it saw fit.</P><Col N="711"/>
        <P>The 1996 legislation was enacted in advance of the completion of the regulatory framework for health insurance that opened the market to competition, put in place by the passing of the Health Insurance Act regulations at the end of March 1996.</P>
        <P>The development of the regulatory framework arose in the context of implementing the EU third non-life insurance directive which provided for the opening of the health insurance market to competition.  It differed significantly from the first non-life directive dating from 1972.  That directive specifically recognised the position of the VHI board and the common good role it had played as a monopoly provider of health insurance cover to people who did not have a statutory right to free hospital services and those encouraged to take out insurance despite having the right to free treatment.  The 1972 directive specifically granted the board, with several similar health care providers in Europe, a derogation from meeting the prudential obligations to be met by most insurance undertakings.</P>
        <P>While the third directive opened the market to competition, it did not remove the derogation granted under the first directive.  Consequently, VHI has continued to operate as a statutory body, exempt from meeting the prudential requirements of the Financial Regulator.  Notwithstanding this, the VHI board maintains significant levels of reserves, amounting to &euro;292 million at the year ended 28 February 2007.  While this is well above the minimum requirement of the European Union, it is approximately &euro;140 million short of the level that established insurers with VHI&rsquo;s premium and claims experience would be required to maintain by the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>VHI finds itself in the anomalous position of being both the market leader in the health insurance market and being an unauthorised insurer.  The company&rsquo;s competitors consider this position confers a competitive advantage on it.  Although the current statutory arrangements also impose several restrictions on VHI, the Government recognises the derogation cannot continue.  It considers that it is in the best interests of the health insurance market and VHI that the company attains authorisation as an insurer in the shortest possible time and be subject to the same prudential regulation as other commercial insurers.</P>
        <P>The proposed changes to the VHI Acts contained in the Bill are consistent with the policy set out in the 1999 White Paper on health insurance.  It recognised the need to give full commercial freedom to VHI, placing its relationship with the Minister on a more appropriate footing and removing its exemption from meeting solvency requirements.</P><Col N="712"/>
        <P>The Bill&rsquo;s provisions also reflect the general thrust of the recent recommendations of the Health Insurance Authority, the Competition Authority and the Harrington group on VHI, as set out in their reports on competition in the private health insurance market.  The Bill addresses matters raised by other market stakeholders, including VHI&rsquo;s competitors.  The European Commission has also taken an interest in developments in the market having regard to overseeing the operation of the insurance directives, complaints made to it by other market participants and the provisions of the treaty.  The Commission has recently emphasised the need to address VHI&rsquo;s derogation as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>The Bill&rsquo;s provisions are focused on providing VHI with a structure more appropriate to the competitive market in which it now operates and one that will oblige the board to pursue early authorisation.  They also provide a statutory framework that will facilitate this process.  Amendments during the Bill&rsquo;s passage in the Seanad were directed at providing the required structure.</P>
        <P>Since its establishment the board&rsquo;s primary function has been to provide health insurance and that will continue to be the case as provided for under section 2 of the 1996 Act.  The Bill&rsquo;s primary purpose is to oblige the board to achieve authorisation from the Financial Regulator as an insurer and to provide it with a structure that supports an application for authorisation.  This involves giving commercial freedom on products and pricing to VHI.  It will, under the parent Act and in accordance with the memorandum and articles of association of any relevant subsidiaries, be obliged to continue to provide health insurance.  The Bill also provides for amending the definition of a health insurance contract in respect of cash plans.</P>
        <P>Section 1 is a standard section providing for definitions relevant to the Bill.  Section 2 provides that section 13 of the Assurance Companies Act 1909 and section 36 of the Insurance Act 1989 will not apply to VHI.  These provisions are associated with the proposal in section 7 that is to allow the board of VHI to establish a subsidiary company for the specific purpose of carrying on its health insurance and health related insurance schemes.  The intention is that the board will, on an appointed day, transfer all its health insurance business to the new subsidiary.  This transfer will take place within the VHI group of companies.  The transfer will not affect any of the rights or entitlements of existing VHI health insurance policyholders on the transfer day.</P>
        <P>Section 13 of the Assurance Companies Act 1909 and section 36 of the Insurance Act 1989 are intended to protect the interests of policyholders in circumstances where one insurance company is taken over by another, or where one insurance company merges with another.  As the transfer <Col N="713"/>proposed in the Bill does not involve any external company, these provisions should not apply.  The Bill, when enacted, will provide the statutory basis for the transfer of the health insurance business from the VHI board to the new subsidiary established for that purpose.</P>
        <P>Section 3 amends section 2 of the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act of 1996.  Sections 3(<i>a</i>) and 3(<i>b</i>) remove the requirement to obtain ministerial consent to the board&rsquo;s health insurance schemes.  Section 3(<i>c</i>) provides for the board determining premium increases having regard to its obligations and outgoings.</P>
        <P>A significant change to the 1996 Act is that the substitution proposed under section 3(<i>c</i>) also imposes an obligation on the board to attain a level of reserves that would facilitate securing authorisation and that this be achieved by the end of 2008.  The Government decided in April that VHI should become an insurer authorised by the Financial Regulator by the end of 2008.  The Government does not believe it is in the interests of either VHI or the health insurance market that its anomalous status as an unauthorised entity should continue for any longer than necessary.  One primary purpose of this section is to oblige the VHI board to have regard to solvency requirements for authorisation and to focus on attaining this objective.</P>
        <P>Section 3(<i>d</i>) sets out the means by which the board may accumulate the reserve required to secure authorisation from the Financial Regulator.  The Government considers it appropriate that VHI should have the maximum flexibility in how it achieves the level of solvency required to satisfy the Financial Regulator.  Regarding subparagraph (<i>e</i>) contained in the insertion in section 3(<i>d</i>), the provision of any capital by the State, either by way of loan or in return for shares, would only take place on an arm&rsquo;s length commercial basis.  The Government and the European Commission would have to be satisfied in advance that any such investment by the State did not constitute a state aid.</P>
        <P>In April, the Government agreed the Departments of Finance and Health and Children should seek specialist advice on how VHI could be authorised by the end of 2008.  The consultants are due to produce a report for the Departments by the end of this month.  Following receipt and consideration of it, the Departments will provide a report to the Government before the end of December.  The Government is determined VHI should be authorised by the end of 2008 and the measure provides accordingly.  It is prudent to allow in section 5(<i>b</i>)(ii), having regard to legal advices received, a limited latitude to provide for a situation where it is not possible to achieve this objective by the specified date, but only where there are good and sufficient reasons.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides for functions of the board.  Section 4(<i>a</i>) replicates section 14 of the Health <Col N="714"/>Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001 as regards activities in which the board may engage.  That section is being deleted under No. 4 of the schedule of enactments being repealed.  It also provides for the board having a services company to provide staffing and other services to the board and its subsidiaries.</P>
        <P>Section 4(<i>b</i>) provides for the board engaging in new activities.  However, the qualification on authorisation is to ensure VHI does not extend the scope of its functions beyond those it already engages in until after authorisation is secured.  The Government&rsquo;s view is that VHI should not expand into new areas of activity such as pensions or life insurance until after authorisation.</P>
        <P>Section 5 provides for the board forming, establishing or acquiring subsidiaries to perform any one or more of its existing functions other than health insurance.  It is a requirement, where authorisation as an insurer is being sought, for the applicant to be a stand-alone entity, engaged only in activities relating directly to the insurance business.</P>
        <P>Sections 6 to 13, inclusive, provide for the transfer of the health insurance activities of the current VHI board to a subsidiary company to be established for this purpose.  Section 6 consists of a provision to enable the Minister to set a date for the transfer to take place.  Section 7 provides for the transfer of the health insurance business and health-related insurance schemes to the subsidiary to be established for that purpose.  This statutory provision is required for the transfer because the VHI board, as a State body rather than a conventional commercial insurance company, is not covered by the insurance Acts which would otherwise apply.  This section is linked to section 2.  The rights of members and staff are not affected in this instance.  The process of securing High Court approval for the transfer is long and complex and not without risk, as it would allow parties which might claim to have an interest in the transfer to intervene.  If this were to happen, it could seriously threaten the objective of having VHI authorised by the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>Sections 8 to 11, inclusive, are standard provisions governing the process of transferring business.  Section 12 allows the Minister to appoint a day on which staff will be transferred from the VHI board to the services company subsidiary to be established for the purpose of employing the staff of the group and its subsidiaries.</P>
        <P>Section 13 sets out the conditions under which the existing staff of the VHI board will be transferred to the new services subsidiary or any other subsidiary established by the board.  Although it is intended to transfer all staff to the services subsidiary, the section gives the board a degree of flexibility in having the power to transfer staff to another subsidiary if it so decides.  The section also provides statutory protection for the terms <Col N="715"/>and conditions of employment of existing VHI staff.</P>
        <P>Section 14 will allow the board to form, establish or acquire subsidiaries to undertake activities outlined in section 4(<i>b</i>) once authorisation has been achieved.  To the extent that any of these companies require to be regulated by the Financial Regulator, they too will be subject to such regulation.  In summary, sections 5 to 14 will enable VHI put in place a holding company structure which is a necessary step towards attaining authorisation for its health insurance business.</P>
        <P>Section 15 provides that the board is to submit reports every six months on its share of the health insurance market.  Section 16 covers the borrowing powers of the board and its subsidiaries.  This section allows the board or a subsidiary to raise or borrow money for the purpose of performing its functions.  It specifies a limit on borrowings to apply to VHI and its subsidiaries.  In order to allow the board scope to meet the prudential requirements of the Financial Regulator, the limit does not include any additional borrowings which may be used for the purposes of attaining authorisation.</P>
        <P>Section 17 provides for the repealing of the enactments specified in the Schedule attached to the Bill.  Section 18 provides for the short title, collective citation and commencement.  This is a standard provision which allows the Minister determine the appropriate times for commencement of the various sections and also the repeals set out in the Schedule.</P>
        <P>The Schedule provides for repeals relating to four existing legislative provisions, the first of which refers to section 18 of the Voluntary Health Insurance Act 1957 which provided for borrowing by the board in very limited circumstances relating only to current expenditure.  In the context of introducing the broad borrowing provisions contained in section 16 of this Bill, the current provision needs to be repealed.</P>
        <P>The second enactment to be repealed is an exemption for cash plan providers contained in the health insurance Acts.  Typically, cash plan payments are made directly to the insured person, provide limited cover for out-of-pocket expenses and do not extend to indemnity cover.  The definition of a health insurance contract includes an exemption from the definition for the products of two cash plan providers.  The exemption was provided on the basis that they were limited to offering community-rated cash plans with a limited focus on hospital services.  It is necessary to put all existing and potential cash plan operators on an equal footing.</P>
        <P>The change proposed will limit regulation to the minimum necessary to protect the community-rated indemnity market.  It will enable cash plan providers to design their products so as to be exempt from the regulatory framework <Col N="716"/>under section 2(<i>a</i>) of the health insurance Acts or to be subject to only limited regulation.  This would include an exemption from the requirement to meet minimum benefit levels and to participate in risk equalisation where offering contracts covering GP services, outpatient services and the supply of drugs.  We will keep under review the question of whether cash plans should be subject to the requirements imposed on indemnity-based health insurance.</P>
        <P>The third repeal is of section 3 of the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 1996, a section that obliges the VHI board to notify any proposed increases of health insurance premia to the Minister and gives the Minister the power to direct the board not to implement increases.  Freedom on pricing is an essential requirement for an insurer which is subject to prudential regulation by the Financial Regulator.  Decisions on products and pricing are appropriate to the board which is best placed to make these decisions.</P>
        <P>The fourth repeal covers section 14 of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001, which section gave VHI the powers to engage in certain health related activities.  It is being repealed as those functions are now encompassed by section 4(<i>a</i>) of this Bill, with related provisions on the establishment of subsidiaries under section 5.</P>
        <P>VHI is a major provider of health care for a significant proportion of the population.  We must ensure it is obliged to meet the appropriate regulatory requirements.  All of the many reports commissioned on the health insurance market since the introduction of the third non-life directive have supported the course we are pursuing.  The provisions of the Bill will have a positive effect on the management and staff of VHI, be good for its consumers and the development of the health insurance market. The European Commission has been kept informed of the evolution of the Bill and taken a keen interest in the development of the health insurance market.</P>
        <P>I congratulate VHI and its staff on the manner in which it fulfilled its functions for the 50 years since it was established in 1957.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Mitchell.  </P>
        <P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bill and its implications for VHI and the health insurance market.  Fine Gael realises the importance of market driven consumer focused competition in the private health insurance market.  While the health insurance market has been open to competition since 1994, there are only three players and the cost of health insurance has risen exponentially.  Despite the cost associated with private health insurance, 62% of the population have signed up for cover.  This may reflect the reality that people have lost faith in the public health service, a matter that <Col N="717"/>will be debated at length later this evening during the discussion of the Labour Party Private Members&rsquo; motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>There is a crisis in services for the diagnosis of breast cancer; there is MRSA, waiting lists and many more issues which have caused the public to lose faith in the health service.  VHI celebrates its 50th anniversary this year with a share of 75% of the health insurance market, approximately 1.6 million members and a profit in excess of &euro;70 million.</P>
        <P>Recent years have seen substantial changes for VHI with it widening its business to include other commercial activities such as travel insurance, Swiftcare clinics and dental clinics.  Now it has the possibility to move into other insurance sectors such as pensions and financial services.  While the Minister claims to be an advocate of fair competition she has allowed VHI to engage in these wider activities for some time while simultaneously enjoying the derogation from solvency granted to it under the first non-life directive of 1972.</P>
        <P>It was not until a former Government Minister, EU Commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, blew the whistle on the preferential and advantageous treatment the Government has allowed VHI that it took steps to make this a fairer health insurance market.  The Government was left with no choice but to address the unfair advantage afforded to VHI.</P>
        <P>In the past ten years this Government should have enhanced, assisted and encouraged competition within the health insurance market.  Instead VHI has been facilitated in maintaining its dominant position and has continued to operate as market leader.  The consequence of this is that there are only three providers in the market and the customer has seen the cost of health insurance subscriptions rocket.  This Bill allows the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, the opportunity to address the anti-competitive anomalies which VHI has enjoyed for some time.  I hope these changes will see a fairer health insurance market which will encourage and facilitate the entry of new players resulting in a better outcome for the consumer.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Bill VHI continues, to some extent, to report to the Minister.  The current position of conflict, whereby the Minister acts as regulator of health insurance through the Health Insurance Authority, owner of the largest health insurer in the country and supplier of the largest part of health insurance products through public hospital facilities, is not resolved.  A number of the current problems in the market are directly traceable to this relationship with the Minister and it seems that this favourable relationship will continue until the end of 2008 when VHI becomes authorised by the Financial Regulator.</P><Col N="718"/>
        <P>The Government published the VHI Bill in May 2007 and it is supposed to be a stepping stone towards achieving, facilitating and strengthening competition in the health insurance market.  While I fully support competition in the market I do not believe the current context of this Bill will achieve it.  The Bill aims to regulate existing commercial activities while giving VHI further commercial freedoms in the future.  While the Bill requires VHI&rsquo;s future commercial activities to become subject to regulation by the end of 2008, it allows existing commercial activities outside its core health insurance business, such as travel insurance, Swiftcare clinics and dental clinics to continue unregulated until that time.</P>
        <P>This exemption has allowed VHI to have a significant competitive advantage over other health insurance providers and has strengthened its position, while making it more difficult for new entrants to penetrate the market.  In the interests of a fair, equitable and competitive health insurance market it is vital that VHI be required to achieve solvency levels for its core business, in addition to existing and future wider activities.</P>
        <P>This Bill also raises questions about the level of reserve VHI must meet.  I understand the Financial Regulator has set the solvency reserve at 40%, but the EU average is just 25%.  Can the Minister confirm whether the Financial Regulator is considering amending the level of solvency health insurers are expected to reach?  If so, are the Department of Health and Children and the health insurers involved in this process?  If VHI is expected to reach a solvency level of 40% of its premium income by the end of 2008 it will have to raise &euro;140 million by the end of next year.  VHI already has a reserve of 28% which could be applied without any financial impact on customers.  If VHI is expected to raise this amount, does the Minister agree it is likely the cost will be passed on to the costumer, who as already seen VHI premiums raise exponentially in recent years?  VHI customers have seen subscription rates rise by 25% in the past two years.  Perhaps the House should examine this issue with a view to benchmarking the health insurance level of reserve to that of other EU countries, which require a reserve of 25%.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes that VHI be permitted to borrow moneys in order to finance its solvency.  Under the third non-life directive insurance companies are permitted to borrow funds for the purpose of meeting solvency requirements, subject to highly restrictive conditions on the extent and terms of such borrowings.  It does not appear that these conditions will apply to VHI and this will lower the cost of capital for VHI giving it a further competitive advantage over its insurance rivals.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether these preferential conditions will apply to VHI.</P>
        <P>The new Bill allows VHI to have subsidiaries but it is not clear how these will interact with the <Col N="719"/>VHI.  Under normal insurance regulation in Ireland insurance undertakings are not permitted to have subsidiaries as they may have a financial impact on the parent company.  A group structure of companies is generally formed whereby a parent holding company would have a number of subsidiaries, one of which would be the insurance undertaking.  This parent holding company would need to be approved by the Financial Regulator as would each subsidiary that is formed.  Under the current legislation it is not clear what the relationship is between the subsidiaries and VHI.  If these subsidiaries face financial difficulties does the Minister expect that they will be capitalised by VHI or will they have the capability to borrow money in their own right?</P>
        <P>The Bill does not indicate whether these subsidiaries will be for-profit companies or if they will only be required to break even.  Will these companies return any profits they make to the Government or will they be used to subsidise the core health insurance business to help maintain premiums at a lower level?</P>
        <P>VHI will potentially receive substantial risk equalisation payments.  How will this money flow throughout the business and will it be used to finance subsidiary businesses?  If these subsidiaries are not profitable, particularly in the initial years, will money be transferred directly from the VHI health insurance business to assist them?  I am sure the Minster will agree it is important that VHI and associate subsidiary companies do not have any further competitive advantages and that every effort is made to ensure that health insurers operate and compete on a level playing field.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not specify whether subsidiary companies will be permitted to cross-sell and tie their products to health insurance products.  Customers who wish to retain VHI travel insurance are not currently allowed to change health insurance provider.  The Competition Authority, the Health Insurance Authority and the Barrington report have recommended that VHI cease its policy of cancelling members&rsquo; travel insurance policies should they choose to switch health insurance provider but to date VHI has refused to implement this change.  Why would VHI jeopardise its 35% share of the travel insurance market if it did not have to?</P>
        <P>In the interest of consumer-focused and market-driven competition, it is crucial that the relationship between VHI and subsidiaries is clear and that anti-competitive anomalies are removed.  To allow VHI to expand its commercial business could potentially tie in customers, which would only serve to strengthen the company&rsquo;s dominant position and distort competition.  This provision should be the same for all insurance companies that provide alternative services.  Does the Minster intend to address this anomaly through the legislation?</P><Col N="720"/>
        <P>To date, six co-location facilities have been approved by the HSE, with a further two locations awaiting approval.  This is intended to introduce 1,000 new private beds into the system.  Under the Minister&rsquo;s co-location plan, the main source of revenue of the new hospitals will be health insurance premia.  Considering that VHI holds 75% of the health insurance market, a contract with VHI will be of critical importance to the co-located hospitals.  Without coverage from VHI, it is unlikely that a co-located hospital could operate in the market.</P>
        <P>VHI&rsquo;s publicly stated policy is that there is no need for any further private beds.  Its annual report states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The single biggest challenge facing private health care in Ireland is the unprecedented increase in private hospital capacity which has been encouraged by generous tax relief for such investment.  VHI Healthcare has questioned the wisdom of such tax incentives particularly since there does not appear to be any significant demand from the public sector to use these new facilities.  The cost of financing the new capacity will place huge pressure on our objective to provide our members with quality health care at affordable prices.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">This new (private hospital) capacity far exceeds what is required on the private side and there is no evidence of any significant transfer of public demand into these facilities.  VHI has consistently argued against this tax relief scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is likely that insurance rates set out for assessment of co-location hospitals will be far in excess of the current rates paid.  The new rates will undoubtedly drive the cost of health insurance upward, thus making it unaffordable.  The small number of competitors in the health insurance market and the dominance of VHI make the operators of the new co-location hospitals dependent on the company.  No co-located hospital could survive without coverage from VHI and the level of its profitability will be dependent on the level of cover VHI will supply to it.</P>
        <P>If there were more health insurers and a more evenly distributed market, this dependence on VHI would diminish and competition would be encouraged.  This would lead to lower premia, less dependence on one player, greater bargaining power for customers and enhanced stability within the market.  To date, however, fair competition has not been facilitated in this market.  It is essential that the changes in the Bill support, encourage and facilitate fair competition.  Perhaps the Minister of State will outline the Minister&rsquo;s plans for the future of VHI.  Does she intend to break up the company or bring forward legislation to reduce its market share?</P>
        <P>Why is psychotherapy, which is now recognised as of great importance in the treatment of mental <Col N="721"/>illness, not covered by VHI?  Everybody accepts it is absolutely necessary that there be an increase in psychotherapy services to facilitate a multidisciplinary delivery of mental health treatment.  The Irish College of Psychiatrists is strongly supportive of such an approach.  Why are patients limited to six months&rsquo; treatment in a psychiatric hospital but there is no limit for general hospital patients?  VHI is discriminating against patients with psychiatric illnesses.</P>
        <P>A report last week from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, outlined conditions in hospitals throughout the State.  Why were psychiatric hospitals not assessed as part of this review?  When I raised this issue with the Minister in last week&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, she responded that psychiatric hospitals are not under the remit of the HSE.  That is no excuse.  HIQA itself is not under the umbrella of the HSE and there is no reason that it should not examine psychiatric hospitals simply because they come under the remit of the Mental Health Commission.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Bill, as far as it goes and as late as it is.  There has been significant pressure from a variety of sources to bring the Bill to the House, as alluded to by the Minister of State.  The greatest pressure came from the rightful contention of the nascent competitors in the market that VHI had an unfair advantage in not being required to hold the same level of reserves as was required of other insurance companies.  Nor did it come within the ambit of the Financial Regulator.  The Government was further pressurised to take action when the European Commission ruled that the derogation granted to VHI was no longer sustainable.  There were also recommendations in the Barrington report and from the Health Insurance Authority and Competition Authority that the <i>status quo</i> was entirely unfair.</P>
        <P>Whatever the provenance of the legislation, the fundamental issue it must address is that of competition in the health insurance market.  That is the underlying objective of the legislation.  The introduction of competition in public services is the key unresolved issue in our society.  The absence of competition in this case, as in others, is resulting in poorer service, less choice and higher prices.</P>
        <P>It seems, notwithstanding many amendments on Committee Stage in the Seanad, that the solvency issue is addressed in the Bill.  I welcome the provision whereby it will come under the ambit of the Financial Regulator.  However, we would be mistaken in expecting this Bill to create a level playing field in which there is a prospect of flourishing competition in the health insurance market.  The legislation does not even begin to address the issue of the market dominance enjoyed by VHI.  Almost 80% of the market <Col N="722"/>belongs to VHI and for years it has been a protected and sheltered monopoly.  The State, meanwhile, has been a supportive backer and an undemanding shareholder.</P>
        <P>The elephant in the room in this debate is the introduction of risk equalisation, which is totally anti-competitive in the context of this background.  It defies logic to suggest that it is somehow in the public interest to require new market entrants to pay huge sums of money to a monopolistic incumbent of some 50 years standing.  I fully support community rating as the only fair pricing system for health insurance.  Furthermore, I support risk equalisation where it is warranted.  However, for as long as VHI holds a position of dominance in the market, which affords it such a huge advantage, there should be no question of other insurers being asked to subsidise it.</P>
  <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I have concerns too about additional powers being given to VHI against this background of dominance.  For example, the power to expand its financial services is something with which, in normal circumstances, I would have no difficulty. This would be good if we could ensure it was competing fairly with others in the same market.  If we are in a position where risk equalisation could lead &mdash; as it very nearly did &mdash; to all competitors being driven out of the field, I have a problem with additional powers being given to VHI.  In these circumstances, the additional freedom to trade in insurance and introduce other financial services, set up subsidiaries, raise capital and become a private health provider as well as insurer is not the kind of power we should be giving to a monopoly, whether in the public or private sector.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>I am concerned about the significant latitude being given to expand into the service provision area.  In effect, VHI may now become a major health-care provider, as well as being a major health-care insurer.  That could be a benefit but we should be very careful about introducing such a possibility when VHI could retain a monopoly.  The Competition Authority must be very wary and careful about this in being a watchdog on our behalf.  There should be no question of tying insurance customers to the service provision offered by VHI if it, for example, provided hospital care, which may be in mind down the road.</P>
        <P>We must examine the relationship between the insurance and service provision businesses to ensure there is no cross-subsidisation that would militate against competitors in either market.  It may be that this could be a benefit in leading to a reduction in prices because of vertical integration between the provider of insurance and the provider of a service but it is not a good idea when the provider has a monopoly.  We should be very careful about this.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about removing current restrictions to safeguard the consumer, those buying insurance, particularly with regard to the <Col N="723"/>Government&rsquo;s power to approve a price increase when VHI wished to do so.  We all know cases when the insurer looked for a 15% rise and was granted 10%, or it sought 10% and was granted 5%.  That at least gave some protection to the consumer but it has now been taken away and it is up to VHI to decide on prices.  I am completely in favour of this in a competitive market, as one must have commercial freedom to set a price.  If a monopolist or dominant player is controlling 80% of the market, it is not a good idea.  We should be very careful about this.</P>
        <P>Many other issues should be addressed in the Bill.  For example, it has been heavily recommended that lifetime community rating be introduced.  The Bill falls down completely on the really important decisions about the provision and direction of health care and the structure it will take.  These decisions have not been made, yet we are giving free rein to a monopoly insurer for private health care.  We do not know if there will be a future for private health care or private health care insurance, who will be insured or where insured patients will be treated.</P>
        <P>We were told two or three years ago that there would be new consultant contracts for public-only care.  We were also told that all private beds in public hospitals would go.  We were then told that only some of the contracts would be public-only care and that we would have co-located hospitals.  There is complete chaos and a lack of direction in these matters.</P>
        <P>My colleague from the Labour Party, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, and I attended a meeting in Buswell&rsquo;s Hotel today with various interest groups representing older people.  They expressed grievous concerns about the introduction of yet another model of health care, with people paying within a completely different structure.  There is no coherence, logic, direction or consistency in what is happening in the provision of health care.</P>
        <P>Nobody knows how health care will be structured in the future and to give free rein to VHI, leaving the genie out of the bottle, is at this stage premature.  Until major decisions about the structure of health care are made and clear direction is given to everybody trying to deliver the service, we will see the continuation of the chaos we have witnessed so far.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to appear to be against VHI.  I am probably one of its longest-serving members, although I am showing my age in saying this.  I was a very small child when VHI was set up.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a complicated issue, as we are dealing with VHI in transition after 50 years in existence.  We should congratulate the body on that length of service.  An EU directive exempted the company from rules governing coverage in the market, with many other similar types of health insurance system in Europe, but we are now moving to a point where the European non-life insurance directive must be implemented.  In effect, VHI is moving from a relatively protected and limited status to competition in the broader market.</P>
        <P>Much of what is in front of us raises many questions, rather than providing answers.  As with previous speakers from Fine Gael, I have a number of questions on the legislation.  We have had competition since 1994 but in some ways it is very limited.  It is in the context of protecting consumers through community rating and the vagaries of risk equalisation.  The Labour Party strongly supports the concept of community rating but the devil is in the detail of how risk equalisation is implemented.</P>
        <P>VHI has a very large corner of the market, which is probably inevitable because it has been in existence for so long and has a very large cohort of loyal customers.  By and large, it has given very good service to its customers.  The broader question to be asked by the Labour Party is whether we should stay within the system in place, an unequal and somewhat contradictory one.</P>
        <P>Some 50% of the population is covered by Voluntary Health Insurance while at the same time having a right of access to public hospital beds.  The other percentage of the population, in effect, has less equitable access, as the services for which we pay through Voluntary Health Insurance are not available to them.</P>
        <P>The system is complicated and, in the context of the move to greater privatisation of the system with co-located hospitals and so on, it has become even more complicated.  Adding further to this complication is the transitional phase at which we are looking up to the end of 2008, when VHI must have &euro;140 million in place to comply with the same solvency rules as its competitors.  In the meantime, the insurer&rsquo;s competitors have relatively small percentages of the market.  I understand VHI has approximately 75% of the market; Quinn Healthcare, 20% and VIVAS, 5%.  One wonders why many other larger companies which provide insurance in other countries with a health insurance system are not entering the Irish insurance market.  We must live with our competitive market and therefore must work out a system <Col N="725"/>which would have more players in the market.  However, I do not support reducing protection for sectors of society that, by their nature, place more demands on the health services, such as the elderly and people with disabilities.  It is vital we protect the interests of those sectors and do not encourage insurers to discourage them from becoming customers.  We must, therefore, ensure the balance is maintained and that level of protection remains.  These figures are worked out mathematically in accordance with statistics, percentages and volumes of use.  I am not expert enough to say whether the risk equalisation balances should be changed.  I do not know and in many of these matters we must rely on levels of expertise of those who deal with these issues all the time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not sure of the position on the issue going through the courts, to which the Minister referred.  Could the Minister clarify it?  I am confused about what the Minister said about section 3(<i>d</i>), that the Government considers it appropriate that VHI have the maximum flexibility on how it achieves the level of solvency required to satisfy the Financial Regulator.  He said if the State was assisting, &ldquo;the Government and the European Commission would have to be satisfied in advance that any such investment by the State did not constitute state aid&rdquo;.  I assume VHI will have to come up with this &euro;140 million by the end of 2008.  I am unsure what the parameters are on achieving that.  VHI members would like to know if that will increase premiums.  I do not know if there are clear answers to the questions I pose.</P>
        <P>The Minister says the Government should seek specialist advice on how the VHI could be authorised by the end of 2008 and that the consultants are due to produce a report for the Departments of Finance and Health and Children by the end of this month.  They will then determine the provisions that will be required to comply with the authorisation by the end of 2008.  The legislation is going through before those reports.  Why was that information not in place before we dealt with the legislation?</P>
        <P>I have some questions on whether it is intended to break up VHI.  Again, there are more questions than answers around this possibility.  What kind of subsidiaries might there be and what are the parameters for their operation?  Would they be free to make profits, as Deputy Neville asked?  There is much vagueness around this issue.  The public will be as confused as I am on the intention of this legislation.  It is pre-emptive to present this Bill without having the answers to so many of those questions.  I support Deputy Neville&rsquo;s comments on psychotherapy and other services that are not covered.  As Deputy Mitchell said, we attended a meeting with the representative groups of a number of organisations that look after the interests of the elderly where strong views were expressed, particularly on nursing <Col N="726"/>homes and the fact that a large percentage of people&rsquo;s incomes and estates would be required for them to have nursing home care.  They raised the question of ageism and equity.  One must ask why certain categories of people and care are not generally included in health insurance, not specifically VHI.</P>
        <P>I have a problem with the fact that HIQA does not cover private facilities so people who pay large amounts of money to health insurance companies do not get the same level of protection on the facilities they use as patients in public hospitals.  While we rightly debate the plan to centralise the excellence required for cancer services in the public system, private organisations can supply cancer services in facilities that are not subject to HIQA&rsquo;s standardisation procedures, the general principle of numbers of patients, throughput and the other issues debated around public facilities.  This divide must be addressed.  All patients are entitled to the highest quality standards, whether public or private, and in this case private patients must be protected rather than public.</P>
        <P>In other areas public patients must be protected.  The Labour Party has serious concerns on the move towards greater purchasing of health services from private facilities, particularly the co-location of private hospitals on the grounds of public hospitals.  We all have significant questions on how that will operate, how the rare experts in specialist areas will be allocated.  There might be only one expert in a particular field located in a certain area.  Such people should be available to private and public patients and we should not have to decide between the two groups.</P>
        <P>We object to the idea that patients who come in to an accident and emergency department in a public hospital will be diverted to one hospital or the other depending on whether they are private or public.  We are concerned about how the public hospitals will be funded when the 1,000 new private beds are open in the co-located private hospitals.  Money that would previously have gone to the public hospital system from the VHI and other health insurers will go to the private hospital, which will already benefit from substantial tax relief funded by the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>There are serious questions for the public service and patients.  I do not know if anybody has done a study on the costs of this transfer, the costs foregone in the public hospital and those associated with private provision.  We are entering unknown territory with these co-located hospitals.  We have no detailed idea how they will operate.  However some of the deals, including the one in my constituency, were signed in the last few days.  The Labour Party vigorously opposed these co-located hospitals before the general election and will continue to do whatever we can to ensure there is an equitable system open to all.  We do not support the concept of co-<Col N="727"/>location.  We are going through a transition phase from what was a monopoly health insurance company coming into competition with other health insurance companies and about to be broadened out to an even more competitive environment by the end of 2008.  We seem to be moving in the direction of more of the population having private health insurance.  As that happens we will have more of a two-tier health system.  For the private system to work, inevitably the public system will need to get worse.  There will be an incentive for those being paid through the private system to ensure enough of the population go in that direction.  Already it is very high in Ireland.</P>
        <P>That is part of the context in which the Labour Party proposed the concept of universal health insurance in 2001 and presented it as the central core of our public health policy in the 2002 general election.  At that time is did not get much credence and was rubbished by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It was implied that we were doing all sorts of things that we were not doing.  In the current climate there is more support for the concept.  Two weeks ago the Irish Nurses Organisation stated it supported the idea of universal health insurance.  It has been supported by a number of senior medical and surgical clinicians.  The general public is beginning to ask why it cannot have a system that is fair and equal as operates in so many other countries.  Since I became health spokesperson I have tried to read myself into my brief and in doing so I have tried to understand how universal health insurance is implemented in a number of other countries in Europe and beyond.  I believe that is the only way for this country to go.</P>
        <P>I hope the provisions in this legislation are temporary and will fit into a broader concept of universal health insurance, whereby those with the ability to pay will pay their full insurance costs, as do 53% of the population now.  Those who are not able to pay should have it paid by the State and those in the middle would have a sliding scale of payments.  That would be the most appropriate and fairest direction for the Irish health system.  More people now want to know more about the concept as a way of coming to terms with the extraordinary problems with the health system, which we will be debating in tonight&rsquo;s motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>We intend to enlarge the dialogue on universal health insurance.  We intend to raise the matter in every way we can.  We intend to encourage people who are thinkers about the health system &mdash; those who work in the health system and, more important, people who need to use the health system &mdash; to consider the possibility of universal health insurance.  There are different ways to implement it.  It is done in different ways in different countries.  Essentially it is based on the concept of excellence and equity.  It also has the capa<Col N="728"/>city to raise standards in the delivery of health services and to ensure the best possible use of the available money.</P>
        <P>Many things that happen in health do not encourage the best possible use of money.  Fixed amounts are paid for certain things, including bed-nights, different procedures etc.  There is no great encouragement for patients to avail of the appropriate care at the appropriate time.  Many other parts of the system do not encourage the best possible use of the existing expertise and capacity.  Everybody in the House would like to see considerably more use of community services.  While agreeing with it, it still has not happened in any meaningful way.  Many people who are in acute hospitals should not be there and would be more appropriately cared for in the community.  In the context of the meeting we attended at lunchtime, many people being forced to go into private nursing homes would be much better off in their own community if the full support services existed in their community.</P>
        <P>We need to have a debate about all the structures in the health service including how certain patients are insured and others are not insured leading to services being provided in different ways to different patients.  There is direct competition at times between public and private lists, which is appalling as was highlighted above anything else in the past year by the death of Susie Long.  In commemorating Susie Long we need to listen to her voice which clearly said that she believed in one system of health care that was universally available to all on the basis of need.  She actually refused to have private health insurance because she believed in such equity of access.  While I do not know whether she could afford it, she clearly said that she did not believe in it because she felt there should be equity of access.</P>
        <P>We believe we need to reach that point.  Obviously we are not there yet.  Even if we were in government next week, it would take some time to implement it.  It is certainly where we would like to get to.  I hope we will have vigorous and informed debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>The Bill represents a transition; it raises more questions than it answers.  There is considerable confusion about what will happen up to the end of 2008 in order to bring VHI under regulation and away from its current position as a somewhat protected organisation.  I look forward to the response of the Minister of State to those questions.  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  As we move on to the other Stages of the Bill I hope we will be able to get clearer responses.  I am conscious that as a former Minister for Health, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows as much about this matter as anybody else in the room.  I look forward to the rest of the debate on the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MargaretConlon"><NameTxt>Deputy Margaret Conlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to contribute to the debate this evening.  The Bill provides for the most significant changes to the provisions governing Voluntary Health Insurance since VHI was established 50 years ago in 1957.  In the intervening period there has been only one other significant amending Act, the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 1996.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A very good Act it was too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretConlon"><NameTxt>Deputy Margaret Conlon</NameTxt>
	<P>VHI finds itself in the anomalous position of being both the market leader in the health insurance market and being an unauthorised insurer.  The company&rsquo;s competitors consider that this position confers a competitive advantage on it.  Although the present statutory arrangements also prescribe a number of significant disadvantages for VHI, the Government recognises that the derogation cannot continue.  It considers that it is in the best interests of the health insurance market and VHI that the company attain authorisation as an insurer in the shortest possible timeframe and be subject to the same prudential regulation as other commercial insurers operating in the market.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Bill reflect the general thrust of the recent recommendations of the Health Insurance Authority, the Competition Authority and the Barrington group regarding VHI, as set out in their reports on competition in the private health insurance market.  They also address matters raised by other market stakeholders, including VHI&rsquo;s competitors.  The Bill will be good for the development of the health insurance market and, ultimately, for consumers.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has also taken an interest in developments in the market having regard to overseeing the operation of the insurance directives, complaints made to it by other market participants and the provisions of the treaty.  The Commission has emphasised the need to address the VHI&rsquo;s derogation as soon as is feasible.  The provisions of the Bill are very much focused on providing VHI with a structure that is more appropriate to the competitive market in which it now operates and one that will oblige the board to pursue early authorisation and provide a statutory framework that will facilitate this process.  The provisions of the Bill are focused on giving VHI a structure that is more appropriate to the competitive market in which it operates.  The new structure will oblige the board to pursue early authorisation and provide a statutory framework to facilitate that process.  Since its establishment, the primary function of the board has been to provide health insurance &mdash; that will continue to be the case.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to oblige the board to achieve authorisation from the Financial Regulator as an insurer and to give it a structure <Col N="730"/>that will support an application for such authorisation.  This involves giving VHI the freedom to take commercial decisions about products and pricing.  It will be obliged, under the parent Act and in accordance with the memorandum and articles of association of any relevant subsidiaries, to continue to provide health insurance for the population.  The Bill also provides for the definition of a &ldquo;health insurance contract&rdquo; in respect of cash plans to be amended.  If an insurance undertaking is to be authorised, the Financial Regulator will have to be satisfied that the organisation has full independence in designing its products and setting their prices.  We agree that it is no longer appropriate in a competitive market for the Minister to have any involvement in such commercial decisions.</P>
        <P>As VHI is a major provider of health care for a significant proportion of the population, we must ensure it is obliged to meet the appropriate regulatory requirements.  The provisions of this legislation will have a positive effect on the management and staff of VHI, benefit VHI&rsquo;s consumers and facilitate the development of the health insurance market.  The European Commission has been kept informed of the evolution of the Bill through its Internal Market directorate which is responsible for insurance directives.  It has taken a keen interest in the development of the Irish health insurance market.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>I welcome this detailed and technical Bill.  VHI, which is a part of the lives of most of us, is 50 years old and has served us well.  The Bill needed to be introduced to bring VHI&rsquo;s level of reserves in line with its competitors.  VHI needs to have a certain level of reserves before it can be authorised as an insurer.  Its high reserves &mdash; some &euro;292 million &mdash; are above the minimum EU requirement.  However, the company falls short &mdash; by &euro;140 million &mdash; of the level of reserves of established insurers with premium and claim experience.  It falls a long way short of what is required by the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>This legislation will put in place a structure that will give VHI commercial freedom on products and pricing.  I am pleased that the Bill provides that the board of VHI may raise or borrow money without any cost to the Exchequer.  While there is no limit on the borrowings VHI may raise for the purpose of attaining authorisation, there is a limit on borrowings for the day-to-day running of the company or new products it may offer.  Such borrowings may not exceed 10% of the previous year&rsquo;s charges.  The board which is best placed to make decisions on products and pricing has sole responsibility for such decisions.  Consumers can be assured their interests will be protected, regardless of the rate of change in the market.</P>
        <P>VHI has provided health insurance for 50 years.  It has given good and loyal service to its customers.  The Government is determined that <Col N="731"/>VHI should be an authorised insurer by 2008.  The Bill will have a positive effect.  It will allow VHI to continue to provide health insurance in Ireland, in the best interests of the health insurance market and consumers alike.  I commend this legislation to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.</P>
        <P>I find it extraordinary that VHI, the market leader in the health insurance market, is an unauthorised insurer.  I accept that the Bill before the House seeks to address this issue.</P>
        <P>Approximately half of the people have private health insurance, mainly to cover hospital care.  Such care is a right that should be delivered to all patients free of charge.  That 50% of the population feels the need to pay for private health insurance constitutes a vote of no confidence in the way the public health service is run by the Government.</P>
        <P>Members should be aware that they are considering the privatisation of VHI in the context of this Bill &mdash; the legislation will lead to the eventual privatisation of the company.  After privatisation has taken place, premiums will increase according to market conditions or in line with what VHI wishes to charge its customers.</P>
        <P>The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, decided in 2001, a year before a general election, not to allow VHI to increase its premiums.  Two price increases took place after the 2002 general election, however, which indicates to me that there may be some merit in removing political interference from VHI.</P>
        <P>Members should consider some of the problems associated with VHI.  Nobody who attends hospital and pays VHI premiums has any idea what he or she pays for, as customers do not receive itemised bills.  We do not know what we are paying for as customers of VHI, Quinn Healthcare or VIVAS Health.  If the Minister wishes to ensure consumers are not abused as a consequence of the monopoly position of the providers in this market, we must ensure patients are charged in a transparent manner.  Therefore, we must consider the possibility of itemised hospital bills.</P>
        <P>While I favour competition &mdash; much of what the Minister is doing in the Bill will probably prove good in the long term &mdash; nothing beneficial will arise from this legislation if we continue to allow VHI to charge its customers in a secretive manner.  We need to change the way hospitals and VHI work together if we are to help those patients who are customers of VHI.  The Minister is not assisting patients in that respect.</P>
        <P>There is no need for large reserves to be held by an insurance company which deals exclusively with health.  It is not in the same position as a company dealing with life assurance or accident <Col N="732"/>insurance.  There is no possibility of a major calamity that would require a health insurance company to use such large reserves.  There is no need for such a large reserve.</P>
        <P>I welcome VHI&rsquo;s heavy involvement in the SwiftCare clinics which have been successful.  I do not doubt that VHI will get involved in other aspects of health care provision.  Therefore, the Minister is privatising and compromising services such as general practice, emergency care and pharmacy care.  There has been no clear debate in the House on whether people want to follow this model.  It failed when it was followed in Australia a number of years ago &mdash; the service to patients became worse, the cost to consumers increased and it did not work out as expected.  The quality of care got worse.</P>
        <P>We should have a proper debate in the House before we allow a vast company like VHI which will have a significant monopoly in the market to privatise many aspects of health care, apart from private health insurance.  The Minister should consider stopping or limiting the process or ensuring greater transparency.  The mere privatisation of VHI will create an unholy mess for consumers if we are not careful and do not look at other aspects of this issue.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael values VHI and the service it has provided.  It established VHI on 1 October 1957 to deliver that service.  I appreciate that this amending Bill has been introduced partially in response to a threat of legal action issued by the EU Internal Market and Services Commissioner, Mr. Charlie McCreevy.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that many players in this field have become concerned about the lack of policy discussion on the future of the health insurance market.  The State has invested significantly in VHI, not only in terms of tax forgone by means of tax reliefs but also in terms of a mechanism about which the Minister has spoken at length &mdash; the subsidisation of private care in public hospitals.  All citizens who pay VHI subscriptions are grateful for those tax reliefs.  While the Minister for Health and Children remains the biggest shareholder, important questions arise for citizens in any discussion of VHI&rsquo;s future.  In many ways, the citizens&rsquo; primary relationship to VHI has pertained to the cost of premiums which for any family constitutes a major expense in the course of a year.  What exactly are citizens buying?  Most believed that through membership of VHI they were buying fast access to health care, as well as a choice of consultant but which we know is not the case.</P>
        <P>This amending Bill will provide retrospective cover for VHI for actions in which it engaged that may have been outside its perceived function.  These include the SwiftCare clinics and the provision of travel insurance, to give two examples.  The explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill states its object is to oblige VHI&rsquo;s board <Col N="733"/>to attain the level of reserves necessary to achieve authorisation as an insurer and to provide it with a structure that gives commercial freedom on pricing to the company.  It is evident that this is essential.  I presume this will give more freedom to VHI to involve itself in other activities outside those in which it has traditionally engaged.  Does the Minister believe it should engage in such activities?</P>
        <P>For example, the Bill allows for VHI to establish a subsidiary company to provide pensions.  This constitutes a major change to its role.  What would be the State&rsquo;s liability in this regard?  Would such companies be completely separate?  For example, if such a company encountered difficulties in the provision of pension or financial services, would there be an ongoing liability for the State?  Is such commercial freedom not undermined by VHI&rsquo;s ongoing obligation to continue to do the Minister&rsquo;s bidding?  The Minister should clarify this issue.  It may be that such companies will be completely separate.  The Bill is unclear in this regard.  Members are being asked to make a very important decision regarding VHI&rsquo;s future.  Answers to my questions would be helpful.</P>
        <P>The proposals in the Bill will give additional flexibility to VHI, which is to be welcomed.  However, I am concerned about the 50% increase in VHI premia in the past five years, which is not fair to consumers.  We must ensure insurance companies cannot cherry-pick members.  A facility must be established to ensure risk equalisation payments are made.  We must ensure every citizen will have access to health care and, if he or she so wishes, private health insurance at reasonable cost.  To this end, the Minister must do everything possible to encourage competition.</P>
        <P>We have had evidence of privatisation working in some sectors but not in others.  Our role must be to ensure genuine competition and consumer choice.  We must also encourage other companies to enter the health insurance market.  It is interesting that consumers have a wide choice of insurers in the field of general insurance, whether vehicle, home or property insurance, whereas the number of health insurance companies is very limited.  Our political ambition must be to ensure a range of health insurance providers is available to consumers.</P>
        <P>With regard to the provision in section 3 removing the requirement that VHI obtain ministerial consent for increases in premia, while I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point that the VHI board is probably best placed to make the final decision on increasing premia, the provision is akin to washing one&rsquo;s hands of the political responsibility for price increases.  Given that VHI is still a State company for which the Government is ultimately responsible, repealing this provision sends the wrong signal.  Either the Government is in charge of VHI or it is not and price increases, charges <Col N="734"/>and levies go to the core of its responsibilities in this area.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation as it helps to rebalance the position in favour of smaller companies.  This is a positive development because more competition is needed in the health insurance market, an issue which the House will debate again.</P>
        <P>The Bill raises questions about the level of reserve VHI must meet.  I understand the Financial Regulator has set the solvency reserve at<?oasys _jy ?>40%, but the EU average is just 25%.  Can the Minister confirm whether the Financial Regulator is considering amending the level of solvency health insurers are expected to reach?  If so, are the Department of Health and Children and health insurers involved in this process?  If VHI is expected to reach a solvency level of 40% of its premium income by the end of 2008, will this have an impact on the cost of health insurance premiums?  VHI customers have already seen subscription rates rise by 25% in the past two years, which is ridiculous.  I suggest the House should re-examine this issue with a view to benchmarking the health insurance level of reserve against the requirement in other EU countries which require a reserve of 25%.</P>
        <P>The Bill allows VHI to have subsidiary companies but it is not clear how these will interact with VHI.  The Bill does not indicate whether these subsidiary companies will be for-profit companies or if they will only be required to break even.  Will they have to make a return to Government on any profits they make or will the profits be used to subsidise the core health insurance business to help maintain premiums at a lower level?  Should they face financial difficulties, does the Minister expect they will be capitalised by VHI or will they have the capability to borrow money in their own right?  If they are not profitable, particularly in the initial years following establishment, will money be transferred directly from the VHI health insurance business to assist them?  It is important that VHI and associate subsidiary companies operate and compete on a level playing field.</P>
        <P>I would be grateful if the Minister of State answered those questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill and listen to the contributions of speakers.  Health has been a big issue in recent weeks.  Health insurance and people&rsquo;s concerns about health care are very important issues.  This Second Stage debate provides an opportunity for Members to express what in many cases are strong views.</P>
        <P>VHI was founded some time ago and could be regarded as a success story.  However, competition is good for all organisations.  I note the takeover of BUPA Ireland by the Quinn Group and the arrival into the market of Vivas Health. <Col N="735"/> BUPA Ireland employed a large number of staff in Fermoy.  There was outrage when it left the town and the health care business but I am glad the Quinn Group took it over and maintained the competition.  The chief executive officer of Vivas Health is Mr. Oliver Tattan who is from my part of the world.  He is a man who should be listened to and holds strong views.  He has much to contribute to the area of health insurance.  Those three companies are involved in the health insurance market.  I hope this will mean increased competition for the benefit of ordinary consumers, those who pay their weekly, monthly or yearly subscriptions to these companies.  It is important the consumer receives a return for his or her subscription payment.</P>
        <P>The two-tier health system is of major concern.  The case of Susie Long provided an insight into what was really happening in this regard.  Those with private health insurance cover who have attended private hospitals are very satisfied with the waiting time for treatment and the service they receive.  As a society which wants to be fair to everybody, we have a duty to provide health care, whether through a system of health insurance or some other system available to people across the State on an equal basis.  This is most important.</P>
        <P>Other significant issues include minimum cover for inpatients, day care treatment, maternity benefit, and convalescent and psychiatric treatment, all crucial aspects of health care.  People often purchase private health care insurance in order to get cover for serious illness, as they feel they cannot rely on our two-tier health system.  It is absolutely imperative that any changes we make to our health insurance system do not impact negatively on any of these vital areas.  That is most important from the point of view of consumers who are dependent on health care.</P>
        <P>People are extremely vulnerable when in need of health care.  It is important that they are allowed to get adequate health cover in order to not add to their woes when they are sick.  It is vitally important that we ensure healthy and vibrant competition in the health insurance industry.  Many expressed their concerns to me when BUPA decided to leave the health insurance market.  They felt they had got value for money from it and feared they would not get the same deal from another company.  Competition is the lifeblood of trade.  The acquisition of BUPA by the Quinn Group allowed this important competition to continue and we must ensure this remains the case.</P>
        <P>There has been a lack of debate about how the private health insurance market operates and what should be its future direction.  Let us remember what happened in Shannon Airport re Aer Lingus and how it forgot the people of the region.  In making changes to VHI, we should <Col N="736"/>ensure the company looks after its customers better than Aer Lingus looked after the people who helped keep it going over many years.  It may be a wild comparison but it is a fact that Aer Lingus turned its back on the people of the Shannon region who supported it.  The Minister should give a clear guarantee in passing this legislation that customers, many of whom pay a substantial amount of hard earned money to VHI, will be looked after.</P>
        <P>Audiology appointments in south Tipperary take over two and a half years, unless a patient pays for private treatment.  This is unacceptable and we cannot allow such a situation to continue.  We should not tolerate such waiting lists for health care.  VHI reserves its right to be bulked up but the European Union will not stand over the current situation.  If things go wrong for VHI, patients will have no recourse.  Policyholders must be given a guarantee and be protected in every way possible.  Other countries such as Canada manage private health insurance in a different way and the system there appears to run efficiently.  We should investigate these systems before we rush into emergency legislation to alter how VHI operates.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about many other aspects of VHI and health care in general, but the consumer is the most important person in all of this.  I seek an assurance from the Minister that he or she will be looked after in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the 1972 directive, VHI, with other insurers, was granted a derogation from meeting the prudential obligations to be met by most insurance undertakings.  VHI has continued to operate as a statutory body and is exempt from the prudential requirements of the Financial Regulator, an independent prudential regulator having responsibility for all authorised insurers.</P>
        <P>As of 28 February this year the board of VHI maintains a significant level of reserves amounting to over &euro;292 million.  That amount is well above the minimum requirement of the European Union.  It is approximately &euro;147 million short of the level that established insurers with VHI premiums and claims experience could be required to maintain by the Financial Regulator.  The proposed changes to the VHI Acts contained in the Bill are consistent with the policy set out in the White Paper on health insurance published in 1999.  It is proposed to give full commercial freedom to VHI and place its relationship with the Minister on a more appropriate footing, and to remove its exemption from meeting solvency requirements.</P>
     <P>The European Commission has also taken an interest in developments in the market, having regard to overseeing the operation of the insurance directives, complaints made to it by other market participants and the provisions of <Col N="737"/>the treaty.  It recently emphasised the need to address VHI&rsquo;s derogation as a matter of urgency.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision in April, having regard to the developments in the overall marketplace, that in the best interest of the health insurance market and VHI, the company should attain authorisation as an insurer in the shortest possible timeframe, if possible by the end of 2008, and that it be subject to the same prudential regulation as other commercial insurers.</P>

           <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I also welcome the fact that the main provisions in the Bill are aimed at providing VHI with a structure that would be acceptable to the Financial Regulator when the application for authorisation is made.  It is only right and proper that VHI would conform to this, with all other insurers.  This involves giving commercial freedom on products and pricing to VHI and also the capacity to establish stand-alone subsidiaries.  VHI should not be constrained any more than any other insurance company.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The substitution proposed under section 3(<i>c</i>) is a significant change to section 2 of the 1996 VHI Act.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann,</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">expressing its serious concerns about disclosures of major failures in cancer care services at the Midlands General Hospital, Portlaoise, including the failure to diagnose breast cancer in nine women who had presented for mammograms and the recall of a further 97 women who had undergone ultrasound scans at the hospital;</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">deploring the way in which the women have been treated subsequent to these disclosures, including the failure to provide adequate counselling for those who have had to undergo surgery and the fact that women who had undergone scans first heard on news bulletins that they might be recalled;</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">noting that concern had previously been expressed about the adequacy of equipment and facilities at Portlaoise;</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">condemning the failure of the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the provision of cancer screening and treatment services in which the public can have full confidence;</P><Col N="738"/>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">urging the public, notwithstanding these alarming failures, to continue to present for screening and assessment;</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">noting that the HSE was the creation of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and that it has failed to deliver the improvements promised in the health service; and</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">believing in the principle of political accountability for such shocking failures in our health system,</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">has no confidence in the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I wish to share time with Deputies Joan Burton, Kathleen Lynch and Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.</P>
        <P>I am amazed that the Government&rsquo;s amendment does not propose confidence in the Minister for Health and Children.  It refers to a variety of matters, including sympathy and regret, and expresses confidence in the efficiency and high quality of the work carried out in the review of mammograms, approves the actions of the Minister for Health and Children, acknowledges the leadership she has shown and supports her in her commitment to ensuring equitable access to high quality cancer services, but nowhere does it express confidence in the Minister.  That is extraordinary.  Why is confidence not expressed by the Government in the Minister for Health and Children?</P>
        <P>We have tabled this motion of no confidence because the women and their families who have suffered so appallingly are entitled to have their health and lives taken seriously enough for somebody to take responsibility.  If political accountability is to mean anything, the Minister, Deputy Harney, must accept overall responsibility for the way these women were treated.  Of course she is not responsible for the misdiagnosis.  However, she set up the system that has become so focused on itself rather than the patient that, incredibly, it ended up telling the Oireachtas health committee before it told the women themselves that 97 human beings who had been told they were clear of cancer had to be recalled and may, after all, have had the disease when they were referred for tests.</P>
        <P>How could it have happened that these women did not get an individual and immediate response as soon as the doubt was known?  How was it that their files were neatly stacked up and batched until the number reached 97 to be dealt with as a package?  How could it have appeared more important to protect the system by telling the committee than to protect the women by telling them?  How is it that, 24 hours later, when the Minister and the nation knew, those women had still not got a telephone call?  How could counselling not have been put in place as promised and how could the help-line not be staffed with <Col N="739"/>sufficient personnel to prevent it being swamped?  The Minister can have three highly paid advisers on her staff, but only two cancer care nurses could be found to staff the helpline.  Every time we think lessons have been learned, something else happens to show that they have not.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is the Minister&rsquo;s response?  She has asked for a report from the board of the HSE which, we are told, will be ready in a few weeks.  What kind of response is that to people who have been so badly let down?  I acknowledge, as I was chairing the committee meeting, that the Minister did not know any sooner than I that 97 women were to be recalled for ultrasound review.  However, she should have known &mdash; she is the Minister.  The most basic lines of communication and accountability were not functioning.  It is inconceivable that the Minister did not keep in regular contact with the investigative process.</P>
        <P>The Minister told the D&aacute;il on 7 November that Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty &ldquo;has been asked to look over the mammograms, ultrasounds and anything else that is relevant, including the machinery&rdquo;.  Last Wednesday, during Question Time, she said in a reply to me that a further two women were diagnosed with breast cancer, in addition to the seven already diagnosed, and gave me to understand that this was the final number.  Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty&rsquo;s brief included ultrasounds.  At what point were they transferred to a parallel investigation?  Who is examining the 15 year old equipment?  If, as we are told, Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty&rsquo;s report is completed, is it confined to the mammography reviews or is it more comprehensive?  How many reports will there be?  Is anybody examining why inadequate systems stayed in place despite the letter sent directly to the Minister in July 2005 by Mr. Peter Naughton, a surgeon in Portlaoise, who described the diagnostic services there as &ldquo;a shambles&rdquo;?  The Minister must be accountable on these matters of vital public concern.</P>
        <P>If nobody is considered responsible, no lessons will be learned.  An unidentified woman at the ICA public meeting a few days ago expressed what most women in Ireland are now thinking: &ldquo;If I find a lump or another symptom that worries me and I go for tests, can I be sure that the result I am given is correct?&rdquo;  That is a fundamental question which no woman should have to ask.  The latest news that 15 patients at Cork University Hospital, and perhaps others at UCHG, were wrongly diagnosed is adding to the uncertainty.  It is essential that trust is restored, but this can only be done by making real and transparent change.</P>
        <P>We have been accused of stirring up fears and playing political games.  I wish to confront those accusations and refute them.  The fear and mistrust are caused by the facts of what has happened.  Women&rsquo;s lives have been unnecessarily put at risk.  The monstrous bureaucracy, the HSE, set up by the political decision of the Government <Col N="740"/>and the Minister, failed miserably to handle the consequences appropriately and ensure that the focus was on patient care.</P>
        <P>It is our job to hold the Minister and the HSE to account.  We would be letting down brave women, such Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley and Susie Long, the Midlands woman who spoke with her back to the camera to protect her family, the mother of four from Kildare who was one of the nine whose mammography was misdiagnosed and who has had surgery, if we did not speak out as strongly as we can.  The woman from Kildare, quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning, said she had no faith in the Minister, Deputy Harney.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she has a clue how to run the system. I know she didn&rsquo;t do the mammograms but after the way she has handled this whole situation I really do think she should step down,&rdquo; she said.  These women were brave enough to stand up and be counted, as we should be.  They did so because they wanted to bring about changes.</P>
        <P>We are not questioning Deputy Mary Harney&rsquo;s integrity or her commitment.  She is an eloquent and persuasive speaker and believes in what she is doing.  She is committed to doing what she believes is right for the health services.  However, that is part of the problem.  She has the ability to persuade others that she is right and, despite the fact that her party got only 2% of the votes of the people, nobody in Fianna F&aacute;il or the Green Party is willing to take on the job.  They stand by while the ideologically driven philosophy of the Progressive Democrats hones and shapes the future of the health services.  The fact that she cannot be answerable for every detail of the operation of the HSE is a red herring.  The present catastrophe in Portlaoise and other crises cannot be passed off as errors by one or more clinicians.  They are primarily failures of management in a system established by the political decision of the present Minister and most of the people in the current Government.</P>
        <P>Speaking in the D&aacute;il in November 2004 when she introduced the legislation to set up the HSE, the Minister said:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is a once in a generation event.  It is our generation&rsquo;s chance to put patients first in the design of the management of health services.  It is our chance to put in place modern, effective management to make the best use of these tremendous resources we are applying to health and to get clear value and clear results for that money.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Later in her speech she said there were two ways Government policy would be judged:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">. . . better outcomes for patients and better value for taxpayers&rsquo; money.  To achieve them, we badly need clarity of roles and accountability  &mdash; political responsibility for the Minister and management responsibility for the management.  The lines of responsibility and <Col N="741"/>accountability are clear in this legislation, the clearest they will ever have been in health administration in this country.  That will make a real difference to the quality of health services provided for our people.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Three years on, the only thing that is clear is that none of this has been delivered.  There is no clarity of accountability, no value for money, no taking of responsibility and, above all, no sense that patients are being put first.  The health service has become a huge centralised bureaucracy with hundreds more senior and middle-management personnel than ever existed in the old health board system.  When one talks to people &mdash; I have talked to many &mdash; who work at the coalface taking care of patients, they say that it is much harder now to have decisions made.  Morale is low and there is a huge level of frustration with the system.</P>
        <P>The HSE should never have been set up in its cumbersome, centralised, top-heavy form.  There must be root-and-branch reform, with layers of management taken out and lines of accountability clearly defined, including that of the Minister.  Deputy John Gormley, now the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, was right when he stated in the D&aacute;il in December 2004 during the debate on legislation establishing the HSE:</P>
        <P LI="1">This is retrograde legislation.  It is a sad day for democracy and this House.  In years to come people will ask what the Government was thinking about when it rushed this Bill through.  It is clear the T&aacute;naiste wishes to rush it through and to guillotine it because she does not believe in the same democratic values in which we on this side believe.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister, Deputy Gormley, is on the other side now.  Will he stand up and be counted on his democratic values?  We cannot stand by and see the health service shaped into an entity that provides speedy treatment according to ability to pay, sees patients as numbers, and is run by an organisation whose structure even Government Ministers such as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v cannot fathom.  The Government as a whole must take responsibility for the health service rather than allowing it to be run according to the ideology of a tiny party.  Backbenchers who are in touch with the concerns of their constituents and those who call themselves Independents should have the courage of their convictions and vote accordingly.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a relatively small country, with a population roughly equivalent to that of Greater Manchester.  There are successful models for us to follow and we have the money to invest.  I acknowledge that a considerable amount of money has been invested in the health services &mdash; a greater increase than any other comparable OECD country.  However, we cannot continue to lurch from crisis to crisis and watch the loss of <Col N="742"/>confidence of patients and staff.  It is possible to re-organise and restructure the delivery of health services to the standard of excellence to which we all aspire.  The Labour Party has made positive proposals on how this can be done, particularly by advancing the concept of universal health insurance.</P>
        <P>We support specialist cancer centres, but they must be properly resourced.  There have been suggestions that we have not been supportive of the proposals with regard to cancer.  We are completely supportive of the establishment of specialist cancer centres, but we must be told how they are to be resourced before they become, once again, distanced from the Minister through the HSE and towards Professor Tom Keane.  We must know that the resources will be provided and for that reason I am pleased that the Minister for Finance is here listening to me.  We have campaigned vigorously for the roll-out of BreastCheck across the country and sponsored whistleblower legislation.  We have also called for the establishment of patient safety alert processes, the accreditation and development of laboratory provision in Ireland, clinical audit and the expansion of HIQA&rsquo;s role to cover private as well as public institutions.  We want open accountability and equity across the system.  These are practical measures that would improve patient safety outcomes, increase confidence in the system, allow people who have concerns to raise them, and ensure constant auditing and reviews of clinical practice in our health service.  These are all matters for political implementation and political judgement.</P>
        <P>What people want above all is to be able to trust the health services.  They want to feel that someone is in charge and that those who give care are enabled and supported in doing so.  Responsibility has not been taken in the appalling circumstances of the Portlaoise debacle and I see no evidence of it in the Government&rsquo;s amendment to our motion.  Each day new and more shocking disclosures have emerged.  Those relating to Cork University Hospital are the latest, and who can say with any confidence that they will be the last?</P>
        <P>We still do not have the answers we were promised.  In the first week of November, when asked about the O&rsquo;Doherty review, the Taoiseach told the House: &ldquo;The review will be completed this week and a full report will be published by the end of November.&rdquo;  Today he told the House that the review has not been completed and he did not give any indication as to when the report would be published.  Is the report being withheld and, if so, why?  It was also reported today that Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty had never spoken to the consultant radiologist at Portlaoise who was sent on administrative leave when the controversy first broke.  As the Taoiseach failed to respond when asked about this today, I now ask the Minister for Health and Children to respond to five specific <Col N="743"/>questions when she speaks in this debate.  Has the O&rsquo;Doherty review been completed?  Has the report been submitted to the HSE and the Department?  When will the report be published?  Did Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty speak to the consultant radiologist during the course of her inquiry?  Finally &mdash; this is a question about which I have some concerns, as there is a lot of confusion &mdash; was Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty initially assigned to cover ultrasounds and equipment as well as mammographies?  That is what the Minister said initially.  The impression given now is that she was not covering anything except mammography.  We need clarity on this.</P>
        <P>After listening to the Taoiseach today I am more confused than ever.  When Deputy Gilmore asked whether Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty was aware of the fact that Mr. Naughton was doing these reports, the Taoiseach replied that from listening to colleagues, he assumed Mr. Naughton was trying to be sure to be sure.  Is that the way to restore confidence?  Why exactly was Mr. Naughton looking at the ultrasounds?  Was it to do with the O&rsquo;Doherty report or was it something he took on himself?  This is the type of thing that causes confusion and concern among the public.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept that although money could never compensate the women who turned up for screening, were misdiagnosed and subsequently had to undergo surgery, women who find themselves in this situation are likely to be entitled to financial compensation &mdash; probably significant compensation &mdash; from the State?  Has she sought confirmation of this from the Attorney General?</P>
        <P>This has been one of the blackest chapters in the recent history of our public health service, made all the worse by the failure of those in political office to accept their responsibility for the pain, suffering and trauma caused to patients.  The reality, as Deputy Gilmore said in the Chamber earlier today, is that the Minister has lost the confidence of the public.  She has lost the confidence of those who work in the health service and she has most certainly lost the confidence of those women who put their trust in our health service and who have been so badly let down.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach seemed on the verge of taking a courageous step today by agreeing to have a free vote on this motion tomorrow, before rapidly backing off.  He knows as well as I do that if he allowed a free vote the Minister would be clearing out her desk in Hawkins House on Thursday morning.  We will not have a free vote, but I still hope there will be some in the ranks of the Independents or on the Fianna F&aacute;il back benches, who have been happy to engage in whispered criticisms of the Minister, Deputy Harney, in the corridors of Leinster House, who will have the courage of their convictions and do the right and honourable thing by supporting the Labour Party <Col N="744"/>motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan for moving this motion.</P>
        <P>The former US President Harry S. Truman had a sign on his desk which read &ldquo;The buck stops here&rdquo;.  This Government seems intent on ignoring that old-fashioned idea of accountability.  The buck stops anywhere but with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children.  The shameful goings-on in our cancer services are probably the greatest scandal to face the health services since the blood contamination crisis.  What we know now points to systemic failures, not just isolated mistakes of administration.  Systemic failure must be the responsibility of the Minister and the Government of the day.  These failures are ultimately life-threatening and life-shortening for a significant number of women, as was the case in the blood contamination crisis.</P>
        <P>All the advice that women are given to reduce their chances of dying from breast cancer involves mass screening, early diagnosis and prompt treatment.  The women in Portlaoise and the women in Cork University Hospital did what they were advised to do and are now in some cases left in an unbearable situation.  They placed their trust and confidence in the HSE, in the health services and in the Minister for Health and Children.  The failure to diagnose them properly will undoubtedly lead to much physical and emotional suffering and pain for the women and their families.</P>
        <P>First Portlaoise, now Cork University Hospital, where up to 16 women may have been misdiagnosed.  This prompts the question.  Is what is happening in Portlaoise and Cork simply the tip of an iceberg?  Is there systemic failure in the health services?  Given what we now know, is it adequate that the HSE should be investigating itself?  If one looks back at comparable situations such as the contaminated blood scandal, it was only when there was a full independent examination that the truths and complexities of the situation began to emerge.</P>
        <P>The key questions now are as follows.  Who knew what, when and how did they respond?  Were at-risk women left to wait an unnecessarily long time?  Why did 97 women, the Minister for Health and Children and Professor Brendan Drumm find out that all was not well only in a question and answer session in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children on Thursday morning last?</P>
        <P>On 29 August 29 the HSE informed the Department of Health and Children and the Minister that it had ceased the provision of breast radiology services at Portlaoise, placed a consultant radiologist on leave and set up a review of all breast radiology diagnoses at the hospital from November 2003 to August 2007.  This review is to be carried out by Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty and is due <Col N="745"/>at the end of this month, but we still do not have it.  It appears that the HSE, in early September, had asked the local surgeon to review the clinical notes of patients who had ultrasound procedures.  Therefore, there were two reviews being carried out independently of each other, but apparently unknown to the Minister and the chief executive of the HSE.</P>
        <P>The HSE was developed as a flagship model of a centralised health service.  In designing this creature, the Minister confined her role, by choice, to policy, openings and speeches.  Like Napoleon, she made provision for an army of administrators who would know everything about the system at any one time, but the sad reality of her creation is that the Minister is now out of touch and the HSE is out of control.</P>
        <P>How many staff does it take to change a light bulb in a hospital?  That is a fair question.  How many Ministers and Ministers of State in the Department for Health does it take to address a crisis?  She and her team of four junior Ministers cost the taxpayer in excess of &euro;2 million a year, while the senior executives in the HSE also earn high salaries.  It begs the question, are they worth the wages that the taxpayer is paying?</P>
        <P>In this tangled mess, three elements stand out: first, the Minister&rsquo;s ideologically-driven desire to have a full for-profit health care industry in this country; second, the role of special interests, corporates and investors seeking the lucrative tax breaks and contracts arising from the Minister&rsquo;s initiatives such as co-located private hospitals; third, the loss of morale among frontline workers such as doctors and nurses who are becoming increasingly alienated from a Minister and a management that appears weighed down by incompetence and over-administration.  There is now a toxic mix at the top of the health service &mdash; arrogance, notions of impregnability and exhaustion as one crisis follows another.</P>
        <P>The worry used to be that staff in hospitals were not washing their hands.  Now we see the Minister washing her hands and refusing to take responsibility for the crisis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I was a member of what is now deemed an old-fashioned system, the old health boards.  Old-fashioned as the system was, as members we could hold both the consultants and the administrators to account, and the people could come directly to us, as public representatives, and tell us their concerns.  In came a new broom, deciding to get rid of these old tired administrations and put in place a new executive <Col N="746"/>and a new model.  The only aspect removed from the old health board system was the democratic voice.  The then chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board still works in the HSE, I believe as an information technology manager.  The only aspect missing is the voice of the people.  That, to me, was ideological.  I do not have a difficulty with ideology &mdash; I myself hold one &mdash; but that was the ideology of the right.  The Minister takes a health service and decides to put it at arm&rsquo;s length, then it goes beyond her grasp and, ultimately, out of her control.</P>
        <P>There is no one who can tell the story of what happened to these women better than themselves and we listen to them day on day on the television.  First, there is the awful dread of going to the clinic because the doctor suggests it or because one has found something.  Some get the relief of being told everything is fine, but all of a sudden they are plunged back in again.  I do not believe they will ever recover confidence.  There will always be that nagging doubt.  Was the first test correct, was the second test correct or will there be another test?  That is really the position in which we find ourselves.  Once a matter is out of one&rsquo;s control it is difficult to get it back.</P>
        <P>It was not just cancer services for women that prompted the tabling of this motion, even though that was the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back.  I want to read to the House a letter I received which I read only on Sunday night.  Despite the late hour, I rang the man concerned because I was so horrified by what I read.  I will skip over most of the detail because I do not want to identify anyone.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis about 18/19 years ago.  My consultant neurologist is . . . (CUH) [in Cork].</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">My most recent appointment with . . . [my consultant] was on 1st August 2007 at which time it was decided to change my medication . . . [The medication I was on was] . . . self-administered whilst . . . [this new medication would have to be] administered in the Day Procedures Ward (DPW) at CUH on a monthly cycle.  I was informed that it would necessitate foregoing all other treatments for a period of 8 to 10 weeks before commencing the new treatment.  I was prepared to go without medication for the stated period.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">For the last number of years I have been self injecting every second day and the progression of the disease has been slowish.  I am hopeful that the administration of . . . [the new treatment] will slow it even more.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I expected to start the . . . [new] regime in late September or early October.  It didn&rsquo;t happen.  I asked when the treatment was scheduled to start and I was told that a backlog had developed and no schedule was yet forthcoming.  This was further exacerbated by the fact that the Day Procedures Ward was closed <Col N="747"/>for the school&rsquo;s mid-term break.  Why a busy hospital ward should close to coincide with school holidays is beyond me.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Other treatments require administration on a regular basis, be they weekly, bi-weekly or monthly.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It seems it is now this man&rsquo;s fate that his new treatment will not start until the end of January.  At that stage he will be 26 weeks without treatment, all because they cannot get the day procedures ward to open.  That ward will close again entirely for two weeks at Christmas to coincide with holidays.  All he asks is. . . . . .</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">. . . a fair chance to maintain a reasonable quality of life, to maintain my independence, to continue working productively and not be a burden on my family or the state.  The &lsquo;fear factor&rsquo; is taking hold of my life; every stumble or fall, every pain or ache and every time I don&rsquo;t feel quite right bring doubts rushing into my mind as to whether this progressive disease is progressing and no one is helping me to stop it.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There are two responsibilities in this area.  One is political and the other is in respect of people earning large salaries to deliver a service to the people, but no one is living up to these responsibilities.</P>

        <P LI="1" FLI="0">has no confidence in the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The motion of no confidence we are debating has been made necessary by the extraordinary revelation at the Joint Committee on Health and Chil<Col N="748"/>dren meeting last Thursday that 97 women in the midlands needed to be recalled after their ultrasound scans were reviewed.  &ldquo;Appalling&rdquo; is the only word to describe the plight of those 97 women who heard the news through the media.  They heard it that way because it was revealed for the first time in a public presentation by a HSE official at the committee.  Subsequently, we had the most extraordinary situation where both the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the chief executive of the HSE, Professor Brendan Drumm, stated that the public presentation was the first they had heard about the review of the ultrasound scans.</P>
        <P>There is no public confidence in the Minister or the policy and management of health services by this Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party-Progressive Democrats Government.  The scandalous situation in the midlands, which has seen women misdiagnosed after cancer screening and then treated deplorably by the HSE, demands that Deputies of all parties hold the Minister and the Cabinet accountable.  Each Deputy has the opportunity at the vote tomorrow night to show where he or she stands on the crisis in cancer services and the shambles that is the health system presided over by this Minister, Taoiseach and Cabinet.  The Minister and her colleagues in the Cabinet are responsible for the fundamentally flawed policies and gross mismanagement that has led to such situations.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have had more than a decade to deliver the world class health service they promised.  Instead, they have maintained a two-tier system riddled with inefficiency and inequity.</P>
        <P>In countless written replies to D&aacute;il questions, the Minister stated that the funding, management and delivery of health and personal social services are the responsibility of the HSE.  It could not be clearer.  Between them, the Minister&rsquo;s Department and the HSE have failed miserably in terms of the effective and targeted funding, the proper management and the patient-centred delivery of cancer services.  In the case of diagnostic services for women in the midlands, the failure has been catastrophic.</P>
        <P>The crisis is not confined to the midlands.  Questions have been raised about other hospitals and professionals.  Thousands upon thousands of women are being put through emotional turmoil as a result.  It is not confined to the 3,000 whose mammograms were reviewed in the midlands.  Thankfully, the majority have been given the all clear, but these women were put through an unnecessary ordeal and others may face the same as the dysfunction in diagnostic cancer services is unravelled.</P>
        <P>When the D&aacute;il debated the cancer services crisis on 7 November, I highlighted the concerns of the Well Woman organisation over the ongoing outsourcing of smear tests for cervical <Col N="749"/>cancer to the United States for analysis and the absence of any clear information as to what cytology laboratories will be used to underpin the national cervical screening programme from January 2008.  I want to flag that issue again because I did not get adequate answers from the Minister when she replied to the debate.  I hope that further grief and tragedy are not being stored up for the future with the approach taken to this vital area of women&rsquo;s health.</P>
        <P>Speaking in the debate to which I have referred, the Minister stated that patient safety should come first.  We are in total agreement.  She stated patient safety should come before hospitals, constituencies and the professions. That is also correct.  It has been and must be the priority for us all.  The difference is that the Minister has been in the responsible position for a long time.  She cannot shirk her responsibility or that of her Department or the HSE for this situation.  The HSE is charged with maintaining standards and managing the health services.  This crisis in diagnostic cancer services should never have arisen in the first place and a shadow has been cast over those services for all women.</P>
        <P>Let it not be forgotten that the issue here is not confined to the competence of health professionals or the suitability of our cancer care infrastructure and its location.  This is also about access to services and how our grossly inequitable two-tier health system affects access.  The late Susie Long, as a public patient, was denied speedy access to a diagnostic procedure that, if received in time, could have detected her cancer and saved her life.  That courageous woman took the decision to highlight her plight nationally, not to seek personal redress for herself and her family but to expose the apartheid in our health services.  This apartheid saw patients with access to private care being diagnosed in time, while Susie&rsquo;s diagnosis was too late.  How many more Susie Longs have there been?  How many in the area of cancer care alone?  How many in other areas of care where there are two waiting lists and two parallel systems, public and private?</P>
        <P>It is deeply ironic that Professor Tom Keane, the new interim director of the national cancer control programme, should have come from British Columbia in Canada.  As one eminent commentator on the Irish health services has stated: &ldquo;Canada has a strongly egalitarian, one-tier system of health care, which delivers results; life expectancy in Canada exceeds the EU average by over a year for women and nearly two years for men.&rdquo;  That system is in total contrast to the two-tier system that exists in this State.  As the Irish Congress of Trade Unions states in its study, How Ireland Cares: &ldquo;The existing State subsidies and tax incentives and the existing organisation of the health care system subsidise private care and discriminate against those who depend on the public system.&rdquo;</P><Col N="750"/>
        <P>The Minister is reported to have complained to an RTE executive about the number of times leading oncologist Professor John Crown was appearing on the station.  This was in the days before he was dropped from a &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; panel.  Far more interesting than the row about the television programme was what Professor Crown himself had been saying.  In a recent interview in <i>An Phoblacht</i>,<i> </i>he was asked what he considered the greatest single deficiency in the health service.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The single biggest deficiency is inequity.  It is deliberately engineered.  We have a two-tier system because the people running it want a two-tier system.  The number of people availing of the public system will decline.  The number of people going private is getting bigger.</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />expresses its sympathy and regret to the women who were patients at the Midland Regional Hospital at Portlaoise and their families, who were affected by errors of misdiagnosis and miscommunication;</P><Col N="751"/>

       <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />expresses its confidence in the efficiency and high quality of the work carried out in the review of mammograms and at the special clinic at Portlaoise by leading clinicians, supported by specialist nurses and other health service staff;</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />acknowledges the leadership shown by the Minister for Health and Children in setting a clear direction in the National Strategy for Cancer Control for the development of quality assured cancer control services as the best way of ensuring that the risk of such events is minimised in the future; and</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />supports the Minister for Health and Children in her commitment to ensuring equitable access to high quality cancer services for patients throughout the country;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">in particular, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann acknowledges:</P>

      <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the significant progress made to date by the HSE in reorganising breast cancer services in order to comply with the National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease, including the recent decision by the HSE to cease breast cancer services at a number of hospitals with very low case volumes;</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I do not want to be side-tracked by some statements made by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, except to say that no such conversation took place with an RTE executive.</P>
        <P>If no confidence motions and political rows could solve our health service problems, we would have the most perfect system in the world.  The former health boards would be renowned all over the world, with other countries rushing to put such a model in place.  The reality, however, is that politics in recent years has bedevilled health care policy.</P>
        <P>I have had the privilege of being elected to the House on nine occasions by the people of west Dublin.  On nine separate occasions, they have placed their confidence in me, a confidence I take seriously.  The faith and trust they place in me is not just an issue now but an issue for me every day.  On four occasions I have had the privilege of being appointed to Government and received the confidence of the House, a privilege I take seriously.  It is a great honour and I defend the decisions of the Government as a loyal colleague should.  If I could not do that, I would not stay in the Government.  If any action of mine compromised patient care, led to a misdiagnosis and delayed treatment for a patient, the Opposition would not have to put down a motion of no confidence.  It simply would not arise.</P>
        <P>The issue of cancer care and health care reform is as fundamental to our society today as resolving the Northern Ireland problem was for many years.  I am not naive and seeking a <i>carte blanche</i> on the health care issue but I invite the leaders of the Opposition to consider a bipartisan approach on cancer services.  Our citizens deserve that we do that.</P>

I want in particular to apologise to the nine women whose treatment was delayed as a result of misdiagnoses.  I want to apologise to those women, who last Thursday first heard on the airwaves that there was an issue relating to ultrasound diagnosis.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, I said I would not quit and walk off the stage, and tonight I will tell the House why.</P>
        <P>Since I became Minister for Health and Children, putting patients first is important to me.  When introducing new legislation on medical practitioners, Ireland was the first country to put a lay majority on the fitness to practise committee.  In seeking that I faced huge vested interests from within the House and outside it.  I was asked why were we doing it first before any other country but I am happy other countries are now following suit.</P>
        <P>We introduced a provision for public hearings on fitness to practise committee meetings.  Why?  It was done to put patients first.  Lay majorities have been appointed to the councils for health and social care professionals and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland that governs the pharmacy profession.  The same will be done with An Bord Altranais.</P>
        <P>A redress scheme for the victims of Dr. Neary, whose files disappeared, and who have no opportunity to vindicate their rights in the courts was introduced.  What a great pity there was no review of the activities in the maternity unit of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, for 25 years.  Blaming me for what happened in Portlaoise is like blaming the 13 health Ministers who presided when those activities were going on in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In appointments I have made, I have sought to put patient advocates on various boards.  Jane O&rsquo;Brien from Positive Action was appointed to the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>

        <P>I have established a Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance, chaired by Dr. Deirdre Madden, to advise me on what policies and legislation are needed to further protect patients.  We need to accredit and licence the provision of private health care facilities.  All these have been done with one concern in mind &mdash; patient safety.  When it came to the siting of the new national children&rsquo;s hospital, I backed a single location even though a hospital in my constituency was adversely affected.  As Deputy Tuffy will testify, I faced a vicious and anonymous political campaign on that matter during the general election.  I single out her and Deputy Curran for dissociating themselves from the viciousness of that campaign.  I am not an ideological fool or politically naive.  I have made these decisions for one reason &mdash; patient safety.</P>
        <P>I first became aware of the issues at Portlaoise Hospital on 29 August.  I was informed the HSE had suspended the mammography service at the hospital.  I commend the director of nursing at the hospital who wrote an important letter on the matter on 15 August.  Had she not done so, it would still be going on.  I salute her courage.  We need more people like her in our health system, like the two midwives in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda who were very courageous in the Neary case.</P>

	<P>After 29 August, when I was informed of a review to be carried out by Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty.  She reviewed clinical evidence of 3,027 mammograms.  Up to 2,000 of those women also had an ultrasound but she was reviewing the mammograms.  As the House <Col N="755"/>knows, she completed her review and submitted it to the HSE last Friday.  The HSE has sought legal advice on the matter.</P>
        <P>Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty was not reviewing professionals but clinically reviewing mammograms.  She found nine cancers from the mammograms reviewed.  As Mr. Hill said yesterday, she and her team did in a couple of weeks what would normally take a couple of years.  I compliment her on this.</P>
        <P>I have not seen her report.  Deputy Reilly has contacted my office on this but I am not entitled to see the report.  It must be cleared by lawyers before it proceeds.  There are large issues with reports of that kind.  Her job was a clinical review of the mammograms.  As a result, nine patients were diagnosed with cancer.</P>
        <P>On 7 November, I apologised in the House when we had a full debate and I answered questions for one hour.  Last week, I answered questions on the same matter in the Seanad.</P>

	<P>On ten separate occasions, we were on to the HSE about the review.  Last Wednesday during Question Time, although no oral question was going to arise on Portlaoise Hospital, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan tabled a question about the appointment of Professor Keane.  I assumed the Deputy would ask a supplementary question, which she did, and I wanted the latest information.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was informed nine cancers had been diagnosed &mdash; seven originally and then two more &mdash; and all women had been seen, the last one on Wednesday morning.  In good faith I gave this information to the House.  When my officials were on to the HSE, they were informed about the ultrasound review.  They did not know what this meant and neither did I.  All Wednesday evening I sought to get information from the HSE.  I had my deputy medical officer and the Secretary General involved but we were not in a position to give any information last Wednesday.  The first time I heard that Dr. Naughton had commissioned a report in respect of approximately 567 ultrasounds was last Wednesday evening.</P>

	<P>In response to Deputy Burton, as I understand it, Dr. Naughton decided to undertake this review but he informed the HSE locally.  It was aware at regional level and I am not trying to say it was not.  I was not aware.  My Department was not aware, despite being in contact with the HSE on ten different occasions about this matter.  Neither the head of the HSE <Col N="757"/>nor the head of the hospitals office was aware of it.  I was as shocked as anybody else at the committee meeting last Thursday morning when the details of this matter were revealed.  I was quite surprised that almost two hours had elapsed before it was raised.  That is the fact.  That is being honest.</P>
        <P>I went from that committee meeting to a meeting I had convened of 20 senior breast specialists with Professors Keane and Drumm.  I had organised this meeting several weeks ago because Professor Keane was coming to Ireland and I thought it would be a good idea to enter into dialogue with key clinicians about the implementation of our new strategy.  At every chance I got at that meeting, I sought to put in place a solution to what had emerged at the committee meeting.  I asked the HSE to telephone people, to visit people.  I spoke to Mr. Hill, who said he would go on Saturday to see the people.  I was working on all of that last Thursday afternoon and that is a fact.</P>
        <P>When I was coming home from that meeting later that night I had the privilege of listening to Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan on &ldquo;Newstalk&rdquo; &mdash; I have a recording of the programme here.  She said the Minister should not resign, that would be completely the wrong focus, and that we have to focus on the women concerned.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to deal with Portlaoise.  In 1996 a Fine Gael Minister, Deputy Noonan, presided over a cancer strategy which designated Tullamore as the centre of excellence for the midlands.  The health board was asked to appoint a regional medical director to oversee the <Col N="758"/>implementation of the strategy and Dr. Donal Hollywood was appointed.</P>
        <P>In 1998 a meeting of the health board took place at which it overturned his recommendation to appoint a medical oncologist and a haematologist to Tullamore hospital, with sessions in Mullingar and Portlaoise.  The health board said it wanted the haematologist in Mullingar and the medical oncologist in Portlaoise.  The members of the health board came with a deputation to the Minister, who at that stage was Deputy Cowen, and the National Cancer Forum was involved.  The medical director and everyone else said it was the wrong strategy.  The health board reversed the decision in favour of Tullamore.  Then Deputy Charles Flanagan applied for a High Court injunction which was dismissed on the basis that it was futile.  These are the people who tell me they want centres of excellence but when we seek to put one in place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>That is what happened.</P>
        <P>I want to address the parties opposite because I have heard a lot about cancer care.  On 30 January last the Labour Party and Fine Gael published their blueprint for health, the &lsquo;Mullingar accord&rsquo; with 12 priority points, to great fanfare and so on.  Was cancer No. 1, No. 2 or No. 3?  No.  Was it even No. 12?  No.  Not even a cursory mention of cancer care appeared in the 12 priorities of their blueprint.</P>

	<P>This illness will affect one third of our population.  That is the reality.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy the Government promised at the time of the last election was the one it promised for the preceding six years and has not delivered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We now have a strategy that Professor Keane has described as being among the best in the world.  He has said so to me and to many others and I understand that this evening he said it on television.  The authorities in British Columbia said the same and they have one of the best organised cancer care systems in the world, which I have visited.  Professor Keane spearheaded the implementation of that strategy and thankfully they have seconded him to help us implement our strategy.  I salute those who have been involved in the strategy, many clinicians, my officials who are modestly here, people from the <Col N="760"/>Irish Cancer Society, from Europa Donna and many of the patient groups that have a significant interest in this area.  According to a world renowned clinician who has come to oversee the implementation of our cancer control programme we have among the best strategies he has seen in the world.</P>
        <P>We must, however, move from strategy to implementation.  Strategy will not guarantee success to patients.  If it is not being too dramatic, I want to be able to look any patient I meet in the eye, anywhere in the country, woman or man, from urban or rural areas, and to say to them we are putting in place a cancer programme that will deliver to them the best possible outcome, the best chances of survival.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will bring the Minister to meet a few of them tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Why would anybody go with something different?  There are 250 evidence-based clinical reports from clinicians around the world to the effect that one&rsquo;s chances improve 20%.  That means that one in five people would die if not treated in a centre that can deal with volume and quality and have all the sub-specialists working as part of clinical teams. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister needs to tell the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, about that.</P>

	<P>Doctors differ and patients die.  </P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Minister should tell her Minister of State.  We will support her. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what specialist centres are all about.  It is not about centres of excellence.  Every hospital in Ireland should be a centre of excellence. <b></b>This is about specialist centres where key specialists work together as part of a team diagnosing cancer and, where surgery is necessary, performing that surgery. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>

	<P>We have established a Health Service Executive to implement Government policy on health care, to be responsible for the delivery of services.  I did not dream up the HSE one day.

	<P>The board of the HSE is appointed by the Government and me and it is accountable to me.  I have asked the chairman of the HSE to carry out a full inquiry relating to these matters, particularly the subject of how patients were managed from the time the HSE became aware of the issues surrounding the situation in Portlaoise.

	<P>I ask Deputy Shatter to allow the Minister to finish her contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The board of the HSE is made up of honest people, many of whom work in the public sector, some of whom come from the private sector, all of whom give a huge amount of time to their tasks.  Mr. Michael McLoone comes from Donegal and the poor man has been subjected to terrible criticism for missing meetings due to personal issues.  Notwithstanding the fact that the organisation is three years old, there are, of course, issues to be addressed and I acknowledge this, as would Professor Drumm, the board members or any objective person.  There has never before been a change process programme on this scale in Ireland, in the public sector or private sector, so of course there will be issues, teething problems and difficulties relating to vested interests and people who do not want change.</P>
        <P>Earlier this evening I was accused, once more, regarding my ideology.  I said at the outset that I am elected by the ordinary women and men of west Dublin who work in the public and private sectors.  I do not think there is a stockbroker, barrister or property developer among them.  I am not here to represent the rich as they can always look after themselves.  My ideology supports innovation, finding solutions and getting rid of obsolete practices.</P>

	<P>What about co-location?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fine example because co-location is widely available in all of our public hospitals.  Nearly half of the patients in the hospital in my constituency last year were private.  They were housed in a public hospital funded and staffed by taxpayers and I want to change the fact that some patients are treated on a preferential basis.  This is at the heart of the review of the consultants&rsquo; contract because we wish to ensure the public hospital system is accessible on the basis of medical need and no other basis.</P>
        <P>I have been asked to resign but quitting is a shortcut to failure and I do not accept failure.  One should not run away simply because the going is tough; one must stay the course.  I invite Deputy Kenny, who has joined us, to take the kind of approach to cancer care that we did to the issue of Northern Ireland.  I am not requesting a <i>carte blanche</i> on all areas of the health service but ask only that we apply this approach to cancer care.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do remember because on this day 22 years ago I voted in favour of it, but we have all moved on a long way since then.</P>
        <P>I may not be objective in this matter but I reject the motion of no confidence in me.  Patients come first, the cancer plan will be implemented and I will fully support Professor Keane and the team he assembles.  I guarantee that I will leave no stone unturned when working day in and day out to ensure the plan becomes a reality sooner rather than later.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been a Member of this House only for five or six months and the Minister&rsquo;s performance is the best I have seen from any Minister to date.  Today is the first time I have seen raw emotion and the first time I have seen the Minister speaking without notes for quite a while.  </P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not speak during the Deputy&rsquo;s speech and ask that the same courtesy be extended to me.</P>
        <P>I have a question for Dr. Devins and those on the other side of the House.  Why is it only when <Col N="764"/>the Minister&rsquo;s job is on the line that we see this emotion, devotion and talk of patient-centred care?  This Minister talks the talk but she does not walk the walk.  She provides over a health system that runs from crisis to crisis, is dysfunctional and fails the people of Ireland who pay for it.  Yesterday she talked tough about not going off the pitch and she has done the same thing again tonight.  We expected no less.  If anything has become clear in recent months, in Portlaoise and elsewhere, it is that talking a good game is not enough and it is no match for ministerial action.</P>
        <P>The Minister has described herself as having responded speedily, quickly and thoroughly but on 2 November she released a statement that the review phase of the radiology breast diagnosis would be completed within a week.  It took 18 more days and only on 20 November, when the Minister, Deputy Harney, was preparing for parliamentary questions, was she finally given the results of the review and the terrible news that two more women had been misdiagnosed and that the total number of women who now had cancer was nine.  Like the Minister, I wish those women well and a speedy and full recovery.</P>
        <P>I do not know how the Minister can describe her actions as speedy, quick and thorough.  On 7 November, during D&aacute;il statements on the Portlaoise situation, the Minister said that Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty had been asked to look at all mammograms, ultrasounds and anything else relevant.  However, she says it was not until 22 November, at the Joint Committee on Health and Children, that she realised a review of ultrasounds was taking place.  How speedy, quick and thorough was that?</P>
        <P>On 7 November, during the same D&aacute;il debate the Minister said the last thing one could accuse Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty of was not being independent.  Yet, on 22 November, at the Joint Committee on Health and Children, the Minister said she became aware two weeks previously that she was on the interview board.  How can somebody who was on the interview board that appointed a consultant on administrative leave, and who may have expressed reservations about the competence of the consultant, not have a potential conflict of interest or be deemed to be an independent arbitrator in this case?  This is hardly speedy, quick and thorough action.</P>
        <P>The Minister has a serious credibility problem.  She came to her Department three years ago with a strong reputation as an achiever, and nobody will deny her past achievements, but today is not about reputations.  Today is about the health of a nation and how the State, through the Department of Health and Children that is run by the Minister, and the HSE deliver health care.  The Minister designed the HSE with her Cabinet colleagues and implemented it in the Health Bill on 23 November 2004.</P>
        <P>In January this year the Minister said there would be no cutbacks in the health service but in September she introduced them.  She said patients <Col N="765"/>would come first and that they would not be affected by the cutbacks, but operations were cancelled throughout the country.  The Orthopaedic Hospital in Navan was closed and the Minister and HSE made a feeble attempt to suggest only six people would be affected in a unit that carries out 180 operations per month.  At least 150 operations were cancelled.  The Minister suggested cutbacks would not affect patient care, but home care packages were removed &mdash; one from a disabled child suffering from Down&rsquo;s syndrome and cystic fibrosis.  The Minister took home help from the elderly and 22,000 bed days were lost in Beaumont Hospital last year, not because of late discharges on Saturdays and Sundays but because beds in the community were not availed of.  Those 22,000 bed days are the equivalent of having two wards, each containing 30 beds, closed for a full year.</P>
        <P>In 2004 the Minister promised to tackle the crisis in accident and emergency departments through a &euro;70 million ten-point plan but over a year later the number of people on trolleys had doubled.  The Minister declared the crisis in accident and emergency departments a national emergency.  The reality facing pensioners and seriously ill patients every day involves long delays in overcrowded accident and emergency departments where they lie in fear of contracting methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, MRSA.  This is quite a record for the Minister to be proud of &mdash; she should hang her head in shame.  This Minister cannot provide dignified care for our elderly loved ones in Irish hospitals after ten years of unprecedented wealth.</P>
        <P>The Minister promised cervical screening would roll out on 1 January and I pointed out six weeks ago that this was most unlikely to happen.  There is only one accredited laboratory to read smears and some tests are being outsourced to the United States.  There is no attempt to build up resources and services in the State.  Sending smears to the United States will lead to further problems because it increases the likelihood of errors of interpretation on this side of the Atlantic.  The Minister has made no arrangements with family clinics and GPs to take smear tests.  It is no wonder the promised cervical screening programme is now delayed until March 2008.  Can this be achieved, given the lack of preparation?</P>
        <P>Women continue to await the roll-out of the BreastCheck programme, which was promised many years ago but has been subject to forever moving deadlines.  The Minister promised centres of excellence for cancer care by 2011.  However, following statements by Professor Drumm that they could not be delivered until 2015, through public private partnerships, she panicked and announced they would be ready by 2010.  Has anybody asked Professor Keane whether he closed down existing services in British Columbia before opening new services?  I doubt very much that he did.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="766"/>

	<P>He did the two together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister promised these wonderful centres of excellence some time in the future while simultaneously stripping existing services with immediate effect in 13 hospitals throughout the State.  These cutbacks involved a reduction in breast cancer services in Galway from five days to three days per week, despite its being one of the designated regional centres of excellence which was to serve the same people from whom the existing services were stripped.  This is a classic case of the Minister promising excellence tomorrow while taking away the services that deliver today.  We are promised a nirvana that will never be reached.</P>
        <P>The Minister denied she knew anything about the problem at Barrington&rsquo;s Hospital until the summer of 2007, but letters were passing back and forth between her Department and the HSE from January 2006.  The Minister did not know about this, however, because she was otherwise engaged.  Likewise, she denied knowing until August about the problems with the radiology service in Portlaoise, but a letter highlighting the difficulty was sent to her in July 2005.</P>

	<P>I heard what the Minister said on this issue and what John O&rsquo;Brien of the national hospitals office said.  The letter was passed on to the HSE, which passed it on to the network manager, who in turn passed it to the hospital manager.  That is the account I received from Mr. O&rsquo;Brien at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children last week.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The letter was passed on to the hospital manager, who interviewed the consultant concerned, Dr. Naughton.  Once it was established that no operations had taken place, that was the end of the matter.  The substantive issue in the letter &mdash; that the radiology service in Portlaoise was shambolic &mdash; was never addressed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>At last Thursday&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, the Minister said it made no difference because it had been dealt with in a thorough and robust fashion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a clinical review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister&rsquo;s idea of thoroughness and robustness results in what has been the blackest day in the health service for 25 years, I suggest, on that point alone, that she should leave now and not come back.  That type of robustness and thoroughness will be the death knell for many people if it is allowed to be repeated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The worst aspect of Thursday&rsquo;s meeting was the crystallisation it offered of what health care under the Minister&rsquo;s stewardship means.  Nearly 600 women&rsquo;s files were reviewed and, as I understand it, the 97 that were identified were handed over to HSE officialdom for the women concerned to be contacted.  Somebody made a decision on the Minister&rsquo;s watch to let these files pile up in a heap to be dealt with when he or she was good and ready, instead of identifying and contacting the women immediately.  Even without an ounce of ethics, compassion or humanity, good logistics would dictate that these women should have been brought in as soon the problem was identified.  Instead, they were all brought together into a health service that is labouring under cutbacks introduced by the Minister and cannot cope.</P>
        <P>The worst aspect of this is the attitude it conveys.  Women were effectively told that, yes, they may have a cancer in their breasts, that this was known to the HSE since September, but that no action was taken until November when those in control were good and ready &mdash; when the cohort and job lot were filled up and the box car was ready to move out of the station.  Loyalty to the system has taken precedence on the Minister&rsquo;s watch over duty of care to the patient.  It is a despicable, Orwellian concept and it has come about through the Minister&rsquo;s blinkered ideology.  It is an ideology that seeks to undermine the public health service and drive people into private <Col N="768"/>insurance so that more private hospitals can be built on private land.  What we will have then is profit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Reilly has interests in private health care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, I did not interrupt the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>He should declare his interest in private nursing homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Reilly is entitled to be heard in silence just as the Minister was.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the best the Minister can do?  I have declared my interest.  Will the Minister declare hers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Reilly has interests in nursing homes, I do not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister&rsquo;s interest in her survival or in the care of patients?  She wants us to head down the route of the United States where 50 million people have no health insurance.  According to Michael Moore&rsquo;s docudrama, <i>Sicko,</i> 18,000 people die there every year because they cannot access medical care.  The Minister may not admit it but many on the Government benches recognise that if profit becomes the bottom line in private hospitals, patient care will take second place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Reilly is involved in private nursing homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>People forget that the old private hospitals were run by voluntary agencies, mainly religious, and were not for profit.  The Minister has demonstrated that she is disengaged.</P>
        <P>How much time do I have left a Cheann Comhairle?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>That is good.  Where was I?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Reilly was attacking me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Reilly without interruption.  The Deputy should address his remarks through the Chair so as to avoid some of the argy-bargy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not attacking the Minister but rather her policy and her professionalism.  She has taken no proper responsibility in her Ministry for accountability and transparency.  There is no accountability on the other side of <Col N="769"/>the House.  We have a Taoiseach who does not take responsibility for his own affairs and does not hold his Ministers to account.  Is it any wonder that this percolates through the system?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has clearly demonstrated that she is disengaged and has no appetite for taking responsibility.  She talks the talk but does not walk the walk.  She tried to mislead the D&aacute;il in regard to her actions and lack of action.  She tried to mislead the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in regard to the inquiry at Portlaoise General Hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to withdraw those remarks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I know Deputy Reilly is not long in this House, but that is a serious allegation.  I will not accept it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister allowed the Taoiseach to tell this House that the first she knew of the issue at Portlaoise was in August 2007.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister received a letter regarding the problems at Portlaoise in 2005.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ask the Irish people to make up their mind on that, not the Minister or those who follow her sycophantically on this issue.  She has supported them and they will support her.</P>
        <P>Why did the Minister not know about the ultrasounds?  Did she not read her own terms of reference?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have explained that there was a clinical review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an issue regarding the independence of the doctor the Minister appointed to read mammograms.  Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty is a person of impeccable clinical ability and is held in high regard.  I have no difficulty with that whatsoever.  However, the Taoiseach told this House that she would review everything, that staff, equipment and quality assurance issues would form part of her report.  How could Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty report on staff when she was a member of the interview board that appointed the member of staff whose work was in question?  My understanding is that Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty may have expressed concerns about this person&rsquo;s suitability, given her lack of experi<Col N="770"/>ence in mammography.  If Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty exonerates her, people will point to the fact that it was Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty who appointed her.  If she finds against this person, the latter could say that Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty was biased against her from the beginning.  The Minister has placed Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty in an invidious position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>A moment ago the Deputy said Dr. O&rsquo;Doherty was a person of impeccable credibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this the first contribution to this issue by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, even though Portlaoise is in his own constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make my contribution to the debate tomorrow.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach stood in this House and told us clearly that there would be triple assessment and pathology, but then he said it never happened.  Why did it not happen in the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s constituency?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask Deputy Charles Flanagan beside him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with that in a minute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past four months, details have been leaked about the concerns over the reading of pathology slides in Cork University Hospital, which reportedly resulted in at least 15 cases of misdiagnosis.  Some 15 patients were probably walking around with cancer as the relevant memo states there were signs of malignancy and signs suggestive of malignancy.</P>
        <P>This went on for four months while the HSE dithered and went into denial as it tried to figure out how best to limit damage to the HSE instead of focusing on the patients and their immediate need for treatment.  The Minister must have read reports in the <i>Daily Mail</i> for the past month and her press officer surely brought the matter to her attention in the daily briefings she receives.  To say she could be unaware of the issue beggars belief.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>All the patients were dealt with appropriately.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="771"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come to that in a moment.  Why has it taken four months to come to a conclusion with regard to the cancer patients in Cork University Hospital?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should be careful about believing everything he reads in any newspaper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The confusion remains.  As late as yesterday, the HSE stated that all patients had been seen by a specialist but numbers could not be released as more may need to be contacted.  Which is it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The review is not over.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Have all the patients been seen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows the review is not over.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us have clarity &mdash; the Taoiseach clarified this earlier.  The HIQA review is not complete and a previous review, carried out by Cork University Hospital, in the UK&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The pathology review is not over.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a memo across&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am clarifying that the review is not over.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>How can it be?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Reilly should continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>What it comes down to is that, even with the latest problems, nobody expects the Minister to read mammograms, to be responsible for clinical decisions or to watch every person who is employed, but we expect her to take charge.  When letters are written to her highlighting concern, the Minister should ensure they are looked after properly.  Thoroughness and robustness should be real rather than a figment of the Minister&rsquo;s imagination, resulting in the disaster that occurred in Portlaoise.  The manner in which women were treated arising from that is a further disaster.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated on the news on Thursday evening that the first she knew about the issue was on the previous night, Wednesday, in preparing for parliamentary questions.  As the parliamentary questions were taken on Wednesday, she must have known on Tuesday night, so what was that about?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not know on Tuesday.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="772"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>There were no parliamentary questions on health on Thursday.</P>
        <P>We are at a fork in the road.  Will we continue down the Minister&rsquo;s path, where we have been going for a number of years since she took over the Department?  This has created a health system rather than a health service and places loyalty to the service ahead of duty of care to the patient.  Alternatively, will we strike out on a new road where the reverse is the case and the patient would come first in all events, where we could capitalise on what we saw last Saturday, when doctors came from Dublin and nurses came from Portlaoise and the surrounding areas on their own time and secretaries gave up their free time, and patients were seen, letters were typed, signed and sent out? That is the way the health service should work.</P>
        <P>It is an awful shame, if she is taking credit for that, that it takes the Minister&rsquo;s job to be on the line for her to act.  That is not acceptable to this House or to me.  I ask the people on the far side of the House to ask themselves will they support this Minister and continue down this route or will they make the right decision?  Will they support this motion so they can go home and tell their wives, husbands, daughters, mothers and constituents that they made the right decision?  The Minister must go.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Well done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset I wish all the women who have unfortunately found themselves at the centre of this debacle well.  I hope those who have been diagnosed make a full recovery.  I cannot over-emphasise in the House tonight the hurt and betrayal felt by the women I have met in the past few months, who have found themselves victims of this appalling mess.  I share their anger and dismay at how they have been treated.</P>
        <P>I accept that the Minister, Deputy Harney, took on the health portfolio with idealism, determination and the best of intentions.  She gave a robust defence of her tenure in office tonight.  Nobody would deny that she is a great speaker and, whether she speaks about herself or her party, she always has a great knack in talking about taking the hard decisions, not being afraid to take on the vested interests and sorting out the health service, but it is just talk and the people saw through that talk in the general election in most instances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I have never denied that the Minister is a good politician.  She stated tonight, more or less, that she has been a great survivor in every election she has contested, but that does not make her a good Minister for Health and Children.</P><Col N="773"/>
        <P>In response to the comments of the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government in the past few weeks, I do not, nor would any sensible person, expect the Minister or the Taoiseach to sit at the bedsides of sick people, hold their hands and check over every medical decision made.  I expect the services set up by the Government, with the people who run them, to have the capabilities to ensure the correct decisions are made.</P>
        <P>Responsibility must be accepted by those within the HSE for this mess, but there must be political accountability as well.  If there is no political accountability in this instance, will there ever be a decision from the Government that demands political accountability?  Clearly there will not, and that does not bode well for what is supposed to be a democratic and civilised society.</P>
        <P>When the issue first arose in August, the women involved were given wrong and misleading information.  The HSE stated that there was no cause for concern and there was no expectation of any woman having a misdiagnosis or an inappropriate procedure.  A few months earlier, the same organisation indicated that the case of Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley would prove to be an isolated incident, but sadly that has not been the case.</P>
        <P>We now see the hollowness of those reassurances.  There has been a lack of coherence, urgency and care in the actions of the Minister and the HSE.  We were told women would be put first but the Minister, Deputy Harney, immediately passed the buck to the HSE, stating that it would carry out the essential task of providing the women with all the necessary treatment, services and counselling as a matter of urgency.  This did not happen, however.</P>
        <P>A review was ordered, the terms of reference of which we only discovered today.  There is an expectation it will be published this week, but the Minister has informed us it is now with the lawyers.  Why can a review not come to her with the full and unbridled truth?  Why does it have to go through lawyers?  If anyone is entitled to see the full review first, it is surely the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Publishing it may be a different matter but the Minister should see the full and truthful review.</P>
        <P>I spoke to many of the women involved in this issue who told me they are still not getting the best possible treatment.  One woman, who spoke to me at the weekend, received a letter from the HSE in October asking her to visit her doctor.  It was a very vague letter which did not state exactly <Col N="774"/>what was happening.  When she visited the doctor she was told she needed a mammogram.  She received no further contact, no counselling, no support and no information.  She had to contact St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital several times.  She was first told she would be seen in January, then she was told it would be December.  It was only when her doctor repeatedly contacted the hospital that she was given an appointment for last Thursday.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not even be able to deal with the allegation made against me in that time.</P>
        <P>The events that unfolded in Portlaoise in recent weeks have lifted the lid on what is a totally dysfunctional health service.  I will deal with the letter from Dr. Peter Naughton to the Minister, Deputy Harney, in 2005 warning of grave deficiencies in the services in Portlaoise.  The Minister admitted last week that she was not even aware of this two and a half year old letter until a couple of weeks ago.  How could such an oversight have emerged?  The Minister surrounded herself with political advisers at a cost of &euro;500,000 per year.  These are the people in the Department who decide what mail the Minister sees and what she does not see.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>They do not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is closeted and comforted by political advisers who have no regard for the health services or anything to do with it.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated that Dr. Peter Naughton is a highly respected consultant.  If the Minister for Health and Children cannot be bothered, or is denied an opportunity, to read his correspondence, what correspondence is read in the Department?  Whose letters does the Minister read if she does not read letters from consultant surgeons in Portlaoise warning her of the shambolic state of affairs in that hospital?</P>
        <P>The Minister has displayed a serious lack of judgment by surrounding herself with people who will not refer letters of a crucial nature to her, and pleading ignorance is no defence.  Her professed ignorance and lack of sufficient interest has shaken the faith of the entire nation in our health <Col N="775"/>services and has led to a nightmare for thousands of women throughout the country and hundreds of women in the midlands.</P>
        <P>In 2005, the Minister&rsquo;s office prevented her from reading correspondence and exercising the ministerial responsibility vested in her.  Worse, she has had the opportunity since August to show that she is a capable and competent Minister, but she has failed to take a hands-on approach.  Women were told they may have breast cancer in a curt letter from the HSE or on the lunchtime news.  For women in that position, every second is like an eternity, yet days passed before the Department or the HSE even opened a helpline.  The women were told last week they would be dealt with in Dublin but that was belatedly changed to Portlaoise.  One of the women described by the Minister as &ldquo;brave and courageous&rdquo; was told last week at the 11th hour that was no bed for her to undergo surgery in St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital.</P>
        <P>Three weeks ago in this House, I posed 12 questions to the Minister.  I told her in the morning I was putting the questions in early to allow her officials to give her the answers before the end of the debate.  If she had got those answers, or even read those questions, she would not have been in the position of ignorance she was in at the committee before Deputy Reilly last week.  The Minister&rsquo;s response to the situation in Portlaoise has been political, as exemplified by her response this evening.  She has argued that local interests prevented the so-called centres of excellence for cancer services from being built and singled me out in that criticism.  However, she stopped the clock in 2000.</P>

	<P>I will move the adjournment in a moment, and I beg the indulgence of the House to answer a political allegation that the Minister threw across the House to muddy the waters &mdash; she is a past master at doing so.  In 2002, Portlaoise hospital was designated a centre of excellence for symptomatic breast disease by then Minister for Health, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  That designation was approved by the Minister, Deputy Martin, and by the Government of which the Minister, Deputy Harney, was a member.  However, the hospital and the issue was starved from 2002 to 2005, and departmental records show that to be the case.</P>

Taking Portlaoise as a microcosm of the health service, it is clear the Minister has failed dismally to meet the demands of office.  The motion stands.  The people behind the Minister will say it in the corridors and the canteen, but let them say it in tomorrow&rsquo;s vote, that the game is up.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I was so interested in the health debate I forgot I was first to speak on the Adjournment.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for this opportunity to raise this important issue of the loss of 140 jobs in Clonmel, County Tipperary, last week after a difficult period for Bulmers.  I also ask what support has been given to Bulmers, what will be done for the workers involved, what other employment is planned for the town and the county and whether the IDA has any further developments to report.</P>
        <P>The cost-cutting programme includes the shedding of 140 full-time staff or about one fifth of the workforce in Clonmel, County Tipperary.  The company employs almost 900 staff worldwide, 600 of whom are based in Clonmel.  Before the latest layoffs in the last two weeks, Clonmel drinks company Bulmers had confirmed that more than half of the temporary jobs losses of last July were to become permanent.  Some 46 of the 70 temporary jobs losses announced by Bulmers in the summer are now permanent.  This is on top of the 140 job losses that were announced last week.</P>
        <P>Another disappointment that is going unexpressed is that the company was meant to be in the middle of a period of expansion.  Certain Deputies and candidates in the constituency during the last general election announced that this year the company would employ over 700.  Like the healthy economy the Government promised us, these jobs have gone belly-up.  This is a serious situation for a town such as Clonmel with an <Col N="777"/>indigenous industry such as Bulmers and I am concerned to see this in a company with the history in the constituency of Bulmers.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will deliver some positive news on Bulmers.  It has had a great impact on the economy of south Tipperary.  Since it went public, C&amp;C has prospered and I am concerned to see job losses at this rate.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House and addressing this important issue.  I hope he will deliver something positive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Tom Hayes for raising this matter.  I am aware of the situation in Clonmel and am concerned about the job losses at the company.  The company has experienced a reduction in sales in a key market in the United Kingdom, primarily due to the impact of bad weather during the summer and increased competition from its main competitors.  The company&rsquo;s sales in the UK are significantly below target.  The company considers that the redundancies are necessary to reduce its costs and bring them in line with a revised business plan devised to ensure the competitiveness of its brands.  Governments and Ministers cannot be held responsible for market trends.  I respect the company&rsquo;s decision, which is aimed to ensure the long-term viability of the company and to protect the remaining 460 jobs in Clonmel.</P>
        <P>Employment in the company increased rapidly from 330 people in 2004 to 600 employees this year, a dramatic increase by any standards.  As the Deputy said, the company was planning additional expansion but market trends have impacted on that plan.  The company has had to rein in its ambitions, regroup and move forward.  We wish the company ongoing success.</P>
        <P>While I am conscious of the effect any job losses will have on the workers involved and their families as well as on the local community, I assure any people affected that the State agencies will give every support they can to develop new employment opportunities.  Enterprise Ireland is in regular contact with the company and is discussing how the agency can be of assistance with its research and development programme.  To date, Enterprise Ireland has approved almost &euro;300,000 in funding under its research technology and innovation scheme for the company and the agency expects all of this funding to be drawn down.  The agency will continue to work very closely with the company during this challenging period.</P>
        <P>The role of F&Aacute;S is particularly important in assisting those people who will lose their jobs.  The agency has been in contact with the company and has offered its full range of services to support the employees.  I understand from F&Aacute;S that the company is currently reviewing the redundancy situation with its employees and their union representatives.  The company will contact <Col N="778"/>F&Aacute;S to avail of the services that have been outlined in initial discussions.</P>
        <P>When job losses happen, the Government, through the State development agencies and other interested parties, adopts a co-ordinated approach in dealing with the situation.  All work together in making the employees, who are initially the most affected and need immediate assistance, aware of the supports available to assist in finding new employment, starting their own businesses or participating in appropriate training programmes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The strategy of IDA Ireland for Clonmel and south Tipperary is to progress the development of a knowledge economy so that they can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment.  The agency also works with its existing client base to help them develop their businesses further.</P>
        <P>A substantial programme of activity is under way with existing overseas companies in the region.  The success of these activities is demonstrated by the presence of 11 IDA Ireland-supported companies in south Tipperary, employing approximately 2,500 people.  In marketing south Tipperary for new foreign direct investment, the agency is focused on attracting overseas companies in the services and knowledge-based industries, including advanced manufacturing.  Recent successes in attracting foreign direct investment include Cordis and Alza in Cashel.</P>
        <P>Cordis is expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2008.  The future development of the Ballingarrane estate in Clonmel, incorporating an IDA business park and the Tipperary institute, will be a key asset in the quest for further overseas investment in the county.  The key industry sector for south Tipperary is life sciences.  The largest employers are Abbott and Boston Scientific, followed by Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, Pinewood Laboratories and Clonmel Healthcare.  Abbott and Boston Scientific are companies of world-class calibre and reputation and it is very good that south Tipperary has the presence across the board of household names in FDI.  It is a very healthy situation from a foreign direct investment perspective.  Interestingly in today&rsquo;s announcement of 170 jobs in Carlow, mention was made of how successful the Clonmel plant was and is for Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme.  This fact was significant in the decision to locate another plant in the Carlow area.</P>
        <P>A significant number of Enterprise Ireland client companies in south Tipperary are actively developing their businesses.  Since 2006, Enterprise Ireland has made payments of more than &euro;1.5 million to its client companies in south Tipperary.</P>
        <P>According to figures for October 2007, the number of people on the live register in Clonmel is 849, an increase of 16 people on a year earlier.  However, the live register is not specifically designed to measure unemployment as it includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers.  Unem<Col N="779"/>ployment is measured by the quarterly national household survey, and the latest figure issued on 15 November for the south-east region, which is for the third quarter of 2007, is 4.8%.  This is a welcome reduction from the 5.8% recorded for the third quarter of 2006.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the State development agencies in Clonmel will continue to support investment and job creation in the area.  I want to reiterate that the State agencies will continue to work closely with each other, with local interests and with all the Deputies representing Tipperary South to facilitate an integrated approach to enterprise development in both Clonmel and south Tipperary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised this issue to highlight the worsening situation in Tralee and the surrounding area with the loss of 44 jobs at the Denny plant.  Just over a week ago the workers were told their jobs would be gone from 31 January 2008.  It is not just those 44 jobs that will be lost.  I am reliably informed that a further eight jobs in the office will follow.  In addition, hauliers and part-time workers will lose their jobs.  These losses need to be viewed with further Denny losses of 20 jobs in May and 25 jobs in June, resulting in the loss of almost 100 jobs in one small plant in Tralee.  Denny is one of the longest-standing businesses in the town and is a very significant loss, not just to the workers but also to the wider community.</P>
        <P>These losses come on top of job losses at other companies based in the town, including Glen Dimplex, Tralee Beef and Lamb, and Klopman in recent years.  This has added to an already serious unemployment problem.  There are now 1,300 people out of work in Tralee which has an unemployment rate of 14.2% &mdash; the second highest in the State for a town of its size.  Apart from those who have no jobs, there is the growing problem of under-employment, casual employment and part-time employment, often at very low wages.  There are almost a further 2,000 people in that position bringing the total signing on the live register to 3,286.  That means that almost 40% of the total workforce in Tralee are either fully or partially unemployed.  Where, it has to be asked, are the benefits of the Celtic tiger to the south west?  They are certainly nowhere to be seen in the town of Tralee.</P>
        <P>The unemployment rate in Tralee has hardly changed in the past 11 years.  In 1996, unemployment in Tralee town was 15.3%.  It is now<?oasys _jy ?>14.2%, an improvement of a mere 1.1%.  Tralee has not seen any benefit from the overall economic gains of recent years.  Without doubt one of the key reasons has been the failure to promote the town properly as the centre for investment.  On a number of occasions I have asked successive Ministers, including the present Minister for Health and Children when she was Minister for <Col N="780"/>Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to state how many companies have been targeted by IDA Ireland for Tralee.  I was told it was a manufacturing and technology town.  However, on each occasion the Ministers avoided the question.  It is my understanding that IDA Ireland has been instructed not to go into the south west.  When I met representatives of IDA Ireland, they told me they were told to promote the area within a 50-mile radius of Dublin where the infrastructure is suitable.</P>
        <P>While Tralee has an educated workforce along with Kerry Technology Park and the Institute of Technology, it has not been exploited for the benefit of the people of the south west.  Without a proactive approach by the Government towards addressing that disadvantage for Tralee and north Kerry, this will continue to be the case.  North Kerry in general has suffered.  Listowel has lost three businesses in recent years and it is now proposed to close the ESB facility in Tarbert.  These losses, along with what is happening in Tralee, highlight the lack of commitment of successive Ministers to proactively create jobs in Kerry in general and Tralee in particular.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the situation.  Given that 14.2% of the workforce in the town is unemployed, it should be top of the Government&rsquo;s agenda to reverse that unemployment rate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The Kerry Group has indicated that it will shortly cut 50 jobs at its Henry Denny plant in Tralee.  The Kerry Group took over the Denny plant in 1982.  It ceased slaughtering pigs in the early 1990s and since then it has engaged in meat processing.  I understand from the company that the reason for this move is that demand for the type of primary cuts that were traditionally manufactured at the Tralee plant has declined and therefore the operation there is no longer viable.  Consumers have switched to a preference for convenience foods and ready meals.  Nevertheless, 30 jobs will remain in place in Tralee where bacon curing will continue to be the main activity.</P>
        <P>Decisions of this nature are entirely a matter for management of the company and we have no involvement in decisions regarding the location or nature of commercial activities.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food maintains a veterinary presence at the Denny plant for the purpose of monitoring compliance with hygiene legislation.</P>
        <P>The Irish meat processing industry is in a robust state notwithstanding that this is a very competitive business.  The sector has shown the degree of innovation and consumer focus needed for success in the global food market.  The export of processed products, prepared meals, etc., is making a valuable contribution to export earnings.  It is creating significant employment and, importantly, is adding value to our primary agricultural output.</P><Col N="781"/>
        <P>Last week, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, launched the 2007 edition of Quality Food Founded on Science, which features the projects funded under the food institutional research measure, FIRM.  Investment in knowledge and innovation is critical to the continued success of the agrifood sector and the Government has steadily increased the funding available for research.  We believe that the concerted efforts of the research community, the food industry and the State will position the sector to meet the ever-evolving demands of the international consumer.</P>
        <P>The pig sector is an important element of the food processing industry.  The main current concern for pig producers is the erosion of profit margins due to the very high cost of feeding stuffs.  The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has in recent times, worked with her EU colleagues, both at Council and bilaterally, to put in place steps aimed at improving the situation and ameliorating some of the difficulties being caused by the increased cost of inputs.  These steps include a suspension of the obligation to set aside 10% of arable land.  The European Commission is also examining ways of synchronising the authorisation process for genetically modified feedstuffs in the EU and the US to try to improve the efficiency of these arrangements.</P>
        <P>We will continue to pursue appropriate measures aimed at addressing current income difficulties.  A scheme of financial assistance for the private storage of pigmeat was put in place in recent weeks.  This was adopted by the European Commission in response to a request from Ireland and some other member states.  We have also impressed on the Commission the desirability of export refunds for fresh and frozen pigmeat.  A proposal in this context will be discussed at this Thursday&rsquo;s meeting of the EU pigmeat management committee.</P>
        <P>The question of compliance with legislation on the protection of the environment is an area of major importance for the future of the pig sector.  It will have significant cost implications and will give rise to operational complexities for producers.  We have established the intensive livestock group to help the pig and poultry sectors to find solutions to manure disposal problems arising from the nitrates regulations.  The work of this group is continuing.</P>
        <P>The case highlighted by Deputy Ferris relates to consumer affairs.  Pigmeat features prominently in Bord Bia&rsquo;s programme of promotion on the home and export markets.  I have asked the board to intensify its national pork and bacon promotion campaign and additional funding is being made available to that end.  Bord Bia&rsquo;s quality assurance schemes help to maintain consumer confidence.  The pigmeat scheme is well established and managed.</P>
        <P>On exports, Bord Bia&rsquo;s marketing initiatives and overseas promotion drives relate, <i>inter alia</i>, to pigmeat.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food maintains an extensive scheme of <Col N="782"/>controls in respect of the hygienic production of pigmeat and the operational procedures which are required to underpin the certification of pigmeat for markets worldwide.</P>
        <P>We are working with the Minister for Health and Children on the introduction of legislation to provide better information to consumers on the origin of pigmeat and other meats.  The process of public consultation on the proposed regulations has been completed and the comments received are being examined.  The draft legislation will be notified to the European Commission thereafter.</P>
        <P>Other relevant support actions on the part of the Department include the extension of the farm waste management scheme to the pig sector, the development of the programme of financial assistance for the transition to welfare-friendly sow housing and the continuation of the programmes for the monitoring and control of animal diseases.  I will continue to work closely with the food industry to develop and implement measures which will ensure that the Irish agri-food sector continues to make an important contribution to the national economy and export earnings.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, is aware, Ballintemple national school on Crab Lane in Cork is full and therefore unable to cope with the increasing demand for school places within the parish.  It is in the unenviable position of being unable to offer junior infant places to nine families from the parish for 2008.  Furthermore, the 2009 and 2010 junior infant classes are greatly over-subscribed by families from within the parish.  The school is not in a position to cater for the additional demand which will undoubtedly arise when the Elderwood and Belview Abbey developments, both of which are within the parish boundaries, have been completed.  It is baffling that so much development was allowed to take place in the immediate vicinity of the school without any provision being made for the education of the children living in the houses in question.  I would like that to be clarified on the Adjournment this evening.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State is probably aware, the SMA Fathers have donated a 1.5 acre site to the school, free of charge, to solve this problem.  The Department of Education and Science has assessed the site, which is situated behind the SMA church on the Blackrock Road, and deemed it suitable for the construction of a 12-teacher school for the parish of Ballintemple.  I am concerned that progress in appointing a design team has been slow, however, especially as the project needs to be advanced as a matter of urgency.  I share the view of the school&rsquo;s board of management and the parents who are sending their children to the school that the generous <Col N="783"/>donation of this valuable site should give the Department enough impetus to engage in a more realistic way with the development of the school and to make progress with this scheme.</P>
        <P>I would like to pick up on two points which were made in the reply I received from the Minister when I tabled a parliamentary question on this issue.  The Minister argued that the school should proceed with the acquisition of the site that has been offered to it by the SMA Fathers.  That is not an issue, however, because the site to be acquired will be given to the school free of charge.  The Minister informed me that the building project that is required will be considered in the context of the multi-annual schools building and modernisation programme.  I would like to emphasise that there are no acquisition difficulties and that there is a clear and demonstrable need for a new school building to be developed.  There are no obstacles to the completion of the acquisition of the school site.</P>
        <P>The sole outstanding issue relates to whether the capital grant for the construction of the school will be provided for in this year&rsquo;s budget.  Is it in the budget or not?  What advice can the Minister for Education and Science give the school authorities about the Crab Lane school?  When does she envisage that the school will be ready to enrol additional pupils, which is something to which she alluded in her response to my parliamentary question?  Is a timeframe in place for the opening of the new school?  Will the school be built by conventional public tender, rather than by means of public private partnership?</P>
        <P>I accept that the Standing Orders of the House can be quite rigid.  However, I have deliberately not used the five minutes available to me so that I will have time to respond to the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.  I hope she will facilitate my wish to organise the debate in this manner, in the interests of getting conclusive information to help the school to make progress with this project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Lynch for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to outline the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and to clarify the position regarding the provision of a new school at Ballintemple national school on Crab Lane in Cork city.</P>
        <P>The modernisation of facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of underinvestment in this area and the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Since the Government took office, it has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of school buildings and to ensure that <Col N="784"/>appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  As evidence of this commitment, &euro;540 million is being spent on school building and modernisation projects this year, in primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  Some &euro;3 billion has been invested in school buildings since 1997 to deliver over 7,800 school building projects.  The further investment of &euro;540 million will build on these achievements and focus on providing school accommodation in areas where the population is growing at a rapid rate.  As further evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment in this area, funding of approximately &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools under the national development plan over the coming years.  I am sure the Deputy agrees that this record level of investment is a positive testament to the high priority the Government attaches to ensuring that school accommodation is of the highest standard possible.  Responsibility for smaller projects has been devolved to school level to reduce red tape and allow projects to move faster.  Standard designs have been developed for eight-classroom and 16-classroom schools to facilitate speedier delivery of projects and to save on design fees.  The design and build method is used to expedite delivery when the use of standard designs is not possible.  Taken together with the unprecedented level of funding available, these initiatives ensure that building projects are delivered in the fastest timeframe possible.</P>
        <P>Ballintemple national school is a co-educational primary school with an enrolment of 211 pupils as at September 2007.  Enrolments at the school have increased by 14% over the last five years.  The school has a current staffing of a principal, eight mainstream class teachers and two permanent learning support and resource teachers.  The school has submitted an application to the Department of Education and Science for capital funding towards the provision of a new school.  The long-term staffing figure on which accommodation needs will be based has been determined and notified to the school authority.  It has been agreed that appropriate accommodation should be provided to cater for a long-term projected staffing of principal and 12 mainstream assistants, as well as for appropriate ancillary accommodation.  The school authorities were advised in September 2007 that the proposed site for the new school building was suitable for the construction of a new 12-classroom school and they could proceed with its acquisition from the SMA Fathers.  While I take Deputy Lynch&rsquo;s point about the acquisition of the site being a formality, it is obvious that certain legal documentation, etc, will have to be drawn up to make the land transfer official.  Perhaps that is the issue at stake.  This building project will be considered in the context of the multi-annual schools building and modernisation programme.  I thank Deputy Lynch again for raising this matter and allowing me to outline the progress being made under the <Col N="785"/>building and modernisation programme and the position in relation to the provision for a new school building at Ballintemple in Cork city.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office for giving me an opportunity to raise this issue, which is of great importance in my constituency, on behalf of the people of Kilfinane, the staff of Kilfinane national school and the current and future pupils of the school.  I have first-hand knowledge of the difficulties being experienced at the primary school, which I have visited on a number of occasions.  I have witnessed at first hand the difficulties being experienced.  The school was built in the 1800s and was modernised to some extent in 1907.  Since then it has served its purpose and has now outlived its usefulness.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>I have described the difficult conditions in the school which affect both pupils and staff.  In recent weeks, however, the principal has described a sinister incident which occurred in close proximity to the grounds of the primary school in Kilfinane.  A person was seen photographing pupils attending the nearby secondary school and when questioned by a passerby, made his escape through the grounds of the primary school.  This is a very worrying incident which is being investigated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I hope there will be a successful outcome to the investigation.  It is worrying in this day and age, both from the point of view of health and of safety, that pupils must go outside the confines of the school building to use outside toilets.</P>
        <P>In March 2005 I led a deputation to meet the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, to make her aware of the condition of Kilfinane school.  She immediately agreed that Kilfinane needed a new primary school.  The various stages for the building of the new school have  advanced through the years and it was hoped that this year the tendering phase would be reached.  Unfortunately, this has not happened.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s word when she informed me recently that she has not yet agreed with the Minister for Finance her departmental <Col N="786"/>estimate for next year&rsquo;s building programme.  I expect she will have an estimate for the building programme.  I appeal to her to allow Kilfinane advance to the tendering stage because it is a thriving town in south-east County Limerick with new houses coming on stream.  A new school is needed both for the current and future pupils.  I ask the Minister to give the green light for the next stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Cregan for sharing his time with me.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>We are very concerned about some of the activity around Kilfinane school.  It is also of concern that the school has outside toilets and that the children must cross the school yard, out of the view of the teachers, to use the toilets.  Some worrying activity has recently taken place in the vicinity of the toilets.</P>
        <P>Firm commitments were made in 2002 by a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister that the school would be completed without delay.  Again in this election year, commitments were made and accepted.  A firm commitment was made that in January 2007 the school would be one of the 54 to proceed to tender within 12 months, that contractors were to be short listed and it would go to tender, and that construction would commence in January 2008.  Two weeks ago, information was received that no certainty existed in this regard and that funds might be diverted to rapidly growing urban areas.  This is a betrayal of children, teachers and parents.  It condemns them to continue in unacceptable conditions as I outlined on several occasions in this House between 2002 and 2004.  Children crossing a school yard in all weathers to use toilets that are not in view of the teachers is unbelievable and dangerous.  A school constructed in 1888 with some upgrading in 1909 is unsuitable for teaching requirements in 2007.  This has been accepted by the Department for the past ten years and the school should be built next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Deputy Neville that there is nothing in the response about funds being diverted.  I do not know from where this information has come; it may be a rumour.  </P>
        <P>I thank Deputies Cregan and Neville for raising the issue and for giving me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department&rsquo;s position regarding the provision of a new primary school at Kilfinane, County Limerick.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to build a new six-classroom school including a general purpose hall and ancillary accommodation on a new green field site.  The project is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning. The stage three submission, developed sketch scheme, has been recently approved and preparation of the stages <Col N="787"/>four and five documentation, detail design and bills of quantities, is currently underway.</P>
        <P>Under the national development plan, &euro;4.5 billion has been assigned to the capital requirements of the primary and post-primary sectors. More than &euro;540 million will be spent this year on school buildings. The level of construction alone in the primary and post-primary sectors in 2007 is such that it will deliver more than 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for around 17,500 pupils.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large-scale building projects from initial design stage through to construc<Col N="788"/>tion phase is considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme. The progression of Kilfinane primary school, as with all large-scale projects, will be considered in this context.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputies that the Department of Education and Science is committed to providing suitable high quality accommodation for Kilfinane at the earliest possible date.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65, 326 and 334 together.</P>
        <P>The EU Reform Treaty will be signed by Heads of State and Government, including the Taoiseach, on 13 December. The Treaty is expected to be ratified by each Member State before 1 January 2009. Member States will proceed with ratification under their respective constitutional provisions and in accordance with their own timetables.</P><Col N="790"/>
        <P>The Government has sought legal advice from the Attorney General on whether ratification of the EU Reform Treaty requires an amendment to the Constitution. While it is necessary to await this advice, I expect that the Irish people will have an opportunity to vote on the Treaty, probably in mid-2008.</P>
        <P>The Government will wish to consult fully with other parties on the Treaty throughout the ratification process. I have already written to all members of the Oireachtas providing them with a summary of the Treaty&rsquo;s provisions and we will shortly be in contact with party spokesmen to arrange for further consultations on the Treaty and its ratification.</P>
        <P>A referendum campaign will need to be preceded by an active information effort and an initial short explanatory pamphlet on the Treaty will be published next month. A dedicated website is being established shortly. In accordance with established procedures, a Referendum Commission will be created to inform the public about the Treaty and to encourage citizens to exercise their right to vote.</P>
        <P>As was the case with the previous EU referendum in 2002, the Referendum Commission will be properly resourced to enable it to carry out its role in an effective manner. In line with normal practice, the Government would intend to publish further material on the Reform Treaty in the early part of 2008, including a White Paper.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has primary responsibility for immigration policy and, in the EU context, these issues fall within the remit of the JHA Council. </P>
        <P>The recent decision by the Italian Government to introduce an emergency decree, which provides for immediate expulsion of EU citizens believed to constitute a threat to public security, has not been discussed by either Justice and Home Affairs or Foreign Affairs Ministers of the EU.</P>
        <P>EU nationals are entitled to free movement within the EU, as set out in Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (the Free Movement Directive). This Directive has been transposed into Irish Law by the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006.</P>
        <P>Rights to free movement within the EU are not absolute. For example, in Ireland, the Habitual Residence Condition restricts access to social welfare benefits for persons who have been here for less than 2 years. In addition, there are specific circumstances under which an EU citizen may be issued with an order to leave the State, or be excluded from entering the State for a specified period, for example, if the person refuses to comply with a requirement under Regulations relating to public policy, public security or public health.</P>
        <P>Where an EU citizen is removed from, or restricted from entering Ireland, this is done in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities Free Movement of Persons Regulations.</P>
        <P>The Italian Government have stated that their emergency decree is in accordance with EU Regulations and this has been accepted by the Commission.</P>

	<P>All members of the Rapid Response Corps are obliged before deployment to participate in an intensive training programme. Two training programmes were held during 2007. </P>
        <P>The training, which was designed especially for the Rapid Response Corps, is delivered in two parts over 6 days by the Kimmage Development Studies Centre (D-TALK) in Dublin and by the Defence Forces UN School (UNTSI) at the Curragh Camp.</P><Col N="792"/>
        <P>The D-TALK component covers issues such as working in humanitarian emergencies, humanitarian law, UN systems, UN humanitarian reform, civil/military cooperation, and medical and stress preparation. The Defence Forces address issues relating to personal security and communications in the field, as well as basic first aid.</P>
        <P>The training has been particularly well received by the participants and I am very grateful to D-TALK and UNTSI, and to the Department of Defence, for their assistance and cooperation to Irish Aid in designing and running the courses provided.</P>
        <P>All Rapid Response Corps members are required to undergo a medical check by medical practitioners expert in the field of travel health. Irish Aid has agreed with those medical practitioners that all Corps members are medically prepared, as far as it is possible to do so, for deployments anywhere in the world. Finally, all members must be deemed fit for duty by those practitioners before they will be considered for a deployment.</P>
        <P>There are also ongoing opportunities for members of the Corps to volunteer for training courses organised and delivered by our UN partners.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, C.J. Hambro was a distinguished Norwegian political leader in the earlier part of the last century. Mr. Hambro was a defender of the rights of small nations in an era when these rights were far from being guaranteed. His belief in the national rights of small nations led him to defend the cause of Irish independence and gave rise to his admiration for &Eacute;amon de Valera. </P>
        <P>I am aware of a recent initiative regarding a proposed commemoration of Mr. Hambro in Muckross House. While I would be willing to lend my support to such a proposal in view of Mr. Hambro&rsquo;s distinguished background, the issue of a commemorative memorial there is a matter for the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In this regard, I understand that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has recently been in contact with the interested party to indicate that they are not in a position to accede to such a <Col N="793"/>request, but have advised of alternative possibilities for commemorating Mr. Hambro.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 73 together. </P>
        <P>The Multi Annual Programme Scheme, (MAPS), is a funding scheme which has been established with a number of core NGOs with the aim of strengthening strategic and programmatic co-operation and providing a flexible and predictable funding framework. Five NGOs participated in MAPS &mdash; Christian Aid Ireland, Concern, Goal, Self Help Development International and Tr&oacute;caire.</P>
        <P>The objective of the MAPS I Scheme, 2003-2005 were:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To facilitate receipt by NGOs of Irish Aid funding in such a way as to promote flexibility within their own programme framework of visions and strategies, insofar as <Col N="794"/>these visions and strategies are in line with the Government&rsquo;s policy of development cooperation.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To permit NGOs with a proven capacity to act in a predictable and coherent framework insofar as funding from Irish Aid is concerned, thereby allowing longer-term relations to be established with partners in the South.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To enhance and strengthen dialogue and mutual learning between Irish Aid and the NGOs in matters relating to strategies, approaches and the adoption of best practices.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">An independent evaluation of the MAPS Scheme was conducted in 2005. The evaluation endorsed the Scheme as an effective mechanism for channelling funding to major Irish NGOs. A number of recommendations were made which have been incorporated into the second phase of the Scheme which will run from 2007-2011. The Evaluation of the Development Cooperation Ireland Multi-Annual Programme Scheme 2003-2005 is available at www.irishaid.gov.ie.</P>
        <P>The Guidelines to the MAPS II Programme provide that the amount of funding to be granted to each participating agency will be determined in accordance with:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Government&rsquo;s overall development cooperation budget and the allocation of funds between the various strands of the programme.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An analysis of the overall portfolio of funds of each participating agency, ensuring that Irish Aid&rsquo;s contribution is balanced by grants from other institutional donors and/or voluntary contribution.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />&lsquo;Liquidity ratio&rsquo; of 70:30 whereby participating agencies are expected to generate 30% of their total income in the form of voluntary funds raised in Ireland or demonstrate a capacity to do so incrementally over the period of MAPS II.</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The quality of the programme based on the MAPS Guidelines.</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The efficient use and value for money evident in the programme proposal.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">All of the MAPS II funding proposals were subjected to a rigorous appraisal and approval process by Irish Aid&rsquo;s Projects Appraisal and Evaluation Group which includes independent appraisal by external development specialists. In addition, a mid-term review of MAPS II will be undertaken to assess progress followed by an end of programme evaluation.  As required by the MAPS scheme, MAPS partners submit each year full audited accounts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The White Paper published in September last year sets out the key principles and priorities for the Irish Aid programme as it expands to meet the target of 0.7% of our gross national product allocated to overseas development assistance by 2012. </P>
        <P>The core objective of the Irish Aid programme is to tackle global poverty and exclusion. For this reason, the White Paper reaffirms that Africa will remain the principal focus for our assistance in the coming years. The number of our partner countries will increase from eight to ten. Malawi has been selected as our ninth partner country and a programme of development cooperation will begin there next year.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid will continue to prioritise sectors, such as health and education, which are central to the fight against poverty. The struggle against HIV and AIDS is particularly important and we allocated over &euro;100 million to this area and other communicable diseases last year. We also need to maintain our ability to respond quickly and effectively to humanitarian disasters, which disproportionately impact the most vulnerable members of society. The Rapid Response Initiative announced in the White Paper has already considerably improved our capacity to respond to these crises, wherever they occur. Other priority areas for the aid programme in future years include good governance, gender and the environment.</P>
        <P>Global development challenges require concerted international action. Ireland will play its part by building on our strong relationships with non-governmental organisations, multilateral institutions and global partnerships.</P>
        <P>NGOs and missionary organisations play a key role in responding to humanitarian disasters and also in longer-term development work. Our commitment to working in partnership with these organisations is as strong as ever. Last year alone Irish Aid provided over &euro;140 million to support the work of development NGOs.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid is increasing the level of assistance channelled through United Nations programmes and we are working to put framework agreements in place with UNICEF, the UNDP and the UNHCR. Support for UN agencies totalled &euro;63 million in 2006. It is crucial that development assistance is managed to the highest standards and Ireland will continue to be at the forefront of UN reform efforts and work to improve the effectiveness of overseas development assistance.</P>
        <P>The European Union is the largest development assistance donor in the world and Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to this effort through the European Development Fund is expected to reach &euro;206 million between 2008 and 2013. Ireland plays an <Col N="796"/>active role in shaping and monitoring EU expenditure on aid.</P>
        <P>We are also working with global initiatives, particularly in the areas of health and education, to deliver long-term change. Between 2002 and this year Irish Aid will have contributed &euro;80 million to the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria for example. This support has provided access for over 700,000 men, women and children to treatment and extended HIV prevention programmes and care services to many more.</P>
        <P>Our plans for the distribution of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development assistance are guided by the principles of partnership, transparency and effectiveness. The programme will continue to operate in an efficient, accountable and innovative way to meet its ultimate aim which is to respond to the needs the poorest and most marginalised people in the world.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the report from the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights to which the Deputy refers.</P>
        <P>The Mungiki came into existence in 1980 as a political grouping of members of the Kikuyu tribe, but over time has transformed into a criminal syndicate which is allegedly involved in extortion and may be responsible for several murders. It goes without saying that all police operations aimed at criminal activity of any kind should comply with Kenyan law and with international human rights standards, and any allegations of wrongdoing must be fully and energetically investigated.</P>
        <P>Preliminary investigations by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights suggest that, between June and October 2007, over 450 bodies of young men have been found which display evidence of their having been summarily executed. The very large number of killings of young men in Kenya during the period in question is a matter of concern, irrespective of who is responsible, and every effort needs to be made by the Kenyan authorities to bring the assailants to justice.</P>
        <P>Considering the seriousness of these allegations, European Union Heads of Mission in Nairobi will be pursuing the issue with the Kenyan Government. The European Union has regular political dialogue with Kenya in Nairobi under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, and governance and human rights issues are raised regularly in this context. Our Embassy in Tan<Col N="797"/>zania, which is responsible for Kenya, will also be following the issue closely and maintaining contact with EU Missions resident in Nairobi.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 79, 83, 105, 106 and 113 together. </P>
        <P>The situation in Pakistan was discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 19 November. My colleagues and I expressed our deep concern at developments in that country and again reiterated our call for the immediate lifting of emergency rule.</P>
        <P>Our position remains clear. The Government of Pakistan must take urgent action to restore the Constitution, follow up on its commitments on holding free and fair elections on schedule in <Col N="798"/>January, and ensure that the necessary conditions for this are put in place, and President Musharraf must honour his commitment to step down as Chief of Army Staff. At the same time we also call for the release of all political prisoners, including members of the judiciary, lawyers, journalists and human rights defenders; for reconciliation with the political opposition; and for the relaxation of media restrictions.</P>
        <P>This position, and the Government&rsquo;s deep concerns about the State of Emergency in Pakistan, the dismissal and arrest of members of the judiciary, the harassment and arrest of opposition figures, and the situation of lawyers and human rights defenders in Pakistan have been directly communicated to the Ambassador of Pakistan in Dublin. This also included the Governments outrage at the arbitrary house arrest of Ms Asma Jahangir, UN Special Rapporteur on the Freedom of Religion or Belief and Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, a Pakistani citizen. I understand that an arrest warrant has also been issued in respect of her sister, Ms Hina Jilani, Special Representative to the UN Secretary General on Human Rights Defenders. I would again implore Pakistan to reconsider its actions, by cancelling the arrest warrants issued against human rights defenders and by releasing those human rights defenders already detained.</P>
        <P>Along with our EU partners, the Government will be keeping the situation in Pakistan under close review and will do all possible to encourage the reinstatement of the Constitution, the holding of free and fair elections, and the earliest possible return to democratic, civilian rule.</P>
        <P>In this context, the EU is continuing to look at the possibility of sending an observation mission for the elections in Pakistan. This would clearly depend on the necessary conditions being in place, but would be something that Ireland would see as valuable and would fully support. Should the mission proceed, Ireland would certainly look at contributing observers. However, if emergency rule is not lifted in advance of the elections, it is difficult to see in those circumstances how the elections could possibly be regarded as free and fair by the international community. I believe that the reinstatement of an independent judiciary would also play an important role in ensuring the validity of any elections.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 308 together. </P>
        <P>I visited Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo during 6-9 November for a series of meetings with senior political figures.</P>
        <P>While in Bosnia and Herzegovina, I met with Foreign Minister Alkalaj and Prime Minister Spiric. Discussions focused on recent political developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the country&rsquo;s relations with the EU, regional issues including Serbia and Kosovo, and questions of bilateral interest. I also visited Srebrenica, where I met with Mayor Malkic, and visited the cemetery and Memorial at Potocari, laying a wreath in honour of those who died in the massacre of July 1995. In my contacts, I underlined Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for Mr. Miroslav Lajcak, who serves as both the international community&rsquo;s High Representative and the European Union&rsquo;s Special Representative, and his introduction of measures aimed at improving the functionality of the State and compliance with the provisions of the Dayton Agreement. I also expressed our support for the European perspective of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and urged all political parties to work together for progress on police reform to help ensure that this can become a reality.</P>
        <P>In Serbia, I met with President Tadic, Prime Minister Kostunica, Deputy Kosovo Minister Alender, and State Secretary Bogojevic. Discussions focused primarily on the Kosovo status question, EU-Serbia relations, regional issues and bilateral questions of interest. During these talks, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s support for Serbia&rsquo;s European perspective and urged the Government there to ensure full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which will clear the way for signature of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union.</P>
        <P>In Kosovo, I met with President Sedjiu, Prime Minister Ceku, and other leading political figures from the Serb and Albanian communities. Meetings also took place with the Head of the UN Mission (UNMIK), Mr. Ruecker and with KFOR Commander, General de Marnhac. In all cases, discussions focused on the political and security situation in Kosovo, in view of ongoing attempts to resolve the issue of Kosovo&rsquo;s final status. The trip to Kosovo concluded with a visit to the Irish KFOR contingent at Camp Ville. I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the excellent work of our Defence Forces personnel in Kosovo, who are playing a vitally important role in a complex and sensitive environment.</P>
        <P>In my discussions with politicians in Kosovo and Serbia, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for the efforts of the international Troika, which is facilitating the talks between Belgrade and Pristina on the question of Kosovo&rsquo;s final status, and urged both parties to take a constructive approach to try to find an agreed solution to this difficult and sensitive issue.</P>

        <Quest> if he is satisfied that the right of return is being respected in relation to the Serb, Roma, Croat or Gorani communities to return to Kosovo; if such a return is being assisted in practice by the international forces, KFOR and the UN; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Along with our partners in the EU, Ireland&rsquo;s position on the Kosovo final status issue has been that a final settlement must provide for a multi-ethnic, secure and democratic Kosovo, consistent with EU values and standards and contributing to the stability of the region. The EU has consistently highlighted the protection of minorities, and the right to return of refugees and internally displaced persons, as key priorities in this context. </P>
        <P>The Contact Group&rsquo;s Guiding Principles for a settlement of Kosovo&rsquo;s status in 2005 also highlighted that any future settlement should provide effective constitutional guarantees and appropriate mechanisms to ensure the implementation of human rights for all citizens in Kosovo and of the rights of members of all Kosovo communities, including the right of refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes in safety.</P>
        <P>As part of the gradual transfer of competences from the interim UN Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) to the Provisional Institutions of Self Government (PISG), provided for under UN Security Council Resolution 1244, most of the functional responsibilities for voluntary returns have now been assumed by the PISG, primarily the Ministry of Community and Return (MCR). However, UNMIK continues to provide assistance and guidance to the MCR as appropriate. In a report dated 28 September last, UNMIK noted that although there have been noticeable improvements in the conditions for returns, such as greater acceptance of the returnees by the receiving communities and an increasing capacity of municipalities to directly implement elements of the returns projects, the main factors affecting returns continue to be lack of economic opportunities and inadequate funding for approved return projects, as well as persisting perceptions of insecurity. It also noted in this context that the number of voluntary minority returns to Kosovo continued to be low.</P>
        <P>The Report adds that during the course of 2007, six projects to support organised returns by 140 families, with a total budget of &euro;3.7 million, have been launched. The MCR, in consultation with the international community, has approved 47 Community Development and Stabilization projects worth &euro;2.08 million to facilitate the equitable integration of all communities and their members currently residing in Kosovo.</P><Col N="801"/>
        <P>The return to Roma Mahala is one of the biggest return projects in Kosovo and involves UNMIK, the OSCE, the UNHCR, and the municipality of Mitrovica. The Government, through Irish Aid, has funded this project to the amount of &euro;250,000. The return of 24 families to their original place of residence on 16 October marked the end of the first phase of the project. At a local level, KFOR has also been involved in the development of facilities for Roma, with members of the Irish Defence Forces contingent in Kosovo contributing to the construction of a Roma education centre in the Serb municipality of Gracanica.</P>
        <P>The Government believes that a comprehensive policy on the right to return must form an integral part of any final status settlement for Kosovo. In this context, I note that the Ahtisaari final status proposal, which Ireland has supported, includes detailed provisions on the rights of refugees and internally displaced persons, and stresses that they shall have the right to return and reclaim their property and personal possessions in accordance with domestic and international law. Irrespective of the outcome of the final status process, I believe that such provisions should be integrated into Kosovo&rsquo;s future legal framework. I therefore urge the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government to intensify their efforts in cooperation with international organisations in Kosovo to achieve, in parallel with the status process, concrete and rapid progress on these important issues.</P>

        <Quest> the research programme proposed for Irish Aid in the coming year; and if such a programme includes research on technology transfer, good governance, or strategies for indigenous development. </Quest>

	<P>The high quality of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is recognised internationally. In ensuring that Irish assistance is of the highest quality, Irish Aid recognises the importance of research in order to ensure that decisions are informed by a strong evidence base. In the coming year, Irish Aid will continue to invest in practical research, through a variety of partnerships and networks in a range of priority areas. </P>
        <P>For example one of the key priority areas outlined in the White Paper on Irish Aid is addressing the global HIV and AIDS pandemic. Irish Aid will continue to support investment into the research and development of new prevention technologies in pursuit of a cure for AIDS. Funding will be provided to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and the International Partnership for Microbicides. Both organisations are involved in clinical trials of new candidate vac<Col N="802"/>cines and microbicides leading to the potential for new products to prevent the spread of HIV.</P>
        <P>In 2008, Irish Aid will continue to support a range of operational research to evaluate the impact of global and country HIV initiatives it funds. One example is support for the Joint Learning Initiative on Children and HIV/AIDS which engages practitioners, policymakers, and scholars in collaborative problem-solving, research, and analysis to address the needs of children living in the context of HIV/AIDS.</P>
        <P>In order to address food insecurity and hunger, we will continue to support the network of agricultural research institutions known as CGIAR (the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research). The aim of this work is the production of pro-poor agricultural research that makes a difference in the food security status of the poorest people in the world.</P>
        <P>At country level, support will be provided for research prioritised by local and national partners that will contribute to indigenous solutions to addressing poverty. For example in Uganda we will provide support for a local NGO, Raising Voices, for research on effective community based interventions to prevent gender based violence.</P>
        <P>In South Africa, where challenges persist in delivering water and sanitation services to rural populations, Irish Aid plans to support a three year research programme through the Water Research Commission. The research will focus the development and transfer of technology for improved water quality, sustainable sanitation and franchising of water services.  Models developed through this research will have practical application in the Irish Aid water and sanitation programme in Limpopo Province.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid also supports research commissioned by the Advisory Board for Irish Aid (ABIA). In the coming year the Board will, inter alia, fund ongoing research in the areas of policy coherence, measuring the impact of aid, and good governance. A range of partners will be involved including Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin.</P>
        <P>The research on good governance arises from the growing concerns about the impact of governance on the delivery of aid. The research will focus on these issues both from the perspective of donors, including Irish Aid, and that of recipient governments.</P>
        <P>Research is an important tool in learning new and better ways of delivering aid more efficiently and effectively. In the development context it is essential that it is focused and practically oriented and can provide decision makers with the information to make better and more informed judgements. I believe that the research funded by Irish Aid scores very well on these criteria.</P>

	<P>The individual to whom the Deputy refers, a former member of the American Indian Movement, was convicted of the 1975 murder of two United States Federal Agents by the United States District Court in Fargo, Minneapolis in 1977. Mr. Peltier was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences, a sentence which has been upheld on numerous occasions by the US appellate courts. I am aware that, in December 1994 and again in February 1999, the European Parliament adopted resolutions calling for clemency for Mr. Peltier. </P>
        <P>The European Union holds bi-annual human rights consultations with the United States, during which both general principles and individual cases are discussed. The European Union raises individual cases of human rights violations with third countries in accordance with the European Union Guidelines on Human Rights; notably, the Guidelines on the Death Penalty, the Guidelines on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders. The case of Mr. Peltier is not considered to fall within any of these Guidelines.  The Council of Ministers has not discussed the case raised by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 99 together. </P>
        <P>Ireland is a long-standing and active proponent of the establishment of an independent Palestinian State. The Government has argued strongly within the EU and internationally that a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East is more urgently needed now than at any time in the past sixty years. It must be based on a nego<Col N="804"/>tiated two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</P>
        <P>There is now an opportunity to make progress by restoring credibility to the peace process. Political leaders from across the region are today in Annapolis for the important international meeting hosted by the US Administration. The EU has strongly supported the preparations for this meeting, and the courageous political dialogue between the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of the Palestinian Authority. It is important that these discussions result in meaningful and urgent final status negotiations. These will have to address the most sensitive issues in the conflict: borders, settlements, refugees, security, water and the status of Jerusalem. The launching of such a process will provide a new opportunity for a just and lasting regional settlement, building on the historic Arab Peace Initiative, which was reaffirmed at the Arab Summit in Riyadh earlier this year.</P>
        <P>I believe that, to be credible, a renewed political process must not only address the core issues of the conflict, it must be bolstered by action to improve the daily lives of the people most affected. The parties must implement their obligations under the Quartet Roadmap. This must involve an end to all violence in and from the Occupied Territories, a genuine freeze on the building of settlements and the lifting of checkpoints. Prisoner releases will also make a vital contribution to the reduction of tensions. The Government also believes that there must be an end to policies aimed at isolating the people of Gaza, and has called for the re-opening of crossing points for people and for goods.</P>
        <P>The EU will have a crucial role to play in the coming period, working directly with the parties and as an active member of the international Quartet. The EU has for long been the strongest supporter of the Palestinian people. Total EU assistance this year will amount to over &euro;800 million. Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral assistance will increase to over &euro;7 million. We will work for the success of the major international donors&rsquo; conference for Palestine which is scheduled to take place in Paris on 17 December. The aim will be to provide the necessary political and humanitarian support for the building of democratic institutions and a viable economy for the future Palestinian State.</P>

	<P>Ireland, together with our EU partners, remains seriously concerned at the grave and persistent human rights abuses and the lack of funda<Col N="805"/>mental freedoms in North Korea. Regrettably, while we avail of every opportunity to raise these issues, any meaningful dialogue on human rights with the North Korean authorities has so far proved impossible. </P>
        <P>North Korea maintains that there can be no progress on a human rights dialogue until the EU refrains from tabling resolutions against it at the United Nations. The EU has refused to accept any preconditions. Given the lack of any improvement in the human rights situation, the EU again tabled a resolution on North Korea at this year&rsquo;s General Assembly, which was adopted on 21 November 2007. Ireland fully supported this resolution.</P>
        <P>Following on from the breakthrough in the Six-Party Talks process in February, an EU delegation visited Pyongyang in March. Human rights issues have also been raised on a number of recent visits to North Korea by delegations from EU member states. During a visit to North Korea earlier this year, Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador, based in Seoul, accompanied by a senior official from Dublin, expressed our deep concern. Similar points were made at senior official level to the DPRK Ambassador when he visited from London earlier this year.</P>
        <P>We will continue, with our EU partners, through the UN and other relevant fora, to make clear our serious concerns about the human rights and humanitarian situation in North Korea.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs will decentralise to Limerick. In May 2007 an advance party comprising over 50 staff moved to Limerick. </P>
        <P>There are three categories of Specialists employed by Irish Aid: Principal Development Specialists, Senior Development Specialists, and Development Specialists.</P>
        <P>There are currently two Principal Development Specialists working in Irish Aid in Dublin. No <Col N="806"/>Principal Development Specialist has so far decentralised to Limerick.</P>
        <P>There are currently seven Senior Development Specialists serving with Irish Aid in Dublin and two serving in Limerick.  There are currently eight Development Specialists serving with Irish Aid in Dublin and two serving in Limerick.</P>
        <P>The development specialists perform an important role in the business of Irish Aid. The specialists work alongside diplomatic and general service staff, in close contact and co-operation with each business unit within the Division. There are a number of issues to be worked out with regard to the specialist posts which are scheduled to move. Discussions are on-going at a very senior level with representatives of the specialists, with their union IMPACT and with the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs in order to resolve the outstanding issues. Significant progress has been made and I hope that these discussions can be brought to a successful conclusion at an early date.</P>

	<P>At present, Ireland has a total of 86 Honorary Consuls and Honorary Consuls-General in some 57 countries who are available, as the need arises, to provide information. Their names and locations are contained in the list below. </P>
        <P>Contact details for each Honorary Consul are to be found on this Department&rsquo;s website www.dfa.ie. Honorary Consulates are generally open during office hours each day, in line with local practice. An after hours emergency service is provided by the Honorary Consulate or the nearest Irish Embassy.</P>
        <P>Our Honorary Consuls are not full-time officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs but are honorary appointees who undertake, in addition to their own occupations, to do invaluable work on behalf of Ireland. In particular, the dedicated and personal consular services that they provide to Irish citizens who find themselves in difficulty are greatly valued.</P><Col N="805"/>

	<P>Longstanding and close bilateral ties have characterised relations between Ireland and Argentina since resident diplomatic missions were opened in both Dublin and Buenos Aires in 1948. </P>
        <P>The close nature of our relations is evident in the number of high-level visits to Argentina in recent years. In 1995, former President Robinson paid a State visit to Argentina, while President McAleese paid a State visit in 2004. In 2001, the Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern T.D., made the first <Col N="810"/>official visit to Argentina. There have been Cabinet-level visits for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day events in 2005, 2006, and 2007.</P>
        <P>In March 2006, the L.E. Eithne visited Argentina and, on its return to Ireland, transported a statue of Admiral Brown, the Mayo-born founder of the Argentine navy. In September 2006, the Argentine Minister for Defence, Ms. Nilda Garr&eacute;, and the Chief of Staff of the Argentine Navy, Admiral Jorge Godoy, visited Dublin to participate in the unveiling ceremony for this statue, which took place in the presence of the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>In commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the death of Admiral Brown, a lengthy programme of events took place in Argentina from 1-9 March 2007. An Irish delegation led by Major General Dermot Earley, the then Deputy Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, and Commodore Frank Lynch, Flag Officer Commanding of the Naval Service, took part in the commemoration ceremonies. In the context of this anniversary, the Argentine Navy tall ship, the Fragata Libertad, visited Ireland for 10 days from 16 June to 26 June 2007, docking in Galway and Dublin.</P>
        <P>Consultations between senior officials of my Department and their Argentine counterparts <Col N="811"/>also take place on a regular basis, most recently in Dublin in May this year.</P>
        <P>Argentina has the largest population of Irish descent outside the English-speaking world, estimated at 400,000. In recognition of the close historical and cultural ties between Ireland and Argentina, on 7 August 2006, my Department announced first-time grants totalling &euro;42,000 to three Irish-Argentine associations. The Fahy Club received a grant of &euro;15,000, as did the Federation of Irish-Argentine Associations, while the Southern Cross newspaper received &euro;12,000.</P>
        <P>Trade relations between Ireland and Argentina are also strong, with total trade in 2006 amounting to approximately &euro;110 million.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the continuing close nature of the relationship between Ireland and Argentina and I would certainly wish to see the bilateral relationship develop further under the new administration of President-Elect Fern&aacute;ndez de Kirchner.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Reaching out to and strengthening links with our communities abroad, and with those of Irish ancestry, is a cornerstone of Government policy. The establishment and operation of the Irish Abroad Unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs has greatly enhanced our capacity to develop and implement long term policies aimed at building relations and providing practical and financial assistance to our Irish communities overseas. Officials in our diplomatic missions have been, and continue to be, extremely active in this regard and work closely with Irish community organisations across a wide range of important issues. </P>
        <P>The funding of community groups working with emigrants is an essential and positive element in strengthening our outreach to the wider &ldquo;Irish Family&rdquo; worldwide. The very substantial level of funding now available &mdash; over &euro;15 million in 2007 &mdash; to assist in the provision of services and support to vulnerable Irish, helps also to promote and sustain valuable community structures into the future.</P>
        <P>While the primary emphasis of Government funding continues to be directed at supporting frontline welfare services in Britain and the United States, I am pleased that the additional funding available in recent years has made it possible for me to broaden the range of projects and extend the geographic reach of our activity. In the past year, for example, I have been happy to approve funding for Irish community organis<Col N="812"/>ations in South Africa and Zimbabwe, and to support organisations who promote Irish heritage and cultural activities in Argentina, Mexico, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Government support for these projects represents an acknowledgement and appreciation of the role that generations of Irish, past and present, who have settled across the globe, have played in developments abroad and at home.</P>
        <P>In April of this year, I called for a national debate on our attitude to our Diaspora at a conference on this important subject which I hosted in Dublin Castle. The conference provided the opportunity to launch a review of our overall approach to our community across the globe and, where necessary, reshape our policies in this key area. In this regard, I provided support, including financial, for the US-Ireland Forum held in New York on 7-8 November, which included discussion of the relationship with our Diaspora.</P>
        <P>As we near the end of 2007, the plight of our undocumented citizens in the US continues to be of the utmost concern to the Government. The Government has been steadfast in its support for the undocumented. The Taoiseach and myself have used every possible opportunity to advocate on their behalf and will continue to do so in the future.</P>
        <P>Officers in the Irish Abroad Unit and at our Embassies and Consulates abroad help to keep our people abroad in touch with Ireland and with each other. They will continue to maintain very close and interactive contact with front-line organisations that support our community abroad. This helps to ensure that the Irish voluntary sector around the world has an effective channel of communication with the Government, and that everything possible gets done to advance the interests and well-being of our overseas communities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The White Paper on Irish Aid underlines that culture can contribute to public awareness and understanding of complex development issues and plays an important role in building stronger public appreciation for the diversity of the partner countries and societies within which Irish Aid works. </P>
        <P>Irish Aid strategies for improving the lives of people in developing countries are devised and delivered taking full account of local cultural factors. It is essential to have a thorough understanding and sensitivity to local traditions and customs in order to deliver effective development <Col N="813"/>assistance. Moreover, activities such as theatre and art can and are harnessed in the development programme to help convey important messages, notably in the areas of HIV/AIDS and gender-related issues.</P>
        <P>While support for explicitly cultural activities does not absorb the level of funds that go into other sectors, some support is provided directly. For instance, financial support is made available for events to mark Africa Day on 25 May to promote a more positive and comprehensive understanding of Africa in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid is concerned in its work to challenge negative images of Africa and to ensure that these are balanced by an understanding of the positives that Africa has to offer including in terms of history, culture and art. This diversity should be highlighted. In that respect development-related events with a cultural component will form an important part of the work of the Irish Aid Volunteering and Information Centre which will open on O&rsquo;Connell Street in Dublin early next year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My officials have provided information to the Department of Defence on the political and humanitarian situation in Chad, the Central African Republic and the wider region in the context of preparations for Irish involvement in EUFOR Tchad/RCA. I also briefed my Cabinet colleagues on the results of my visit to Sudan and Chad at the Government meeting on 20 November at which a decision was taken on an Irish contribution to EUFOR Tchad/RCA. For more information on my visit as well as details of the current situation in Chad and neighbouring Darfur, I refer the Deputy to my reply today to Questions Nos. 115 and 120.</P>
        <P>As regards the Central African Republic (CAR), the already fragile situation has been exacerbated by the activities of criminal gangs, the spill-over of instability from Darfur and Chad and armed rebellions in the north-west and north-east. Since late 2006, UN reports have described the conflict in the border areas between Darfur, Chad and CAR as a threat to peace and security in the whole region. Approximately 170,000 people have fled their homes in CAR since 2005; more than 43,000 refugees from CAR reside in camps in southern Chad; and 20,000 people are thought to have fled to Cameroon. These displaced people are in dire need of protection and humanitarian assistance. Deployment of the EUFOR Tchad/RCA mission is obviously intended to assist in this regard. Gender based <Col N="814"/>violence is widespread, and some rebel groups use child soldiers. Both the CAR military and police are in need of urgent reform to allow them to provide security while abiding by basic human rights standards.   Since late 2006, President Boziz&eacute; has been trying to reunite the country through a process of inclusive political dialogue, involving the opposition and civil society. Through talks he also reached a peace agreement with some of CAR&rsquo;s rebel factions in early 2007. These efforts have been welcomed by the international community but much more remains to be done.</P>

At the Summit, world leaders reaffirmed the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security, and despite the absence of agreement on the various models advanced, they unanimously supported the principle of its early reform. The General Assembly was asked to review progress by the end of 2005. In November 2005, a debate in the General Assembly reconfirmed widespread agreement both that there is a need to expand the Security Council with a view to making it more broadly representative and that enlargement of the Council&rsquo;s membership should contribute to its efficiency and effectiveness. However, the debate also showed widely divergent views concerning the size of the Council and the categories of its expanded membership, highlighting the difficulty of finding an agreed way forward. </P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s view is that a more representative, efficient and transparent Security Council is an essential aspect of reforming the UN to meet the many global challenges which we face. Our approach is based on the following key principles:  The Security Council should be increased in size to reflect the realities of the twenty-first century; That increase should be regionally balanced, including enhancing the role of Africa; Any change should not lessen the capacity of smaller Member States, like Ireland, to continue to aspire to membership from time to time; While we would ideally wish to see the complete removal of the veto, there should be no conferral of new veto powers.  An expanded Security Council should accommodate member states that play a particularly significant role in the UN system, for instance financially, in peacekeeping or through their capacity for regional leadership.</P>
        <P>Regrettably, wide differences of view among the UN membership have meant that little pro<Col N="815"/>gress has been made on the issue in the period since 2005. In an effort to reinvigorate the debate, facilitators were appointed last February by the then President of the General Assembly to carry out consultations on Security Council reform. The facilitators concluded that it was not possible at this stage to find an agreement which would reconcile the positions of all the different parties. Instead, they flagged the possibility of a transitional approach, with an interim arrangement which would be subject to review in the future. They suggested various possibilities for an interim arrangement such as a new category of re-electable seats with an extended term.</P>
        <P>In May, the facilitators&rsquo; report was discussed by an informal meeting of the General Assembly, and in September, the Assembly adopted a report by its outgoing President, which included the earlier findings. At a debate of the General Assembly on 12 November, the new President, Ambassador Kerim of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, stressed the need to build on this work and agree the elements that could form a basis for intergovernmental negotiations with a view to achieving concrete results during the session.</P>
        <P>Ireland regrets the lack of progress to date on this critical issue. We welcome the efforts by the President of the General Assembly to reinvigorate the debate and we look forward to participating actively in future discussions of the issue, on the basis of the principles set out above, once the President has outlined the next steps in the process.</P>

	<P>Cyclone Sidr, with wind speeds of up to 240 kilometres per hour, hit Bangladesh on the evening of 15 November. The storm caused extensive damage to the southern districts of the country.  More than 4 million people in 28 southern districts are now known to have been directly affected by the cyclone. As of 20 November, the Government of Bangladesh had reported a death toll of 3,447 people, although this may rise. It is estimated that over 300,000 homes were destroyed and a further 626,000 houses were partially damaged. An estimated 870,000 acres of crops were affected. Extensive damage to roads, schools and public buildings is also evident. </P><Col N="816"/>
        <P>I announced on 16 November initial assistance of &euro;500,000 to those affected by Cyclone Sidr. This funding will be distributed through partner relief organisations operating in the region and will help meet the immediate needs of those worst affected.  Funding of approximately &euro;10 million is committed to the Cyclone Sidr emergency from the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), to which Ireland provided &euro;20 million in January of this year. The CERF was established specifically to be able to immediately respond to emergencies such as Cyclone Sidr and I am glad that it is proving effective.</P>
        <P>In addition, the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) allocated approximately &euro;175,000 from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to respond to the urgent needs of the population affected by Cyclone Sidr. Ireland is also a significant contributor to that fund, having contributed &euro;1 million in 2006 as part of our two year agreement with the IFRC.  The European Commission has announced funding of &euro;6.5 million to assist the victims of Cyclone Sidr. This funding will help provide water, food, shelter and household items to those affected by the cyclone.</P>
        <P>It is important to note and commend the exceptional work done by the Government of Bangladesh in disaster preparedness. An effective early warning system and a network of shelters in vulnerable coastal areas helped ensure that the loss of life in this instance was not even greater.  Ireland has already pledged &euro;125,000 to disaster preparedness projects in Bangladesh in 2007. This is in addition to emergency funding of &euro;640,000 provided earlier this year for victims of previous floods in Bangladesh.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 330 together.  </P>
        <P>The Government and our EU partners share the widespread international concern at Iran&rsquo;s continuing refusal to comply with its international obligations in relation to its nuclear programme.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.7- ?><P>At the meeting of the General Affairs and External Affairs Council which I attended in <Col N="817"/>Brussels on 19 November, we reviewed developments on Iran, including the latest report by the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Dr. Mohammed El Baradei, which was published on 15 November. He reported on the operation of the Work Plan agreed between the IAEA and Iran in August, indicating that progress had been made in answering outstanding questions on the history of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme, and that some of these questions have been satisfactorily resolved. However, he also reported that Iran was not yet providing the active cooperation and full transparency needed for the full implementation of the Work Plan, and stated that the Agency&rsquo;s knowledge of Iran&rsquo;s current nuclear programme was in fact diminishing. The report again confirmed that Iran continues to ignore the unanimous demand of the UN Security Council to suspend its uranium enrichment activities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the reported progress in relation to Iran&rsquo;s past activities, even if it is long overdue. I hope it will continue, and draw attention to the IAEA&rsquo;s statement that Iran needs to continue to build confidence about the scope and nature of its present programme. It is important to emphasise that progress under the Work Plan does not negate Iran&rsquo;s obligation to comply with the demands of the UN Security Council, which reflect the genuine and serious concerns of the international community, including Iran&rsquo;s neighbours.</P>
        <P>The UN Security Council is now considering what further action it should take in view of Iran&rsquo;s non-compliance with its clear demands, most recently set out in Resolution 1747 of 24 March 2007. The EU is firmly committed to the search for a diplomatic solution, and is working in close cooperation with the United States, Russia and China. I hope that High Representative Solana will meet again shortly with Iran&rsquo;s chief negotiator on the nuclear issue. I expect that we will have further detailed discussions on the way forward at the meetings of the Council in December and in January, and that we will consider what additional measures the EU might take in order to support the UN process and the shared objectives of the international community.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 323 together.  </P>
        <P>A key purpose of the EU Reform Treaty, which will be signed by Heads of State and Government on 13 December 2007, is to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the Union.  Since 2006, the Houses of the Oireachtas and other national Parliaments in the Union have received European Commission proposals directly from the Commission. The Reform Treaty will strengthen current arrangements by giving national Parliaments longer to respond to Commission proposals and by increasing the onus on the Commission to take into account national parliaments&rsquo; reasoned opinions on whether or not a Commission proposal respects the principle of subsidiarity. The Commission can be obliged by National Parliaments to review and to justify a proposal. This strengthened role for national Parliaments, which has become known as a &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; system, is a positive development which will enhance accountability and democratic legitimacy within the Union.</P>
        <P>The Reform Treaty aims to simplify the EU&rsquo;s decision-making procedures. In most instances, a double majority voting system will be used in the Council of Ministers whereby a qualified majority will require 55 per cent of the Member States and 65 per cent of the Union&rsquo;s population. The role of the European Parliament will also be strengthened by the Reform Treaty, with additional policy areas being subject to co-decision between the Council of Ministers and the Parliament.  At national level, the European Union (Scrutiny) Act in 2002 improved the arrangements for scrutiny of EU business by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad. Thanks to the work of the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny, parliamentary oversight of proposed EU measures has been greatly enhanced. At national level, the European Union (Scrutiny) Act in 2002 improved the arrangements for scrutiny of EU business by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad. Thanks to the work of the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny, parliamentary oversight of proposed EU measures has been greatly enhanced. Under the Scrutiny Act, the following measures are subject to scrutiny: regulations or directives; joint actions and common positions under the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP); and a range of measures in the Justice and Home Affairs area.</P>
        <P>In relation to CFSP/ESDP measures, my Department informs the Oireachtas as to the content, purpose and the national implications of <Col N="819"/>such proposals. 56 such proposals were scrutinised in detail in 2006.  I also arrange to brief the Joint Committee on European Affairs, in advance of each meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, on items to be discussed, the majority of which usually relate to CFSP/ESDP issues.  I welcome the establishment of the new Joint Committee on European Scrutiny under the Chairmanship of John Perry T.D. The establishment of the new Joint Committee may have implications for the Guidelines for Departments on Oireachtas Scrutiny of EU Business, which are prepared by my Department. We will consult with other Government Departments and the Houses of the Oireachtas in the coming weeks in relation to the preparation of the new Guidelines.</P>

	<P>In our regular contacts with the Chinese authorities at various levels we have stressed the importance that Ireland attaches to human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, including freedom of speech and freedom of religion. We have stressed our hope that every effort possible will be made to facilitate freedom of movement and expression, including the right to peaceful protest, in the run-up to and during the Olympic Games in Beijing next year. We have also highlighted the opportunity which China&rsquo;s hosting of the Games presents, in terms of show-casing a positive, progressive image to the world.  While I welcome the decision by the Chinese Government from the beginning of this year to temporarily relax some restrictions on foreign journalists in China for a period up to and including the Games, I believe it would be a significant gesture if these rules were made permanent and expanded to include local journalists, which would allow for a deeper understanding of China and its development.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?><P>Human rights issues continue to be a constant and important point of dialogue with the Chinese authorities at both bilateral and European Union levels. The EU-China Human Rights Dialogue is the agreed formal framework through which the EU raises its concerns with China about general <Col N="820"/>human rights issues, as well as individual human rights cases. The Dialogue, the most recent round of which took place in Beijing on 17 October 2007, has allowed the EU to engage with China on such issues as freedom of expression, the death penalty, the independence of the judiciary, freedom of religion and minority rights. The EU has used the Dialogue to press its case for Chinese ratification of such international instruments as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and, in that context, reform of the criminal justice system. Significant individual human rights cases are also raised and followed up in subsequent contacts with the Chinese authorities.</P>
        <P>Human rights and the role of China in international issues such as Burma and Darfur, as well as development issues, including Africa, will be important topics for the upcoming EU-China Summit, due to be held in Beijing on 28 November 2007.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 83 of 23 October 2007 in relation to countries expected to fail to meet the Millennium Development Goals, if he will provide details of Irish Aid&rsquo;s pro-poor growth initiatives; and if such initiatives have been assessed in terms of a human rights perspective. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>As indicated in my earlier reply referred to by the Deputy, progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals has been mixed. There has been good progress on reaching some targets, with more intensive effort required on others. On the positive side, if current trends continue we are on target to reach the MDG on the poverty reduction target for the world as a whole. Extreme poverty is beginning to fall in Sub Saharan Africa and child mortality has declined globally.  However, there is significant geographical disparity, with progress in sub-Saharan Africa being still far too slow. </P>
        <P>Ireland is committed to playing our part in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. We intend to keep the achievement of the MDGs at the centre of our development efforts and will encourage other donors to increase and improve the quality of their aid, as we are doing, and to ensure that governance and respect for human rights are strengthened in developing countries.  Human rights are at the core of Irish foreign policy. The close relationship between human rights and development is emphasised in the White Paper on Irish Aid. Our commitment to reducing and eradicating poverty is made within the framework of achieving the MDGs and is consistent with a rights-based approach.</P><Col N="821"/>
        <P>Aid on its own will not be enough. Achieving the MDGs will require sustained economic growth especially in the poorer African countries. Much of Ireland&rsquo;s aid is used to fund basic services such as health, education and water supply as well as roads and agricultural services. We are also strengthening our support for the private sector. Economic growth will increase developing countries&rsquo; own revenues allowing them to finance more and better services for the poor. A growing economy also provides opportunities for poor people to increase their incomes through their own productive activities such as smallholder agriculture or through paid employment.</P>
        <P>These poverty reducing benefits of economic growth do not just appear by chance. Pro-poor economic growth requires appropriate policies and planning by Government. As I said in my reply to the previous question on this issue, the best way to ensure that economic growth benefits the poor is for the poor to participate directly in generating that growth. The pattern of growth is critical for poverty reduction. For poor people to benefit, growth must occur in sectors of the economy where the poor are economically active and make their livelihoods. The poor must be directly involved in growing economic activity as producers, traders, processors or employees.</P>
        <P>In its partner countries Irish Aid provides funding for public expenditure programmes at overall exchequer level and to specific sectors such as health, education and agriculture. As an important funding partner we have the opportunity and responsibility to discuss budgets and economic and other policies with our partner Governments, the International Financial Institutions and other donors. Irish Aid uses these opportunities to ensure that policies for sustaining growth in our partner countries &mdash; including those promoting macro-economic stability and improving the investment climate &mdash; should be designed to increase poor peoples&rsquo; incentives, opportunities and capabilities for employment and entrepreneurship, so that they too can participate in and benefit from growth.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid also uses this dialogue to ensure that funding of basic services and other poverty reduction programmes is protected and increased in the allocation of aid and other public resources. Progress in other, non-income areas of poverty such as education, literacy and health status is a key driver of poor peoples&rsquo; ability to benefit from economic growth.</P>

	<P>I would like to <Col N="822"/>assure the Deputy that it is of particular importance to me that Ireland&rsquo;s overseas aid to African countries is used for the benefit of the poor.  The overall objective of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development assistance is to help the poorest and most vulnerable people in developing countries, particularly in Africa. There is a wide range of measures in place to ensure that Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money is contributing to achieving positive and lasting changes in the lives of poor people. </P>
        <P>In our bilateral Programme Countries, support is planned in close consultation with national Governments and other partners at country level. We support our partner countries&rsquo; national poverty reduction plan. These plans are developed to respond to the needs of the poorest people and have a strong focus on providing basic social services such as health and education.  In addition, Irish Aid is actively engaged with Governments and other donors in national policy and budget allocation discussions. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that funding for basic services and poverty reduction programmes are protected or increased. A number of Programme Countries are introducing special social protection programmes to target those who are chronically poor.</P>
        <P>Monitoring of programmes and projects is carried out by national Auditors General, donors and civil society groups on an annual basis. Particular attention is paid to progress in relation to reducing the number of people living below the poverty line and increasing access to basic health, education and water and sanitation.</P>
        <P>We realise that poor governance is a problem in many developing countries and there are concerns regarding corruption. This is a symptom of the level of underdevelopment that exists. We are working with other donors to help strengthen public financial management systems and the institutions of governance, such as the Offices of the Auditor General.</P>
        <P>In addition, Irish Aid has in place, rigorous accounting and audit controls. These are essential to ensure a transparent, effective and high quality programme. Programmes are regularly audited and evaluated by independent audit firms and by the Department of Foreign Affairs&rsquo; Evaluation and Audit Unit. Programmes are evaluated to ensure that funds are used for the purpose for which they are intended and for value for money.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the methods used by Irish Aid for planning and monitoring programmes, together with the audit and evaluation systems we have in place, serve to protect the funding provided. Such methods are in accordance with international best practice and the highest standards in this area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 116 together.  </P>
        <P>At the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council which I attended in Brussels last week, we held a detailed discussion with the Iraqi Foreign Minister on the political and security situation in Iraq. We were encouraged by the substantial improvement in the security situation in recent months. It is clear that while there are still appalling incidents of violence, there has been a significant reduction in almost all areas. The most striking improvements have been in Baghdad and in the neighbouring province of Anbar, which is a largely Sunni area and was until recently one of the most dangerous in Iraq.</P>
        <P>It is generally agreed that there a number of factors behind these positive developments. The increased US troop deployment, along with Iraqi forces, has resulted in a more focused security effort. Sunni forces which had previously supported the insurgency have cooperated to drive out elements linked to Al Qaeda, which brought terrible suffering upon the local population. The ceasefire by the main Shia militia has seriously reduced the level of sectarian killings. None of these factors is irreversible and the situation remains fragile. However, the Iraqi people have been given some hope and there is now an urgent need to grasp the opportunity which exists for political progress.</P>
        <P>I have always argued that, while improved security is an essential requirement for progress, there are no security solutions to Iraq&rsquo;s complex problems. Lasting peace and stability can only be assured through a process of genuine political reconciliation between the communities in Iraq and the cooperation of all its regional neighbours.  Regrettably, progress towards political reconciliation has continued to be very disappointing. The national unity Government of Prime Minister Al Maliki has appeared paralysed by disputes between the parties, and the key issues identified as the main requirements for closer involvement of the Sunni community in Government remain deadlocked. These are the review of the new Constitution, the easing of the exclusion of former Ba&rsquo;ath Party members, and the question of redistribution of oil revenues. The Government and our EU partners have made it clear that Iraq&rsquo;s leaders must act urgently in the new security climate to achieve real progress in these crucial areas.</P><Col N="824"/>
        <P>A new element of concern in recent months has been the dangerous prospect of a major Turkish military incursion, directed at the PKK militia which has been responsible for serious attacks in Turkey and which maintains some bases in the Kurdish area of northern Iraq. Such a development would have the potential to destabilise the one region of Iraq which has largely escaped the turmoil and violence since the invasion in 2003. The EU, the US and others have strongly urged Turkey not to launch military operations into Iraqi territory. The Council last week welcomed the dialogue now taking place between Iraq and Turkey and called on the Iraqi Government and the Kurdistan Regional Government to ensure that their territory is not used for attacks on a neighbouring country.</P>
        <P>The horrific violence of the past few years has forced large numbers of Iraqi families to flee their homes. There are now over two million refugees outside Iraq and a further two million internally displaced. Syria and Jordan have borne a particularly heavy burden. There have been encouraging reports that as many as 1,000 people a day have begun returning from Syrian refugee camps in the hope that the security situation may be stabilising, but the humanitarian needs are still enormous. Ireland is playing its part in helping address the crisis. On 16 November, the Government announced additional funding of &euro;2.9 million for relief programmes in Iraq, Syria and Jordan, bringing the overall level of assistance for the Iraqi people to over &euro;5 million this year.</P>

	<P>Irish Aid has provided significant support in recent years to the Irish Congress of Trade Union&rsquo;s global solidarity project under our Development Education Funding Scheme. Grants totalling &euro;230,000 were awarded to ICTU for the 2005-2007 phase of the project and a total of &euro;84,764 was awarded in 2003-2004. This funding reflects our support for the aims of the programme. These include ensuring an informed and active Irish trade union voice on development issues and deepening cooperation between trade unions in Ireland and in developing countries. </P>
        <P>Activities supported through the global solidarity project include awareness raising, education, campaigning and capacity building with partner organisations in the developing world.  I will give sympathetic consideration to any new <Col N="825"/>funding proposals submitted by ICTU in respect of the global solidarity project.</P>

	<P>Audits of Missions are carried out as part of a Departmental three-year rolling audit work plan and associated annual operational plans. The work plan consists of two streams &mdash; one focusing on Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs), the other on Vote 29 (International Cooperation). The work programme seeks to ensure that sufficient coverage is obtained to provide the Secretary General of the Department, as Accounting Officer with audit assurance that the Department&rsquo;s systems of oversight and financial control are working satisfactorily. The agreed annual programme of audits is approved by the Accounting Officer and endorsed by the Department&rsquo;s external Audit Committee. </P>
        <P>The Missions audited under Vote 28 in 2007 included: Paris, Ottawa, The Hague, Budapest, New Delhi and Washington. One further audit remains to be undertaken, namely that of the Mission in Prague. This audit is scheduled to take place by the end of 2007. The six audits conducted to date have all yielded positive audit opinions.</P>
        <P>The most recently completed audit was that of The Hague in the Netherlands. The outcome of this audit was that the Department&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit was satisfied with the operation of the internal financial control system at the Mission. It was also satisfied that the system of controls in place is sufficient to ensure that:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(a)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />All consular monies received are fully recorded, lodged intact and properly reconciled;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(b)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />Payments are made only for goods and services appropriate to the Mission, and are properly checked and authorised.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">The Missions under Vote 29 oversee the disbursement of significant sums of money under Ireland&rsquo;s Aid Programme. They are audited annually by internationally recognised audit firms. Further assurance is provided by Internal Auditors, based at most Missions, who report to the Evaluation and Audit Unit.  In addition, the Evaluation and Audit Unit itself conducts a series of audit visits annually. During 2007, it has undertaken visits to Uganda, Mozambique and Zambia.  With regard to both Votes, audit issues that arise are reported to Senior Management as appropriate, and also to the external Audit Com<Col N="826"/>mittee. Management responses are provided in reply to each audit.</P>

        <QRef>[30894/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The humanitarian situation in Darfur remains extremely fragile, characterised by ongoing armed clashes, continuous new population displacements, increased violence inside the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps and seriously constrained humanitarian access to an ever growing number of conflict affected people. </P>
        <P>In October, armed clashes in Muhajiriya (South Darfur) and Um Dukhum (West Darfur) led to a further displacement of thousands of civilians, bringing the total tally of newly displaced this year to some 270,000 people.  Adding to the complexity of the Darfur crisis is the increased presence of armed men, from all sides, jeopardizing the security of the IDPs. This, in combination with Government pressure for returns to the villages of origin has led to widespread violence amongst the IDPs along tribal lines. One example of this is the long simmering animosity amongst IDPs in Kalma camp, which recently burst into a spike of violence leading an estimated 10,000 IDPs to flee to nearby camps and Nyala town. The camp remained virtually closed for humanitarian operations for a week.</P>
        <P>There have been some moves by the Government to get people to return to their villages of origin. However, both the United Nations and many Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) do not believe that the conditions currently exist for large numbers of people to return home.  During his recent visit to Sudan and Chad, my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dermot Ahern T.D., raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the humanitarian situation in Darfur, as well as about access for humanitarian workers to affected populations, directly with President Bashir and with the acting Foreign Minister of Sudan, Ali Karti.</P>
        <P>Alleviating the suffering in Darfur is a priority for the Government. Since 2006, Ireland has provided approximately &euro;9 million directly in response to the situation in Darfur, including almost &euro;4 million in 2007. Since 2004, Irish Aid has also committed &euro;5m in funding for AMIS, the African Union Mission in Sudan, currently deployed in Darfur.</P>

	<P>I have received the correspondence from Amnesty International to which the Deputy refers. A response outlining the Government&rsquo;s position on this matter has been issued by my Office.  As the Deputy will be aware from my responses to previous Parliamentary Questions on this matter, Ireland holds the view that those detained in Guant&aacute;namo must be treated in accordance with the requirements of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, a position which is shared by the EU as a whole. Human rights and humanitarian standards have to be maintained while combating terrorism. The Government has repeatedly stated its desire to see the United States Administration take steps to release or bring to trial all detainees in accordance with established legal norms, and to close Guant&aacute;namo Bay as soon as possible. Ireland has raised the issue of the detainees in Guant&aacute;namo Bay with the US authorities on numerous occasions. In all contacts with the US authorities, Ireland has been assured that the US is aware of their obligations under international law. The United States is well aware of the Government&rsquo;s concerns about reports of prisoner abuse in Guant&aacute;namo Bay as outlined above.</P>

	<P>I was shocked by the severity of the floods experienced in the Mexican states of Tabasco and Chiapas in the aftermath of Hurricane Noel. These were the worst floods suffered in the southern Mexico region for 50 years. As much as 80% of the state of Tabasco was under water, while it is estimated that as many as 900,000 people were made homeless. </P>
        <P>The response by the international community to the disaster has involved relief assistance on the ground by UN agencies, international organisations and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), in support of Mexican Government <Col N="828"/>authorities. Many countries, including Ireland, have provided funding to facilitate this assistance.  Hurricane Noel also provoked considerable damage and flooding in other countries throughout the Caribbean and Central America.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 6 November, I announced emergency funding of &euro;1 million to assist international efforts to provide shelter and relief to those who had been worst affected by the flooding. This funding is being delivered via our key partners: the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC), the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP).</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to previous replies to similar questions concerning the United Nations Convention against Corruption, most recently on 23 October 2007. The Convention against Corruption was adopted by the UN General Assembly in October 2003 and was signed on behalf of Ireland, when it opened for signature, in December 2003. The Convention entered into force on 14 December 2005. </P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has arranged for his officials to undertake a detailed examination of the text of the Convention, in order to ascertain what, if any, changes to the domestic criminal and civil law and to administrative practice will be required in order for Ireland to ratify this Convention.</P>
        <P>Following extensive consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, it has been concluded that Ireland largely fulfils the criminal justice requirements of the Convention either through existing anti-corruption statutes or via legislation that is in progress, such as the forthcoming Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill and the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill 2005.</P>
        <P>A number of other issues in the civil and administrative area will also have to be addressed in advance of Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the Convention. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is pursuing these matters with the relevant Departments and Agencies.</P>

	<P>My colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Dermot Ahern T.D., has recently returned from a visit to Chad. While there, he was able to observe at first hand the humanitarian situation in the country, and the tremendous difficulties involved in providing essential relief to those in need across the vast expanse of Eastern Chad. During his visit, Minster Ahern pledged an additional &euro;2 million in humanitarian funding for Chad. </P>
        <P>His visit confirmed the serious humanitarian and security situation obtaining in that vulnerable region and the valuable role which Ireland, as part of the EUFOR Tchad/RCA mission, can play in helping to address and improve this situation.</P>
        <P>Since 2006, Ireland has provided humanitarian funding of over &euro;6 million to United Nations agencies and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) working in Chad. These agencies and organisations operate in a wide variety of fields, including medical relief and emergency food supply. Transportation of humanitarian relief is an integral part of many of the projects funded. The European Community&rsquo;s Humanitarian Aid Office has contributed in excess of &euro;20 million towards humanitarian efforts in Chad this year.</P>
        <P>As part of Ireland&rsquo;s overall emergency response, my colleague Mr. Trevor Sargent T.D., Minster of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, has provided funding of &euro;2 million to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in Chad. This funding was specifically for the UN Humanitarian Air Service, which provides transportation of food to remote regions.</P>

        <Quest> the progress being made in terms of the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by the G8; and his views of the progress, or lack thereof, in achieving universal access to prevention treatment and care of persons suffering from AIDS, the strengthening of health systems, the care of orphans and vulnerable children, affordable treatment and the promise to establish a G8 working group on AIDS. </Quest>
        <QRef>[30873/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are a framework for development for the whole international community, involving cooperation between developed and developing countries, and are not confined to the G8. Their <Col N="830"/>achievement will require a large push forward, not only by donors, but also by the developing countries which will benefit from a sustainable reduction in poverty. </P>
        <P>The MDGs report, launched last July, gave us a snapshot of the progress achieved at the midpoint of the 2015 MDG target date. It is indeed a mixed picture. On the positive side, it shows, for example, that the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell from nearly a third, to less than one fifth, between 1990 and 2004. If this trend continues then the MDG poverty reduction target will be met for the world as a whole. However, this is not the case for sub-Saharan Africa. Though the poverty rate there has declined by six percent since 2000, the progress is far too slow.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although HIV and AIDS continue to be the single biggest obstacles to reducing poverty and to attaining the MDGs, significant progress is being made in some areas. Current statistics from the United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) released last week, reveal that global HIV prevalence has levelled off and that the number of new infections has fallen, in part due to the impact of HIV programmes. However, with over 33 million people estimated to be living with HIV and an estimated 6,800 new infections occurring each day, there is still significant work to be done to achieve Universal Access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care and support.</P>
        <P>Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the epicentre of the epidemic. The increase in availability of HIV treatment and the impact of HIV prevention efforts are bringing results in some countries there. Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe are all showing signs of stabilising or decreasing HIV prevalence. About 25% of the people who are in need of HIV treatment are accessing anti-retroviral drugs. However, mortality from AIDS remains high in Africa due to the extensive unmet treatment need.</P>
        <P>Key obstacles to progress include significant human resource shortages in many health sectors in sub-Saharan Africa, weak health systems, and the growing numbers of children orphaned as a result of AIDS. Over fifteen million children have been orphaned by AIDS and millions more are vulnerable.</P>
        <P>HIV and AIDS have been on the agenda of the G8 nations and in response to a call to set up a G8 working group on AIDS, they have promised to regularly review progress made on AIDS. At the last G8 meeting in Germany in July of this year, they committed to making a total of US$60 billion available to combat HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria, over the coming years. These funds are to be used to safeguard universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment and care programmes and to develop health systems at <Col N="831"/>local level. They will go a long way in making progress to achieve Universal Access.</P>
        <P>Responding to the global problem of HIV and AIDS is a key priority for the Irish Government. Funding for HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases is now at &euro;100 million per year. This funding is directed at programmes at international, regional and country levels to provide increased access to HIV prevention, treatment and care services. Ireland will continue to work with the international community in advocating for a sustained and resourced global response to HIV and AIDS, strengthened leadership at all levels and improved coordination of resources for effective HIV and AIDS prevention and control.</P>

The proposed legislation has been drafted in accordance with the recommendations of a 2004 report by Forf&aacute;s on the export licensing of military and dual-use goods in Ireland. The Department of Foreign Affairs has been fully involved in the work of the inter-departmental group charged with the implementation of the Forf&aacute;s report.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 120 together.</P>
        <P>I visited both Sudan and Chad from 14-16 November last. Whilst in Khartoum on 14 November, I met with President Bashir, acting Foreign Minister Ali Karti, and Minni Minnawi, the leader of the SLA faction which signed the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) in 2006. I also met with representatives of the main UN agencies and of Irish and international NGOs which are active in Darfur. In my meetings with the Government, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s disappointment at the lack of progress in implementing the DPA, and at the failure of many rebel groups to travel to Libya for the current talks process. I urged that the Government re-consider its unwillingness to agree to deployment of non-African personnel and capabilities with the UN/African Union hybrid force, UNAMID. I also emphasised in my discussions with President Bashir and the acting Foreign Minister the importance Ireland attaches to access for humanitarian agencies and personnel in their life-saving work in Darfur. I urged that the UN/Government of Sudan Joint Communiqu&eacute; on humanitarian access be renewed when it expires in January.</P>
        <P>I also expressed my concern over difficulties with implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between north and south. I am satisfied that the Sudanese Government remains committed to the CPA and has no wish to return to war with the south.  I subsequently travelled to N&rsquo;Djamena on 15 November for discussions with Chadian Government representatives, including Prime Minister Coumakoye, Foreign Minister Allam-Mi, Defence Minister Nour (a former rebel leader), and the State Secretary for the Interior. I also met with opposition leader Lol Chouat, and with representatives of UN agencies and non-governmental organisations active in Chad. I outlined Ireland&rsquo;s expected role in the UN-mandated EUFOR Tchad/RCA mission and our commitment to the humanitarian objectives of that mission and also referred to the Government&rsquo;s plans to increase support for humanitarian and recovery activity in Chad. Prime Minister Coumakoye and his colleagues expressed warm appreciation for the deployment of EUFOR <Col N="833"/>Tchad/RCA as well as Ireland&rsquo;s lead role within the Mission.</P>
        <P>I travelled to Abeche in eastern Chad on 16 November where I visited a number of camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees and met with local government and UN representatives. My visit to eastern Chad confirmed the serious humanitarian and security situation obtaining in that vulnerable region and the valuable role which EUFOR Tchad/RCA can play in helping to address and improve this situation.</P>
        <P>Negotiations between the Government of Sudan and the Darfur rebel factions began on 27 October in Libya under joint AU/UN mediation. However, the start of this process was overshadowed by the absence of many of the principal rebel groups, which boycotted the talks. The UN and AU have sent representatives to Darfur and Juba to find and speak with the rebels who did not attend, and it is hoped that the talks will recommence in December. Although there have been some improvements in recent months on humanitarian access in Darfur on foot of the UN/Government of Sudan Joint Communiqu&eacute; agreed last March, the humanitarian situation is again becoming more difficult. The fragmentation of the rebel groups, growing tensions within camps for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and banditry in the countryside are making the tasks of both peace negotiators and humanitarian agencies increasingly difficult.</P>
        <P>Since 2002, the stability of Chad has been threatened by armed rebellion arising from clashes between ethnic-based militias and Government forces, incursions by Janjaweed from Sudan, and inter-Chadian Arab/non Arab clashes. Following an agreement with the rebel Front Unifie pour le Changement in 2006, the Chadian Government reached a similar agreement in October 2007 with representatives of four of the main remaining armed rebel groups. This agreement calls for an amnesty and a role for rebels in government, in return for a ceasefire and the integration of their forces into the army. However, implementation will present challenges, and not all of the rebels have yet laid down their arms. The Chadian Government also reached an agreement with the peaceful political opposition in August 2007, which postponed legislative elections to 2009 while a new electoral system is introduced. Chad&rsquo;s unsettled internal situation has been exacerbated by a spill-over of instability from Darfur, and more than 180,000 internally displaced Chadians and 236,000 Sudanese refugees live in camps in eastern Chad.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the answer given to PQ 304 on 23rd October 2007 (attached), in which I outlined the structure of the Conflict Resolution Unit and explained that my Department is in the final phase of completing its work programme in this area, which will set out the Unit&rsquo;s key objectives. The Unit will be a cross-cutting one, working closely with Irish Aid and Anglo-Irish Divisions and relevant Desks in Political Division.  The Programme for Government sets out a number of key goals to support Ireland&rsquo;s activities in the field of conflict resolution, including a Stability Fund, a system of roving ambassadors to crisis regions, and the creation of an Irish Academic Centre for Conflict Resolution. The Centre is intended to provide academic and analytical capability in the area of conflict resolution, drawing on national expertise to strengthen the policy research and knowledge base for greater Irish involvement in international conflict resolution.</P>
        <P>Developing and drawing on Irish academic resources is an exciting but challenging goal. The Conflict Resolution Unit is currently completing a study of comparable academic centres abroad. This will identify best practice and offer a range of possible options for the remit and structures most appropriate to our own resources and goals. No decisions as to the configuration of the proposed Centre or its location have yet been taken.</P>

	<P>The EU military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, entitled EUFOR Tchad/RCA, was authorised by a Joint Action of the Council of the European Union on 15 October, in accordance with the mandate set out in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1778 of 25 September. </P>
        <P>The Joint Action included the appointment of Lieutenant General Pat Nash of the Defence Forces as Operation Commander. The Government on 2 October agreed to the nomination of General Nash for the position. The nomination of General Nash, and support staff, was approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 9 October. Following reconnaissance visits by the Defence Forces to <Col N="835"/>the region, and my own visit to Sudan and Chad earlier this month, the Government on 19 November authorised the Minister for Defence to arrange, subject to D&aacute;il approval, for the despatch of a contingent of up to 400 members of the Defence Forces for service with EUFOR Tchad/RCA, making Ireland the second largest contributor to this Mission.</P>
        <P>Lt Gen Nash, as Operation Commander, has had primary responsibility for the Force Generation process which aims to ensure that the mission has the capacity to undertake the tasks envisaged for it by the United Nations, namely to protect civilians in danger, particularly refugees and displaced persons, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, and protect UN personnel.</P>
        <P>To date, three Force Generation meetings have taken place, and very significant commitments of personnel and equipment have been made, including by third countries outside the European Union. It is the Union&rsquo;s and the Operation Commander&rsquo;s hope that formal Initial Operating Capability can be declared by year end, or very soon thereafter. Deployment of the Irish contingent would take place in line with the overall deployment.</P>
        <P>As with the Force Generation process for any substantial mission, certain shortfalls have been identified. In this case, transport aviation and medical support facilities have been the key shortfalls thus far. The Taoiseach has indicated to the House that deployment of members of the Defence Forces will be conditional on adequate logistical support being in place. Given the importance of the Mission, and its key role in addressing the humanitarian crisis and regional instability resulting from the Darfur crisis, I expect that these shortfalls will be addressed in the coming period and the Mission will proceed on schedule.</P>

	<P>Following the adoption of conclusions by the Council on 3rd October 2005, accession negotiations were opened with Turkey. Under the terms of the agreed Negotiating Framework, these accession negotiations are an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed beforehand. </P>
        <P>In all, there are thirty five negotiating chapters which deal with a range of policy areas. To date, four chapters have been opened with Turkey. Benchmarks have been agreed for thirteen other <Col N="836"/>chapters. These benchmarks identify areas where further progress should be made by Turkey before negotiations begin on these particular chapters. On 6th November last, the European Commission published its annual package of enlargement reports. These include an assessment of progress made by candidate countries in meeting EU membership criteria.</P>
        <P>In respect of Turkey, the Commission noted that following the constitutional crisis in spring of this year, early parliamentary elections were held in full respect of democratic standards and of the rule of law. Against this background, only limited progress was achieved on political reforms during 2007. Significant further reforms are needed in particular on freedom of expression, the rights of non-Muslim religious communities and on civilian control of the military. Further progress is also needed in the fight against corruption, the judicial system, trade union rights and women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s rights. In the South-East, Turkey needs also to create the conditions for the predominantly Kurdish population there to enjoy full rights and freedoms.</P>
        <P>The Commission reports that Turkey continued to make progress against economic criteria for accession over the course of the last year. With regard to the alignment of Turkey&rsquo;s legislation with that of the EU, progress was reported in a number of areas and further alignment should be pursued in areas including agriculture, fisheries, food safety and the environment.  The Commission also noted that Turkey has not yet fulfilled its obligations under the Ankara Protocol by opening its ports and airports to vessels and aircraft from the Republic of Cyprus. In December 2006, the Council of Ministers agreed that eight specific negotiating chapters cannot be opened, nor will any chapters be provisionally concluded, until the Commission verifies that Turkey has fulfilled its commitments under this Protocol.</P>

        <Quest> his views that in view of this country&rsquo;s experience in the resolution of conflict in the island of Ireland, the Irish Government could assist the Government of Sri Lanka in conflict resolution in its own peace process, therefore preventing a slide towards full civil war; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am deeply concerned about the deteriorating situation in Sri Lanka. Ireland, together with our partners in the EU, takes a close interest <Col N="837"/>in developments in Sri Lanka, and in the peace process in particular and regrets the fact that neither party appears willing to engage in meaningful negotiations. We continue to take the firm view that there can be no military solution and that the only way to a just and lasting peace in Sri Lanka is a rapid return to comprehensive talks between the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) to resolve outstanding differences. Ireland remains firmly committed to assisting the Norwegian facilitator in his work in this regard. </P>
        <P>The EU continues to play an active role as one of the four Co-Chairs of the 2003 Tokyo Conference on Reconstruction and Development of Sri Lanka. At their last meeting in June 2007 the Co-Chairs expressed their concern about the conflict and said that there can be no justification for the use of military means. An important part of the work of my Department&rsquo;s new Conflict Resolution Unit will be drawing together the lessons of the Northern Ireland peace process in a way which will make it possible to share them in a useful fashion. While of course all conflicts have their own specific character, there may be lessons from Northern Ireland that could be useful to the parties in Sri Lanka in re-engaging in their peace process. I recall that over the last few years there have been a number of visits, including by Mr. John Hume and Mr. Martin McGuinness, aimed at sharing experiences. The Government would of course be willing to offer advice if sought by relevant parties but there currently appears little scope to do so in light of the negative situation there.</P>

	<P>The scheme of performance-related awards in the civil service applies to Deputy and Assistant Secretaries and equivalent grades.  Details of awards to individual officers under the performance related scheme are not disclosed on the basis that they are confidential to the officer concerned.  However, during 2007, awards totalling &euro;51,200 were made to 4 officers in my Department in respect of 2006 (as shown on page 10 of the CPA report for 2006).  Details of the operation of the scheme are available in the report of the Committee for Performance Awards which can be accessed on the website of the Department of Finance (www.finance.gov.ie).  In October of this year, eight individual Departmental staff members were given employee recognition awards of &euro;500 each.</P>

        <Quest> the buildings occupied by his Department which are and which are not fully accessible to people with disabilities in tabular readable form. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department occupies and administers the West Block of Government Buildings, Upper Merrion Street, Dublin 2 and for many years has been conscious of our duty to ensure access to our buildings and services by people with disabilities.  At the time of the adaptation of the building for the Department in the early 1990&rsquo;s, many facilities were provided, which have subsequently been improved upon, and we will continue to review facilities and upgrade them as necessary.  As part of our endeavours to adopt best practice, hearing loops to facilitate those with hearing aids have been installed in the Welcome Pavilion, at Reception, in the Press Centre and in all conference rooms throughout the building.  People with disabilities can access all areas of Government Buildings included in the Saturday Tours and a portable hearing loop is also available on request.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Taoiseach website is continually monitored to ensure compliance with WAI and W3C Accessibility Guidelines.  We have also recently installed a number of induction coupler telephones and Minicoms (Telephone devices for the Deaf, TDD&rsquo;s) throughout the Department.  My Department provides access to information to people with a disability in a variety of formats on request (this can include Braille, simple text documents or large print).  Assistive technologies are supplied to staff and visitors as  necessary and accessibility tools are part of the standard desktop used in my Department.  As part of this Department&rsquo;s ongoing Customer Services initiatives, an access audit of the Department was carried out in December 2006.  The intent was to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Disability Act, 2005 and to further improve on the Department&rsquo;s existing facilities and services.  Arising from the audit, a programme of work has been prepared in conjunction with OPW to address many of the issues raised.  The access audit identifies a range of barriers that potentially restrict access for disabled people to the built environment and its recommendations now form part of the Department&rsquo;s ongoing and strategic plans to ensure its buildings and services are accessible to all.</P>
        <P>The audit report noted that due to the building&rsquo;s features, its location and protected heritage <Col N="844"/>conservation status, most of the major works that are required to comply with Best Practice for accessibility are not practical to effect.  However, it also found that the building was open and well designed for universal accessibility.  The Department&rsquo;s Disability Monitoring Committee will continue to explore and implement opportunities to improve services to people with disabilities.  This Committee seeks to ensure that the range of services provided by the Department is accessible to people with disabilities and that staff of the Department engage proactively in the process.  In line with the requirements of the Disability Act, 2005, we have also appointed an Inquiry Officer (who will deal with complaints where the Department fails to comply with the Act) and an Access Officer (to ensure compliance with the Act in terms of facilities, services and the built environment).  We also have a Disability Liaison Officer and an Employee Assistance Officer.</P>

	<P>I am officially responsible to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the general activities of my Department.  However, there may be specific activities undertaken by officials of my Department for which I do not have official responsibility e.g. decisions made in relation to freedom of information applications.  I account to the D&aacute;il in a limited way in respect of a number of state offices, for example, the legal offices of the state and the Central Statistics Office.  By and large, I answer questions in the House in relation to matters of administration connected with those offices.  Similarly, the nature of my responsibility to the House in respect of any Tribunal, Commission or other independent inquiry established &ldquo;under the aegis&rdquo; of my Department is confined primarily to the arrangements relating to their <Col N="846"/>establishment and ongoing administration.  The specific nature of my accountability in respect of any body operating within my Department&rsquo;s policy area has long been established by precedent in each case.</P>

	<P>The total housing stock in April 2006 was 1.77 million units according to the Census carried out at that time.  Of these, 1.46 million were occupied by their usual residents on Census Night.  The remaining 310,000 units consisted mainly of vacant houses or flats and holiday homes.  Of the 1.46 million occupied housing units 1.09 million were owner occupied, accounting for a population of 3.1 mil<Col N="848"/>lion.  A further 323,000 housing units were rented, with 807,000 residents.  No nature of occupancy was stated in the case of some 47,000 housing units, and 22,000 were occupied free of rent.  This covers the remaining 166,000 persons resident in permanent housing units.  The above figures are taken from Volume 6 &mdash; Housing of the 2006 Census.</P>

	<P>The Personnel Code is issued and updated by the Department of Finance.  The Code aims to make the various instructions governing personnel matters readily available to all civil servants.  The Code is contained in four volumes and holds relevant circulars, circular letters and letters to heads of Departments and Personnel Officers on terms and conditions of civil servants.  The Code covers matters such as recruitment, employment legislation, retirement, conduct, sick leave, disciplinary and grievance procedures.  Since January 2002 the Personnel Code is available to civil servants electronically on the website www.personnelcode.gov.ie. Members of the public can also access this website.  In the light of the information being freely available it is not considered necessary to lay the Civil Service Personnel Code before the Houses of the Oireachtas. </P>

	<P>Capital gains tax roll-over relief was abolished in Budget 2003 as a means of widening the CGT tax base after the CGT rate was halved from 40% to 20% in Budget 1998.  Other changes to the CGT code in the 2003 Budget included the abolition of indexation relief and the change in the CGT payment date.  These changes were made in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information is not compiled on a basis which enables an estimate to be made of the tax yield from abolishing the capital gains tax roll-over for businesses upgrading to a new premises. Accordingly, the specific information is not readily available and it either could not be obtained or could not be obtained without conducting a protracted investigation of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; records.</P>

	<P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Affordable Housing Certificate presented for signature to them by the taxpayer required confirmation that the taxpayer had not previously claimed income tax relief in respect of interest paid on money borrowed to purchase or build a dwelling.  The <Col N="853"/>Revenue Commissioners were unable to certify the certificate as the taxpayer has claimed and received tax relief at source in respect of mortgage interest paid on the family home since 2005.  The Revenue Commissioners have no record of a request from the taxpayer for a certificate stating that their tax affairs are in order.  Following the Deputy&rsquo;s query a letter, dated 21 November 2007, issued to the taxpayer confirming that their income tax affairs are in order.</P>

I am also informed that repayment cheques for refunds relating to reviews carried out for 2006 and prior years will continue to be generated up to 14 December inclusive and will all be posted prior to the last day for mailing in order to guarantee delivery before Christmas, which is 19 December.  Reviews for the current year which are dealt with through the issue of amended Tax Credit Certificates (TCCs) will continue to be generated up to 7 December inclusive. No further amended TCCs for 2007 will issue after this date because employers would not have the opportunity to input them into their payroll systems in time to have any repayment due included in the employee&rsquo;s last pay cheque before Christmas.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 157 together.</P>
        <P>The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States.  In the Irish context, these derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.  While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, who are the deciding authority, have to date refused all such requests.  The Commission maintain that, in keeping with the EU Energy Tax Directive, Member States must apply at least the EU minimum rates of excise on fuels in such circumstances and that any further favourable excise treatment is not allowable. In this regard the Commission&rsquo;s decision was published on its website in March 2007.  At the Commission&rsquo;s behest my officials have indicated that Ireland will avail of the forthcoming Finance Bill to make the necessary legislative changes to conform with the Directive.  In the cir<Col N="855"/>cumstances, the relevant line Departments who have primary responsibility in this regard are, in conjunction with my Department, exploring alternative non-tax support mechanisms that could be put in place where appropriate to maintain the assistance currently being provided, subject of course to compatibility with EU State Aid requirements.  In the interim the reduced rates applicable to fuel used will be maintained.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works has been carrying out works on the River Tolka in the Dublin City area in conjunction with Dublin City Council since 2003.  The works have been carried out as a result of the recommendations contained in the River Tolka Flooding Report completed in 2003.  The Report recommended a number of works which should be undertaken to provide the standard level of protection against a flood with a 1% probability of occurring in any year along both banks of the channel in the Richmond Road area.  All these measures have now been undertaken, including raising of some existing walls, the construction of new walls and embankments, widening of the channel and the replacement of Distillery Road Bridge.  Dublin City Council was asked by residents of the Tolka Road area in 2006 to have the river wall replaced in the area downstream of Distillery Road Bridge to Luke Kelly Bridge.  The original Report indicated that the existing wall was structurally sound and not in need of replacement. However, following these requests from the local residents, the City Council again had the wall assessed in 2006, and this assessment confirmed that the wall was in good condition.  As the wall does not require replacement from a flood defence perspective, such a replacement does not fall within OPW&rsquo;s remit on activities under the Flood Relief programme.</P>

	<P>There are no immediate plans to replace the heating system in the National Library with air conditioning.  The Berkely Library in Trinity College is a modern building and very different from the National Library in Kildare Street, which is a very old building (built in 1890) and a protected structure.  Buildings such as the National Library pose significant challenges in balancing conservation needs with the provision of services such as air conditioning. </P>
        <P>When undertaking any new projects in the National Library, the Commissioners of Public Works assess the feasibility of installing air conditioning and if practical, install it, e.g., the former NCAD building. The new Book Repository, which is the top priority for the National Library, will be air conditioned.</P>

	<P>The table below shows for each of the years 2004 to 2007 the year-on-year increase in cost of the pay of the Taoiseach, Ministers, Ministers of State and TDs.  This takes account of all pay increases (i.e. those arising from nation wage agreements, recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector and the Benchmarking Body). </P>
        <P>Report No. 38 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector recommended that the salary of a TD should be set at the ordinary maximum of the grade of Principal (standard) in the civil service and should be revised for the future on that basis. Following implementation of this recommendation the salary of TDs is no longer examined by the Review Body.</P>
        <P>The salaries of the Taoiseach, Minister and Minister of State are made up of two elements: the office holder&rsquo;s salary plus the TD&rsquo;s basic salary.  While the TD&rsquo;s element of the salary is determined in the manner set out above, the office holder&rsquo;s element is examined from time to time by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration. The office holder&rsquo;s salary does not attract increases recommended by the Public Service Benchmarking Body.</P><Col N="863"/>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>At present there is no legislation in Ireland governing the intervention in the <Col N="866"/>natural process of creating human life; instead, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council.  These provide that the creation of new forms of life for experimental purposes or the deliberate and intentional destruction of in vitro human life already formed is professional misconduct. </P>
        <P>In March 2000 the then Minister for Health and Children established the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction (CAHR). Its terms of reference were: to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area.</P>
        <P>The CAHR comprised largely of persons with expert knowledge spanning medical, scientific, social and legal domains.  This expertise was a prerequisite to a precise examination of the issues concerned and the Commission published its report in May 2005.  Its report was the first step in determining a policy response to Assisted Human Reproduction (AHR) and it made 40 recommendations on AHR services in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Government decided to refer the report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children so that the Committee could consider and report in due course on its views of the recommendations of the Commission.  The Committee was considered an appropriate forum in which to subject the report to structured democratic and political analysis and scrutiny.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, cognisant of the amount of work required, I instructed my Department to begin work on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.  As part of the analysis of the complex issues involved in developing an appropriate regulatory framework for this area (including the issue raised by the Deputy), the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children -when completed- along with any judgement of the Supreme Court in the RvR (frozen embryo) case, will be taken into account.</P>

	<P>The social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, includes a commitment that the issues around the introduction of a cost of dis<Col N="868"/>ability payment will be considered following the development of a needs assessment system under the Disability Act.  This follows an inter-departmental examination of the issue by a working group and research commissioned on its behalf by the National Disability Authority. </P>
        <P>Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 establishes a system for the assessment of individual needs for people with a disability.  The assessment of need process has been implemented for persons aged under 5 years of age with effect from 1st June 2007.  It is intended that the assessment of need process for all persons with a disability will be in place by 2011.  My Department is committed to considering the issues around a cost of disability payment following the development of this needs assessment system.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, there is already significant assistance available to mitigate the impact of the additional costs incurred by people with a disability.

        <P>As the Health Service Executive (HSE) has operational responsibility, under the Health Act 2004, for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, the issue of revised reimbursement prices for community pharmacy under the GMS and community drugs schemes, following the announcement by the HSE on 17 September 2007 of new wholesaler arrangements, <Col N="870"/>is being managed by a HSE-led team which includes representation from my Department.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>The revised pricing arrangements were arrived at following a detailed consultation process accompanied by independent economic analysis. In the light of the position on competition law previously outlined by me, the HSE obtained legal advice, confirmed by advice to my Department, that a fair and transparent consultation process was the most appropriate means to allow for the determination of new reimbursement arrangements.  This process involved direct discussion with wholesaler companies and a call for public submissions, published on 20th December 2006, in response to which a total of 161 submissions (including 143 from community pharmacy contractors) were received.</P>
        <P>Following the completion of public consultation, and informed by the independent economic analysis, carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants, new reimbursement arrangements were announced by the HSE on 17th September 2007.  The report by Indecon was published by the HSE on 13 November 2007. All aspects of the Indecon report were considered by the HSE in making its determination.  To address concerns expressed by the IPU, on behalf of community pharmacists, about the implications of the legal advice on competition law on their right to negotiate fees through the Union, a process of dialogue was established, chaired by Bill Shipsey SC, to explore ways in which concerns raised by the IPU about the implications of this legal advice might be addressed.  Despite suspension of this process during the recent withdrawal by individual pharmacists of methadone services, there has recently been renewed engagement between the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the HSE under the auspices of Mr. Shipsey.</P>
        <P>I am also exploring, in consultation with the Attorney General, the other relevant Government Departments and the HSE, the best way of progressing the development of a new contract with pharmacists.</P>

	<P>The aim of the home help service is to enable older people and other dependent persons, who would otherwise need to be looked after in residential care, to live at home.

        <P>The level of home help required by an existing or new client is informed by an assessment of need which is carried out by HSE professional staff.

In that regard, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.

	<P>The Report on the Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease  (&lsquo;the O&rsquo;Higgins Report&rsquo;) was published in 2000.  The Report recommended 13 specialist breast cancer centres nationally based on a requirement for each centre to manage a minimum of 100 new primary breast cancer cases per annum as follows: South Eastern Health Board &mdash; Waterford Regional Hospital; Southern Health Board &mdash; South Infirmary and Cork University Hospitals; Mid-Western Health Board &mdash; Limerick Regional Hospital; Western Health Board &mdash; University College Hospital Galway; North-Eastern Health Board &mdash; Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda; North-Western Health Board &mdash; Sligo General Hospital, (Letterkenny General Hospital linked to Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry); Midland Health Board, &mdash; Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore or Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise; Eastern Health Board &mdash; Mater Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, St James&rsquo; Hospital and Tallaght Hospital. </P>
        <P>Last June I approved National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services under the Health Act 2007 which were prepared by a multi-disciplinary expert group chaired by Professor Niall O&rsquo; Higgins.  The Standards require that each centre providing breast cancer care manages a minimum of 150 new cases per year.  Based on the new Standards,  and the fact that the BreastCheck screening programme will reduce significantly the number of symptomatic breast cancer presentations, the Health Service Executive (HSE) determined that we <Col N="872"/>require a total of eight specialist breast cancer centres nationally.</P>
        <P>Arising from the designation of eight cancer centres nationally and in order to comply with the Standards, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has directed a number of hospitals with very low case volumes to cease breast cancer services.  The National Hospitals Office has already planned the redirection of this symptomatic caseload.  Further staged reductions in the number of hospitals providing breast cancer services will occur over the next two years in line with the development of quality assured capacity in the eight designated centres.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 to 197, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>I understand that the Health Service Executive (HSE) has detailed operational guidelines in place for the assessment of applications for a medical card or GP visit card.  The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that every person entitled to a medical card or GP visit card is given the opportunity to avail of their entitlement and that there is a consistent approach to means-<?oasys _ch ?>testing nationally.</P>
        <P>The guidelines include provisions dealing with the exercise of discretion in the medical card/GP visit card application process, where an applicant would not qualify solely on the basis of an assessment of means.  The term  &ldquo;discretionary medical card&rdquo; has come to be applied to cards awarded to persons whose income exceeds the guideline figure and whose health status is such that they have greater care requirements than the average medical card holder.</P>
        <P>In 2001, in the context of industrial relations negotiations aimed at giving effect to the extension of eligibility for a medical card to all persons aged 70 or over, it was agreed to pay additional amounts totalling &euro;2 million per annum to contracted GMS GPs in respect of a notional figure of 20,000 &ldquo;discretionary medical card&rdquo; patients.  The payments to individual GPs were calculated on a pro rata basis in relation to the size of each GP&rsquo;s GMS patient panel.  In 2002, in the context of further difficult industrial relations discussions and in order to ensure the continued provision of GMS services to the eligible population, it was agreed that the pro rata payment in respect of &ldquo;discretionary medical cards&rdquo; would be increased such that it would be calculated by reference to an estimated population of 75,000 holders of such cards.  It was contended by the Irish Medical Organisation that the number of persons with a &ldquo;discretionary medical card&rdquo; was in the region of 75,000 and information received by the Depart<Col N="875"/>ment from several health boards appeared to support a number of this order.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>My Department and the HSE are currently working on the development of a new GMS GP contract.  It is intended that the remuneration arrangements attaching to this will involve a simplification of the current arrangements, which include the capitation and a range of associated payments, including those in respect of &ldquo;discretionary medical card&rdquo; patients.</P>
        <P>As aspects of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments.  The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina <Col N="881"/>bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions. </P>
        <P>Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients.  Other products are available according to the patient&rsquo;s eligibility.</P>
        <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process the Health Service Executive can take into account a range of measures including the household income guidelines, particular circumstances and the medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  In addition people over the age of 70 years have an automatic entitlement to a medical card regardless of income.  Application should be made to the local area office of the HSE.</P>
        <P>In November 2004, I introduced a new graduated benefit &mdash; the GP Visit Card to extend free GP care and treatment to individuals and families on moderate incomes.</P>
        <P>In June 2005, I simplified the means test for both medical and GP visit cards.  It is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after income tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work.  In 2005 the income guidelines for medical cards were increased by a cumulative 29 per cent.  The income assessment guidelines used for the GP visit card are 50% higher than those used for medical cards.  These improvements have made the assessment process much fairer and ensure that those on low to moderate incomes can qualify for free GP care.</P>
        <P>Non-medical card holders can use the Drug Payment Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month, or approximately &euro;20 per week, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
        <P>In addition, the deputy will be aware that non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 212 and 213 together.</P>
        <P>Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.</P>
        <P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The current recruitment pause is a temporary measure initiated as part of the HSE financial break-even plan and will be reviewed at the end of this month.  In any instance where a critical or essential vacancy arises it may be filled through redeployment of existing staff by the line manager or re-assignment of responsibilities based on assessment of priority need.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, the HSE recognises that there are some circumstances where appointment of staff may be necessary in frontline services.  Accordingly, a process has been put in place to evaluate, monitor and approve requests for derogation from the general recruitment pause.  A group has been established which meets weekly to consider such applications.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s recommended immunisation programme is based on the guidelines of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  These guidelines are prepared with the assistance of an active committee from associated disciplines in paediatrics, infectious diseases, general practice and public health.  A vaccine to prevent against meningococcal infections, including meningococcal septicaemia, caused by the Meningococcus C strain of the bacteria is already included in the primary immunisation schedule.  The vaccine referred to by the Deputy is pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PVC) which protects against pneumococcal infections, which include pneumonia, septicaemia and bacterial meningitis.  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) has recently completed a review of our immunisation schedule and the Chief Medical Officer of my Department has received the updated guidelines.  These new guidelines include the addition of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PVC) to the schedule.  PVC vaccine provides a high level of protection to young children from pneumococcal infections.  It is proposed to introduce the new schedule in 2008.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>
        <P>Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</P>
        <P>With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the <Col N="888"/>EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated &euro;153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P>
        <P>In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a weekly subvention in respect of their child.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.</P>
        <P>It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</P><Col N="889"/>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data received this month.  Where appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Group in question has been approved for transitional funding under the NCIP Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS), and a letter of approval has issued this week from the Childcare Directorate of my Office.  This funding will, for the first six months of 2008, be based on the level of funding currently being provided to the Group under the EOCP staffing support grant scheme and subject to the necessary contractual arrangement with Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the EOCP and NCIP.</P>

        <P>Prior to the establishment of the NDRDI, the main source of information on drug related deaths was the General Mortality Register.  Statistics in the General Mortality Register are collected by the Central Statistics Office which measures &mdash; as it is required to do &mdash; direct drug-related deaths based on an international classification system.  It does not have a reliable measure of deaths which are indirectly related to drug use and so does not provide the full picture of drug-related deaths.  For example, a death through an infectious disease contracted through drug use may not feature in the General Mortality Register as drug-related.</P>

        <P>To remedy the above limitations the NDRDI was established.  The data for the Index is drawn from a number of sources including the General Mortality Register; the Coroner&rsquo;s Service; the Hospital In-patient Enquiry (HIPE); and the Central Treatment List.  The Index includes statistics from the coroner&rsquo;s service on &ldquo;sudden and <Col N="893"/>unexpected deaths with positive drug toxicology or a history of drug dependency&rdquo;.  These data are extracted from closed coroner files.  Files may not be closed for a period of time due to a number of reasons such as awaiting toxicology results, pathology results, Garda reports and delay in criminal court proceedings.  These processes must be complete before an inquest is held and the file closed.  For example, for some deaths which occurred in 2003 the inquest was held in 2005.  This indicates that there may be up to a 2 year delay before the cause of death is ascertained and the file is closed.  2004 is the latest year for which data is available as the work is done retrospectively.</P>
        <P>A steering committee, co-chaired by the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform provides general and technical advice on the development of the Index and the first report from the NDRDI will be available in late 2008.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.  My Office will respond to the letter enclosed shortly.</P>
        <P>Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), tar<Col N="894"/>geted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</P>
        <P>With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated &euro;153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P>
        <P>In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a weekly subvention in respect of their child.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a <Col N="895"/>not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.</P>
        <P>It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July of this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 is being used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual services, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data received as part of the application process for transitional funding.  Where appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for <Col N="896"/>disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>

	<P>The Health Strategy 2001 included a commitment to provide an additional 3,000 acute hospital beds. Significant progress has been made on this commitment. The average number of in-patient beds and day places available in public acute hospitals was 12,145 in 2001 (11,374 in-patient beds and 771 day places).

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251, 252 and 259 together.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 I have introduced a number of significant changes to the manner in which the assessment for medical cards and GP visit cards is undertaken.  The assessment guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29%.  Applications are now considered on the basis of income net of tax and PRSI and allowance is made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work.  In June 2006, I agreed with the Health Service Executive (HSE) a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those used in respect of medical cards.  As of 1st November 2007, the number of persons holding a medical card exceeded 1.27 million, an increase of some 125,000 since the beginning of 2005.</P>
        <P>My Department does not hold data which would enable it to assess the effect, and hence estimate the cost, of increasing the medical card threshold to &euro;337.35 per week in order that all those on the minimum wage would qualify.  However, based on a recent medical card costing exercise undertaken by my Department, on foot of a  Parliamentary Question, it is estimated that the average annual cost of providing a medical card to a person aged between 18 and 65 years is approximately  &euro;1,200 per annum.</P>
        <P>This figure does not take account of the following:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Potential additional cost in terms of income forgone by public hospitals in respect of A&amp;E attendance and in-patient charges;</P><Col N="903"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The possible cost, depending on the circumstances of a person retaining a medical card, of such benefits as aids and appliances;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Costs in other areas of Government in which the holding of a medical card may be used as a means of determining entitlement to services or benefits.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">The Programme for Government commits to the following:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Indexing the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Doubling of the income limit eligibility of parents of children under 6 years of age, and trebling them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Allowing people with disabilities to work without losing key essential medical card cover after 3 years;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Implementation of an annual publicity campaign and making applications easier so as to increase uptake amongst those who are eligible for Medical Cards and GP Visit Cards.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My Department is at present considering the most appropriate approach to the implementation of these commitments.  In addition my Department and the HSE will continue to monitor on an ongoing basis factors which may have a bearing on the setting of the qualification thresholds for a medical card or GP visit card, such as changes in income levels generally, the nature of typical household outgoings and changes to the various social welfare schemes.</P>
        <P>My Department is also examining the steps necessary to give effect to the Towards 2016 commitment to review the eligibility criteria for the assessment of medical cards in the context of medical, social and economic/financial need with a view to clarifying entitlement to a medical card.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive has detailed operational guidelines in place for the assessment of medical card applications.  The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that every person entitled to a medical card or GP visit card is given the opportunity to avail of their entitlement and that there is a consistency of approach to means-testing nationally.  The guidelines include provisions dealing with persons in receipt of certain allowance/benefits, for a period of 12 months or more, who are entitled to retain their medical card for 3 years on taking up employment.  These include persons receiving Job Seekers Allowance and Job Seekers Benefit.</P>
        <P>My Department does not hold data which would enable it to assess the effect, and hence estimate the cost, of increasing the number of years from 3 to 5 for which a person entering the labour market may keep their medical card, as recommended in the 2006 Report by the National Economic and Social Forum titled &lsquo;Creating a More Inclusive Labour Market&rsquo;.  However, based on a recent medical card costing exercise undertaken by my Department, on foot of a  Parliamentary Question, it is estimated that the average annual cost of providing a medical card to a person aged between 18 and 65 years is approximately &euro;1,200 per annum.  Accordingly, the estimated average additional cost of allowing a person with full eligibility and entering the labour market to keep their medical card for five years instead of three is approximately &euro;2,400.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>
        <P>Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</P>
        <P>With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to dis<Col N="906"/>advantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated &euro;153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P>
        <P>In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a weekly subvention in respect of their child.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.</P>
        <P>It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged <Col N="907"/>parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data received this month.  Where appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Group in question has been approved for transitional funding under the NCIP Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS), and a letter of approval has issued this week from the Childcare Directorate of my Office.  This funding will, for the first six months of 2008, be based on the level of funding currently being provided to the Group under the EOCP staffing support grant scheme and subject to the necessary contractual arrangement with Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the EOCP and NCIP.</P>

Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data received this month.  Where appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Group in question has been approved for trans<Col N="910"/>itional funding under the NCIP Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS), and a letter of approval has issued this week from the Childcare Directorate of my Office.  This funding will, for the first six months of 2008, be based on the level of funding currently being provided to the Group under the EOCP staffing support grant scheme and subject to the necessary contractual arrangement with Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the EOCP and NCIP.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>
        <P>Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</P>
        <P>With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated &euro;153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community <Col N="914"/>childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P>
        <P>In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a weekly subvention in respect of their child.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.</P>
        <P>It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My <Col N="915"/>Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.

Where appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>
        <P>Applications from Groups entering the new scheme are currently being processed and when validated, these Groups are issued with letters from the Childcare Directorate of my Office approving transitional funding under the NCIP Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS).  To date seven of the Groups named by the Deputy have been approved transitional funding.  This funding will, for the first six months of 2008, be based on the level of funding currently being provided to the Group under the EOCP staffing support grant scheme and subject to the necessary contractual arrangement with Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the EOCP and NCIP.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>
        <P>Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), tar<Col N="919"/>geted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</P>
        <P>With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated &euro;153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P>
        <P>In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a weekly subvention in respect of their child.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a <Col N="920"/>not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.</P>
        <P>It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data received this month.  Where appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Group in question has been approved for transitional funding under the NCIP Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS), and a letter of approval has issued this week from the Childcare Directorate of my Office.  This funding will, for the first six months of 2008, be based on the level of funding currently being provided to the Group under the EOCP staffing support <Col N="921"/>grant scheme and subject to the necessary contractual arrangement with Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the EOCP and NCIP.</P>

        <Quest> if a child (details supplied) in County Kildare suffering from dyspraxia is entitled to a medical card in their own right; the criteria laid down as Government policy as to the criteria a child must adhere to in order that they would be entitled to a medical card; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The assessment of eligibility to medical cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and, with the exception of persons aged over 70 who have an automatic entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants.  Under Section 45 of the Health Act, 1970 medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
        <P>This provision also entitles qualifying dependants to avail of a medical card.  The HSE may also grant a person full eligibility for a particular service, where the person would be unable, without undue hardship, to provide that service for themselves or their dependants.</P>
        <P>In assessing an application for a medical card on behalf of a child, the HSE uses guidelines based on the means of the child&rsquo;s parent(s)/ guardian(s), which includes their income, certain allowable outgoings and the effect of other factors which may impact on their ability to meet the cost of GP services.  Under the assessment arrangements, income derived solely from Department of Social and Family Affairs payments or HSE payments is disregarded, even if these exceed the assessment guideline limits.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is understood that Shannon Airport is making every effort to ensure that year-round transatlantic services are maintained. I would be confident that the Airport Authority, with the continued support of business and tourism interests in the region, can respond to the challenges and opportunities presented by Open Skies.</P><Col N="924"/>
        <P>Experience has shown that the liberalisation of aviation markets results in a greater level of competition among airlines, lower fares and the development of a wider range of services. I understand that several studies have projected that the Open Skies agreement will lead to considerable economic benefits for Ireland, for the business sector, for the tourism industry and for the air transport industry itself.</P>
        <P>It should also be borne in mind that the new services by Aer Lingus from Washington, San Francisco and Orlando, and the potential for additional services by US carriers, provide the opportunity to substantially grow more North American business to Ireland. Traditional travel patterns and the attractiveness of the tourism product in the West, suggest that over 50% of such incremental business will involve visits to Ireland&rsquo;s Western regions.</P>
        <P>On 7 November, Aer Lingus announced that it would for Summer 2008 maintain daily direct flights between Shannon to New York and Shannon to Boston and a daily flight to Chicago via Dublin. This reflects a continuation of the schedule now being operated over the winter 2007/2008 period. In comparison with the 2007 summer schedule the difference in the 2008 schedule is that the Chicago service is operated not on a direct basis but indirectly via Dublin.</P>
        <P>The operation of two daily direct services between Shannon and the U.S. entails the provision of well over 400,000 seats to/from Shannon.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Commuting by private car is growing in Ireland and our economic success and growing population has contributed to the increase in transport demand.  One such area relates to school travel.  Figures from the 2006 Census indicates that the percentage of primary school children being driven to school by car has risen to 55% in 2006 compared to 27.7% in 1991.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Transport 21 investment programme is providing significant public transport benefits and it also includes proposals to manage travel demand.  There are also a number of initiatives targeted at school children to reduce reliance on the car as a mode of transport. My Department has provided funding to the Dublin Transportation Office (DTO) who have introduced measures in schools to increase the number of children who walk and cycle, improve safety on the school run, reduce school-related congestion and improve physical health and fitness. The programme has been very successful and currently has 29 schools with a combined student population of approximately 10,400 with 545 teachers.  A further roll-out of the programme is being considered at present.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Science is responsible for the school transport scheme and there are no plans at present to extend the existing free transport in urban areas for certain school children.  The Government is committed to delivering a Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan, which will consider all policies impacting on travel demand.  This will be published in 2008 after a full public consultation process and issues such as free transport for schoolchildren in urban areas can be considered further in that context.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 283 to 285, inclusive, together.  </P>
        <P>The information requested by the Deputy available to my Department is currently being collated and will be forwarded to the Deputy in the coming days.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Road Transport Act, 1932 as amended, provides the statutory basis for regulating the provision of public bus services by private bus operators.  The Act provides for the grant of annual continuous licences, annual seasonal licences and occasional licences.</P>
        <P>Section 11 of the Act establishes specific criteria for the determination of applications, which provide that</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The service is required in the public interest having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Whether the service is sufficient in terms of frequency and duration to meet the requirements of the public</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Whether the applicant has the organisation and equipment necessary to carry out the service.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">Failure to meet the test established by reference to those criteria will result in the refusal of an application.</P>
        <P>Information relating to applications that are being processed or applications that were not approved, including details relating to the identity of the applicant and the services to which the application relates are commercially sensitive to the operator concerned and are treated as confidential and will not form part of the information to be supplied.</P>
        <P>Dublin Bus is not subject to licensing in accordance with the provisions of the 1932 Road Transport Act, as amended.  However, the initiation or alteration of a bus service by the Company is subject to compliance with the necessary regulatory requirement of giving advance notice to my Department and to compliance with the provisions of Section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 concerning competition with licensed private operators.  The details of all current licences issued to private operators are available to view on my Department&rsquo;s website.  All services in operation by Dublin Bus are available on that Company&rsquo;s website and are listed in the Company&rsquo;s scheduled timetable.</P>

        <Quest>  the number of people as of 31 October 2007 who were employed in his Department; the number who were permanent employees; the number who were temporary staff; the number who were contracted staff; if he will provide comparative figures for 31 October 2002; and if he will provide the information in tabular readable form.  </Quest>

	<P>As of 31 October 2007 there are 456.82 staff employed in my Department.  This is a whole time equivalent (wte) figure and all staff included are permanent employees.  There were 10 temporary staff employed in my  Department as of 31 October 2007.  All these staff are on contract.</P>
        <P>The functions of the Department of Transport changed following the Government election in 2002 and this led to substantial movement of staff among Departments.  While there are no readily available figures for staff employed on 31 October 2002 the figure on 31 December 2002 was 509.47 (wte).  The Department does not have a figure available for temporary staff employed at that time.</P>
        <P>Staffing numbers between 2002 and 2007 are not directly  comparable since, in addition to the changes in functions in 2002 referred to above, the Department experienced staff movements as a result of a number of other changes in functions since then. These include the Department taking responsibility for maritime issues on 1 January 2006, the establishment of the Road Safety Authority on 1 September 2006 and the recent transfer of responsibility for non-national roads and related matters to the Department from the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 296 and 297 together.  </P>
        <P>I fully recognise the importance of air connectivity to Shannon Airport and the West of Ireland generally.  This country already has an air services Public Service Obligation (PSO) scheme in operation.  The scheme provides for the subvention of air services from Dublin to Kerry, Galway, Knock, Sligo, Donegal and Derry.  These PSO routes serve regional airports which, <Col N="932"/>because of their remote locations or limited runway facilities, find it difficult to attract commercial scheduled air services.</P>
        <P>The relevant EU Council Regulation, (EEC) No. 2408/92 of 23 July 1992, allows a Member State to establish a PSO route in respect of scheduled air services to an airport serving a peripheral or development region in its territory, where such air services are considered vital for the economic development of the regions concerned and where air carriers are not prepared to provide them on a commercial basis.  In addition the Department is aware that there may be opportunities for State intervention under the Community Guidelines on Financing of Airports and Start up aid to Airlines departing from Regional Airports (2005/C 312/01).</P>
        <P>My Department has recently written to the EU Commission with a view to having an in-depth engagement on the options for facilitating the provision of air services to meet the connectivity requirements of the West of Ireland in a liberalised, competitive aviation market.  My officials have requested an early meeting with the Commission on the matter.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of uninsured drivers is estimated by the insurance industry to be in the range of one hundred thousand drivers or 6%.  This is calculated by taking the number of registered vehicles from the National Vehicle and Driver File maintained by the Vehicle Registration Unit and subtracting the number of exempted vehicles, e.g., State vehicles.  The resulting figure is compared to the number of policies in force.  An allowance is also made for fleet insurance where a number of vehicles are insured on a single policy.  </P>
        <P>The Internal Market Directorate of the European Commission has undertaken a survey among Member States of the European Union on uninsured vehicles, within the European Union.  There are a number of factors which must be taken into account when making international comparisons.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The calculations methods used among Member States when arriving at the number of uninsured vehicles are very diverse.</P><Col N="933"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Some Member States have not disclosed the method used to calculate the estimate of uninsured vehicles, or the number of vehicles on which the estimate is based.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Insurance in Ireland and the UK is on the driver whereas in other Member States, insurance is on the vehicle.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The most comparable Member State is the UK because the insurance is on the driver rather than the vehicle.  Their estimate at approximately 5% is similar to Ireland.  However the method used to arrive at this figure is not comparable to the method used in Ireland.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">Several steps have been taken in recent years to reduce the level of uninsured driving. The Garda Traffic Corps has been substantially expanded to improve compliance with all road traffic legislation including motor insurance requirements. <Col N="934"/> Legislation has also been put in place to extend the powers of the Garda&iacute; to permit the seizure of all uninsured vehicles.  In addition, since the introduction of the Penalty Points system, 6,778 persons have received penalty points for uninsured driving up to the end of October 2007.</P>

	<P>As I previously advised the Deputy in my reply to his Parliamentary Question on 31st October, 2007, my Department issued a licence on the 3rd October, 2007 in accordance with the Road Transport Act, 1932 to a private operator for a high frequency bus service from Swords via the Port Tunnel to the City Centre.  </P>
        <P>On the 19th November, 2007, the private operator commenced the operation of some of the licensed services.  It is a condition of the licence that the services are in operation in their entirety within 4 months from the date of issue of the licence.  Following the introduction of the high frequency service, my Department is considering the Dublin Bus proposal to re-route four of its existing Route 41X services from Swords via the Port Tunnel.  My Department will advise Dublin Bus of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>Contacts between my Department and management in Dublin City Council on this matter are continuing, and my Department received photographs on 15 November showing arrangements for the parking of vehicles fully rather than partially on a footpath, in what appears to be a variation of the on-street loading bay parking provided for in this country. </P>
        <P>The paramount matter to be considered in relation to permitting parking fully or partially on pavements is the impact of any such measure on the safety and convenience of pedestrians and persons in wheelchairs who use the footpaths.  The most recent Parliamentary Question on this subject is No. 415 of 5 December 2006.</P>

	<P>The vast majority of notifications on proposed awards to Irish citizens received in the Department of Foreign Affairs from foreign Governments relate to honorary awards which do not confer titles of nobility or honour.  They are dealt with at official level in the absence of a Constitutional requirement that they be brought to the Government. </P><Col N="939"/>
        <P>Since 1997, we are aware of three cases where titles of nobility or of honour were conferred on Irish citizens by another State, one in 2001 and two in 2005.  In all three cases, we understand that the persons concerned were also citizens of the State conferring the awards.  The prior approval of Government was sought and granted in two of these cases; in the third case, the approach to the Department was made two days after the award.  This approach referred to an earlier request in 2005 in which the Department had been asked to approve and had agreed to an honorary award for the person concerned.  In the event, the honorary award was changed to a substantive one.  While taking account of this background, the Department also emphasised to the Government concerned the importance on all such occasions for the prior approval of the Government to be obtained.</P>

	<P>Strong systems and financial controls are in place across my Department to ensure efficiency and value for money in both Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs) and Vote 29 (International Cooperation). </P>
        <P>My Department is committed to completing and publishing five major Value for Money reviews in the period 2006-2008.  Two of these, dealing with funding for emigrant services and the Government&rsquo;s response to the Tsunami, have been completed and published.  A further report, on Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance to Mozambique, will be published shortly and a fourth, on the Passport Service, is nearing completion.  The final Value for Money review in this cycle will be on expenditure in the fight against HIV/AIDS in developing countries; a tender process is currently underway to identify a suitable company to conduct the review.  All of these reports, when completed, are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and sent to the relevant Select Committee.</P>
        <P>More broadly, my Department has established a Procurement Management Unit which is responsible for promoting a strategic approach to the achievement of value for money by (a) integrating value for money principles within the Department&rsquo;s management processes; (b) developing and implementing an annual Corporate Procurement Plan for the Department; and (c) promoting best procurement and project management practices throughout the Department.</P><Col N="940"/>
        <P>The preparation of the Department&rsquo;s Corporate Procurement Plan involves a detailed analysis of purchasing expenditure for the purpose of identifying specific areas where better value for money outcomes and efficiencies can be achieved by improved purchasing practices.  The Plan identifies actions such as aggregation of requirements which may be used in appropriate cases to enhance the Department&rsquo;s purchasing power and thereby achieve better value from suppliers.  For example, the Department currently avails of aggregated arrangements, along with other Government Departments, for air travel booking services and the purchase of desktop computers and I understand that these arrangements have yielded significant financial benefits and administrative efficiencies.</P>
        <P>In addition, in the design and implementation of the new biometric passports, my Department was one of the first participants in the public sector-wide peer review system for the management of major ICT projects, which helps ensure that cost and time targets are realistic and achievable.</P>
        <P>Under the Management Information Framework, which is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s Strategic Management Initiative, my Department has implemented a range of measures to ensure more efficient financial transactions and more effective under the Management Information Framework, which is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s Strategic Management Initiative, my Department has implemented a range of measures to ensure more efficient financial transactions and more effective use of resources, as well as to assist decision-making about resource allocation.  These include new budgeting and financial systems and the preparation of detailed financial procedures manuals for both Vote 28 and Vote 29.</P>
        <P>As is the case for all Government Departments, the new Strategy Statement currently under preparation in my Department will set out performance indicators against which our progress in achieving our goals can be measured.  Combined with increasing delegation of budgetary responsibility to Heads of Divisions, this means that we are better able to align our resource allocations to our business objectives.  These measures, together with a rigorous approach by line managers on an ongoing basis, ensures that the Department&rsquo;s financial resources are used efficiently and effectively, in line with the Government&rsquo;s policy priorities.</P>

	<P>My Department operates a diplomatic mail service to facilitate secure communication between the State and our Missions abroad.  Ireland currently has a network of 75 resident diplomatic and consular Missions abroad and 87 Honorary Consulates.  To date in 2007, the operation of Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic mail service has cost &euro;941,675.</P>
        <P>The expenditure, to date in 2007, on postage accrued by my Department is &euro;1,254,582.  Over a million Euro of this expenditure was spent by the Passport Office forwarding passports to our citizens.  While we do not differentiate in our accounting system between registered and standard postage costs, passports are normally sent to citizens through An Post&rsquo;s &ldquo;swiftpost&rdquo;, which is a type of registered post service.  In regard to courier services, the costs accrued to date in 2007, both at Headquarters and across our Missions, amount to &euro;179,431. For convenience, I am setting out the above in tabular form.</P>

	<P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to application processes operated by my Department to provide services to the public and also applications involving Local Authorities. </P>
        <P el="10"><i>Passport Application Process</i></P>
        <P>To date in 2007, the Passport Office has processed 665,590 applications. The majority are <Col N="945"/>channelled through the Passport Express service operated by An Post, and in the case of Northern Ireland, by the Royal Mail. The Passport Office guarantees that a person using these services will receive his or her passport within 10 working days provided that the application is complete and in order.</P>
        <P>It is also possible to apply for a passport using the ordinary postal service, through Embassies and Consulates abroad and in person at the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork. The turnaround time for these applications varies depending on the time of year and the level of demand on the passport service.</P>
        <P>In the case of urgent travel it is possible to provide a forty eight hour service, and in the case of emergency a same day service. This emergency service is also available at weekends. The level of service provided by the Passport Office is continually reviewed to ensure maximum efficiency, effectiveness and value for money.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Consular Application Processes</i></P>
        <P>The Department also processes applications for Irish citizenship by Foreign Births Registration and for letters of freedom for Irish citizens who require them in order to get married abroad.</P>
        <P>In general, the processing of applications for Irish citizenship by Foreign Births Registration for persons resident in Ireland is currently taking about six weeks, from the initial submission of applications until the Certificate confirming citizenship is issued, provided that full documentation is presented. The timescale for processing these applications at our Missions abroad can vary depending on the volume of applications received, whether the documents initially submitted were correct and complete, and other local circumstances. Efforts are made to process applications as quickly as possible while ensuring that the legal requirements under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts are met and that only applicants who are entitled to Irish citizenship are approved.</P>
        <P>A letter of freedom to marry, often referred to as a Certificate de Coutume or a Nulla Osta, is only valid for a marriage ceremony that takes place within 120 days after it is issued. Applicants are advised to apply in good time and there is at present no significant waiting time for these applications to be processed. I might also mention that the Department provides a same day service for authentication of official documents.</P>
        <P>The level of service for Foreign Births Registration and for letters of freedom is kept under constant review. In particular, we have focused on the development and implementation of IT applications which can improve application procedures. For the convenience of members of the public, we have recently begun to provide these services from the Department&rsquo;s Offices in Cork, in addition to the existing service provided in Dublin. </P>
<P el="10"><i>Irish Aid</i></P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, Irish Aid have a number of programmes where development agencies and Non-Governmental Organisations <Col N="946"/>can apply for funding for development projects. On occasion, some Local Authorities have applied for funding for specific development initiatives and these have been considered on the merits of the applications.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the recent measures he has taken to develop Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy in the context of the EU common foreign and security policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) is intended to impart greater coherence and unity to all elements of the European Union&rsquo;s action in the international arena and in its relations with external actors. As such, the CFSP covers the entire range of the Union&rsquo;s foreign policy concerns. While some new measures are envisaged in the Reform Treaty to enhance the Union&rsquo;s external coherence and visibility, including the establishment of a new post of High Representative, the CFSP will remain essentially inter-governmental in nature, with policy and decisions continuing to be made by Member States. </P>
        <P>Ireland remains strongly positive about our participation in the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The general principles underlying the CFSP very much accord with our own priorities and values, in particular the emphasis on multilateral cooperation and the role of the UN, promotion of democracy and human rights, conflict prevention and resolution, and the eradication of poverty. Involvement in the CFSP gives us the chance to shape policy within a bloc which is much more influential than we could be acting only by ourselves. The inter-governmental nature of the CFSP, with unanimity continuing to be the general rule for decision-making, allows Ireland to influence positively the determination of the Union&rsquo;s foreign policy priorities and ensure that they accord to the maximum extent possible with our own national priorities.</P>
        <P>Ireland participates actively in discussion of all CFSP issues with our EU partners, both in Brussels and in the coordination of EU positions in international organisations and at international conferences. In practice, this is the principal day-to-day focus of the relevant officials in my Department. I meet my EU colleagues each month at meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. Within the CFSP, Ireland is particularly active in urging common EU action on international issues to which we attach particular importance, such as the situations in Darfur, Burma and the Middle East, and on issues where traditionally we have led internationally, such as non-proliferation and disarmament, and respect for human rights.</P>
        <P>Within this broad context, there remains ample scope for us to take specifically national initiatives, or to work with small groups of like-minded partners.

        <P>Of the remaining two buildings, most of the public areas in Iveagh House have in recent years been made accessible to people with disabilities.

	<P>At present, there is only one organisation which operates under the aegis of my Department which was established on a statutory basis. </P>
        <P>The Ireland &mdash; United States Commission for Educational Exchange (the Fulbright Commission) finances study, research, teaching and other educational activities between Ireland and the United States of America. It was established in 1957 by means of the Scholarship Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1957 as amended by the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1991.</P>
        <P>The Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1991 also provided for the establishment of the Ireland &ndash; United States Educational Fund (which is controlled by the Minister for Finance). The income accruing to the Fund is made available to the Fulbright Commission for the purposes of its functions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have certain responsibilities in regard to the Commission. Under section 3(1) of the 1991 Act, I am responsible for the appointment of four members of the eight-member Commission. Under section 5(10) of the 1991 Act, I am responsible for laying before both Houses of the Oireachtas, a copy of the annually audited accounts of the Ireland &ndash; United States Educational Fund and the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General thereon.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent years, the international community has redoubled its efforts to address the serious challenges facing the continent of Africa. The adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000 marked a watershed in uniting the international community around a single set of development objectives. Agreed targets include halving extreme poverty and providing universal primary education by 2015. The MDGs have resulted in renewed determination and pledges to meet the needs of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries, most of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. </P>
        <P>According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), development assistance provided by the world&rsquo;s major bilateral donors has almost doubled &mdash; from less than US$54 billion in 2000 to around US$104 billion in 2006. During the same time period, support to Africa increased significantly and allocations to sub-Saharan Africa rose from US$11 billion to around US$28 billion. It is clear that Africa is receiving real and substantial increases in development assistance. These increases are set to continue. Ireland&rsquo;s own Official Development Assistance (ODA), the main geographical focus of which is on Africa, has increased from &euro;250million in 2000, to over &euro;800million in 2006.</P>
        <P>More generally, there are strong indications that development assistance is having a positive effect in Africa. In its &ldquo;Africa Development Indicators 2006&rdquo; report, the World Bank noted that, in contrast to the 1990s, conflicts have declined and growth has improved. Improved growth rates will contribute to achievement of the MDGs. It also notes that, since the second half of the 1990s, many low income African countries, including Mozambique and Uganda, have lifted significant percentages of their citizens above the poverty line. Africa is at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s programme of official development assistance and we have played an important role in the positive news emanating from both of these countries.</P>
        <P>Development assistance is important to continued social and economic progress on the continent of Africa and it is imperative that donor nations continue to make progress towards the UN goal of 0.7% of GNP for ODA. However the governments of the developing nations of Africa also have a responsibility to promote good and accountable governance to ensure that poverty reduction is at the heart of their national develop<Col N="951"/>ment plans. It is the combination of external assistance from donors such as Ireland, allied with an internal commitment to poverty reduction by African nations, which will make a real and sustainable change for the better in the lives of the poor in Africa.</P>

	<P>At the EU-Western Balkans Summit at Thessaloniki in 2003, European Union leaders reiterated the European perspective of the countries of the Western Balkans, and affirmed that the future of these countries lies within the EU, once they have fulfilled all of the requirements necessary for membership. </P>
        <P>Croatia is engaged in accession negotiations with the EU. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has obtained candidate status, although its negotiations on accession have not yet commenced. The EU is in the course of completing Stabilisation and Association Agreements with other countries in the region.</P>
        <P>On 6 November last, the European Commission published its annual package of enlargement reports. These include an assessment of progress made by candidate countries, including Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in meeting EU membership criteria. They also assess progress made by countries elsewhere in the Western Balkans towards realisation of their European perspective</P>
        <P>The Commission reports that accession negotiations with Croatia are advancing well. Areas where further progress is still needed include judicial and administrative reform, minority rights, and refugee return.</P>
        <P>With regard to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Commission reports on some progress in reforms and considers that the pace of reforms needs to be accelerated in key areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While noting progress in many areas, the Commission considers that the region as a whole needs to move forward in building modern democracies and developing a political culture of dialogue and tolerance. The Commission reports that Albania and Montenegro, which have signed Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the EU, have made progress in a number of areas but still face major challenges. Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to move ahead with reforms, <Col N="952"/>in particular in governance and police reform. The Commission acknowledges that Serbia has the administrative capacity to make substantial progress towards realising its European perspective. However, there will need to be full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) before the Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiated with the EU in recent months can be signed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The United Nations has the lead role in the search for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. The Government fully supports the leadership of the UN Secretary General in this important work, and we welcome the ongoing efforts of the Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Representative to Cyprus, Mr. Michael Moeller, to bring the two sides together to seek progress toward a political settlement. </P>
        <P>On 8 July 2006, the UN Under Secretary General for Political Affairs, Dr. Ibrahim Gambari, brokered an agreement between the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, and Mr. Mehmet Ali Talat, representing the Turkish Cypriot community, on a set of principles, recognising that the status quo was unacceptable and that a comprehensive settlement was both desirable and possible. They agreed to begin immediately a two-track process involving discussions by committees of issues affecting the day-to-day life of the people and, concurrently, of substantive issues leading to a comprehensive settlement. However, these committees were not subsequently established, due to disagreements on their respective mandates and terms of reference. Following a hiatus, consultations at official level on these issues resumed at the end of January 2007, though so far without any breakthrough.</P>
        <P>On 5 September, the Special Representative facilitated a meeting between President Papadopoulos and Mr. Talat, the first such encounter between the two leaders since last year. While regrettably no substantive progress was made on this occasion, we welcome the reopening of political dialogue which this meeting represents. Both sides have also recently sent submissions to the UN Secretary General, outlining new proposals to take the process forward. The Secretary General has not formally commented on these <Col N="953"/>proposals as yet. We are encouraged that the two sides are continuing their contact through the UN, and remain hopeful that this dialogue may yet help to unblock the stalemate in the process.</P>
        <P>Ireland will continue, through our Embassy in Nicosia and in contacts with the Embassies of Cyprus and Turkey in Dublin, to encourage both sides to renew their commitment to the negotiating process and the achievement of the objective of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federal State through an honourable, balanced and durable settlement protecting and guaranteeing the basic interests and aspirations of all.</P>
        <P>At EU level, proposals have been brought forward by the Commission to encourage the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community. At its meeting in January 2007, the Council of Ministers noted progress, in particular as regards the implementation of a financial aid regulation. The Council called for work to continue aimed at adopting a Regulation &ldquo;on special conditions for trade with the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control&rdquo;. The Commission&rsquo;s direct trade proposal has subsequently been the subject of discussion at working group level, but consensus has not yet been found on a way forward.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mr. Mich&eacute;al Martin T.D., has overall responsibility for negotiations on the current global trade round taking place in the framework of the World Trade Organization. My Department works closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in developing and implementing policy aimed at ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are promoted and protected in the negotiations. It had been hoped that the negotiations would be largely concluded by the end of 2007. However, it is now certain that they will extend well into 2008. </P>
        <P>Ireland fully supports a successful conclusion to the current round of WTO negotiations. I can assure the Deputy that the Taoiseach, my colleagues the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and <Col N="954"/>Employment and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and myself avail of every opportunity to advance Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the negotiations. The Government will continue to press for an overall balanced outcome to the negotiations across the different strands, including agriculture, industrial goods and services. The Government will strongly oppose any proposal that places an unfair burden on agriculture. Ireland also attaches the highest importance to promoting the interests of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries in the negotiations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 and 333 together.</P>
        <P>Negotiations between the Government of Sudan and the Darfur rebel factions began on 27 October in Libya under joint AU/UN mediation. However, the start of this process was overshadowed by the absence of many of the principal rebel groups, which boycotted the talks. The UN and AU have sent representatives to Darfur and Juba to find and speak with the rebels who did not attend, and it is hoped that the talks will recommence in December. The unwillingness of the Government of Sudan to agree to the inclusion of specific and essential non-African personnel and capabilities is hampering the deployment of the UN/African Union hybrid force, UNAMID. Although there have been some improvements in recent months on humanitarian access in Darfur on foot of the UN/Government of Sudan Joint Communiqu&eacute; agreed last March, the humanitarian situation is again becoming more difficult. Banditry, the fragmentation of the rebel groups and growing tensions within camps for Internally Displaced Persons are making the tasks of both peace negotiators and humanitarian agencies increasingly difficult.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, delays in the implementation of the north-south Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) have led to heightened tensions <Col N="955"/>within the Government of National Unity, culminating in the withdrawal of the Sudan People&rsquo;s Liberation Movement (SPLM) from that Government in October. However, from my discussions with President Bashir, I am satisfied that the Sudanese Government remains committed to the CPA and has no wish to return to war with the south.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The European Union strategy in this troubled region has three dimensions &ndash; support for political processes to bring about peace, support for peace-keeping to allow peace to take hold and to improve security, and humanitarian and development aid to alleviate suffering and help build the foundations for sustainable development. On all of these tracks, we are working closely with the UN and with the African Union, both in Darfur and in southern Sudan. The situation in Darfur is regularly discussed at meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, most recently in Brussels on 19 November. I also discussed the Darfur crisis when I met with UN Secretary General Ban in New York on 2 October.  During my visit to Sudan earlier this month, I raised with the Sudanese government the need for full, effective and prompt deployment of UNAMID. I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s disappointment at the lack of progress in implementing the May 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement, and at the failure of many rebel groups to travel to Libya for the current talks. I also expressed my concern over difficulties with implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between north and south. I once again impressed upon the Sudanese Government the importance of humanitarian access to those in need of our help.</P>
        <P>The will of all the parties involved &ndash; the Government of Sudan and all the different rebel groupings &ndash; is absolutely crucial to the success of our efforts. Bitter experience has shown that it is impossible to impose a sustainable peace from the outside. Ireland remains open to considering carefully targeted measures against any party standing in the way of a peaceful resolution of the situation in Darfur. However, we believe that ongoing efforts by the AU and UN to broker peace should be supported and given time to succeed.</P>
        <P>Ireland and the European Union stand ready to assist in addressing some of the underlying causes of the conflict through targeted development assistance, once the conditions allow. Since 2006, Irish Aid has provided over &euro;33 million in funding for humanitarian and development purposes in Sudan, including Darfur.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the deputy to my reply to Question No. 328 of 23rd October 2007, (below), which deals with all the issues raised in the question. </P>
        <P>As has been made clear in reply to previous questions, it is not the policy of the Government to draw up any kind of &ldquo;league table&rdquo; of countries in relation to human rights abuses. Ireland closely monitors developments in the human rights situation throughout the world and where the situation warrants, we make known our concerns to the Governments in question, either bilaterally, through the EU, or through action at the UN General Assembly or the UN Human Rights Council.</P>
        <P>The risk of human rights violations is of course greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak. Development is essential to allow people the full enjoyment of their human rights, and Africa lies at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s development co-operation programme. Irish Aid supports specific actions designed to promote human rights, including by strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions, in particular through legal training. Irish Aid has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.</P>
        <P>The link between security and human rights protection is a key concern in many parts of Africa. Where state authorities do not have the will or capacity to enforce the rule of law, people are extremely vulnerable to serious human rights violations, with little prospect of redress. Some of our most serious human rights concerns relate to countries which are currently suffering from conflict, or which have recently emerged from conflict, such as Sudan, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Sustained efforts are required to restore the kind of stability within which human rights can be protected. Ireland supports the work of the UN Peacebuilding Commission in this regard, as well as the considerable efforts of the European Union. On a national basis, Ireland also promotes security and stability in Africa through our active development aid programmes and through our participation in peacekeeping, most recently as part of the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) from 2003-2007. Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the planned ESDP mission to eastern Chad and the Central African Republic will help improve security for the many refugees and displaced people in that region.</P><Col N="957"/>
        <P>The EU, in its political dialogue with African countries under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, regularly raises issues which arise in the development of democracy and the need for protection and promotion of human rights. The EU also pursues human rights issues when appropriate through the UN General Assembly and UN Human Rights Council. Ireland is fully associated with EU statements on human rights in these bodies. We actively supported the UN Human Rights Council&rsquo;s consensus resolution on Darfur, which was adopted in March 2007. Ireland and the EU have also made statements of concern about Zimbabwe at the Human Rights Council this year.</P>
        <P>Together with our EU partners, Ireland has been a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means to combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations in relation to four situations, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, northern Uganda, the Central African Republic and the Darfur region of Sudan, and we will continue to monitor this work closely.</P>
        <P>In addition to the United Nations and European Union, the African Union also has an important and growing role to play in the protection of human rights in Africa. The aims of the African Union include the promotion of peace, security, and democracy on the continent, as well as the promotion and protection of human rights, in accordance with the African Charter on Human and People&rsquo;s Rights. The emergence of African standards in this area is a very welcome development. The African Union is an important strategic partner for Ireland and the European Union and for the international community generally.</P>
        <P>We will continue to proactively address human rights challenges in the course of our work in support of peace, security and development for all of the people of Africa.</P>

        <P>Across the development programme, strategies are devised in close consultation with national governments and other stakeholders to ensure that the support provided complements national poverty reduction plans and targets those most in need. These strategies include monitoring frameworks to ensure that our assistance is effective and that it is implemented for the benefit of those for whom it is intended.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid has in place rigorous accounting and audit controls which are essential to ensuring a transparent, effective and high quality programme. Irish Aid programmes are regularly and intensively audited and evaluated by independent audit firms, by Irish Aid&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit and by the independent Audit Committee of the Department. Programmes are evaluated to ensure that funds are used for the purposes intended and in respect of outcomes and value for money.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the methods used by Irish Aid in devising its strategies, combined with its audit and evaluation systems, serve to protect the funding provided in accordance with best international practice and highest standards in this area.</P>

	<P>My Department does not provide direct funding or grants to businesses but provides funding to a number of State <Col N="959"/>Agencies, including the County and City Enterprise Boards, Enterprise Ireland and F&Aacute;S, through whom assistance is delivered directly to businesses.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>The 35 County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) provide a source of support to small businesses with 10 employees or fewer.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants.  All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of enterprises provided that the projects, which should generally be in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector, have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities.  In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland provides funding and expertise to companies with ten or more employees in the indigenous manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors who wish to expand through increased export activity.  Through its network of 34 overseas offices, Enterprise Ireland assists client companies to create and implement successful strategies for market entry, development and growth.</P>
        <P>EI Clients must be Irish owned, be a manufacturing or an internationally trading services enterprise or be an overseas company in the food, drink and timber sectors seeking assistance to locate in Ireland, must employ more than 10 people or be a high growth start-up according to criteria defined by the Board of EI.  In addition Enterprise Ireland must be satisfied that the company will produce products for sale primarily in world markets; produce products of an advanced technological nature for supply to internationally trading or skilled sub-supply firms within the State; and produce products for sectors of the Irish market which are subject to international competition or is a service industry, as defined by relevant ministerial order.  Enterprise Ireland may support the development of new and existing waste recovery/recycling firms, on the basis of demonstrated need, that produce value added raw materials or products for export.  There should be a particular focus on R&amp;D and technology development as well as management and skills development for this sector.</P>
        <P>Should the person concerned wish to contact Enterprise Ireland in order to discuss the supports that may be available, subject to the qualifying criteria outlined above, they should contact the following Enterprise Ireland Executive; Mr. Gerry O&rsquo;Brien, Enterprise Ireland, High Poten<Col N="960"/>tial Start Up Business Unit, Shelbourne Road, Dublin 4, (Tel. No. 01-6092171).</P>
        <P>Alternatively if the proposed project falls within the remit of the County and City Enterprise Boards I would suggest that the person concerned should make direct contact with their local CEB and explore what level of assistance, if any, may be available to them. Contact details for individual CEBs can be found by accessing the following website; www.enterpriseboards.ie.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>At the Africa Caribbean Pacific (ACP)-EU Joint Council of Ministers in May of this year, all 6 ACP regions, together with the EU, reaffirmed their intention to conclude full EPAs (including provisions on services and investment) before the deadline of the 31st of December 2007. After that date the current trading arrangements under the Cotonou Agreement must end if the EU and our ACP partners are to meet our international obligations in the World Trade Organization. </P>
        <P>However, some of the ACP regions have since indicated that it will be difficult for them to agree the terms of a full EPA by that deadline. In those cases, the EU is proposing to put in place new arrangements to deal with trade in goods after the 31st of December and to continue with negotiations for all other aspects of a full EPA into next year.</P>
        <P>At the EU General Affairs Council of the 21st of November last, the Development Ministers considered the current state of the negotiations for EPAs and issued Conclusions. In those Conclusions, the Council noted the right of all ACP states and regions to determine the best policies for their development and acknowledged that the ambition for the scope of an EPA may differ from one region to another.  The Council continues to support the inclusion of provisions on trade in services, investment and other trade related areas in EPAs, as it believes that such provisions fulfil the objectives of economic and trade cooperation as set out in the Cotonou Agreement and contribute to the release of the <Col N="965"/>full development benefits of EPAs. As far as the negotiations of services provisions go, the Council has said clearly in the Conclusions that it supports a flexible and phased approach.</P>
        <P>Ireland agrees that the negotiations must be conducted in a spirit of goodwill, flexibility and understanding. We have always said that any resulting agreements must be supportive of ACP countries development needs and their poverty reduction strategies. Accordingly, any proposal from an ACP region, such as the one from the SADC region, should be considered.</P>
        <P>In the case of trade agreements such as the EPAs, it is the Commission who have the competence on behalf of the EU to negotiate, and not the individual Member States. As far as the SADC region is concerned, I understand from the Commission that it remains optimistic that agreement on an EPA can be reached with at least some of the countries in that region by the deadline of the 31st of December 2007.</P>

	<P>Under the Industrial Development Act of 1986, as amended by the Acts of 1993 and 1995, IDA Ireland has the power to acquire, hold and dispose of land and any other property or any interest therein for the purpose of facilitating an industrial undertaking.  Only when the Agency intends to dispose of land, other than in accordance with facilitating an industrial undertaking, is the consent of the Minister of the day required.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the management of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s industrial property portfolio is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency, as part of the statutory responsibility assigned to it by the Oireachtas, and, other than considering applications for consent, it is not a matter in which I have a function.</P>
        <P>I have already written to the Deputy on this matter in reply to previous representations.   In view of the request for additional information I have brought the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns to the attention of the Secretary of IDA Ireland and asked <Col N="966"/>that he reply directly to the Deputy on the matter.</P>

	<P>The Employment Permits Section has indicated that, in general, employment permits are only issued in respect of full-time positions and for persons over the age of 18.  However, under the current Spousal/Dependant Permit Scheme the Employment Permits Section can consider applications in respect of eligible Dependants over the age of 16.  This is in line with the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, which stipulates that for regular employment a person must be over the age of 16.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the application of the competition legislation in the context of the dispute between the Health Service Executive and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union; if it was the intention of that legislation to prohibit negotiation between an employer and a representative organisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that both the Health Services Executive (HSE) and the Department of Health separately received legal advice on the interpretation and application of the Competition Act 2002.   Section 4 of that Act prohibits anti-competitive practices, such as price fixing, by &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo;.  An &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; is defined in the Act as &ldquo;a person being an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged for gain in the production, supply, or distribution of goods or the provision of a service&rdquo;.  This definition has been in use in Irish competition law for some time and is supported by EU case law.  Section 4 mirrors <Col N="968"/>Article 81 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. </P>
        <P>Under the 2002 Act, the Competition Authority is the independent statutory body responsible for enforcing competition law.  The Authority has previously found that self-employed persons are &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; for the purposes of the 2002 Act, and as such collectively bargained agreements concluded by representative bodies on behalf of such persons are prohibited agreements under section 4.  The Competition Act does not prohibit negotiations between an employer and a representative organisation when such a body is representing employees.</P>

	<P>Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which is administered by my Department, grant aid is provided to <Col N="975"/>local authorities towards the capital costs of a new or replacement public swimming pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool provided by local authorities themselves or by other bodies where the application for capital funding is supported by the local authority.  Under the Programme, a local authority undertakes four stages in developing a swimming pool project.  These, in order of progress, are: Feasibility Study/ Preliminary Report; Contract Documents; Tender and Construction.  Local authorities may not proceed to the next stage of a project until prior approval issues from my Department.  Grant aid is formally allocated when the tender is approved.  The Department&rsquo;s technical advisors, the Office of Public Works (OPW), evaluates each stage.</P>
        <P>The current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme closed to new applications on 31 July 2000 and the priority since then is to continue to support those projects remaining within the programme.  Of the 57 projects within the current round, 43 projects have been formally allocated grant aid, of which 29 have been completed and 14 are under construction or about to start construction.  3 projects are out to tender and the remaining 11 are at earlier stages in the process.</P>
        <P>My Department is completing a Value for Money and Policy Review Report of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme at present.  The Report is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date and what changes, if any, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  Thereafter, following consideration of the recommendations in the Report, it is my intention to launch a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  When the programme is re-opened, it will be open to all local authorities to submit applications under the terms that will apply.</P>

	<P>Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department, grants are allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The organisation in question was allocated grants totalling &euro;100,000 in 2006 and 2007.  The 2006 grant allocation of &euro;50,000, which was allocated towards surface replacement, has all been drawn down bar the retention amount of &euro;2,500 which will be paid upon receipt of proof of completion of the project.  The 2007 grant allocation of &euro;50,000, towards gym equipment, has been formally approved and my Department is awaiting further documentation in order to process the payment.</P>

	<P>Questions in relation to excise duty are matters for my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Mr Brian Cowen TD, in the first instance.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Department of Finance, in conjunction with other relevant Departments including my Department, is exploring alternative non-tax support mechanisms that could be put in place, where appropriate, to maintain the assistance currently being provided, subject of course to compatibility with EU State Aid requirements.</P>
        <P>Obviously, pressures on costs affecting tourists or tourism-related businesses, including pressures caused by the removal of reliefs, could lead to further pressure on the competitiveness of <Col N="980"/>Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry, which operates in a highly competitive marketplace.</P>
        <P>I understand that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, has previously advised the House that, in the interim, the reduced rates applicable to fuel used will be maintained.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 377 and 378 together.</P>
        <P>At the end of September, the latest month for which full expenditure data is available, the amount spent on social insurance based income supports was &euro;5,318 million. The figure for social assistance payments was &euro;5,975 million. The corresponding amounts for the full year in 2007 are expected to be &euro;7,202 million and &euro;8,219 million, respectively.</P>
        <P>The total number of scheme payments made to the end of September, 2007 is 48.1 million.</P>
        <P>My Department makes in excess of 67 million payment transactions annually to some 1.7 million customers covering all payment schemes. A range of payment methods are used including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />i.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />by cheque by post to the customer&rsquo;s address;</P>

	<P>The overall goal of my Department&rsquo;s Debt Management Strategy is to actively pursue the recovery of debt to maximise recovery levels, with due regard to value for money and with particular emphasis on recovery from people no longer dependant on welfare payments.  The objectives of the strategy are:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To maximise the recovery of overpayments</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To efficiently record, report and monitor the occurrence and recovery of overpayments</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To fulfil statutory, accounting and reporting obligations</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To conduct overpayment and debt management as efficiently as possible</P>
<P el="5" FLI="0">One of the key elements to the strategy is the introduction of the Overpayment and Debt Management (ODM) computer system which will record all overpayments and debt recovery data and allow for timely and efficient management of debt.</P>
        <P>The new ODM system is now in operation in the Department&rsquo;s headquarter buildings in Dublin, Letterkenny, Longford and Sligo and is being rolled out on a phased basis to the remainder of the Department.  It is expected that all areas will be using the new system by mid 2008.</P>
        <P>The debt management strategy is based on having a clear policy on overpayments and debt management in the Department and making the organisational and procedural changes necessary to support this. Guidelines setting out debt management procedures and defining the responsibilities of areas in relation to debt management and debt management procedures are currently being finalised.  These will issue shortly to ensure consistency across the Department in the process of debt recovery.</P>

	<P>Meeting the needs of an ever increasing and diverse customer base involves a considerable level of interaction between our staff and the public, whether by post, in person, by phone etc and with their representatives.</P>
        <P>Our income support work impacts on the lives of almost every person in the State. The bulk of our activity is in the delivery of direct services to the public (over 1 million people each week claim a social welfare payment) and, when their depen<Col N="987"/>dents are included, a total of more than 1.5 million people benefit from weekly payments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department administers some 50 separate welfare schemes and services. In any given year we process nearly 1.9 million application forms, receive some 6.5 million phone calls and issue 68 million payments. The Department publishes 87 information booklets/leaflets and a wide range of forms.</P>
        <P>In that context the amount spent by my Department on couriered documents, registered post and standard post to end October 2007 (latest date for which information is available) is set out in the following tabular statement.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Waiting days have been a feature of the illness benefit and jobseekers payment schemes since their inception and are a feature of similar social security schemes in many countries. The application of a three-day waiting period avoids the disproportionately high administrative costs involved in processing large numbers of claims of a very short duration.</P>
        <P>The waiting day rule is not applied in every case. Where a person is subject to intermittent spells of unemployment it would clearly be unreasonable to impose the three waiting days for each such jobseekers benefit claim.</P><Col N="989"/>
        <P>In the case of illness benefit and jobseekers benefit, spells of unemployment are aggregated so that the waiting period is confined to the first three days of the aggregate period of interruption of employment subject to falling within rules governing linking. Linking rules provide that any two periods of unemployment, not separated by more than 26 weeks, are treated as one such period and payment may be made from the first day of the later claim. The same principle applies in the case of jobseekers allowance but the linking period is 52 weeks instead of 26 weeks.</P>
        <P>In addition, linking rules apply in a variety of ways across schemes, e.g. where a person claims illness benefit immediately following an unemployment benefit claim. I would emphasise that people who need financial support are not left without such support during waiting days. A person who has no other income may claim supplementary welfare allowance in respect of the days in question.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 387 and 388 together.</P>
        <P>A Deciding Officer disallowed the jobseekers allowance claim of the person concerned from 4 October 2007, on the grounds that he was not genuinely seeking employment.  The Deciding Officer took the view that he had failed to produce sufficient evidence on the basis that he produced one letter from an employer who was not in a position to offer employment.  The person concerned has now appealed this decision.</P>
        <P>In making a decision on a jobseekers claim, a Deciding Officer will take all relevant factors into account, including the level of job opportunities available and the person&rsquo;s availability for and their efforts to find work.  The onus is on the customer to prove to the satisfaction of the Deciding Officer that he or she satisfies the conditions for receipt of payment, including that he or she is genuinely seeking full-time work on a consistent and ongoing basis.  Deciding Officers do not refer claimants to specific employment opportunities, nor could their decisions be conditional on them being in a position to do so.</P>

	<P>The Bereavement Grant is a payment designed to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses.  It is a scheme that relates specifically to those who have made PRSI contributions and is payable on the death of an insured person, his/her spouse and dependent children under age 18 or under age 22 if in full-time education.</P>
        <P>In order to qualify for the bereavement grant the deceased must have:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a total of 156 PRSI contributions paid since entry into insurable employment, or</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />at least 26 PRSI contributions paid since entry into insurable employment and 39 PRSI contributions paid or credited in the Relevant Tax year.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">Unfortunately the deceased person in this case does not satisfy the PRSI contribution conditions to qualify for bereavement grant.</P>
        <P>Where there are insufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for bereavement grant a person may receive assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Under this arrangement, the local Community Welfare Officer may make a single payment to help meet exceptional expenditure, for example, for funeral expenses, which a family could not reasonably be expected to meet from their own resources.</P>

        <P>Initially, the Personal Advocacy Service will be located in Dublin.  When the service is well established, it is anticipated that advocates will be located in a number of key highly populated areas around the country.

	<P>Maternity Benefit is an income maintenance payment awarded by this Department to eligible women for a 26-week period on foot of a confinement. Entitlement to this benefit for employees is contingent on entitlement to statutory Maternity Leave.</P>
        <P>The right to Maternity Leave is established under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 &mdash; legislation which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Any changes to current Maternity Leave provisions are a matter for him to consider in the first instance &mdash; and entitlement to Maternity Benefit would normally follow suit.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of social welfare legislation, the 26-week period of core statutory Maternity Leave attracts a payment from my Department &mdash; subject to certain social insurance <Col N="992"/>contribution conditions being fulfilled. Maternity Leave legislation also provides an option for a woman to take an additional 16-week period of Maternity Leave that does not attract a benefit payment.</P>
        <P>With regards to the potential expansion of maternity leave and benefit arrangements, the scheme has experienced significant improvements, notably in the last few years, in terms of both the duration of the payment and the level at which it is paid. Budget 2006 provided for Maternity Leave &mdash; and thus Maternity Benefit payments &mdash; to be extended from 18 to 22 weeks. A further 4-week extension was implemented in the aftermath of Budget 2007 &mdash; bringing the total period of paid Maternity Leave and Maternity Benefit to the current level of 26 weeks.</P>
        <P>In terms of the level of payment, in 2000, the rate payable was the equivalent of &euro;219.41 per week over 14 weeks &mdash; or &euro;3,071 for the duration. Maternity Benefit is now paid at a weekly rate of &euro;280 over 26 weeks &mdash; or &euro;7,280 for the duration.</P>
        <P>Under the Maternity Leave (Amendment) Act, 2004, further changes have been made to the Maternity Benefit scheme. The period of leave that must be taken before the end of the week during which the baby is due has been reduced from 4 to 2 weeks. Also, the final 4 weeks of Maternity Benefit can now be postponed in the event of a child being hospitalised.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the recently agreed Programme for Government contains the following commitment in relation to &lsquo;Giving Parents More Time with Their Children&rsquo;:</P>
<P LI="1">&ldquo;Over the next five years we will:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Increase paid maternity leave by five weeks and make all leave after the first 26 weeks available to either parent&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Progression of this commitment is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the first instance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The income disregard for Disability Allowance does not contain any recommended guidelines on the number of hours of employment that can be availed of but instead operates so as to encourage the maximising of overall income that can be earned from the combination of disability allowance and employment.</P>
        <P>As of June 1, 2006, the income disregard operates on the basis of a tapered withdrawal rate between &euro;120 and &euro;350.  This means that all <Col N="993"/>income up to &euro;120 is disregarded as means when assessing entitlement, while income between &euro;120 and &euro;350 is assessed on the basis of 50 cents for every euro earned.  The effect of this tapered withdrawal rate is that a single person can earn up to &euro;420 per week before their Disability Allowance fully ceases.</P>
        <P>Prior to the introduction of the tapered withdrawal, a flat income limit of &euro;120 was in place meaning that once a person exceeded earnings of &euro;120 per week, payment of their Disability Allowance was withdrawn on a euro for euro basis.  However, this approach ensured there was no incentive to increase earnings above &euro;120 and, therefore, was in conflict with one of the underlying policy principles relating to incentives to work, i.e. that there must be a reward for working.  A review published by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in 2004 of the Illness and Disability Payment Schemes suggested that continually increasing the income disregard level is not the most appropriate answer to the disincentive problem</P>
        <P Just="Left">Instead, that Review favoured introducing a mechanism which would allow for the gradual reduction of social welfare benefits as earnings increase, thereby allowing people who increase their earnings or employment potential to see an increase in the overall income level.  This approach benefits those in employment, irrespective of the hours worked or hourly rate earned.  It was in this context that the tapered withdrawal rate was introduced in 2006 and has, thus far, resulted in a 30 per cent increase in the number of people availing of the disregard for earnings from rehabilitative employment.</P>

        <Quest> the number of deposits provided by community welfare officers to rent supplement claimants in each of the past three years; the value of deposits in each year; the way in which community welfare officers make payments to claimants; and the procedures in place to recover deposits when the tenancy ends and to prevent double payments when the claimant moves to another tenancy. </Quest>

	<P>Statistics requested by the Deputy on rent deposits over the last 3 years are set out in the table attached.</P>
        <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential once-off cost, such as a payment of a rent deposit, which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.  There is no automatic entitlement to this payment and each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case and at the discre<Col N="994"/>tion of the Community Welfare Officer (CWO).  Such payments are confined to occurrences which the Executive considers to be unexpected, unforeseen or exceptional.</P>
        <P>Rent deposits are usually paid to the tenant by cheque. If the landlord or tenant terminates the tenancy the tenant can use the returned deposit to secure a new tenancy.  If a tenant has a legitimate grievance in relation to the refund of a rent deposit which they have paid to their landlord, they may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to have their dispute resolved through the board&rsquo;s dispute resolution process.</P>
        <P>In certain circumstances and with the permission of the tenant, payment can be made directly to the landlord.  In such circumstances the CWO may make arrangements with the landlord to return the rent deposit to the Executive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Every effort is made to ensure that payments of rent deposits are only made once by checking my department's computer systems to see if any previous deposit had been paid.  In general multiple rent deposits are not paid to the same person.  However, CWOs have discretion in this regard, in particular in instances of potential homelessness.</P>

        <Quest> if there are plans within his Department to re-examine the allowance for the household package for old age pensioners; his views on splitting that allowance up for 75% towards gas costs and 25% towards electricity costs as supported by a large number of old age pensioners; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[30998/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity/gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence schemes, is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefit package or free travel retain that entitlement.  This measure is in place <Col N="995"/>to ensure that households who have this entitlement do not lose it on the death of a spouse.  People aged over 70 years of age can qualify for the household benefits package regardless of their income or household composition.  Those aged under 70 must live alone or only with certain excepted people in order to qualify.</P>
        <P>In order to provide further assistance to recipients of the household benefits package the number of units of electricity covered by the scheme was increased from 1,800 to 2,400 with effect from January 2007.  An equivalent increase in the natural gas allowance had already come into effect in October 2006.  These allowances continue to also cover standing charges and the associated VAT.</P>
        <P>In addition to the electricity and gas allowance, my Department also operates the national fuel scheme the aim of which is to assist householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April and can be used to pay for any form of heating fuel.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person&rsquo;s normal heating expenses.</P>
        <P>A number of improvements have been made to the scheme in recent years including the easing of the means test and extending the duration of payment from 26 weeks to 29 weeks.  Budget 2006, provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of &euro;5, from &euro;9 per week to &euro;14 per week and to &euro;17.90 in designated smokeless areas.  Budget 2007 provided for a further increase of &euro;4 per week to &euro;18.  This means that the level of the fuel allowance will have doubled in the last two years.  The income threshold for eligibility for fuel allowance was also increased from &euro;51 to &euro;100 per week over and above the contributory pension to enable more people to qualify for the payment.</P>
        <P>The electricity allowance element of the household benefits package is paid as a credit on a customer&rsquo;s electricity bill.  The natural gas allowance is an alternative to the electricity allowance for people whose homes are connected to a natural gas supply.  People can choose to have the allowance applied to either their electricity or their gas bill, which ever is most beneficial to them.  Splitting the allowance as proposed would have significant administrative implications both within the Department and within the utility companies participating in the scheme.</P>
        <P>However, a range of proposals, including splitting the gas/electricity allowance, has been made in relation to the household benefits package.  These proposals and the associated costs will be kept under review in the context of the objectives of the scheme and budgetary resources.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 396 and 397 together.</P>
        <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over.  All carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance, regardless of their age, also receive a free travel pass.  It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension.</P>
        <P>People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.</P>
        <P>The proposal to extend the scheme to people aged under 66 years who may not be in receipt of a qualifying payment is one of a number of proposals that have been made to extend the free travel scheme.</P>
        <P>A study published by the National Council on Ageing and Older People in 2001 suggests that approximately 31% of people who retire early do so due to illness or disability.  It is not known how many of this group would not be in receipt of an illness or disability type payment from my Department.  As such, it is not possible to estimate the cost of the proposal.</P>
        <P>In any event, further extensions to the free travel scheme can only be considered in a Budgetary context and taking account of the financial and other needs of those not covered by the existing arrangements.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the buildings occupied by his Department which are and which are not fully accessible to people with disabilities in tabular readable form. </Quest>
        <QRef>[31035/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The information requested by the <Col N="1006"/>Deputy is set out on the attached tabular statement. With the exception of those offices on which I have included specific comments, all my Department&rsquo;s Offices meet a basic standard of physical accessibility.  In addition, my Department is continually upgrading its facilities; there is a replacement programme in place for offices found to be totally unsuitable for their purpose.  In relation to those offices which are currently <Col N="1007"/>inaccessible, alternative arrangements are made, where necessary, to accommodate individual accessibility requirements.</P>
        <P>Section 25 of the Disability Act, 2005 requires that all public buildings be fully accessible by 2015 and that they at least meet the minimum standard as set out in Part M of the Building Regulations, 1997-2006.  The Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan (as required by section 31 of the Act) sets out an Action Plan in this regard. This Plan provides for a programme of formal access audits of our buildings and twelve such audits have been undertaken to date.</P>
        <P>My Department is working closely with the Office of Public Works (OPW) to ensure the <Col N="1008"/>commissioning of these audits in line with the Sectoral Plan targets.  That Office will also undertake any works of a substantive nature which are recommended on foot of the auditing programme.</P>
        <P>At present, 19 out of 141 locations are deemed not to be fully accessible for people with disabilities.  In the case of 7 of these locations, replacement with new offices is planned over the next 2 years.  The ultimate objective of my Department is to ensure that all its offices used by both customers and staff with disabilities are fully accessible well in advance of the deadline of 2015 contained in the Disability Act.</P><Col N="1007"/>

	<P>My Department administers some fifty schemes and makes payments to one million people each week.  This volume of business requires the Department to depend heavily on ICT and to have responsibility for significant amounts of data.</P>
        <P>Data is generated by staff entering information to internal data-bases or by receipt of information from external agencies such as the General Register office in respect of births.  Data is stored in the Department&rsquo;s data centres with arrangements in place for inter-site backup and security.</P>
        <P>My Department relies on other agencies in carrying out its business, for example An Post for payments, and Revenue for the collection of PRSI contributions.  Information is also provided to other agencies such as the CSO and Health agencies for various purposes in accordance with legislation.  This necessitates exchanges of data on a regular basis with the relevant organisation.</P>
        <P>My Department operates a policy whereby personally identifiable information must be exchanged legally and securely and must be capable of being audited. Data provided to service providers is typically transferred over direct secure electronic links.  Backup arrangements for these include encryption of physical files. While the Department is satisfied that other data exchanges (e.g. off-site backup) have been carried out in an appropriately secure manner, it is reviewing all data exchanges in view of recent events in the UK.</P>
        <P>Over the past few years, the Department has undertaken a number of Information Security projects and has established internal structures to implement its policies.  In tandem with this, technical work has been carried out on the Department&rsquo;s infrastructures and systems.  It is clear, however, that further work, resources and time are required to achieve an optimum operational state.</P>
        <P>Finally, a High-Level Group has been established within the Department to review access management and control.  The primary focus of the Group is to formulate the Department&rsquo;s policy on access to data and to initiate a further work programme to address the issues involved.</P>

        <Quest> the amount spent on the rent allowance scheme in 2007; the projected cost for 2008; and the potential savings in rent allowance if 12,000 recipients of the scheme <Col N="1018"/>were removed from the private renting sector and placed in social housing. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Expenditure on rent supplement to end October 2007 was &euro;324 million. It is estimated that a further &euro;68 million will be spent on the scheme by end 2007, bringing total expenditure for this year to &euro;392 million.  The Pre-Budget Outlook published on 18th October provides &euro;775.5 million for supplementary welfare allowance in 2008, just under &euro;414 million of which is for rent supplement.  The final allocation for rent supplement in 2008 will be published in the revised estimates volume early in the new year. </P>
        <P>Assuming no change to the average rent or number of recipients, a once-off transfer of 12,000 claims from the rent supplement scheme would result in a reduction in expenditure of &euro;80 million per annum.</P>

        <P>A decision was taken, however, to extend this contract for a further month to 30 November 2007 in order to provide time for my officials to complete their discussions with the operating company, Carbery Isle Ferries Ltd, regarding an extension of its contract for a period of up to one year.</P>
        <P>The decision to open these discussions was taken with a view to securing administrative efficiencies and in the context of the limited number of service providers available in this sector.  It should be noted that only one tender was received in response to the previous tender competition for this particular service and that, at a recent meeting of the Service Monitoring Committee, Sherkin Island representatives expressed satisfaction with the standard of service provided.</P>

	<P>The Charter of Rights for Farmers 2005/2007 sets out deadlines within which payments under the various schemes operated by my Department should be processed. A Charter Monitoring Committee involving the farming organisations and officials of my Department under an independent chairman meets on a regular basis to review compliance with the deadlines in the Charter.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Single Payment Scheme</i></P>
        <P>Under the Single Payment Scheme / Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, my Department processes approximately 130,000 applications each year. A system of combined application form is operated, thereby negating the necessity for those farmers eligible under both schemes to submit two application forms. The EU Regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme require that applications under that Scheme be submitted by 15 May of the year in question, while also providing that payments cannot be made before 1 December of the year of application. In the case of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, there is discretion as regards the payment date, which is generally mid-September, when the vast majority of applications were fully processed. It will be appreciated that the task of processing up to 130,000 applications is a substantial operation, with the necessity to confirm the detail contained in each individuals&rsquo; application, most importantly in respect of the various land parcels declared.</P>
        <P>Mindful of the adverse weather conditions experienced during the summer months of 2007, I made a successful case to the EU Commissioner that agreement should be forthcoming to allow advance payments under the Single Payment Scheme be made at the earliest possible date, 16 October &mdash; the start of the EU financial year. Following successful processing of applications, in <Col N="1028"/>excess of 95% of farmers received their advance payment on, or shortly after that date.  Payments under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme had commenced on 21 September and in excess of 90% of applicants had been paid within the following two weeks, with in excess of 98,000 farmers paid to date.  Those applicants under both the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme who have yet to be paid have received correspondence from my Department, which outlines the reasons for non-payment. As further cases are subsequently confirmed eligible, payment issues without delay.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Single Payment/Cross Compliance Inspections</i></P>
        <P>Two types of inspections are carried out for the purpose of implementing the Single Payment Scheme, Eligibility inspections (area checks) and Cross Compliance inspections.  Payment is not delayed where the Cross Compliance inspection is not finalised before payment date.   However the EU regulations require that all Eligibility checks are completed prior to payment.</P>
        <P>A total of 6,784 farmers who applied for the Single Payment were selected for eligibility inspections in 2007.  Some 4,086 were inspected using remote sensing technique without the need for an on-farm inspection.  To date some 6,337 eligibility inspections have been fully completed.  The cases remaining to be finalized are cases where a final decision could not be taken following remote sensing and these cases require a ground inspection to clarify the position.  It is expected that all remaining cases will be finalized in early December so as to allow full payment to issue where appropriate.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>On-Farm Investment Schemes</i></P>
        <P>Grant payments under the following on-farm investment schemes are being made in accordance with the deadlines set out in the Charter of Rights for Farmers 2005-2007:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Farm Improvement Scheme</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Farm Waste Management Scheme</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Sow Housing (Animal Welfare) Scheme</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Young Farmers&rsquo; Installation Scheme</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS)</i></P>
        <P>Over 85% of annual payment applications in REPS have been processed in line with the targets.  Additional staff resources have recently been assigned to my Department&rsquo;s local offices to assist with the processing of REPS files.  The required number of post-payment inspections will be completed by year-end and there have been no delays affecting payments to participants arising from these inspections.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Forestry Grants Scheme</i></P>
        <P>Grants under the forestry schemes are being paid in a timely manner.  Inspections may be required to confirm compliance with approvals <Col N="1029"/>granted but I am happy that this does not lead to unwarranted delays for applicants.</P>

	<P>The Government decision on the decentralisation of my Department includes the transfer of the local offices in Cork city to Fermoy, involving up to 100 staff. Since the announcement an implementation plan for Fermoy was put in place and my Department has worked with the OPW regarding a specification for the office and the identification of a site. OPW has made some progress in this regard lately and an official announcement is expected. Their latest estimate is that construction will be completed in the second quarter of 2009.</P>
        <P>Recruitment for Fermoy has begun and will be carried out on a phased basis in order to try to ensure continuity of business and the maintenance of service. Five applicants from the Central Applications Facility have been recruited to date and more appointments are planned. There is also a significant level of interest among existing staff.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Any area of a REPS farm designated as a Special Protection Area under the Wild Birds Directive, a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive or a Natural Heritage Area qualifies in REPS 4 for the Natura 2000 rates of payment:  &euro;282 per hectare up to 40 hectares, &euro;29 per hectare for next 40 ha up to 80 ha, &euro;22 per hectare for next 40 ha up to 120 ha and &euro;5 per hectare thereafter.  These rates also apply on commonage.  Areas recently proposed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) as Special Protection Areas for the Hen Harrier will automatically qualify for the Natura 2000 rates.   The NPWS operates a national scheme and farmers may choose to join either that scheme or REPS.  The issue of taxation of payments is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

Category C caters for farmers who sold their milk quota into the Milk Quota Restructuring Scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid Schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.  The person named was deemed unsuccessful under this category, as he did not sell his milk quota into a restructuring scheme within the specified period.</P>
        <P>The person named subsequently appealed this decision to the Single Payment Appeals Committee, who determined that the person named was eligible for an allocation from the National Reserve, based on additional information provided with the appeal. The person named has now received an allocation under Category C of the 2005 National Reserve, which necessitated a full re-calculation of the value of the entitlements for 2005, 2006 and 2007. This re-calculation is now complete and all outstanding payments for <Col N="1034"/>2005, 2006 and 2007 will issue shortly to the person named.</P>

	<P>The Single Payment Scheme is subject to ongoing scrutiny by auditors from the European Commission and the European Court of Auditors.   In its recent annual report for 2006, the European Court of Auditors highlighted what they regard as certain deficiencies in the operations of the Single Payment Scheme in a number of Member States including Ireland.   In particular, the Court of Auditors expressed the view that consolidation of entitlements was applied incorrectly in Ireland.  The report also refers to an incorrect approach taken by Ireland with regard to the transfer of holdings by lease and the report also suggests that there was a delay in establishing entitlements for certain farmers who applied for entitlements from the 2005 National Reserve.</P>
        <P>The position is that my Department refutes the Court&rsquo;s findings and has provided a comprehensive response to the matters raised during the course of the audit visit to Ireland.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to make clear that my Department is not preventing the operation of immersion models of education. My Department provides a range of supports to encourage <Col N="1042"/>the establishment of all-Irish schools and to encourage instruction and communication through Irish. The right of parents and children to choose education through the medium of Irish is fully respected, but this does not obviate the need for schools to implement all aspects of the national curriculum. What is at issue in this case is the requirement that schools should implement the minimum instruction time specified in the curriculum for English, and do so no later than the start of the second term in junior infant classes. </P>
        <P>The revised primary curriculum was launched in 1999 and provides an integrated programme of learning in the spheres of Languages, Mathematics, Social Environmental and Scientific Education, Arts Education, Physical Education, Social Personal and Health Education and Religious Education.  Page 27 in the Introduction to the Curriculum states &ldquo;It is a particular feature of Irish primary education that children, from the beginning of schooling, have experience of language learning in two languages.&rdquo; The curriculum also specifies a set of learning objectives for each area of the curriculum for 4 groupings &mdash; infant classes, first and second class, third and fourth class, and fifth and sixth class. It also sets out a suggested minimum weekly time framework for tuition. This provides that where a first language is being taught, there should be four hours instruction per week, and 3 hours per week where there is a shorter day for the infant classes. Where a second language is being taught, the suggested minimum timeframe is 3.5 hours per week, and 2.5 hours per week for infant classes with a shorter day.</P>
        <P>Furthermore the achievement of the curriculum objectives in every curriculum area at each of the four levels of primary schooling is an over-riding requirement in all schools. I have therefore determined as a public policy issue that the introduction of a minimum of 2.5 hours per week for English as Language 2 in Irish medium schools should not be delayed beyond the start of the second term in Junior Infants.</P>
        <P>I am convinced of the importance of ensuring that all children have access to the full primary curriculum from the earliest possible stage.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The role of the Ombudsman for Children is to promote and safeguard the rights and welfare of children and young people up to eighteen years of age.

Among these are the primary school curriculum in Physical Education, the revised Junior Cycle Physical Education syllabus, the Leaving certificate syllabus in PE  and the Health and Leisure module as part of the Leaving Certificate Applied programme. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The primary and Junior Cycle curricula are centred on the provision of physical education across six strands - athletics, aquatics, adventure activities, games, gymnastics and dance. At junior cycle, health-related activity is also included. Schools are encouraged to cover all the activities over time, taking account of the resources and facilities available.</P>
        <P>The physical education syllabuses which have been developed to date at junior cycle and senior cycle have tended, for practical reasons, to concentrate on the internationally-recognised core areas of activity mentioned above.  In so doing it is not suggested that there are not a variety of other activities which are worthwhile in their own right, including self-defence. Difficulties around including this as a core activity as part of the standard physical education syllabuses would include, for example, the skills base and training of physical education teachers to deliver such activities as the majority of physical education teachers would not be qualified to teach self-defence.</P>
        <P>Any activities that bring breadth and variety to the physical education programme in schools are welcome.  Physical activities such as self-defence, <Col N="1044"/>yoga, martial arts, lifesaving, First Aid, horse-riding, for example, are all to be found in many of the excellent Transition Year Programmes that are taking place in schools throughout the country.</P>

	<P>The Social Personal and Health Education programme, which is mandatory in primary schools and at junior cycle level, provides a framework under which the generic values and skills which underpin responsible decision-making, and respect for the rights and safety of others can be developed and promoted among students. SPHE has a specific personal safety strand within the programme, and this provides a mechanism through which road safety issues for all can be best dealt with in an age appropriate way. </P>
        <P>In addition, the Civic Social and Political Education programme, also mandatory at junior cycle, deals with important themes such as Law, Rights and Responsibilities, Democracy and Inter-dependence, which are also important in a road safety context.</P>
        <P>The implementation of SPHE and CSPE is being supported by resource materials on road safety developed by the Road Safety Authority. The RSA MACE &ldquo;Safe to School&rdquo; campaign at primary level was launched on 6 February 2007. It includes a DVD, posters, information leaflets, teacher worksheets for use within the SPHE curriculum, a guide for parents and a picture competition for students, and has been circulated to all primary schools. There is also a website www.safetoschool.ie which includes a walking guide, quizzes etc.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Streetwise programme for junior cycle pupils was launched in UN Road Safety Week on 24 April 2007. It covers road safety across 9 topics &mdash; walking, cycling, seatbelts, airbags, speed, driver fatigue, motor cycle safety, hazard recognition and the engineering aspects of road safety, to be delivered over approx. nine class periods. Streetwise is available for live implementation in 2007/8 following a successful pilot.</P>
        <P>A follow on programme has also been developed by the RSA in collaboration with my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Second Level Support Service for use in Transition Year, and is currently being piloted in schools. Covering areas such as seatbelt use, hazard perception and driver attitudes towards alcohol and drug use the Transition Year Road Safety Programme will also prepare students for the Driver Theory Test. The Road Safety Authority has also obtained input from the Gardai, NCT centres and Bus Eireann in the delivery of this programme.</P>

The recent priorities under the Programme have been the development of schools&rsquo; internal networking facilities and the provision of broadband connectivity for schools, which my Department has pursued in partnership with the Telecommunications and Internet Federation within IBEC.   Other recent developments include the introduction of the new Technology syllabus and the revised Design and Communication Graphics syllabus at Leaving Certificate level which were introduced this year with an associated investment of some &euro;14 million to schools to upgrade their facilities.   </P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the report that the Deputy refers to. The report has a number of interesting things to say about what contributes to quality in education systems. </P>
        <P>The report recommends getting the right people to become teachers. Irish teachers are relatively well paid by international standards with salaries that are higher than international averages, a factor that seems to contribute to attracting very high calibre candidates to the teaching profession.</P>
        <P>Our trainee teachers at both primary and post-primary level are drawn from among the highest achievers. Entrants to colleges of education from Leaving Cert level in 2007 required 465 CAO points for entry to the two largest colleges. Half the students entering those colleges would have achieved 490 points or more based on their Leaving Cert results.</P>
        <P>Similarly, at post-primary level, there is a quota system in place for entry to Higher Diploma in Education courses because demand for places on the courses far outstrips the number of places available. Successful candidates are drawn mainly from the highest achieving graduates from arts, science and business studies courses as well as a range of technology courses.</P>
        <P>The McKinsey report also recommends developing teachers into effective instructors. Apart from recruiting talented and committed people to teaching, the other important factors in the development of effective teachers are the initial training and professional development supports provided for teachers throughout their careers. The report emphasised building practical skills during initial training, and mentoring teachers during the induction stage. We are currently implementing a pilot induction programme for primary and post-primary teachers. With regard to continuing professional development, almost 600 specialist teachers are currently deployed in providing professional development support for teachers, especially in the introduction of new curricula and syllabuses at primary and post-primary level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The third major recommendation of the report is related to ensuring that the system is able to deliver the best possible instruction for every child. Much of our attention in this regard has focused on assisting children who might otherwise leave school without a good basic education, through dramatically improved supports for children with special needs and those from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above elements which contribute to attracting and supporting good quality teachers, the Teaching Council also has a specific remit to promote teaching as a profession. To date, it has produced a DVD, Cro&iacute; na M&uacute;inteoireachta (the Heart of Teaching), in which the <Col N="1047"/>views of graduates and prominent members of Irish society are provided: it records the fact that teaching continues to be held in high esteem in Ireland and highlighted the value placed on good teaching by Irish people. The Council will, in all its work, continue to protect the standards of the profession.</P>

	<P>The Youth Affairs Section of my Department supports a number of schemes and initiatives which provide non-formal educational opportunities for young people throughout the country through voluntary participation in youth work. This support consists mainly of grant-in-aid assistance for national and major regional youth work organisations under the Youth Service Grant Scheme, targeted youth work responses for young people through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme and support for youth clubs and groups at a local level through the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme. In addition, my Department has secured additional funding in 2007 from the Dormant Accounts Fund (Economic and Social Disadvantage Funding Measures) for small scale equipment grants for local youth groups/clubs. This Scheme complements my Department&rsquo;s existing Local Youth Club Grant Scheme.</P>
        <P>Links between youth clubs and youth work projects and schools are generally forged at local level and these relationships are seen as positive by schools and youth clubs/projects alike.</P>
        <P>Youth Officers have been assigned to the VEC sector to carry out the functions set out for VECs under the Youth Work Act, 2001. These Youth Officers are currently liaising locally with relevant organisations and clubs and this process will help to put in place a local framework that will facilitate inter alia the coordination of youth work services with other education programmes.</P>
        <P>A key objective of DEIS, the new Action Plan for educational inclusion, is to enhance integration and partnership working, both within the education sector itself and between my Department, education agencies and providers and all other Government departments, agencies, organisations and groups. Specific actions to be taken in relation to the integration of services and partnership working include increased alignment of the Youth sector measures with actions being taken by schools and school clusters/communities <Col N="1048"/>participating in DEIS to tackle early school leaving.</P>
        <P>The School Completion Programme (SCP), which is a key initiative under DEIS, aims to have a significant positive impact on levels of pupil retention in primary and second level schools and on the numbers of pupils who successfully complete the Senior Cycle, or equivalent. SCP is based on the concept of integrated services.  Effective supports must include multi-faceted actions that respond to young people&rsquo;s needs. They need to be both preventative and supportive, ranging from social and personal development to After school and Out-of-School supports, including sport and leisure activities as well as supports that target the young person&rsquo;s home and community life.  SCP is a collaborative programme where schools work in partnership with family, community, youth, and sporting organisations and with relevant national statutory and voluntary bodies, including Local Youth services that play a key role and in some areas provides breakfast clubs, after-school clubs and holiday supports.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the issue of student behaviour in our schools and I have introduced significant measures over the last few years to address this matter.</P>
        <P>In early 2006, I announced an implementation strategy following publication of &ldquo;School Matters&rdquo; the Report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools, and that strategy is now well advanced.</P>
        <P>At the core of the recommendations of the Task Force was the putting in place of a National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS). The NBSS was established in 2006 with the appointment of a National Co-ordinator and five Assistant National Co-ordinators. In addition, ten Regional Development Officers and fourteen part-time Associates were recruited to ensure the success of this significant initiative. A key feature of the composition of the National Behaviour Support Service is the assignment to it of a team of four psychologists.</P>

        <P>These have been seconded from the National Educational Psychological Service and their presence will ensure that the team operates in a multi-disciplinary way. In addition a Literacy Development Officer and a Research Officer have been recently appointed to the team.  The Literacy Development Officer will address literacy issues <Col N="1049"/>arising in the context of behavioural issues.  The Research Officer will carry out research of current Irish and international literature and test against reality situations in Irish schools.  This should provide an invaluable benchmark of the level of disruption in schools and the effectiveness of intervention by the NBSS.  A full-time administrator is based in Navan Education Centre.</P>
        <P>Since their appointment, the team has been working on a number of key issues:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />1.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />The development of a Draft National Framework for Behaviour Improvement.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />2.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />The development of models of good practice for systems in schools which assist with and impact on classroom and whole school behaviour.</P>

       <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />4.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />Research into and communication with behaviour support systems in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">The NBSS is currently working with 50 selected schools throughout the country.  Behaviour Support Classrooms have been established and staffed in 30 of these 50 schools. These classrooms provide an individualised intensive intervention programme for a targeted group of students.  The Behaviour Support Classrooms are staffed by at least one qualified wholetime teacher.  The Board of Management of the schools concerned have flexibility in relation to the employment of another wholetime teacher equivalent and may employ people with different expertise to cater for the needs of the students involved.   I want to emphasise however that these classrooms cannot be, in themselves, a solution to the issue of poor student behaviour. They must be one part of a holistic response which should see a school, actively supported by the Behaviour Support Team, defining for itself a pathway to improvement.</P>
        <P>The NBSS also propose to produce a training CD/DVD on all aspects of challenging behaviour, within the Irish context.  It is envisaged that this would be available to all schools.</P>

	<P>I launched the internet safety initiative, Webwise, which was developed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) in February, 2006.  The Webwise website, <i>www.webwise.ie</i>, provides information and resources in four specific areas, surfing, chatting, sharing and gaming to teachers, parents and students to help ensure that children and young people have positive and safe on-line experiences.   The NCTE published the Webwise Internet Safety Education Pack which was distributed to schools in March 2007.   This pack is designed as an adaptive resource to enable individual schools to be proactive in the area of internet safety.   The pack contains the Surfwise Educational Programme, an Internet safety programme for 7-14 year olds, which focuses on the key Internet Safety issues that relate to use of the Internet by children in schools. As well as classroom and take-home activity sheets, this education programme contains online interactive lessons that use animated characters to demonstrate how to search safely and how to check that information they come across online is reliable.  Now accompanied by the Chatwise Educational Programme, which addresses safe communication on the Internet, both learning modules are available on the Webwise website.  </P>
        <P>A course for teachers on Integrating Internet Safety into Teaching and Learning was developed by Webwise and is available as part of the NCTE&rsquo;s teaching skills initiative through the regional Education Centres.   A suite of thirteen Internet safety lessons has been developed by Webwise in collaboration with the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) Post Primary Support Service.  The lessons focus on personal safety issues and the Internet, as well as Internet Literacy issues so that children may develop skills in ways of keeping safe when using ICT.  These classroom resources are to enable teachers and students embed safer Internet practice into their use of new media.  These learning resources will be integrated into SPHE in-service training from January 2008.</P>
        <P>The NCTE&rsquo;s <i>watchyourspace.ie</i> website offers practical tips and advice and supports teenagers who use the web. A key feature is the advice given by teenagers to teenagers on how to cope with the fall-out from abuses and misuse of social networking and picture-sharing websites.  It has presentations of the key findings from studies of <Col N="1054"/>teenagers&rsquo; use of the Internet by other teenagers and is integrated with an online helpline service from Childline. The website was promoted through a poster campaign in schools.</P>
        <P>The importance of informing parents on internet safety is evident when one considers that the Webwise 2006 survey found that younger children are to a larger degree introduced to the Internet at home.  Of those Children surveyed that had used the Internet; 60% of children will use the internet for the first time at home, 22% at school, 7% with friends, 2% in an internet caf&eacute;, 6% in other places (3% didn&rsquo;t know or failed to answer this questions).  The National Parents Council Primary working with the NCTE has developed a seminar to take the mystery out of the Internet for parents and to give them the skills to engage with their children&rsquo;s online lives. The seminar gives a practical demonstration of the technologies and the websites young people are using. Participants hear young people talking about how they use the Internet, why it is attractive to them, and get an insight into children&rsquo;s main concerns about being online. Since its roll-out in September 2007, eighty seven schools have scheduled Internet safety seminars for parents.</P>
        <P>The Schools Broadband Programme provides broadband internet access to Primary and Post Primary schools and includes Content Filtering as an integral part of the service. The Content Filtering service is designed to control the level of access from schools, via the broadband network, to the wider internet. No school is connected to the internet via the schools broadband network unless it has confirmed that an Internet Acceptable Usage Policy is in place and it has selected a Content Filtering option.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Lisbon Convention and the EU Directive on Mutual Recognition of professional qualifications, Ireland is committed to giving appropriate recognition to qualifications from other countries.  The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland hosts a network of qualifications and quality assurance agencies from Ireland, Northern Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland, and this network has agreed a ready reckoner showing how levels of qualification in Ireland and the UK align with each other.  This provides useful information for employers, learners and education and training providers for comparing qualifications. In addition the Authority is a national recognition centre for qualifications which is linked with similar national centres throughout the EU.</P>
        <P>The teaching profession is regulated for the purposes of employment as a teacher in the public sector in Ireland.  EU Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications came into force on 20th October 2007 and ensures that professionals from any of the EU member states proposing to enter a regulated profession will have their qualifications and experience recognised appropriately.  The Teaching Council of Ireland is the competent authority for the regulation of the teaching profession in Ireland and holds the register of teachers approved to teach in publicly funded schools in the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a general principle, persons recognised to practice a regulated profession in their Member State of origin must be given recognition to practice that profession in a host EU Member State. However if there are shortfalls or significant gaps in the applicant&rsquo;s qualifications or experience <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> those required in the host Member State,  the host State may require a compensatory measure - either an aptitude test or an adaptation period under supervised practice which addresses the shortfall.   Therefore, such qualifications are examined on a case by case basis to ensure that the person concerned is appropriately qualified to teach in Irish schools. This is in line with normal practice under the EU Directive.  While the Teaching Council is familiar with the majority of teacher training programmes provided in Northern Ireland, there are some instances where the matter has to be referred to an assessor for further examination. In addition, there is a large volume of applications for recognition of qualifications gained in other jurisdictions, and this may sometimes lead to delay.</P>
        <P>Primary teachers trained in another jurisdiction, whose qualifications have been recognised by the Teaching Council, but who do not <Col N="1063"/>possess an appropriate Irish language qualification are granted provisional recognition to teach in national schools, but are required to gain competency to teach Irish within a 5 year period. In order to satisfy the Irish language requirement such teachers must pass in Irish language examination (Scr&uacute;d&uacute; C&aacute;il&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge) before being granted full recognition.</P>

	<P>Outdoor Education Centres (OECs) have been developed by Vocational Education Committees in order to enhance the quality of the educational experience for young people through outdoor education programmes. OECs cater mainly for primary and post-primary students, including young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. They also cater for third-level students, youth groups, special needs groups and adults. During periods such as school holidays, when the centres are not fully utilised for educational purposes, the centres generate additional income by providing courses on a commercial basis for the leisure and tourism market.</P><Col N="1064"/>
        <P>There are currently 9 recognised centres and 3 unrecognised centres. Funding was originally approved on the basis that the centres would be self-financing.  Accordingly, my Department&rsquo;s annual grants are contributory in nature and go mainly towards the core staffing costs involved in running the centres. The funding provided by my Department has increased considerably in recent years, and for 2007 was &euro;2.116m.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that extra financial supports are being provided to schools under the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) action plan for educational inclusion. In the last school year, DEIS related grants totalling more than &euro;17 million were paid to schools to meet the needs of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. This represented a substantial increase on the 05/06 level of almost &euro;12 million.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to prioritise the needs of schools serving disadvantaged communities going forward. The emphasis on tackling educational disadvantage in recent years is absolutely unprecedented. In 2007, we are investing nearly &euro;730 million in measures aimed at tackling disadvantage at all levels. This represents an increase of nearly &euro;95 million on the 2006 figure and an almost 60% increase on the &euro;460 million provided in 2003. I have no plans to introduce a subsidised scheme as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The information on uptake requested by the Deputy is not available as my Department does not obtain data on the attendance rates in the centres from the VECs.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may already be aware, I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students and to consolidate the administration of this unified grants scheme in the VEC sector. This will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administrative system. The scheme, which will be underpinned by a new Student Support Bill, will facilitate consistency of application, improved client accessibility and timely delivery of grants.</P>
        <P>My Department has, as I have indicated previously, engaged in substantial consultations with the key stakeholders on the future structure and administration of the student support schemes.  This process of consultation with the key stakeholders is on-going, in order to map the most logi<Col N="1065"/>cal and effective arrangements for the administration of the student support schemes, including the arrangements for the 2008/09 academic year. These consultations are a priority for my Department at present.</P>
        <P>The Student Support Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation and my Department is currently working closely with the Office of the Attorney General to finalise outstanding issues. I hope to be in a position to have the Bill published during the current D&aacute;il session.</P>

	<P>The National Educational Welfare Board is developing a nationwide service on a continuing basis that is accessible to schools, parents/guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) have been deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the Board&rsquo;s functions locally operating through 5 regional teams, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. A service is provided from 26 locations nationwide. Staff are deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. In addition, the Board follows up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Educational Welfare Officers play a pivotal role in implementing the service provided by the NEWB through monitoring school attendance and working to improve it. The EWOs also help parents who are experiencing a difficulty with getting a school place for their child. The NEWB has advised that the matter for additional resources for all areas is kept under continuous review. Areas are prioritised for additional service based on a combined analysis of demographic data, absence data reported from schools and other indicators of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>An additional 15 staff have been allocated to the NEWB in 2007. These additional staff are being recruited at present. This brings the current authorised staffing of the Board to 109 posts of which 90 are allocated to working directly in the service delivery area. The staffing complement is comprised of 19 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 13 Senior EWOs and 72 EWOs.  It <Col N="1066"/>should, however, be noted that the Board is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to improve school attendance and encourage more young people to finish school. In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and services such as breakfast clubs and homework clubs. In addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 600 staff within the education sector with a role in school attendance. Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, in working with parents, promote school attendance and its importance for success in school.</P>
        <P>School attendance is a central objective of the School Completion Programme with attendance tracking a core feature and one of its preventative strategies.  Access to these services is being increased with the continued rollout of services under DEIS, the Action plan for tackling educational disadvantage.  This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s allocation to the Board for 2007 is &euro;9.808 million for the National educational Welfare Board. This represents an increase of 20% on the 2006 allocation and of 50% on the 2004 level. This substantial increase in funding is a clear indication of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk. Through increased investment and improved services we are determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.</P>
        <P>In respect of the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question relating to Co. Donegal, I have been advised by the Board that the county currently has the services of one Educational Welfare Officer. I am also pleased to inform the deputy that it is the Board&rsquo;s intention to deploy another Welfare Officer in Co. Donegal when the additional 15 staff, referred to earlier, have been appointed.</P>
        <P>I will be keeping the issue of the NEWB&rsquo;s staffing under review in light of the rollout of services, the scope for integrated working and any proposals that the Board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs.</P>

My Department is most concerned at any inference that such assessments are required in order to access educational resources for the children concerned in the light of the advent of the General Allocation Model, which has reduced the number of assessments necessary in this regard, and the fact that some 10,000 assessments have been conducted or funded by NEPS in the 06/07 academic year. Through the aforementioned meetings that has taken place between NEPS and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in recent months, a greater understanding of the overall context in which the psychological service is provided to schools exists and a process has been agreed between the two bodies to record and monitor demand.</P>

	<P>In the region of &euro;730 million will be spent by my Department this year on tackling educational disadvantage at all levels &ndash; from pre-school to further and higher education. This represents an increase of over 60% and is testament to the Government&rsquo;s determination to prioritise social inclusion and ensure that all our children and young people get the supports they need to do well at school. Social inclusion measures across all Government Departments have also been prioritised under the Towards 2016 agreement, the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-16 and the National Development Plan.</P>
        <P>One of the high-level goals under the new National Development Plan 2007-13, is to reduce the proportion of pupils with serious literacy difficulties in primary schools serving disadvantaged communities from the current level of 27-30% to less than 15% by 2016.</P>
        <P>To achieve this goal significant resources to address literacy and numeracy difficulties in schools serving disadvantaged communities are <Col N="1071"/>being provided through DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion. These measures include a maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes in the 194 urban/town primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities and increased access to literacy and numeracy support services and programmes for all urban/town primary schools. Additional literacy and numeracy tutors are being recruited to provide in-school support and guidance to all teachers in these schools.</P>
        <P>In addition, training in &ldquo;Reading Recovery&rdquo;, &ldquo;First Steps&rdquo; and &ldquo;Maths Recovery&rdquo; are being made available to all urban/town primary schools. The Junior Certificate School Programme&rsquo;s Demonstration Library Project is also being extended on a phased basis to second-level schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. Extra resources will also be made available for intensive professional development programmes for principals and teachers in DEIS schools. A new Family Literacy Project is also being implemented. Finally, the School Development Planning service will support schools in developing their plans and policies for teaching literacy and numeracy and in setting measurable targets for the reduction of serious literacy and numeracy difficulties.</P>
        <P>Financial supports allocated to each of the schools selected under DEIS provides for the inclusion of after school and holiday time support &ndash; for literacy and numeracy development as well as homework support, social and personal development and arts activities.  After-school activities are delivered as part of the School Completion Programme and homework clubs in particular are a widely implemented support to provide students with a structured environment to complete homework. After-School Supports provided under the School Completion Programme focus on the personal and social development of young people, aiming to enrich their overall educational experience by providing fun activities that tap into the many talents of young people. Programmes that focus on activities like Drama, Music, Art, Craftwork and Sport enable children to develop a range of creative and sporting skills. These activities help to boost self-esteem, have positive consequences for the classroom and are particularly important for academically weaker students.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is aware that the home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.</P>
        <P>The rates of pay applicable to home tuition tutors are based on the qualifications of the tutor.  Therefore tutors fall into 2 categories for payment purposes i.e. primary and secondary in accordance with the appropriate part time rates of payment.  A subdivision within the categories reflects whether the tutor is qualified or unqualified.  Early intervention tutors are primary teachers and therefore paid at primary part time payment rates.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, all <Col N="1073"/>applications for large scale capital funding are assessed against published prioritisation criteria and assigned a Band rating. Progress on individual projects is then considered in the context of the multi-Annual School Building and, however, the school in question requires temporary accommodation in the meantime, it should make an immediate application to the Department.</P>
        <P>The funding of &euro;4.5 billion to be provided under the new National Development Plan (NDP) for investment in school building infrastructure will be adequate to meet the Departments needs over the lifetime of the Plan. This will be the largest investment programme in schools in the history of the State and it will enable the Department to ensure that school places are available where needed as well as continuing to upgrade existing school facilities. This investment will allow the Department to continue the acceleration of the school building programme which commenced during the lifetime of the last NDP when well over &euro;2.6 billion was invested on school development, delivering over 7,800 projects.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) that is administered by NEPS.</P>
        <P>In common with other psychological services NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases. The prioritisation of urgent cases for assessment is a matter for the school principal in the first instance.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that where non-English speaking children are so prioritised, NEPS, on a case-by case basis, arranges to cover the cost of basic interpretation facilities being provided in parallel with the educational assessment.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that during 2007 the number of NEPS psychologists has increased from a total of 128 in April to a current level of 134. In all 9 psychologists have been recruited in this period but due to the normal effect of resignations and retirement the net increase is 6.</P>
        <P>Six psychologists have been recruited since September and these undergo an induction and work shadowing process before being assigned a full quota of schools. The full effect of this intake which will not therefore become apparent in coverage terms for a number of weeks/months.  In addition my Department has recently contracted a further 5 psychologists with 3 due to take up duty later in November and one in December this year. A further psychologist will take up duty in early January 2008.</P>
        <P>The majority of these new recruits have been sited in the three NEPS Dublin regions and will during the current academic year be reflected in additional schools being afforded coverage by NEPS psychologists in the short and medium term.

	<P>Since its commencement in 1998, there has been significant investment in the ICT in Schools Programme, in providing computers to schools, professional development ICT courses for teachers, improving the availability of digital content and in supporting schools to integrate ICT into their teaching and learning. </P>
        <P>The recent priorities under the Programme have been the development of schools&rsquo; internal networking facilities, which has involved an expenditure in excess of &euro;23 million since 2002 across primary and post-primary schools, and the provision of broadband connectivity for schools, which my Department has pursued in partnership <Col N="1077"/>with the Telecommunications and Internet Federation within IBEC.  Since 2006, the Grant Scheme for Minor Works to National School Properties includes ICT equipment within the range of approved school expenditure.   Disadvantaged primary schools are also benefiting from the &euro;3.4m ICT Grant scheme for DEIS Schools from the Dormant Accounts (Educational Disadvantage) Fund.</P>
        <P>While the ICT facilities in our schools have improved considerably, I am conscious of the need for further investment to ensure that we are realising the full potential of ICT to improve the learning experience for our young people. Our Programme for Government sets out our commitment to implementing a comprehensive Schools ICT Strategy. This strategy will be underpinned by the investment of &euro;252m in the National Development Plan 2007-2013.</P>
        <P>Regarding the expenditure on IT equipment within my own Department, my IT unit has expended a total of &euro;2.387m on PCs, laptops and printers between 2002 and 2007 inclusive.  This figure rises to &euro;2.833m, if expenditure on servers is included.  The expenditure comprises &euro;0.478m on laptops, &euro;1.601m on PCs and &euro;0.308m on printers.  My Department adheres to the Department of Finance&rsquo;s guidelines on the replacement of IT equipment, with such equipment being replaced when it has a zero book value or earlier if it fails.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 520 and 522 together.</P>
        <P>Providing the county specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to language support teachers would require accessing individual school files, involving an inordinate amount of administrative time for both compilation and checking.</P>
        <P>In order to meet the language needs of students in our schools whose first language is not English or Irish, additional support is given to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of posts.</P>
        <P>The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled. I indicated in January last that the limit of two teachers per school and the limit of two years&rsquo; support to an individual pupil which had applied up to then, will no longer apply. As a result, an individual school may be allocated up to six language support posts under the arrangements now in place.</P>
        <P>Schools with between 3 and 13 eligible pupils receive grant assistance towards the cost of employing part-time teachers. Schools with 3 to 8 such pupils receive a grant of over &euro;6,300, while schools with between 9 and 13 such pupils receive over &euro;9,500.</P>
        <P>My Department does not have records of the number of teachers employed by local Boards of Management who receive this grant.</P>
        <P>Schools with 14 or more such pupils are entitled to one or more language support teachers, the number of which has increased dramatically in recent years. There are now over 1,400 language support teachers in our primary schools.</P>

        <P>My Department estimates that there are in the region of 28,000 students in our schools whose first language is not English or Irish. In order to meet their language needs, my Department in May 2007 issued a circular, reference 0053/2007, to the managerial authorities of all schools &mdash; both primary and post primary &mdash; to assist them in providing an inclusive school environment to meet the needs of pupils for whom English is a second language. The circular outlines the resources that are available to assist schools in this task. The circular is accessible on the website of my Department.</P>
        <P>The level of additional teacher support allocated to primary and post primary schools is determined by the number of enrolled pupils for whom English is a second language and the associated level of language proficiency.</P>

        <Quest>  the role an inspector has in carrying out an assessment of a newly qualified primary teacher for their diploma; the measures that can be taken if an inspection is deemed to be unfair to the newly qualified teacher involved; if there is an onus on the inspector to notify in advance their visit to inspect; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

	<P>During the probationary period for primary teachers, which normally extends over a school year, the Inspectorate evaluates a teacher&rsquo;s effectiveness in a classroom environment, and in teaching the appropriate range of curriculum areas and subjects.  Probationary requirements for primary teachers are laid out in Circular 0140/2006. </P>
        <P>Where a teacher is dissatisfied with the professional work of an inspector or an Inspectorate report, the teacher may request a review of the <Col N="1081"/>inspection in accordance with the Procedure for Review of Inspections on Schools and Teachers which has been drawn up by the Chief Inspector in accordance with Section 13 (9) of the Education Act 1998. If the issues raised by a teacher relate to the general behaviour or conduct of an inspector the complaint may be referred for investigation under the Department&rsquo;s customer comments and complaints system.</P>
        <P>During the probationary period, two reports on the teacher&rsquo;s work are completed by an Inspector: an interim report (Beagthuairisc) during the first half of the school year, and a General Report (M&oacute;rthuairisc) in the second half of the year.  With the exception of the visit to complete the General Report, all visits by the Inspector are incidental and no advance notice is given. In the case of the General Inspection which leads to a General Report, and in accordance with Rule 161 (11) of the Rules for National Schools, three clear school days&rsquo; notice of a General Inspection is given in writing to the teacher and to the Chairperson of the Board of Management.</P>

	<P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students. These are the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees&rsquo; Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses. The Higher Education Grants Scheme is administered by the local authorities. The other three schemes are administered by the Vocational Education Committees.</P>
        <P>In January each year my Department carries out a survey of the 66 local authorities and VECs in respect of the status of applications.  The survey <Col N="1088"/>will indicated the number of applications received, the number awarded a grant and the number refused a grant.  The details in respect of the status of applications for student grants for the academic year 2007/08 will not be available until mid-January 2008.</P>
        <P>In relation to the number of students receiving financial assistance under the student support schemes, the most recent figures show that over 56,000 students benefited under the schemes in 2006/07, of which approximately 13,200 benefited from the special rate of maintenance grant in addition to the basic maintenance grant.</P>

	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Board is developing a nationwide service on a continuing basis that is accessible to schools, parents/ guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) have been deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the Board&rsquo;s functions locally.</P>
        <P>In respect of the matters raised I wish to advise that two letters were received in my Department dated 7th and 9th of November concerning educational provision for a named individual.</P>
        <P>My officials have investigated the matters concerned. As part of this investigation some issues were referred to the National Educational Welfare Board for their attention. My officials have since received a full report from the Board the contents of which have been communicated to your correspondent by letter dated 23rd November.</P>

	<P>Section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998 requires the Board of Management to publish the policy of the school concerning the admission to and participation in the school.  The schools enrolment policy should have the prior approval of the Patron.</P>
        <P>In summary, Section 15, subsection (2) of the Education Act states that:</P>
<P LI="1">&ldquo;A board shall . . . publish, in such a manner as the board with the agreement of the patron considers appropriate, the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school, including the policy of the school relating to the expulsion and suspension of students and admission to and participation by students with disabilities or who have other special educational needs, and ensure that . . . the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents&rsquo; choice are respected&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The compulsory school starting age in a National School is 6 years of age. Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 (as amended by Section 50 of the Equality Act, 2004).</P>
        <P>The Board of Management of a school is also obliged under section 19(3) of the Educational Welfare Act 2000 to make a decision in writing in respect of an application for enrolment within 21 days and to inform the parents in writing of that decision.</P>
        <P>Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the <Col N="1095"/>student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act (as amended by Section 4 of the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007, to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</P>
        <P>Details on appealing decisions on enrolment under section 29 of the Education Act (as amended by Section 4 of the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2007), are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.</P>

	<P>My Department does not have a pilot project to evaluate the use and effectiveness of interactive whiteboards as a teaching and learning tool.  However, the National Centre for Technology in Education is involved in a project, which explores the use of different technologies, including interactive whiteboards, in addressing the English curriculum at primary level.  I am aware of a specific project involving Drumcondra Education Centre, the Computer Education Society of Ireland and the Irish Computer Society which is investigating the effectiveness of using interactive whiteboards in the classroom.  The successful use of interactive whiteboards requires substantial investment in terms of equipment, technical support and digital content.  To be effective users of interactive whiteboards, teachers need considerable experience and competence in the integration of ICT in teaching and learning.  The NCTE is preparing advice on the appropriate ICT equipment specification for schools and the role of interactive whiteboards is being considered in that context.  </P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the pupil:teacher ratio counts all the teachers in our schools &ndash; not only those employed as mainstream classroom teachers, but also those working in areas such as resource teaching and language support.  </P>
        <P>There are now in the region of 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002.  The estimated annual value of additional expenditure on these posts is in the region of &euro;300 million.  As a result of the appointment of so many extra teachers, the pupil:teacher ratio had been reduced to 16.4:1 by the last school year.  Figures for the current school year are not yet available. When they are available, it will be possible to <Col N="1099"/>estimate how many extra teachers it would take to reduce the pupil:teacher ratio to 15:1.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to predict the number of additional posts that will be created because of demographic changes and the uncertainty as to how any increases in enrolment will be spread over individual schools. </P>
        <P>Schools have flexibility in the way in which they assign pupils and teachers to classes and the Department does not allocate teachers to specific classes or age groups.  However, on the basis of current enrolments, it is estimated that in the order of 2,900 additional mainstream teaching posts would be required to reduce class sizes to under 20 pupils for children under 9 at an estimated salary cost of &euro;174million.</P>
        <P>Statistics are not compiled on an age basis. It is therefore assumed, for the purpose of providing the information sought by the Deputy, that all of the pupils in junior classes (junior infants to second class inclusive) are under 9 years of age.</P>
        <P>Provision of accommodation to cater for these additional teachers would cost in the order of &euro;360m.</P>
        <P>This does not include provision for the additional costs which would arise if teacher numbers increased in terms of services and training for the additional teachers in the system.  This would include the cost of additional inspectors required to carry out inspections (including probation), additional teacher training places required in the teacher education colleges, provision of additional inservice training and the additional administrative costs for the Department of Education and Science associated with processing payment of salary, pension etc for extra teachers.  Neither does it include the additional costs on the capital side in terms of ongoing maintenance of any additional classroom accommodation provided.  The salary cost given does not include provision for the necessary pension costs which would increase the salary cost by approximately 25%-30% per annum.</P>

This estimate does not include the cost of supporting the existing ECCE infrastructure to develop and deliver services.</P>
        <P>The cost of providing free pre-school places for all children before they enrol in Primary schools is dependent on a number of factors including the type of model proposed.  Pre-school services operate across a wide range of curricular philosophical bases, e.g., Montessori, Steiner, High/Scope.  Other approaches include the Region Emilio approach.  Any estimated costing would depend on the models of intervention envisaged and assumptions about different variables within those models.

	<P>There are a range of measures in place to safeguard personal data held by various business units in my Department.  My Department has produced a set of guidelines for all staff which sets out the issues to be considered when collecting, storing and processing personal data.

        <P>For the purposes of the Data Protection Acts, my Department has nine data controllers registered with the Data Protection Commissioners.  These data controllers are responsible for ensuring that appropriate processes and procedures are in place to safeguard personal data held in their sections.

        <P>Relevant procedures in place at business unit level include use of security passwords, lock-up procedures, closed offices, segregation of duties, secondary authorisation, hard copy paper trails and audits.  For example, the level of access to electronic files and databases that hold personal information is limited to staff working in specific areas and at specific grades within that area.  Also, the level of access to paper files is controlled by lock-up procedures and closed offices.</P><Col N="1104"/>

	<P>Civil Service posts at the levels of Assistant Secretary and Deputy Secretary are covered by a scheme of performance related awards.  The operation of the scheme is overseen by the Committee for Performance Awards.  Details of awards to individual officers under the performance related scheme are not disclosed on the basis that they are confidential to the officer concerned.  However I can say that during 2007 awards totalling &euro;22,400 were made to 2 officers in my <Col N="1106"/>Department in respect of 2006 (as shown on page 10 of the CPA report for 2006).  Details of the operation of the scheme are available in the report of the Committee for Performance Awards which can be accessed on the website of the Department of Finance at the following link: http://www.finance.gov.ie/documents/ publications/reports/CPArep2006.pdf</P>
        <P>Performance Awards for other grades are made to individual staff members and to groups of staff by way of recognition for exceptional performance of duty.  In assessing eligibility for awards, regard is given to the nature and quality of the activities involved and to the circumstances under which they were carried out.  Attention is also paid to the grade level of the staff members concerned and to what would be regarded as high quality performance from staff in such grades.  In December 2006 and January 2007 awards totalling &euro;26,650 were made to 35 individual staff members across all grades.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>On 25 September, 2007, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1778 establishing a multi-dimensional mission in Chad and in the Central African Republic (CAR) that will help strengthen security in the region.</P>
        <P>In October, a Defence Forces fact-finding team participated in an EU reconnaissance mission.  The reconnaissance mission included visits to the region and to the designated Operational Headquarters for the operation in Paris.  This was followed by a reconnaissance visit to the proposed area of operations by Defence Forces intelligence staff to conduct a detailed threat assessment.</P>
        <P>A report on these reconnaissance missions, including a detailed threat assessment, was submitted to me by the Chief of Staff.  Based on this assessment, on 20 Nov 2007, I sought and obtained the approval of the Government for the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the EU military operation named &ldquo;EUFOR TCHAD/RCA.&rdquo;  Tomorrow, I will move the necessary enabling motion in D&aacute;il Eireann.  At that stage, I will make a statement to the House, which will include a report on the results of the reconnaissance visits and details of Force protection assets being deployed.</P>
        <P>As Deputies will appreciate, the Chief of Staff&rsquo;s report is a confidential report to me as Minister for Defence.  The report contains information on the security situation in the region and is based on information received from confidential sources.  As such, it would be inappropriate to release the report into the public domain.</P>

	<P>The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension.  In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  </P>
        <P>The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency.  This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.</P>
        <P>Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.   While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.</P>
        <P>An application for long term residency from one of the persons referred to by the Deputy was <Col N="1111"/>received in January 2007.  I understand that applications received in July 2006 are currently being dealt with.</P>

	<P>Newcastle West is in the Limerick Division and the personnel strength of that Division on the 31 October 2007, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 566.  The personnel strength of Newcastle West Garda Station on the same date was 28.  Local Garda management is satisfied that policing in the area adequately caters for the needs of the community.  </P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel taking everything into account.  Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.  The situation will be kept under review by the Commissioner and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Limerick Division and Newcastle West Garda Station will be fully considered by him within the overall context of the needs of Garda Districts/Divisions throughout the country.</P>

	<P>Information on criminal convictions in Ireland is retained by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, specifically, in the Garda Criminal Records Office, which is now co-located with the Garda Central Vetting Unit in Thurles, Co. Tipperary.  Such information is retained indefinitely and without exception and may be used for all legitimate police purposes, including criminal history vetting, as appropriate.  </P>
        <P>In general, there is no provision in Irish law allowing for the expunging of criminal convictions.  However, section 258 of the Children Act 2001 provides for a limited &lsquo;wiping of the slate&rsquo; in respect of most offences committed by persons under 18 years of age, once certain conditions have been met.   Moreover, on 31 July, 2007, the Law Reform Commission published a report on Spent Convictions.  My Department is currently conducting an examination of this report.</P>
        <P>The Spent Convictions Bill currently before the House is a Private Members Bill.  Deputy Barry Andrews was granted leave on 25 October last by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to introduce the Private Members&rsquo; <Col N="1114"/>Bill on spent convictions.  The ordering for Second Stage of Deputy Andrews&rsquo; Bill to which I am well disposed is a matter for the House.</P>

	<P>I have set out hereunder the amount of sick leave taken by all prison staff for the years 1997 to 2006 inclusive.  Due to the manner in which they were then collated, figures broken down by each prison are not readily available prior to 2000 &mdash; global figures for the years 1997 to 1999 are shown in the table below.  Figures for the years 2000 to 2006 are shown by each prison. </P>
        <P>The most recent figures available for 2007 to the end of September show that 50262 days were availed of for sick leave.  The number of staff at that date was 3111.  This is a reduction of 18.5% per capita for the same period in 2006 and the first major reversal of the trend since 2000.  I have provided the figures by prison for the years 2000 to 2006.</P><Col N="1113"/>

	<P>I assume that the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the scheme of performance-related awards in the civil service which applies to Deputy and Assistant Secretaries and equivalent grades.  In the past 12 months, awards under the scheme were paid to 10 staff of my Department and 9 heads of agency.  Details of individual awards made under the performance-related scheme are not disclosed on the basis that they are confidential to the officers concerned.  However, I can say that the largest 10 awards made under the scheme ranged from &euro;14,600 to &euro;26,438.  I would also mention that in the same period, awards under the same scheme were  made to 14 Deputy/Assistant Commissioners in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The 10 largest payments to these officers ranged from &euro;11,500 to &euro;16,000. </P>
        <P>Details of the operation of the scheme are available in the report of the Committee for Performance Awards which can be accessed on the website of the Department of Finance at the following link: http://finance.gov.ie/documents/ publications/reports/CPArep2006.pdf</P>

	<P>Applications for certificates of naturalisation from the persons referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question were received in the Citizenship section of my Department in March 2005.  Officials in that section inform me that there has been some confusion regarding a valid address for the persons concerned. As correspondence sent to the address provided by the couple has gone unanswered, officials have now written to their solicitor, as per their initial request.  </P>
        <P>The first-named person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question is required to provide further documentation before processing of his application can continue and a letter has recently issued to his solicitor to that effect.  On examination of the application of the second person concerned, it was determined that, on the date the application was made, she did not meet the residency requirements as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. However, she subsequently did acquire the necessary residency by the time the application was reached for processing.  In this regard the Citizenship section has invited the person in question to make a new application under her existing application number &mdash; the purpose of which is to ensure that the applicant does not lose her place in the processing queue. The individual in question must submit the completed application form and all supporting documents to the <Col N="1119"/>Citizenship section within the next two months.  I will inform the Deputy and the persons in question when I have reached a decision on their applications.</P>

Officials in that section are currently processing applications received at the beginning of 2005 and have approximately 10,400 applications on hand to be dealt with before that of the person concerned. These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the application will commence by mid 2009.  I will inform the Deputy and the person in question when I have reached a decision on the matter.</P>

	<P>Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006. In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003. I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.</P>
        <P>I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.

	<P>Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 it is open to me to set policing priorities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I recently announced these priorities for 2008. One of the priorities I have set is to combat, particularly in cooperation with other agencies and the community generally, the problems of public disorder with particular emphasis on alcohol related behaviour (including under age drinking) and socially disadvantaged communities especially through utilisation of the legal mechanisms being made available, namely, ASBOs and behaviour warnings and closure orders.</P>
        <P>Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.</P>
        <P>Strong provisions are already in place to combat anti-social behaviour.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in this regard.  The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 contains provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides the Garda with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.</P>
        <P>In addition to the criminal law, there is a range of initiatives in place to get at the root causes of this type of behaviour. My policing priorities for 2008 include the expansion of the juvenile liaison scheme and the continued expansion of the Garda Youth Diversion Project.  The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. The Children Act 2001 gives a statutory basis to the Programme.  Garda Youth Diversion Projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour.  By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda/community relations.  I recently approved the establishment of an additional seven projects, bringing the current total to 100 throughout the country.  It is intended to establish a further 68 projects in the <Col N="1123"/>lifetime of this Government bringing the total number of projects to 168 nationwide.</P>
        <P>More broadly, a number of reforms have taken place in recent years to bring about a more effective youth justice system and these have been enshrined in legislation in the Children Act 2001, as amended.  The Act is based on the principles of diversion from crime and anti-social behaviour, restorative justice, the expanded use of community-based sanctions and measures by the courts, and the use of detention only as a last resort.  Recent measures have reformed our entire approach to youth justice.  The Irish Youth Justice Service, an executive office of my Department which is co-located in the Office of the Minister for Children, now has responsibility for developing youth justice policy and operating the children detention schools.  CCTV schemes are a strong deterrent in fighting crime and anti-social behaviour as well as giving communities greater peace of mind.  Both Garda operated and community based CCTV schemes have been set up, and such schemes will continue to be set up.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee in each local authority administrative area.  The purpose of these committees is to provide a forum where members of a local authority and the senior Garda officers responsible for the policing of that area, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area including the levels and patterns of anti-social behaviour such as the misuse of alcohol and drugs.  There are currently 29 committees established in a pilot phase. In consultation with my colleagues the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I propose to roll out the committees to all 114 local authority areas as early as possible in 2008.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Encounter, commenced by the Commissioner in February, 2002, targets public disorder and anti-social type behaviour by specifically targeting offences contrary to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1996 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988  which include the sale and consumption of alcohol by underage persons.  All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proactively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour.  Areas subject to such behaviour have been identified as &lsquo;hot-spots&rsquo; by local Garda management and additional foot and mobile patrols are directed to these areas during times when these offences are more likely to occur. All such incidents, detected by members on patrol or reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are dealt with immediately, and the suspected offenders are dealt with in accordance with the law.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the comments that have been expressed by the Citizens Information Board.  The Maternity Protection (Protection of Mothers who are Breast-feeding) Regulations 2004 make provision for an employee who is breast-feeding to take 1 hour off from her work each working day as a breast-feeding break without loss of pay, until the child is 6 months old. The Regulations were framed in the context of a maternity leave entitlement of 14 weeks with a further entitlement to 4 weeks additional unpaid leave. The entitlement to maternity leave is now 26 weeks with a further entitlement to 16 weeks additional unpaid leave. Further increases in paid maternity leave are envisaged in the Agreed Programme for Government over the next 5 years.  The Breast-feeding Regulations are being reviewed by my Department in the light of these developments.</P>

Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme, to the making of a behaviour order by the Children&rsquo;s Court.</P>
        <P>In setting up the regime, the intention was that these warnings or good behaviour contracts would themselves address the problem behaviour. It is only if they fail that an ASBO will be applied. In any case, it inevitably takes time to reach the stage where an ASBO itself might be sought. Where these do not succeed in altering a person&rsquo;s behaviour, they will culminate in ASBOs being sought by the Garda authorities from the courts.</P>

        <Quest> the number of persons who applied for leave to remain on humanitarian grounds in each year from 2000; the number who have been refused in each year; the number outstanding at the end of each year; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to applications for Leave to Remain in the State made pursuant to Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended.</P>
        <P>An application for Leave to Remain in the State in these circumstances arises where a non-national is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3(3)(a) of the Immigration Act, 1999. A person served with such a notice of intent to deport is afforded three options, viz. to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of a Deportation Order; or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why a Deportation Order should not be made and why temporary Leave to Remain in the State be granted instead.</P>
        <P>Leave to remain, outside that granted on the grounds of parentage of an Irish born child or marriage to an Irish or EU national, is considered in the context of deciding whether or not to deport a non &mdash; national.  Temporary leave to remain is considered in every case regardless of whether representations are made by, or on behalf of, the persons concerned. Statistics are not maintained in a way which distinguishes between those who have made an application for leave to remain and those who have not.</P>
        <P>The total number of applications awaiting a decision for temporary Leave to Remain, as provided in my Reply to D&aacute;il Question Nos. 515 and 516 on Tuesday 16 October 2007 to Deputy Denis Naughten, is 11,068. Of that number, 10,457 is the number of asylum cases which entered the Leave to Remain process, with these cases being at different stages of processing. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that many of those who failed the asylum process, and who did not opt to return voluntarily or consent to deportation, nonetheless left the State before a decision to deport or grant leave to remain was made. It is reasonable to presume that many of those listed as awaiting a decision on Leave to Remain have, in fact, left the jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>The figures in the table below refer to persons who received notification of intention to deport under Section 3(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, but were subsequently refused temporary leave to remain in the State. When temporary leave to remain in the State is refused, deportation orders are then made in respect of the persons concerned. The majority of those in the table below would have been persons who were refused refugee status in the State.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005, decisions on the realignment of Garda Regional and Divisional boundaries are matters for the Garda Commissioner in the first instance, in the context of his Annual Policing Plans.  The Commissioner has recently submitted proposals to my Department to align Garda Divisions with local authority boundaries which will lead to greater efficiencies and effectiveness for the Force and facilitate more effective operation of the Joint Policing Committees.  The 2008 Annual Policing Plan, which will include the specific aspects of the proposals to be implemented next year, will shortly be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in compliance with Section 22(6) of the Act. </P>
        <P>It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specific matter raised by the Deputy prior to the policing plans containing such details being laid before the Houses.</P>

	<P>The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  The <Col N="1129"/>dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency. </P>
        <P>While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  An application for long term residence from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in October 2007. I understand that applications received in July 2006 are currently being dealt with. As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.</P>
        <P>Officials in the Citizenship section of my Department inform me that there is no record of an application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The evidence of finance was deemed insufficient or incomplete</P>

	<P>The position is that several consultative processes have recently been undertaken in relation to issues arising in connection with multi-unit developments.  Following publication of its Consultation Paper on Multi-Unit Developments in December 2006, the Law Reform Commission launched an extensive consultation process and the Commission will have regard to the submissions received from interested bodies and individuals when completing its final report.  In December 2006, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement also invited submissions in response to its Consultation Paper containing Draft Guidance on the Governance of Apartment Owners&rsquo; Management Companies. I understand that the Office is currently finalising the document in light of submissions received during the consultation process. </P>
        <P>The National Consumer Agency has published a booklet entitled &ldquo;Property Management Companies and You&rdquo; and a report on &ldquo;Management Fees and Service Charges Levied on Owners of Property in Multi-Unit Dwellings&rdquo;. As part of its follow up to these publications, the Agency launched an on-line consultation process &ldquo;Have Your Say&rdquo; seeking consumer input in relation to the experience of living in a multi-unit development.</P>
        <P>The high-level interdepartmental committee will, as part of its deliberative process, be assessing the outcomes of these consultations and reporting on them. The question of the committee itself inviting submissions does not arise at present.</P>

	<P>Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006. In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the <Col N="1131"/>period starting with the first quarter of 2003. I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.  I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.</P>

Similarly in the Prison Service, the information requested by the Deputy is not contained on the files of committed prisoners. However, the Probation Service conducts interviews with all young offenders on committal to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. During the course of these interviews, any prior contact between the offender and any relevant State agency is recorded.  </P>
        <P>The compilation of the information recorded in these interviews, would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort to prepare. This could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is extremely difficult to quantify the level of illegal drugs consumed by prisoners while in custody, particularly given the extremely covert nature of illicit drug supply and use in a custodial setting.  It is therefore not possible to estimate the number of prisoners who may have developed a drug addiction while imprisoned.  However, an independent  study by the Health Research Board titled; &ldquo;Drug Use Among Prisoners: An Exploratory Study&rdquo;, which was published in 2001 stated that: &ldquo;Overall, <Col N="1132"/>research carried out in other European countries has found little evidence of prisoners&rsquo; being initiated into their first use of illicit substances while in prison, although it has been cited as an issue of concern. Only one respondent in the current sample reported that he had been initiated into his first ever use of an illicit drug while in prison&rdquo;.  On this basis, the Report concluded that &ldquo;initiation into drug use in the prison setting was rare&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service continues to take firm steps to eliminate the supply of drugs into prisons as well as enhancing the range of treatment options for those who are already addicted to drugs.  Drugs awareness courses and other interventions to highlight the detrimental effects of drug use and encourage prisoners to adopt or maintain a drug free lifestyle are also provided.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 6 March 2004 and claimed asylum. Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  The person concerned  was informed by letter dated 13 February 2006 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her and afforded her three options in accordance with Section 3 (3) (b) (ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.</P><Col N="1136"/>
        <P>Her case was examined under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations submitted on her behalf for permission to remain temporarily in the State. On 17 October 2006 my predecessor refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. A notice of this Order dated 15 November 2006 was served by registered post. Said notice also invited the making of a Subsidiary Protection application pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 &mdash; Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006, which came into effect on 10 October 2006.</P>
        <P>By correspondence dated 6 December 2006, an application for Subsidiary Protection was made together with a request to reconsider the Section 3 (6) application for temporary leave to remain of the person concerned. Following consideration of the information submitted, the deportation order was affirmed and the legal representative of the person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 19 December 2006.</P>
        <P>In order to consider the Subsidiary Protection application, the Deportation Order signed by my predecessor on 17 October 2006 was revoked. An order of revocation was signed in this regard on 28 June 2007 by one of the senior officials in my Department. Following consideration of the Subsidiary Protection application lodged, it was found that the person concerned was not eligible under the Regulations. Subsequent to this decision, consideration was again given to the person concerned under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, for permission to remain temporarily in the State. On 31 October 2007, I refused permission to remain and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. Notice of this Order was served by registered post requiring her to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on Tuesday 13 November, 2007, in order to make travel arrangements for her deportation from the State. She presented as required and was given further <Col N="1137"/>presentation dates which she kept. She was due to present again on 26 November 2007.</P>
        <P>The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for temporary leave to remain in the State and for Subsidiary Protection, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport her is justified.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>

	<P>The detailed allocation of Garda resources, including transport, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to decide in accordance with his identified operational requirements and priorities.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that Ballynacargy Garda station is policed as part of Granard Garda District, which is allocated 4 marked vehicles and 1 unmarked vehicle.  One of these marked vehicles is shared by the members attached to Ballynacargy, Ballinalee and Smear Garda Stations.  In addition, Ballynacargy sub-district is patrolled by the Divisional Traffic Unit and members of the District Detective Unit. The responsibility for the efficient deployment of all official transport in a Division is vested in the Divisional Officer who may allocate vehicles from station to station as required.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to the commitment by Government and the Social Partners in Towards 2016 to review the level of statutory entitlements to maternity and paternity leave before the end of 2008. The Deputy may also note that the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government is, over the next five years, to increase paid maternity leave by five weeks, to make all leave after the first 26 weeks available to either parent and, to examine the possibility of introducing a statutory entitlement to paternity leave and shared parental leave.</P>
        <P>It is in the context of these commitments that the question of introducing paid parental leave and the costs associated with such parental benefit will fall to be examined. No costs of the kind sought by the Deputy are available at present. However, the question of introducing paid parental leave was examined by the Working Group on the Review of the Parental Leave Act 1998, which was published by my Department in April 2002. Some preliminary costings only were included. The Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 623, 646 and 649 together.</P>
        <P>Three separate investigations are underway into the Bray fire tragedy.  These are being conducted by the relevant statutory authorities, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Wicklow County Council.  I believe that it is important to await the outcome of these investigations.  The questions concerning the publication of the terms of reference for the HSA and Garda investigations and when these investigations will be completed are matters for those authorities.  I understand that it is the case that a Garda investigation would normally focus on whether a crime was involved and with a view to assisting the Coroner&rsquo;s inquiries, while the HSA has wide-ranging powers relevant to the matters in question.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Wicklow County Council investigation, which, I understand, is proceeding apace, the following is the brief given to the independent consultants conducting it on behalf of the Council:&mdash;</P>
<P LI="1">&ldquo;carry out an investigation and assessment of the fire incident with specific reference to the building features to:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />determine, if possible, the factors in the building which influenced the course and severity of the fire,</P>

        <P>As early as possible in 2008 I intend to provide county and city councils with an indication of the general level of Exchequer funding that will be available over the next three years for the main housing investment programmes.  County Councils will be expected to co-ordinate the planning for the various housing programmes for their county areas. My Department will then meet and discuss their plans with each housing authority as part of the Housing Action Plan review process. By the end of the first quarter of next year I expect to be in a position to announce the allocations for 2008 for each housing authority. One local authority already manages its housing programme on a county at large basis for operational reasons. For the most part, however, the allocations in 2008 will be made directly to city, county, borough, and town councils.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that over time the management and integration of operational programmes has become more complex and some pooling of resources at a county level is required to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of the programmes. Against this background and in the context of developing further the multi-annual finan<Col N="1142"/>cial framework for the housing investment programmes, I am considering how to provide greater flexibility for housing authorities in the management of their programmes.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> if he will introduce legislation which will oblige businesses that deliver large household items such as white goods and furniture to private houses to remove the packaging for reuse or recycling; his views on whether payment into a packaging waste compliance scheme does not sufficiently encourage a reduction in such packaging; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Packaging plays a necessary role in the safe and hygienic transport of products purchased by consumers and householders.  Retailers who deliver items such as white goods and furniture to a private house are not obliged to take away the packaging waste.   Producers and retailers who place substantial amounts of packaging on the market do, however, have a range of responsibilities under the relevant legislation.  They must accept back at their own premises, free of charge, any packaging waste of the type which they supply unless they join a packaging waste compliance scheme. </P>
        <P>Currently, there is one packaging waste compliance scheme, Repak Limited, and the fee structure applicable to its members &ndash; which is related to the type and amount by weight of packaging placed on the market &ndash; reflects the polluter pays principle and directly incentivises the minimisation and reuse of packaging by producers.</P>
        <P>Through these fees, producers contribute to the overall cost of the collection and recycling of packaging waste.  These arrangements have in recent years ensured that Ireland has consistently met and exceeded targets set in European Union legislation for the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. In the light of the comprehensive regulatory regime in place for packaging waste, which promotes prevention, reuse and recycling, and the success achieved to date in meeting and exceeding targets for recovering and recycling packaging waste, it is not currently proposed to oblige retailers who deliver items to private houses to take away the packaging waste.</P>
        <P>My Department Is continuing to work with packaging producers under the auspices of the National Strategy Group on Packaging Waste Recycling  which is representative of the relevant public and private sector stakeholders, in developing waste prevention measures  as part of a multi-annual strategy to deal with this waste stream.</P>

	<P>From the commencement of the single mandate for elective local government, local authorities were required to make specific arrangements to provide a reasonable level of service for Oireachtas members and facilitate them in carrying out their work on behalf of local communities.  These arrangements, as set out in Articles 8, 9, and 10 of the Local Government Act, 2001 (Section 237A) Regulations, 2003 provide, inter alia, for the supply of specified documentation to Oireachtas members by the local authority, and equivalent systems, procedures and timeframes to those used in relation to correspondence from local authority members apply also in respect of Oireachtas members.   In addition, county/city managers are required to meet at least annually with local Oireachtas members and thus provide an opportunity for an update on developments and for any difficulties encountered to be raised and addressed.  This is, of course, additional to normal and regular contacts between public representatives and local authority officials regarding particular problems or issues.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that local authorities should at all times facilitate parliamentary representatives, in both the spirit and the letter of the regulations in relation to the timely provision of local authority documentation to members of the Oireachtas carrying out their work on behalf of local communities.  In that regard, a review of the arrangements for access by Oireachtas members to information in local authorities is currently underway in my Department.  This review is focusing on how the system is working in practice and on what improvements might be made.  I expect the review to be completed early in the New Year</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 635 and 636 together.</P>
        <P>Both my Department and the Department of Transport have been working effectively together for some years now to ensure better integrated land use and transportation planning, with particular regard to enabling the development of strategically located areas within the Gateways identified in the National Spatial Strategy.</P>
        <P>Examples of good integration between land use planning and transportation include the development of three Strategic Development Zones (SDZ&rsquo;s) in Dublin.  Development at Adamstown is proceeding in tandem with the provision of new suburban rail services to Dublin.  Public consultation on the planning scheme for the Balgaddy-Clonburris SDZ closed on 15 October 2007 and includes the provision of rail services.</P>
        <P>As regards the rail services at the Hansfield SDZ, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann made an application under the Strategic Infrastructure Act to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 7 September 2007 for a new rail link between Clonsilla and Dunboyne, running through the Hansfield SDZ.   It is my understanding that the proposal from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann includes the standard provisions for a new train station at Hansfield and upgraded facilities at Clonsilla.  The precise detail of station design and specification within the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la is an operational matter for the Board to consider within the context of its functions under the Strategic Infrastructure Act.</P>

        <Quest> the plans he has to make regulations under Section 37 of the Fire Services Act 1981 to put the Code of Practice for the Management of Fire Safety in Places of Assembly on a statutory footing in line with a commitment given in 1989; if he will extend the provisions to cover all work places; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Code of Practice for the Management of Fire Safety in Places of Assembly is intended to provide guidance to persons in control of places of assembly in discharging their statutory obligations under Section 18(2) of the Fire Services Act 1981.   This Code, one of a series of Codes, was given statutory underpinning by section 31 of the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003.  </P><Col N="1150"/>
        <P>In addition to giving a statutory footing to the Code of Practice, the inspection powers of fire officers have been substantially strengthened under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, and fire officers can require fire safety assessments and specify works to be carried out within a period of time by persons in control of a premises.  Fire officers may also provide advice, warnings and recommendations in both oral and written format.  Fire officers can close a premises on the spot when they consider that it poses a serious or immediate risk to the safety of persons.  The enforcement, prosecution and penalty provisions of the Acts have been updated and brought into line with modern legislative codes.  I am satisfied that they provide adequately for the protection of persons in such premises from the dangers of fire and there are no proposals for regulations under Section 37 at present.</P>
        <P>Under Part 3 of the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003 the issue of workplace fire safety has been addressed by the inclusion of &ldquo;any workplace&rdquo; as a premises to which the provisions of section 18 of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 apply.</P>

	<P>Circular letter SP5-03 was issued to all planning authorities by my Department in July 2003 with clear and comprehensive best practice in regards to Groundwater Protection and the Planning System.  The Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines for Planning Authorities, which issued in April 2005, emphasised the need for adherence to best practice in order to protect water quality, the Guidelines were issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 which requires planning authorities to have regard to them in the performance of their functions.  </P><Col N="1151"/>
        <P>Septic tanks installed on or after 1 June 1992 must comply with Part H of the Building Regulations which requires septic tanks to be so sited and constructed that they do not pollute, so as to endanger public health, any water (including groundwater) which is used as a source of supply for human consumption.  The related Technical Guidance Document H provides guidance on how to comply with Part H.</P>
        <P>The Environmental Protection Agency is developing a comprehensive Code of Practice on Waste Water Treatment Systems.  The EPA intends to publish the document as a Code of Practice under section 76 of the EPA Act, and this code will then be cited in the Annex to Technical Guidance Document H of the Building Regulations when it is revised next year.</P>
        <P>The Water Services Act 2007 contains a number of significant provisions in relation to the operation of septic tanks.  It places a duty of care on the occupier or owner of a premises in relation to the maintenance of septic tanks and it also requires the occupier or owner to notify the water services authority where any leak, accident or other incident occurs relating to discharges of sewage from a septic tank, where it is likely to cause a risk to human health or safety or the environment.  It is envisaged that these sections, which have not yet been commenced, will be brought into operation shortly.</P>
        <P>In addition, it is open to local authorities to make and adopt bye-laws to require periodic inspections of septic tanks and other on-site proprietary treatment systems under the general powers available to them under the Local Government Act 2001.</P>

	<P>The position set out in the reply to Question 524 of 6 November 2007 and in the adjournment debate of 13 November has not changed.</P>
        <P>In summary, the Government published the report of the Expert Group on the Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields earlier this year. With regard to Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) fields emitted by electricity power lines, (including 400Kv power lines), the Report concluded that there is limited scientific evidence of adverse health effects. The Expert Group have recommended that precautionary measures be used, <Col N="1154"/>where appropriate, and that Ireland continue to adopt and enforce the international guidelines developed by the International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection and endorsed by the World Health Organisation and the European Union.</P>

	<P>Wild deer are protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976 (as amended).  There is an annual open season when deer can be legally shot under licence. The open season for deer operates from either 1 September to 31 December or from 1 November to 28 February depending on the species of deer.  However, red deer cannot be hunted in County Kerry at any time of the year.  </P>
        <P>In recent years deer numbers have been increasing and deer have been spreading to areas where they were not previously found.  This trend has led to concern with, for example, wild deer now considered a serious threat to forestry management in many areas. Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of the landowner, who may apply to my Department for a licence under the Wildlife Acts to cull deer when this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.</P>
        <P>My Department carries out localised annual counts of deer populations on lands managed by the Department such as National Parks.  Where appropriate, culls are carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach unsustainable levels that would have negative ecological consequences.</P>
        <P>My Department will be undertaking a national deer survey in 2008 which should provide better figures on the overall deer population.</P>

	<P>Under the new Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, eligibility for grant aid is determined on the basis of gross household income, i.e. the property owner&rsquo;s annual gross income, together with that of his/her spouse, if applicable, in the previous tax year, or in the case of private rented accommodation, the tenant&rsquo;s annual gross income, together with that of his/her spouse, if applicable, in the previous tax year. </P>
        <P>The effective maximum grant of &euro;30,000, which may cover up to 95% of the approved cost of works, is available to households with gross household incomes of less than &euro;30,000 per annum, tapering to 30%, and a maximum of &euro;9,000, for those with gross household incomes of up to &euro;65,000 per annum.  The full breakdown is attached in the table below.</P>
        <P>In determining household income, local authorities apply the following income disregards:  &euro;5,000 for each member of the household aged up to 18 years, or aged between 18 and 23 years and in full time education or engaged in a FAS apprenticeship; &euro;5,000 where the person with a disability, for whom the application for grant aid is sought, is being cared for by a relative on a full-time basis; income derived from Child Benefit, Early Childcare Supplement, Family Income Supplement, Domiciliary Care Allowance, Respite Care Grant and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit / Allowance.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, capital assets are not assessed in determining eligibility for grant aid.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 650 to 654, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The consultation document referred to in the question sets out a range of proposed exemptions for renewable energy technologies. The exemptions are designed to support uptake of renewable energy technologies across the commercial, industrial, agricultural and public sectors, and are a result of extensive research by the Department into the possibilities for introducing planning exemptions for renewable energy uptake across these sectors.</P>
        <P>The proposed exemptions would be introduced by way of amendment to the Planning and Development Regulations 2001. Article 6 and Schedule 2 of these Regulations set out certain classes of development which are exempt from planning permission requirements. However, the exemptions are circumscribed by article 9, which places a number of general qualifications on the availability of exemptions, including a proposed condition that exemptions will not apply where the development would interfere with the character of a landscape, or a view or prospect of special amenity value or special interest.</P>
        <P>In the first instance, it will be the responsibility of those who intend to avail of the exemptions to ensure that the proposed development is in accordance with the specific exemptions and conditions attached. However, the question of whether a specific type of activity or works is development within the meaning of the planning code, or is or is not exempted development, is ultimately a matter for the planning authority under Section 5 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. It is open to any individual, on payment of a fee, to request a declaration in writing from a planning authority where a question arises as to whether a particular development is or is not exempted development within the meaning of the planning code. A person can also refer the decision of the planning authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for a final determination.</P>
        <P>In arriving at the specific draft exemptions and the conditions proposed to be attached in each case, my Department has aimed at striking the optimal balance between, on the one hand, maximising renewable energy usage, and on the other, minimising the potential for adverse impacts on neighbouring properties and wider communities arising from that wider uptake.  It is, of course, open to any person to make a submission to my Department on any aspect of the proposed exemptions set out in the consultation document, including the proposed conditions relating to scale and siting of technologies, before 18 January 2008. The final draft amendments must also then be laid before the Oireachtas for approval.</P>

	<P>The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for the preparation of annual inventories of greenhouse gas emissions to meet the reporting requirements of both the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the European Union. The Agency publishes a National Inventory Report each year on foot of these requirements. </P>
        <P>The most recent report published by the Agency, in respect of greenhouse gas emissions in 2005, indicates that total emissions of greenhouse <Col N="1159"/>gases in Ireland in 2005 were 69.95 million tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> equivalent. Further information is available on the website of the EPA at www.epa.ie.</P>
        <P>The National Inventory Report sets out emissions based on source categories in line with reporting guidelines adopted by the UNFCCC, which differ from the source categories identified in the question.  However, based on EPA data, information on emissions for the years in ques<Col N="1160"/>tion, set out according to the sectors identified in the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012, is available and is set out in the following table.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that these data represent gross emissions and do not include the countervailing sequestration effects of forestry. Similarly, the data for the transport sector do not include emissions from international aviation or marine bunker fuels as emissions from these sources are not included in the scope of the Kyoto Protocol.</P><Col N="1159"/>

        <Quest> the number of vehicles on the roads estimated not to have road tax paid on them; the assessment he has made of the way this figure compares internationally; the steps he proposes to vastly reduce this number; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Motor tax compliance surveys are undertaken on a periodic basis and the information from the last survey in 2001 indicated an evasion level of 4.6%. This compares with an evasion level of 5% for the United Kingdom in 2006. Measures have been introduced by my Department to combat motor tax evasion, and other enforcement initiatives are being developed in conjunction with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The increase of some 8% in motor tax revenue to end October 2007 reflects a range of factors, including the impact of anti-evasion measures and increased payment levels in respect of motor tax arrears. Arrears payments increased <Col N="1160"/>by 12% to end October 2007 over the same period in 2006. </P>
        <P>Consideration will be given, in consultation with other relevant authorities, to the question of holding a motor tax compliance survey next year.</P>

        <P>It is not possible to provide an overall cost figure for the construction of 12,000 social housing units in 2008 as this would depend on a range of factors including the distribution of units across the country, the number of different types of units and the state of the housing market.  The average unit cost for the construction of a 3 bedroom social housing dwelling in 2007 is &euro;137,278.</P>

	<P>The assessment of hous<Col N="1166"/>ing need, including verification of the relevant circumstances of applicants, is a matter for the local authority concerned. As standard procedure, local authorities seek information on applicants&rsquo; accommodation history and have powers under Section 15 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 to seek information from a range of relevant bodies in relation to applicants.</P>
        <P>In general, an immigrant must have a legal right to remain in the State on a long-term basis if they are to be considered for long-term housing support (this is particularly pertinent in the case of affordable housing given that the purchase of an affordable house is a long-term commitment). Therefore, for example, persons who are currently seeking asylum here are ineligible to apply for housing supports, as are persons who hold work permits.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas market became fully liberalised on 1 July 2007 in line with EU legislative requirements on gas market opening.  From that date the benefits of liberalisation, which were previously for industrial and commercial consumers, were extended to residential natural gas customers, allowing them to shop around for their supplier and to obtain the best value for money.  Most recent data indicate that Bord G&aacute;is Energy Supply still supplies approximately 98 per cent of the residential gas market.  However, the opening of the market will see progressive change.</P>
        <P>The potential of the Irish gas market is very small by international standards.  It is also a feature of gas market openings that there is a time lag between the opening of the market and the active participation of new market entrants.  In general, new entrants in energy supply markets tend to initially target the large volume customers in the industrial and commercial sectors and then move towards the smaller volume commercial customers and domestic customers if the economics are favourable.</P>
        <P>Since 1 July last, two licences have been issued by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) enabling two new suppliers to enter and compete <Col N="1172"/>in the deregulated gas market.  One of these suppliers, SSE (Ireland) Ltd, has publicly announced its intention to supply the residential market.  In addition, the CER has advised that it is also considering an expression of interest in the residential market sector by another potential entrant to the Irish natural gas market.</P>
        <P>CER has recently revised Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Non Daily Metered (NDM) revenue regulation and has restructured the NDM tariffs.  These changes, together with the arrival of full market opening, are expected to encourage new entrants and deliver additional competition into the market.</P>
        <P>Overseen by the CER, the gas distribution and transmission systems of Bord G&aacute;is Networks (BGN) are available to all Irish licensed shippers and suppliers of natural gas on a non discriminatory basis.</P>

	<P>My Department carries out a periodic review of energy suppliers. </P>
        <P>Based on the last review, electricity is supplied for my Department by two companies, Energia &amp; ESB Supply.  Both provide a proportion of their energy from renewable energy sources.  Based on information provided by the suppliers, the overall amount of energy supplied for electricity from renewable sources for the period in question was some 4.5% of the total.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently carrying out a further review of electricity suppliers across the market with a view to increasing energy consumption provided from renewable sources.</P>
        <P>The main energy provider for the heating of Departmental buildings is natural gas supplied by An Bord G&aacute;is.</P>

        <Quest> the progress made in preparing for the construction of a second electricity interconnector to Northern Ireland, and of electricity interconnectors to Great Britain and north west Europe as announced in the White Paper on Energy. </Quest>
        <QRef>[30915/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government attaches the highest priority to the development of electricity interconnection between Ireland, Great Britain and, over time, other EU Member States.  Greater interconnection between Member States is also a key <Col N="1176"/>priority for the European Union to ensure the effective working of the Internal Energy Market.</P>
        <P>The second interconnector with Northern Ireland is being progressed by EirGrid and its northern counterpart SONI, at the request of the two Energy Regulators, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR).</P>
        <P>The second interconnector project entails the construction of a new 400kV line between Cavan and Tyrone, which will more than double the current cross-border power transfer capacity to over 600 megawatts.  I am advised that the proposed overhead line will span approximately 35km in Northern Ireland and approximately 45km in Ireland, and will be routed from a proposed new substation near Kingscourt in County Cavan, through County Monaghan and onwards to County Tyrone.</P>
        <P>EirGrid is undertaking public consultations on a number of proposed routes with a view to identifying for public presentation, a preferred route, having regard for all relevant considerations by early 2008.  Further studies on the proposed route may be undertaken at this point prior to preparing a planning application and Environmental Impact Assessments.  The project is scheduled to be completed no later than 2012.</P>
        <P>The east/west electricity interconnector with Great Britain is being progressed to schedule.  On foot of the Government decision in 2006, the CER, together with EirGrid is finalising competition to secure the construction of the 500 megawatt interconnector no later than 2012.  The Government also decided in 2006 that the interconnector will, as a national strategic asset, remain in public ownership and will be owned by EirGrid.</P>
        <P>EirGrid is progressing work on route selection and technical specification of the interconnector and has recently announced that Woodland in County Meath is the most favoured connection point on the Irish side.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Work is also advancing, with the relevant authorities on finalising the connection point on the west coast of Britain.  I am advised by EirGrid that a connection point in Deeside in North Wales is under consideration.  The final subsea route will be confirmed in light of the results of detailed feasibility and marine surveys.</P>
        <P>To oversee and ensure delivery of the interconnector to schedule, a high-level coordination group has been established under the aegis of the CER with the direct involvement of EirGrid and my Department.</P>
        <P>The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure Act) 2006, which provides for a streamlined planning process for strategic infrastructure developments, includes special provisions designed to expedite the planning process for electricity interconnector projects.  To underpin the interconnector development process, new <Col N="1177"/>arrangements have been made in respect of the construction and governance under licence of interconnector operators by the CER in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006.</P>
        <P>At the Government&rsquo;s request, EirGrid is also undertaking cost benefit analysis and feasibility planning for further interconnection with the United Kingdom and potentially with Europe in the longer term, which will inform decision-making on a medium to longer term interconnection strategy.</P>

	<P>My Department is very aware of the risks such as identity theft to individuals should their personal information be made available to criminal elements.</P>
        <P>Despite the fact that my Department holds very limited personal records other than employee details, it has invested heavily over a number of years in ensuring that every effort is made to maintain the security of both electronic and paper records.</P>
        <P>There are multilayer electronic firewall defences backed up with electronic intrusion detection systems, which actively monitor network traffic for electronic threats.  When backup tapes are removed to a certified external storage facility for disaster recovery purposes they are transported in special locked cases.  The connections between my Department and other Departments or the Naval Service are across the private Government network.</P>
        <P>My Department carries out some electronic sales via our websites.  The credit card transaction is processed out by a third party and the card details are not recorded on any of our systems, just a reference number for the successful payment.</P>
        <P>All offices are equipped with multiple locked receptacles for confidential waste and the policy is that all paper other then externally printed brochures, magazines, et cetera are disposed of in these receptacles.  The contents are regularly emptied and shredded on site.</P>
        <P>In relation to staff personal records, all personal data is protected under the Data Protection Act whereby no personal information is disclosed to a third party unless my Department is satisfied that we have the individual&rsquo;s consent.

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the percentage of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy supply which is imported from the UK; and if, in the context of such facts or that 87% of Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas supplies are imported from there, actions are planned to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on one country. </Quest>
        <QRef>[31340/07]</QRef><Col N="1182"/>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Currently over 90% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy needs are provided for by imports. In order to ensure the security of our energy supply, the Government&rsquo;s objective is to reduce our reliance on imports and to significantly enhance diversity of energy sources. </P>
        <P>Natural gas currently accounts for over 60% of electricity generation in Ireland.  With the decline of the Kinsale gas field and pending the full development of the Corrib field, we now import some 95% of our natural gas from the UK.  Natural gas transported through the UK network comes from fields in the North Sea, the Netherlands, Norway and Russia.  The Energy Policy White Paper points to the need to develop longer term strategies to reduce over-reliance on gas imports from the UK.  The actions set out in the White Paper include long term strategic planning by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) in relation to security of gas supply and working in the EU to deliver regional gas markets for Northern Europe and diversification of supply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The CER has granted a gas storage licence to Marathon Oil Ireland Ltd to make the full capability of its depleted Kinsale facility, which has a capacity of 7 billion cubic feet (bcf), available to third parties.  This is the first such storage facility in Ireland and BGE has contracted to use over 5 bcf of it.  Work is also nearing completion on an All-Island study overseen by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland on a joint approach to gas storage and Liquified Natural Gas (LNG).  The planned development of a merchant LNG storage facility at Shannon will also have a positive impact on the security of our gas supply and improve our connectivity to the global gas market.  The connection of the Corrib gas field, with its estimated capability to supply some 60% of our annual natural gas requirements over a span of 15-20 years, will significantly reduce our dependence on imports during that period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards the generation of electricity, the Government has set ambitious and essential targets for the increased penetration of renewable energy.  Connected wind capacity will reach over 900 MW by year end, which will represent a very significant increase of over 25% of installed wind capacity since the start of 2007.  It is a priority to ensure the provision of flexible generation plant to accommodate electricity coming on to the system from wind generation.  The establishment of the All-Island Single Electricity Market is also a key development, which will contribute to ensuring the security, reliability and competitiveness of electricity supplies throughout the island.</P>
        <P>Existing gas interconnection and planned electricity interconnection between Ireland and Great Britain is a key plank in our security of energy supply strategy.  The current interconnection <Col N="1183"/>capacity with the UK Grid (through Northern Ireland) of 300 MW, will be increased by 500 MW with the delivery of the new East West electricity interconnector between Ireland and Wales by 2012.  Enhanced interconnection, in both electricity and gas, will assist in promoting the regional energy market, in line with EU security of energy internal market objectives.</P>
        <P>As regards imports of oil, in 2005, the latest year for which definitive figures are available, <Col N="1184"/>65% of Ireland&rsquo;s oil imports were sourced from the UK, with crude accounting for 12% and products accounting for 88% of those imports.  In the same year Norway accounted for 28% of our oil imports, of which crude consisted of 93% and products 7%.  The Irish downstream industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated.  We are currently undertaking a strategic review of security of oil supplies which will include consideration of security of commercial access to oil supply.</P>
