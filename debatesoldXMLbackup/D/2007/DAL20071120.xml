	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The issue of a State honours system has been mooted many times in the past but there has never been all-party support to sustain its development.  In September 1999, I wrote to the main Opposition party leaders enclosing a discussion paper.  It was the first time a serious attempt had been made to outline the broad shape of such a scheme.  I made it clear that I was completely open to any views which other parties might wish to put forward, including, in particular, views on the central question as to whether a scheme was desirable.</P>
        <P>It has always been my view that a national honours system would require all-party consensus if it were to proceed.  However, it was evident at the <Col N="1566"/>time that there was not the cross-party support required to introduce such a scheme.  I have always been in favour of some form of national honours system and it is a matter of considerable regret to me that we do not have any way of formally recognising outstanding achievements by Irish citizens.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I recently wrote to Opposition party leaders to inquire if the parties would now be prepared to enter into discussions about a system for formally recognising conspicuous service to Ireland and the Irish people or signal achievements in various fields of endeavour.  I am pleased to report that Deputy Kenny has responded favourably on behalf of his party, indicating that it is prepared to enter all-party negotiations and nominating Senator Frances Fitzgerald as its representative.  Deputy Gilmore has indicated that he intends to bring the proposal before his party&rsquo;s parliamentary party and will revert to me in the matter when it has considered it.  To date, I have not received a response from Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  Other Deputies have raised this issue in the House a number of times.  For example, Deputy Finian McGrath, supported by other Deputies, has raised it with me many times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that the Taoiseach has written to the party leaders about this matter and that I have indicated to him that I will respond when my parliamentary party has considered it.  I would like to elicit further information from him about what he has in mind.  We live in a republic, the basis of which is that every citizen is equal.  Is an honours system a good idea in principle, given that the implication of such a system is that the status of some citizens &mdash; those who would receive honours &mdash; would somehow be greater than that of other citizens?  How will we square an honours system with the strong opposition the founders of the State had to it, for the reasons outlined?  How will we square it with the intent, if not the letter, of the Constitution, which explicitly states that titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State?  I appreciate the Taoiseach is not talking about introducing titles of nobility, but the intent of the Constitution was, in keeping with the thinking of the founders of the State, that honours and elevated status for some citizens was not a republican ideal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not put forward a draft scheme for consideration in my letter to the leaders of the Opposition, because I understand it might be more helpful to let the outlines of a scheme emerge from discussions at all-party level, if there is agreement to hold such discussions.  I did, however, offer a number of views, which may be useful to any further discussions.  In 1998 or 1999, I set out a fairly detailed scheme.  It was <Col N="1567"/>not the details, but the concept that stopped that scheme going forward at the time.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy Gilmore, I would like to make a few points.  I am on record for ten or 15 years as saying I do not favour a system that would confer titles.  I suggested that any scheme should operate within the existing constitutional framework and involve the conferring of public awards or citations.  That can be done within the Constitution and does not require any change.  It is not necessary to get involved in a change to the Constitution on the issue.</P>
        <P>The system should be capable of applying to citizens, the diaspora and others who have made a significant contribution at international level or in Ireland.  It should operate, and be seen to operate, transparently and independently.  If we ever go ahead with this scheme, it should be open and not discriminate against anybody from any walk of life or class, creed or location.  It should be an honour capable of being achieved by any citizen so that there is no elitism, as in some countries, attached to it.  While a broad range of service achievements could be covered, I am particularly anxious that exceptional service for the betterment of the community would be included.</P>
        <P>I have not gone over the history of this issue recently, but nine years ago I read the file in detail.  The idea is certainly not new in political terms.  The file started in July 1930 and has continued since.  It is interesting, probably very interesting from the point of view of how not to do things.  It was started in 1930 by Ernest Bligh, who made some progress on it.  In 1946 &Eacute;amon de Valera took it up and he was followed in 1948 by Mr. Costello.  In 1953 &Eacute;amon de Valera took it up again and was again followed in 1956 by Mr. Costello.  In 1959 Mr. Lemass took it up and so on.  I took up the issue in 1999 and have given it some attention since.  All those involved were trying to establish a system.  The issue about Ireland being a republic is well and truly covered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are good systems in Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France &mdash; on which we have based many decisions on issues &mdash; Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.  To be honest I had put this one away, having tried in 1998 or 1999 to reopen it.  The reason I have returned to it again is that quite a number of people, not a massive number, have been offered titles or honours by another jurisdiction.   The present position is that if somebody is to receive a title or honour, he or she informs the Government.  The majority of them have not been interested but raised the point that they have been asked and wish to inform us.  Others have been offered honours and have accepted.   There is a notional view that the Government <Col N="1568"/>must be asked and obviously we agree when asked.</P>
        <P>One can see what is happening, a number of our prominent people are being honoured by the UK establishment.  They would prefer, I think, to be recognised in their own country or not recognised at all.  With most of them it is not a big issue.  There is a continual trend of this practically every quarter.  I am not talking about this scheme being for such people because many people here would not be known outside our own shores.  There are certainly a great number of people, whether NGOs working in the Third World, those who are just good community people or people who have achieved internationally whom we should recognise.  We have some schemes and probably many award schemes that are all important in their own right but we have no national award scheme for people who would consider they are being recognised nationally either through the President or by an advisory group of Parliament.  That is a pity and the reason this debate has gone on, in one form or another, since 1930.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a very long answer.  Normally when one goes back on history one does so either to refresh one&rsquo;s memory or to revise it.  The Taoiseach has given the history of this matter and has mentioned most of his predecessors.  I am quite happy to participate in this business provided it is absolutely above board.  The problem is how to put in place a system that does not breed cynicism.  We all know of the claims and the cases that were taken in respect of payments and donations to British parties for appointment to the rank of nobility or something like that.  We do not want a situation where we have Sir Bertie Ahern in a few years time because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;somebody decides to make payments by way of a dig out or whatever.  I am not suggesting that would happen and I do not think that is what the Taoiseach has in mind. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not referring to the Minister beside the Taoiseach.  Actually when I do mention donations, that is a party that wanted to get rid of donations altogether and now finds it cannot make a donation to its own party.  The people of the year awards is a system whereby a panel looks at valid contributions made by men <Col N="1569"/>and women in various categories of Irish life and makes an award to them.  Years ago I was instrumental in the presidential Gaisce awards for young people, who complete certain tasks or activities and are nominated for presidential honours in that sense.  The problem for politicians is that no matter what is done it will breed a cynical response.  I recall the Taoiseach in his own inimitable fashion saying on &ldquo;Six-one&rdquo; that he honoured people by appointment to State boards because they were his friends.  That is not what he has in mind here.  We are quite happy to participate in this exercise to see if it is possible to devise a scheme whereby Irish men and Irish women can be honoured without it becoming a partisan party political &ldquo;How is your father? I will look after you&rdquo; system.  We will support it if the Taoiseach will guarantee that surreptitious payments will not be made to political parties, as happened in Great Britain for the achievement of honours to be nominated by the Queen or, as would be the case here, by the President, in respect of whatever system is set up.  I assume this is not what the Taoiseach has in mind.  We need to draw a balance with regard to perfectly legitimately honouring Irish men and women for outstanding achievements or their contribution to our society.  I am sure the Taoiseach does not want a situation where people will say &ldquo;That is because he was a supporter of Fianna F&aacute;il&rdquo; or &ldquo;She was a supporter of Fine Gael&rdquo;, or whatever the case might be, or that it suddenly comes to light that the person is making contributions to the Green Party for nomination as a person of honour in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many good schemes.  Gaisce, the President&rsquo;s award, is one scheme that challenges young people to use their leisure time for positive development for the betterment of their communities.  The Aosd&aacute;na award is in place for artists.  The Deeds of Bravery Council makes awards for the saving of human life in situations involving personal risk.  The Scott medal is awarded to members of the Garda and there is a military medal for gallantry as well as a distinguished service medal for the Army.  The Michael Heffernan memorial award covers the area of the marine and natural resources.  Honorary citizenship is also awarded, although very sparingly &mdash; Chester Beatty, Dr. and Mrs. Herrema, Tip O&rsquo;Neill, Jack Charlton, Derek Hill and a few others received that award.  While all those awards are fine, they are very limited and, collectively, are small enough, although the Gaisce award is perhaps not so.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy heard me explain I do not favour a system that would confer a title or titles.  I suggested that any scheme would operate within the existing constitutional framework and would involve the conferring of public awards or <Col N="1570"/>citations.  We are talking about people who are involved in good deeds.</P>
        <P>Deputy McGrath asked me a series of questions on this issue last year and I replied that such awards would be made to recognise exceptional service to mankind, outstanding achievement which confers international distinction on Ireland, conspicuous service to Ireland and Irish people, or pre-eminent inspiration or contribution in any field of Irish life, usually but not necessarily of a national character, with the emphasis on voluntary and community services.  The system would have to be categorised as being open to any man or woman in the country, young or old, not someone who did something great last Saturday, although at times that might be acceptable.</P>
        <P>We all know there is a huge number of people who do outstanding things because we see or hear of them in our public lives.  However, they are never recognised because we do not have such a scheme, although practically every other country does.  We had a row on this.  I read the file and skimmed over it again at the weekend, although I did not re-read it in full.  Looking back, one can see the issue concerned the Republic and other such arguments.</P>
        <P>To be fair, across the water, in what is another establishment and another country, while their system may have other problems, their problem with finance concerned the House of Lords and the title system, with people wanting to become a member of a House of Parliament.  We are not talking about such a system.</P>
        <P>There is nothing wrong with the People of the Year awards or any of the county or sporting awards, which are all good awards, but we are out of step as we do not have national recognition for our people.  There are open views on whether we should have one, but we should have some system.</P>
        <P>The second point concerns transparency.  The system would require a politically agreed panel that would examine this.  If it was to be close to any other system, it would have to be done by a group.  While the Government of the day might pass recommendations to the President, it would be best to have nothing to do with the system other than that.  The decision should be made by whatever would be an acceptable advisory group.</P>
        <P>I will make a third point but I do not want it to be misunderstood because it is good when an Irish person is honoured by another government, whether nearby or far away.  Increasingly, the British Government is honouring Irish people with distinctions, of which there has been a number.  It is happening nearly every quarter.  I can nearly tell when it will occur because it has been that way for five years.  Some accept honours, while others do not, but that is a matter for them.  Whenever I am asked &mdash; a regulatory or legal provision &mdash; I always say yes because it is <Col N="1571"/>an honour for the individual involved.  If it continues for the next ten years, that will be great but as they are Irish people, I would like to think we will recognise them because we are all proud of them.  We have seen this happen in a number of categories, including broadcasters, sports people, business people and writers.  They are from different backgrounds.  I do not think the British Government or Monarchy is picking them for any reason other than the fact that they have achieved an extraordinary task.  It would be nice if we recognised their achievements, not only for them but for the people generally.  It would be a fitting tribute to them.  I am sure Deputies Kenny and Gilmore regularly meet people around the country who have given service for half a century to a charitable or community organisation, but they receive no national recognition.  I am sure it is not a big deal for most of them but it would be nice to have such a system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, honoured the Taoiseach in the British Parliament, rightly so, for his contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process.  I attended that ceremony as a mark of respect for the work undertaken by all the Governments concerned.  Does the Taoiseach have in mind a name or title for the honour, as distinct from titles granted to individuals?  I hope political agreement can be reached on a panel to examine the matter.  One does not want people to achieve such awards that they would be ten a penny every year.  Therefore, a level of achievement, heroism or outstanding example would have to be established beyond which persons would be considered for an on&oacute;ir n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta or whatever it might be called.  Does the Taoiseach have any numbers in mind or is he starting from a basic foundation, seeking agreement on a panel to consider the elements mentioned?  After that it would be clearly seen to be apolitical, not a personality title, but rather an on&oacute;ir n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta to mark outstanding achievement in whatever field, by young or old, male or female.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, I am totally open on the matter.  While we proposed a scheme which we had prepared within the Department based on discussions in 1998, I am not wedded to it.  As regards a national award, I am inclined to think it should concern continuity of service.  While some may differ, I am not hugely into honouring the person who scored a goal last week or won a competition because there are many awards for such persons.  There should be a national award for distinguished service at home or abroad over a prolonged period.  It should be for community-based individuals who have done a good job for the country but have never been in the limelight, rather than for those whose names are up in lights <Col N="1572"/>all the time.  There are many such persons. Others say people who do that are not interested, but when they are asked by another administration, they are very interested but they would prefer to be recognised by their own Administration.  They come forward because they know I will probably hear anyway or it will come through the system, even though it does not always.  They are interested in recognition.</P>
        <P>I am totally opposed to titles because that would create a constitutional issue and any scheme would have to comply with the Constitution.  People are interested in recognition and not in the conferral of public awards, citations or titles.  Previous schemes in this area tended to cover approximately 100 people and distinctions were made.  These included exceptional service to mankind; outstanding achievement which confers international distinction on Ireland; conspicuous service to Ireland and to Irish people, which brings in the international scene, NGOs and others; and pre-eminent and inspirational contribution in any field of Irish life, usually but not necessarily of a national character, with particular emphasis on voluntary community service and service to persons in the community who are disadvantaged or marginalised but not restricted to those purposes.</P>
        <P>I have no interest in trying to do this quickly or in pushing any particular scheme.  There is a void in this regard, particularly in recognising outstanding people who are not generally well known and who may not want to be, but whose considerable achievement, effort and commitment is felt by others to deserve recognition.  It should be kept to that area.  The only way to do this is to ensure the scheme is open to everybody without distinction and there should be no classes.  An advisory group should operate the scheme on behalf of the political system.  The Government of the day, within the normal Constitution rules, should take its recommendation and make it to the President without change.  If anybody thinks that is a load of nonsense and there is another way, I am as open to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The more I hear of this, the less I like it or think it is necessary.  First, as the Taoiseach accepted, a range of schemes is in place to acknowledge the service of people, including the People of the Year awards and awards such as honorary degrees and the freedom of a city.  If a national honours scheme is introduced, will it undermine such awards, given that a recipient of a freedom of the city or a People of the Year award might feel it is not the real McCoy because he or she did not receive a national honours award?</P>
       <P>Second, the Taoiseach put a great deal of emphasis on people being honoured by other jurisdictions who feel if they are honoured by <Col N="1573"/>another state, they should be honoured by this State.  That is a good reason not to do this.  For example, a number of people could receive MBEs and pressure would then be on the advisory group to honour them because they received an MBE across the water.  If the belief is that because many people receive awards in other states, we should honour them as well, that is an argument not to do this because there will be pressure to honour them.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.6- ?>
        <P>A third issue is the backlog that would arise under such a system.  Presumably if the process of an honours system is commenced, many people would be on the list to be honoured.  There might be a gradual process of honouring people in years ahead but initially the names of a pile of people will be stacked up to be honoured, for many of whom perhaps, to put it kindly, time is running out.  The pressure will be on to award them the honour in time.</P>
        <P>I am not convinced that such an initiative is a good idea.  I am willing to hear what the Taoiseach has to say and to examine whatever detailed proposals he has on it.  However, this is an area where the Government should leave well enough alone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter has been the subject of debate for 77 years.  I do not want to put undue emphasis on it.  No matter what one says, somebody will pick up on something.  I was careful to say we are talking of a handful of people honoured by another jurisdiction, whether in the United States, different parts of Europe, recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize or awards by the British Government.  It is similar to the freedom of the city of Dublin, which has been awarded to a handful of people in the past few hundred years.  However, many pre-eminent and inspirational people not necessarily with a national standing have made a major contribution to Irish life with particular emphasis on voluntary and community service.</P>
        <P>I was only making the point regarding those who have been recognised by other countries.  Many people, although not huge numbers, have said to me they were offered recognition but they did not want to accept it and others have said they were offered it and wanted to accept it.  They all say they would love if there was an honours system in their own country.  That is only a small proportion of people.</P>
        <P>I will not try to force Deputy Gilmore or anybody else in terms of what they believe.  I always tend to take account of what happens internationally.  These schemes operate very well and have been in existence for a long time.  I agree there is the difficulty of a backlog at the start, but if it is limited in number, that does not apply.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore regarding the various schemes, including those throughout the <Col N="1574"/>country.  I have made many of the presentations throughout my life&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has all right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and one notes on the night that half of the people being honoured do not turn up.  That says something, but it is not that these awards are unimportant.  The people concerned are not available on the night for one reason or another and they ask other people to collect the award on their behalf.</P>
        <P>Being recognised by a president of a country by a system set up by the political system is a different issue.  It does not take from the republican values because it happens in other countries.</P>
        <P>This issue has been raised by many people.  I did not start this debate, which has been ongoing for a long time, and I am sure I will not finish it.  It is a view of at least a considerable number of people that there should be a fitting system of recognising the abilities of inspirational people in an Irish context mainly and not international figures.  We can have the discussion to examine if anyone can devise a system and if we can do it, so be it, and similarly if we cannot do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the Taoiseach&rsquo;s opening reply concerning his correspondence with the various party leaders, I apologise for the lateness of my response but it is in his pigeon hole since this morning.  Like Deputy Gilmore and, I presume, Deputy Kenny, I consulted colleagues here and externally to put together a set of views on what is proposed.  I am happy to say I concur with much of what the Taoiseach said.  As an Irish republican, I believe an honours system can be devised that would be wholly compatible with republican principles.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility and of course it can be done.  I would see it as creating recognition awards.  I looked at An Agreed Programme for Government and noted there was a commitment included.  Deputy Ryan, a co-signatory of the programme for Government, should be equally aware.  Strangely enough, we have been discussing this issue for 35 minutes and it has not been alluded to at all.  The programme states the Government is committed to introducing what are described as national presidential citizens awards.  Is this the awards or honours scheme to which the Taoiseach is referring?  What does that commitment in the programme represent?  Is that what he is teasing out with the D&aacute;il and in correspondence recently?  Perhaps he can throw some light on the matter. </P>
        <P>There are real concerns, to some of which the Taoiseach referred in his deposition, his letter and replies this afternoon.  Will he again confirm that the selection process would have to be independent of the influence of the Government?  It <Col N="1575"/>would have to be either a commission or panel, as the Taoiseach referred to it, which would clearly have to be seen to be independent.  The address to the proposed recipients would refer to exemplary service to Ireland and their respective communities.  God forbid that anybody would be considered for one of these awards on the basis of his or her elected position in this House as regards the negotiation of Government support following a general election.  I notice Deputy Finian McGrath is to be the next questioner.  I am sure he will be interested to hear what the Taoiseach has to say in that respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>

	<P>He has got everything he is going to get, whatever it is. </P>
        <P>I have indicated and asked the Taoiseach to note that we will participate in the all-party consultative process, with a view to working with him in devising a system that would be appropriate and command the required respect and support of each citizen.</P>

	<P>I was not in any way being critical as regards replying to the letter.  That is not what I meant. </P>
        <P>In reply to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, it would have to be an independent and open system.  Those with an interest in this issue, including persons involved in big award schemes, say it would have to be a transparent system, as otherwise it would not work.  It would have to be open to everybody, something that may be won or achieved by anybody.  As such, it would be in line with a republican ethos.  An Agreed Programme for Government refers to a national presidential citizen&rsquo;s award, as recommended in the active citizenship report.  Such an award could be incorporated but it was intended to be entirely different from the State awards system.  It has been noted that there is a long list of awards around the country and the report recommended that the national presidential citizen&rsquo;s award be co-ordinated in some way, bearing in mind the hundreds of schemes in place.  It made a detailed recommendation, as drawn up by Ms Mary Davis and her colleagues earlier this year, but it is not the same.</P>
        <P>For my part, I brought forward a detailed document the last time based on the previous discussions.  I emphasise that while this is not the forum to go into detail on a proposed initiative, it would be prudent to let the outline of a scheme emerge organically from inter-party discussions and then see what would be possible.  If it was considered that it would not be possible, it would be added to the list of efforts made since 1930.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I was referring to all Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I thank the Taoiseach for the very positive response to the question.  I raised this issue during the term of the previous D&aacute;il.  Should any awards system not be based on democratic and republican principles?  One option would be to model it on the French scheme, whereby the authorities award citizens nationally and internationally but retain respect for those citizens and the democratic and republican tradition in France.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider this approach.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach recognise the number of people who are investing valuable time and significant sums of money in the voluntary and community sector?  I know of many individuals in and outside this country who have invested millions of euro to the benefit of disadvantaged children on the north side of Dublin.  The Taoiseach will be aware of this and has mentioned it in his responses so far.  Will he include such people, in addition to artists and sportspersons, in any honour system that is developed?  It is important that we do not forget their valuable contribution.</P>
        <P>A system of national recognition would not involve an award system such as that associated with conferring on an individual the freedom of a city or some other civic award.  It would be directed towards people who do extraordinary voluntary and community work in addition to those involved in music and the arts.  One should have an open mind on the matter.  I urge all Members to support the proposal because, as the Taoiseach stated, we are talking about it since 1930.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On Deputy Finian McGrath&rsquo;s first question, the French system is good, has worked well and has been in operation for a long time.  In this regard, one should bear in mind that France is a republic.  Its system is associated with the political system yet retains its independence.  It is easy enough to see how one can build a system around such a concept, and doing so would not present a difficulty for us.  I agree with the Deputy that our system should be open to <Col N="1577"/>every citizen involved in any service to mankind, including service to one&rsquo;s community.</P>
        <P>I agree most with Deputy Finian McGrath&rsquo;s last point.  Those who have been involved with award schemes, be they county-based or sectoral, have told me they like their own schemes and the associated annual events.  Nobody will ever need to change this but one must acknowledge there is a big difference between a county or organisational award scheme, associated with the arts, sport or another field, and one that confers national recognition.  It is an entirely different concept.  We must really decide whether we want an award scheme that, without conferring titles, recognises people in designated categories who do extraordinary work, provide exceptional services, achieve outstanding results, earn international distinction or make an inspirational contribution to a community.  We must decide whether it is a good idea to recognise these people by putting together an independent scheme with an arbitration committee.  Recognising the scheme in the Constitution is not the difficult matter; the challenge lies in deciding whether the scheme would get caught up in political argy-bargy.  If we want to go ahead with it, I will be happy to try to facilitate it, but if not, I will understand.</P>

	<P>How can we avoid politicising the issue?  The national lottery and the dormant accounts fund were supposed to be means by which funding would be provided to voluntary, community and local organisations and that was supposed to be done on a non-political basis and open to everybody, yet we all know that both processes have become highly politicised, down to the letter appearing a day beforehand in the pigeonholes of Government Deputies to give them advance notice to be out with the good news to the recipients.  How do we avoid a situation where if there is a national awards scheme, Government Deputies do not get a letter 24 hours in advance telling them the Government has decided to nominate or propose to the President that they get one of these awards?  </P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Having been on both sides of this House, I am not sure how I would solve that one because there is a consistency in that regard whoever is in government.  An awards scheme would be an entirely different system.  What happens in other countries and what would have to happen here is that a panel would undertake the task.  That is the only way it could be done to ensure the system is fair.  If it was seen as party political or favourable to the Government of the day or to some sector of society, it would not stand up.  In so far as we have award schemes &mdash; there are many such schemes &mdash; they cannot be criticised for that.  If the political system is involved, it would not be criticised either.  </P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</askee>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The public service pay bill is the biggest single element in public expenditure, accounting for approximately half of all current expenditure.  Every 1% increase in the public service pay bill costs approximately &euro;180 million.  The total cost of meeting the public service pay commitments arising from the current pay agreement under Towards 2016 will come to approximately &euro;1.7 billion.  This pay agreement expires at the end of September 2008 in the public service, but at various earlier dates in the private sector. </P>
        <P>In preparing for any forthcoming negotiations on arrangements to follow the current pay agreement under Towards 2016, it is important that expectations are kept in line with the economic realities we face.  In particular, regard must be had to the need to maintain and improve our competitiveness and, in the case of the public service, of the need to maintain budgetary discipline.  The national partnership agreements have served us well over the past decade and I hope that this well-tested approach can once again be relied upon in helping us to meet the emerging challenges we must face as a small open economy.</P>
        <P>The more recent national partnership agreements, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, Sustaining Progress and Towards 2016, have put in place a better framework for dealing with public service pay.  It provides a system under which the pay of public servants can be reviewed periodically on the basis of fair comparison with pay rates across the economy.  There is an equal set of ground rules that apply to every public service union.  As I said on many occasions, Government policy on public service pay is that the public service should be in a position to attract its fair share of good quality staff at all levels.  It should neither lead the market nor trail it.</P>
        <P>The other key feature of the framework which the agreements have put in place in respect of public service pay is the conditionality and verification provisions associated with pay increases.  Payment of any pay increases in the public service is contingent on co-operation with a robust agenda of measures to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and user-friendliness of our public services and to the maintenance of industrial <Col N="1579"/>peace.  Payment of any increase under the agreement is subject to verification of co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, including co-operation with the implementation of the agenda for modernisation.</P>
    
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>The report of the public service benchmarking body on the second benchmarking review of the pay of most public service grades is expected to be received around the end of the year.  The question of the implementation of the outcome of the benchmarking processes will be discussed by the parties in the context of discussions on whatever arrangements on pay and conditions are to be put in place on the expiry of the current pay agreement.</P>
  </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not disagree with the Minister that expectations must be kept in line with realities, that we need to be conscious of competitiveness and that conditionality is vital in any public pay settlement.  Against that background, how can he appeal for wage restraint from others when the Government will not apply it to itself?  I cite the recent pay increase of 14% to the Taoiseach and similar increases to Ministers. If no demands for performance have been made of senior managers and Ministers, how can the Minister refer to conditionality of the pay settlements of others, reform and better delivery at the front line?  Does the recent higher pay settlement repeat all the criticisms that were publicly made in the benchmarking process?  There was no transparency in the evidence presented and no taxpayers representative to deal with issues from a taxpayer&rsquo;s point of view and this payment is made without any improved performance from those receiving it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation that arose relates to the implementation of the independent review body on higher remuneration in the public sector.  It was established in 1969 as an independent standing body, whose primary function was to advise the Government on the general levels of remuneration appropriate to higher public servants in the Civil Service, local authorities, former health boards, non-commercial State bodies, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, hospital consultants, members of the Judiciary and holders of political office.  It is established Government policy to accept the recommendations of this independent review body.  It has been accepted by successive Governments.</P>
        <P>In its report the review body set out the basis for its decisions.  The Government has decided to phase in the increases over an 18-month period over three payments.  The payments are based on comparing public sector posts to private sector <Col N="1580"/>posts where the duties and responsibilities are comparable.  The recommendations are based on the lower quartile of the private sector rates and have been further reduced by 15% to allow for the superior value of public sector pensions relative to the private sector.</P>
        <P>I am mindful of the fact that the findings of the review body will inevitably attract adverse criticism, in terms of public service and national pay policy.  There is never a time when increases for top public service posts or the public service worker in general can be approved without attracting some adverse criticism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste set out two pillars of pay policy.  One was that expectations should be in line with reality.  How is an increase of &euro;38,000 for the Taoiseach in line with reality that our economy is facing?  The T&aacute;naiste also referred to conditionality, value for money for the taxpayer or users of public services.  Where is the value for money in the higher remuneration settlement?  There is no demand for higher performance and no performance linkage and the T&aacute;naiste is allowing these increases without them meeting his criteria.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is incorrect to state that the independent review body did not refer to performance pay.  Those were in respect of further performance related payments they suggested should be paid.  We have deferred consideration of these payments and they do not apply to the Judiciary or public office holders.  The review body suggests it is much less than the proportion of the pay available as bonuses to many in the private sector.  We were not prepared to go down that line.</P>
        <P>The comparison with the private sector was modified by the review body.  It was not a direct comparison with the private sector.</P>

	<P>It has been.  In respect of report No. 37 and the fifth general review, received in January 1997, on 4 March 1997 the Government published a report stating that in line with the established Government policy of accepting the recommendations of this independent review body, the Government had decided to accept the recommendations of report No. 37 in principle.  It went on to say, because there was an election coming up, that the question of imple<Col N="1581"/>mentation of the rates that would flow from the recommendation would be considered at a later date.  When the new Government took office it deferred implementation of the report until March 1998.  The Government then announced the implementation of the recommended increases, backdated to 1 April 1997.  All Members in that outgoing Administration took up that increase.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the way the most recent reported increase in inflation compares with the forecast he gave in his budget 2007 speech; the measures he will take to deal with the issue; the way he proposes to protect people on social welfare and lower incomes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[29583/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>On 6 December 2006, when I presented budget 2007, inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was forecast to average 4.1% this year.  This forecast was based on the normal technical assumption of unchanged interest rates.  The budget day forecast for the harmonised index of consumer prices inflation &mdash; the EU inflation measure &mdash; was 2.6% this year. </P>
        <P>The most recent inflation figures released by the Cental Statistics Office are those for October 2007.  These show consumer price index inflation running at an annual rate of 4.8% and harmonised index of consumer prices inflation running at 3%.  My Department published updated inflation forecasts in the pre-budget outlook in October.  At that stage inflation as measured by the consumer price index for the year as a whole was forecast at 4.9% and on the same basis the harmonised index of consumer prices inflation was forecast at 2.8%.</P>
        <P>Since budget day there have been three quarter-point interest rate increases.  Mortgage <Col N="1582"/>interest currently accounts for a significant proportion of the current rate of consumer price index inflation so that if mortgage interest is excluded, the year-on-year consumer price index average in the 12 months to October 2007 would be 2.8%.  On the normal assumption of no further interest rate increases, the rate of inflation is expected to moderate next year and this is reflected in the pre-budget outlook forecast for consumer price index inflation, which is forecast to average 2.2% over the period 2008 to 2010.</P>
        <P>Based on census 2006 figures, it is estimated that only approximately 40% of households hold mortgages.  That 40% can avail of mortgage interest relief, which currently applies at 20% and to a ceiling of &euro;8,000 single or &euro;16,000 married for first-time buyers for the initial seven years of their mortgage, and &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000, respectively, for all others.  The current level of mortgage interest relief for married first-time buyers is sufficient to cover the interest arising on a mortgage of up to approximately &euro;321,500 over 33 years at an interest rate of 5.0%, which is well above the average mortgage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Given his busy schedule, I do not know if the Taoiseach has had the opportunity to go shopping in a supermarket recently.  The price of bread has increased by 7%, flour by 11% and milk by 8.2%.  There has been a significant increase in the price of weekly shopping for an average family.  One has little change from &euro;150 for a family of three or from &euro;200 for a family of four.  What does the T&aacute;naiste propose to do to take account of inflation?  As the T&aacute;naiste is fond of pointing out, there are more than 600,000 people on the lowest level of PAYE, who are effectively outside that net because incomes are so low.  Does the T&aacute;naiste have measures in mind for these people, social welfare recipients or pensioners on budget day given that we are close to the top of the euro inflation league?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Record social welfare packages were introduced in the past three budgets, in view of the revenue available and the growth rates achieved.  Growth rates are changing and inflation must be monitored.  We intend to assist those on social welfare and, in my time as Minister for Finance, which added to the successful efforts of my predecessor, we have met national anti-poverty targets by increasing the basic rates up to those targets.  Significant funds were required to achieve this and we provided them.  I do not wish to comment on the budget.  However, continuing to try to maintain the living standards of those on social welfare payments is obviously a matter that we will continue to prioritise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister is aware that, even when one includes free schemes, <Col N="1583"/>a single pensioner&rsquo;s income does not amount to much more than &euro;12,500.  That is half of what Ministers each accepted in their recent salary increase of &euro;25,000.  How does the Minister expect to compensate people for the extraordinary increase in food costs?  Poorer people spend more of their income on food.  The Minister said nothing about the 600,000 plus on wages so low that they do not pay tax.  Will he enlighten us as to what his approach will be on budget day?  Does he propose to raise the tax on cigarettes?</P>
        <P Just="Left">An issue arises in respect of food costs.  Pig farmers feed their animals cereal which is continually rising in price.  They are being badly affected and not doing particularly well in terms of the price they pay versus their output.  This is a complex matter.  As the budget approaches, how does the Minister propose to address it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy is aware that two weeks prior to the budget I cannot discuss issues of that nature in any level of detail.  I can only provide a general indication of the Government&rsquo;s success up to now and refer to its and the previous Administration&rsquo;s intention to protect living standards of those in receipt of social welfare payments.  We have been extremely successful in removing hundreds of thousands from the tax net.  Some of the individuals concerned paid tax under previous Administrations, of which the Deputy was a member.</P>
        <P>I take the point regarding the need to ensure the living standards of those on social welfare payments are protected.  The price of food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 4.4% in October&rsquo;s CPI.  However, as this sector only accounts for less than 12% of the total weighting in the index, its impact would only have contributed approximately 0.5% to October&rsquo;s overall CPI increase.  Food price inflation has largely been driven by increases in raw material prices in global markets.  This matter is not within our control but, in the light of global developments, we must pay close attention to it.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> his views on whether the present structure relating to stamp duty is equitable in its impact; and if the faltering in the housing market presents an opportunity for reform. </Quest>
        <QRef>[29950/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of equity in the treatment of housing, of which the stamp duty code is a part, must be seen in the context of the overall tax treatment of property owners.  The OECD has reported that Ireland &ldquo;has some of the most generous tax provisions for owner-occupied housing&rdquo;.  Ireland is the only country to <Col N="1584"/>allow tax relief on rent, mortgage interest payments, capital gains and capital acquisitions, while not applying an annual property tax.  Furthermore, stamp duty helps fund public services such as health and education, while keeping the direct tax burden low.  This facilitates continued economic success which benefits all taxpayers and their families and has allowed us to reduce taxes on work and enterprise with clear benefits for the economy as a whole.</P>
        <P>It is a long-standing tradition that the Minister for Finance does not comment on tax measures in the run-up to the budget.  However, the programme for Government commitments in this regard have been met.  The Finance (No. 2) Act 2007 introduced a full exemption from stamp duty for first-time buyers in accordance with the commitments made in the programme for Government.  This change brought about a positive impact upon the ability of first-time buyers to purchase their first home.  This has widened the choice available to first-time buyers and removed an obstacle to their establishing their own homes in the neighbourhoods and communities in which they grew up.  These matters are monitored on a continual basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that the legislation he introduced prior to the summer recess was a sham?  The legislation to which I refer did nothing in respect of introducing mobility to the market.  As matters stand at the end of the third financial quarter, almost 10,600 fewer houses have been built this year compared to last.  The Minister&rsquo;s pre-budget outlook is built on the estimated completion of approximately 60,000 houses.  The eminent firm of Goodbody Stockbrokers has indicated that the actual figure may be as low as 50,000.  As the Minister is aware, there is a loss of almost &euro;1 billion for every reduction of 10,000 in the overall figure.</P>
        <P>The Minister last night stated, as part of the Indecon public policy lecture he delivered at the Royal Irish Academy, that he was building his budget on three priorities, one of which was equity in tax treatment.  The current position on stamp duty is inequitable.  The Minister must follow through on his public pronouncements and make what he is saying part of policy.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that the Finance (No. 2) Act 2007 which was passed before the summer recess has had no impact on the market?  He stated stamp duty was a great provider of revenue.  However, the Exchequer is going to be short almost &euro;600 million because he failed to introduce the stamp duty proposals he was supposed to bring forward.  HIs former colleague, Michael McDowell, previously indicated that stamp duty was to be done away with.  This week, another of his former colleagues, Tom Parlon, as head of the Construction Industry Federation stated the goose that was laying the golden eggs <Col N="1585"/>was no longer doing so.  The Minister must reform the stamp duty regime.  Will he do so?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>These matters were widely amplified and articulated as the people went to the polls and made decisions in respect of some of them.  I note the Deputy&rsquo;s interest in protecting the tax base.  His party&rsquo;s election campaign proposal in respect of this matter would have cost &euro;660 million in a full year and would not have had any impact on prices or accrued any benefits for first-time buyers, the only ones who come into the market without equity.  The housing market has been extremely buoyant for the past decade.  In the past, criticisms from the benches opposite in respect of this matter related to the affordability of house purchases.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to consider this issue in the proper context.  I am glad the Deputy referred to the speech I made last night in which I set out where the priorities for the economy in the next decade should lie.  Since I became Minister for Finance, I have brought forward initiatives which have in my view and in any objective analysis improved equity within the tax system.  When the Deputy&rsquo;s party was in office, hundreds of thousands on low pay or the minimum wage paid tax.  They no longer do so.  That is a testimony to the improvements in equity for those in most need who were not catered for when the Deputy&rsquo;s party was in office.</P>
        <P>That we have continued to improve the lot of those paying tax at the standard rate by widening the bands is another achievement.  When one considers the contribution of capital taxes as against that of income tax and consumption taxes paid by individuals, one can see that the percentage of the tax take has more than trebled, from 4% to almost 12%, since the Deputy&rsquo;s party was in office.  These are indications of the improvements that have been made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The facts do not speak for themselves.  House prices have decreased by 5% in the past year.  The tax take is down as regards stamp duty.  The Minister is forgetting that stamp duty is part of a basket of taxes.  If it is not collected in respect of houses, neither is VAT.  We talk about stamp duty and CGT holding at 15% but that is not the case.  The Minister must reform this area.  During the election campaign Fine Gael put forward an extremely pragmatic proposal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must put a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to the effect that the first &euro;100,000 should be exempt, the next &euro;350,000 should be taxed at 5% and the balance at 9%.  Will the Minister adopt and introduce this <Col N="1586"/>practical measure?  It would move the market which is in need of movement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Deputy was busy canvassing in his constituency at the time but these arguments were all rehearsed and a democratic decision was taken in respect of them, particularly in the context of his party&rsquo;s specific proposal.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In the two years prior to the general election house prices were rising.  When one considers movements in house prices, it is important to recognise that one is coming at this matter against a background of previous rises in such prices.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is also negative equity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The rises to which I refer occurred during a period when we were trying to make house prices more affordable.  One cannot, depending on which vested interest one talked to most recently, jump from one side of the argument to the other.</P>

        <Quest> the extent of the shortfall in his tax projections made at the time the programme for Government was drawn up for the year 2010 as a result of his revision in economic growth; and whether he plans to review the commitments in the programme for Government as a result. </Quest>
        <QRef>[29717/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In the pre-budget outlook released in mid-October, a technical fiscal position for the years 2008 to 2010 was set out in Table 6.  The publication projected tax receipts for 2010 to be &euro;56,520 million on a technical basis, an increase of 6.25% over the 2009 estimate.  This was the first time my Department published a tax revenue projection for 2010.  Tax revenue of this magnitude is substantial and will enable the Government to continue to make adequate provision for day-to-day public services and investment.</P>
        <P>Revised economic and fiscal projections for the period from 2008 to 2010 as well as estimated outturns for 2007 will be provided in the annual budget which I will present to the House on 5 December.  These updates will take account of all relevant developments since the publication of the pre-budget outlook.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government is an agreed five-year programme between the Government parties in which we set out our guiding economic <Col N="1587"/>and budgetary policy principles.  In this regard, I remind the Deputy we are fully committed to a responsible fiscal policy.  Detailed spending and taxation plans for 2008 will also be presented to the House on budget day.  These will represent the first instalment of the Government&rsquo;s delivery of the programme for Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>In the manifesto set out by Fianna F&aacute;il, tax revenue for 2010 was projected at &euro;61.4 billion.  This manifesto, which committed to major improvements, will have a black hole of &euro;4.9 billion by that year.  The total for the improvements committed to is &euro;5.2 billion if the commitment to have a surplus that year is included.  Given that the Minister will have less than 10% of the revenue he thought he would for these improvements, what is going to give?  Will he revise these commitments or will we pretend the Minister will be able to fund 4,000 extra garda&iacute;, 2,000 extra consultants and 4,000 extra teachers?  Will he have a medium-term prospect of what is realistic given the resources available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In our manifesto we set out what we expected from a 4.5% rise in growth per year and the spending priorities we would outline.  Since then, we had the election and a programme for Government in which we set out the stall of the Government.  In the second half of this year we saw a further slow down.  The entire programme for Government and all manifesto commitments based on the assumptions set out are based on prudent and efficient management of the economy.  If the suggestion is that I am obligated to proceed regardless of present economic circumstances or forecasts and proceeding with spending plans based on 4.5% growth which will not be achieved next year, I do not believe this is a responsible fiscal position to take.</P>
        <P>During the course of the election campaign, I outlined what my priorities would be in the event of a slowdown and I note Fine Gael&rsquo;s attempt to continue to run it.  Fianna F&aacute;il documentation on jobs and employment which is available on the website confirm the priorities to maintain capital spending under the development plan and to target tax changes towards those most in need.  This has always been my position.  The budget will outline the Government&rsquo;s spending plans from 2008 to 2010 and what are our priorities in view of the economic circumstances with which we now contend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>What are we to make of the programme for Government published in June to which all parties signed up?  The Minister will not tell us how much it will cost but I estimate the total will be at least &euro;7.5 billion.  The total amount of revenue which in May the Minister stated would underpin it will not be there.  Is the <Col N="1588"/>programme for Government a work of fiction or a genuine planning document on the basis of which we can expect the Government to develop its ideas?  If the Minister now states the money will not be there, let us have a realistic programme and we will consider priorities.  Is the Government&rsquo;s priority the NDP or to have 4,000 extra teachers or 2,000 extra garda&iacute;?  The public deserves to know and we deserve to have a sensible programme so we know how the money will be used and how scarcities will be prioritised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The programmes put forward in the election by Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s party and other parties with which it wished to coalesce were not specific when it was pointed out they were &euro;1.7 billion above its programme commitments during the second week of the campaign.  This was not Fine Gael&rsquo;s fault.  It came from the then leader of the Labour Party who promised the sun, moon and stars to everybody.</P>
        <P>Every programme is based on assumptions and we set out clearly what were our assumptions.</P>

We will aim to achieve further significant sustainable growth, operate a responsible fiscal policy, deliver the national development plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;with regard to all current spending.</P>
        <P>Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s critique is that I will not reduce current spending quickly enough.  I do not know where this will leave his figures.  I seek to accommodate all day-to-day expenditure in the context of a responsible fiscal policy which will <Col N="1589"/>not compromise capital investment because this was the mistake made by past successive Governments when faced with the same dilemma.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a black hole in the programme for Government and the Minister will not face up to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>No, there is not.  Every programme for Government, including the one negotiated by Deputy Lowry prior to Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s brother becoming Taoiseach, has a covering budgetary context in which it is achieved.  This is no different in this programme for Government.  A programme would be meaningless if it did not have such a covering budgetary parameter which confirms what will be done in the context of the growth the Government seeks to achieve.  Without this, Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s contentions are meaningless.  It is the budgetary context&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Financial Stability Report 2007 published last week by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, CBFSAI, is a comprehensive and detailed assessment of the impact of international financial market conditions on the  Irish financial services sector and on financial conditions in the economy generally.  I welcome the CBFSAI&rsquo;s conclusion that the financial system is well placed to withstand any adverse economic and sectoral developments in the short to medium term.  The report highlights that based on key indicators such as asset quality, profitability, solvency and liquidity the Irish banking system is strong and robust and is clear that domestic banks have no significant direct or indirect exposure to US sub-prime mortgages.</P>
        <P>The Central Bank&rsquo;s report draws attention to a number of welcome improvements in the overall financial environment over the past year, in particular to the moderation in growth in house prices and private sector credit growth.  The report also finds that underlying fundamentals of the residential property market continue to appear reasonably strong.  It emphasises that the safe<Col N="1590"/>guarding of our international competitiveness is essential to securing the growth potential of our economy, particularly in the context of the expected moderation in the residential construction sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Effective and efficient financial regulation is a key element of overall financial stability in the context of international financial market developments.  In Ireland, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland provides a highly effective financial regulatory and supervisory regime.  This is central to the resilience and well-being of the sector, helping to maintain financial stability, ensuring effective prudential supervision and promoting the interests of consumers.  The integrated structure we have adopted for the supervision of individual financial firms and the monitoring and maintaining of financial stability overall confers significant advantages in ensuring effective and timely co-ordination of these important functions.</P>
        <P>The authority functions within the overall context of the Eurosystem and the European Central Bank whose operational framework has functioned well in response to recent financial market developments.  My Department will continue to work closely with the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland to oversee national financial stability planning arrangements in line with EU requirements.</P>
   
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P Just="Left">There is also a co-ordinated EU response to international financial market conditions.  EU Finance Ministers have agreed on a set of common principles and a roadmap of further actions to enhance financial stability arrangements and the ability of authorities to respond to market developments.  Ireland is of course participating fully in this work to ensure there is an effective EU-wide system to maintain financial stability taking into account the important cross-border linkages that now exist in EU financial markets. </P><P Just="Left">In conclusion, I share the Central Bank's assessment that the Irish economy continues to support the stability of the financial system and that the Irish financial sector remains in good health.</P>
   </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask two questions.  The Minister raised the financial stability report of the Central Bank.  However, he neglected to mention this report states the system has a weakness.  The Central Bank carried out a survey of the licensed financial banks and found that joint ventures or special purpose vehicles are sub-prime conduits and are not regulated.  Is the Minister concerned about this?  We do not have proper controls.  The ISTC, which is on the verge of going out of business, directly entered the retail sector through Friends First and 125 <Col N="1591"/>retailers invested in it, one of which was a credit union.  That has an impact on the ordinary man on the street.  Based on the financial instability report and what I have said, is the T&aacute;naiste satisfied that proper controls are in place?  Will he comment on the fact that the value of bank shares, which make up a substantial proportion <?oasys _dc28- ?>of the Irish Stock Exchange&rsquo;s value, has dropped by nearly half?  Can he explain this significant decrease?<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Special investment vehicles fall outside the remit of regulation and do not have an interface with the public in terms of taking deposits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly they had.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue raised by the Deputy pertains to the fact that complex financial vehicles and arrangements are in place and we have to regulate them in so far as it is possible and consistent with normal commercial arrangements to do so.  With regard to the Stock Exchange, markets react to sentiments and events in the sub-prime market and across the world.  Obviously, the inter-bank market has experienced turbulence and that is feeding into market sentiment and affecting bank shares.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste did not answer my question.  Does he think regulation should be introduced in the area of special investment vehicles?  If the sector is so secure, based on the Central Bank&rsquo;s assurances, why are the share prices of banks falling?  Is he satisfied the banking system does not have any inherent problems?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Governor of the Central Bank spoke on the matter at the launch of the bank&rsquo;s financial stability report for 2007.  He noted that while much depends on the possible evolution and duration of the current market turbulence, there are concerns that a prolonged period of market disruption could affect economic activity by increasing the cost of credit to firms and individuals and reducing the volume of credit banks are willing to extend to borrowers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the T&aacute;naiste happy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy that we have a robust financial system in Ireland which is well regulated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the T&aacute;naiste confident that we will experience no issues in the next several months similar to those which affected ISTC?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is nothing, of which I am aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1592"/>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Should we not therefore have controls over the area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy wants a reply, I will give him one but if he asks ten further questions while I am answering, it will be difficult for anyone to know what is going on.  I have given my reply and I concur with the Governor.  The Central Bank and the regulatory authority continue constantly to monitor the situation.  We have seen turbulence in financial markets but I am satisfied we have a well capitalised and regulated banking system.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>Special investment vehicles are considered at European level.  Deputies will recall that when the Northern Rock issue arose, a meeting was held that weekend of Finance Ministers.  One of the conclusions of the meeting was that methods of working together needed to be found so as to address these issues in a way that does not hinder the efficacy of the system but enables commercial dealings to continue.</P>

        <Quest> if he has proposals to cap the benefit that a person can derive from cumulative tax breaks on investments outside their principal occupation; and the number of persons with an income in excess of &euro;500,000 and bands of &euro;50,000 above that who pay tax at the standard 20% rate or less, including those paying 5% and below, for the most recent year for which figures are available. </Quest>
        <QRef>[29597/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In budget 2006 I announced the introduction of a limit with effect from 1 January 2007 on the use of tax reliefs, including certain exemptions by some high-income individuals.  This measure was designed to address the issue of a small number of individuals with high incomes who, mainly by means of the cumulative use of various tax incentive reliefs, have been able to reduce their income tax liability to a very low level or to zero.  Such individuals are no longer able to do so.  This provision ensures that such individuals who use tax incentive schemes will have an effective rate of income tax for each year of not less than approximately 20% on the income sheltered by such schemes.</P>
        <P>The method used to increase the rates at which these high income individuals pay tax effectively addresses the equity concerns raised over the past number of years while at the same time ensuring the intended incentive effects of tax schemes will continue to be delivered.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent basic data on incomes available from which information of the type requested by the Deputy could be derived are in <Col N="1593"/>respect of the income tax year 2004.  The data are set out in detail in the table.  The figures show that in 2004, of the 2,544 people with incomes in excess of &euro;500,000, 21% had an effective rate of tax of 20% or less.  Within this category, 7% had <Col N="1594"/>an effective rate of 5% or less.  The data also show that 79% had an effective rate in excess of 20%.  It should be noted these figures are historical and predate the changes I have outlined in regard to the restriction of reliefs.</P><Col N="1593"/>

	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that the taxation system should be fair and equitable?  Essentially, the Revenue survey shows that over 10% of earners in the top 400 have a tax rate of 5% or lower.  Much of that 5% exists because the T&aacute;naiste changed the statistics to include the payment of DIRT in order to create some notion of these people paying tax.</P>
        <P>Does he intend to extend the use of such tax breaks or will he curtail them?  The recommendation from Indecon, the consultants he appointed last year, was that from the perspective of economic efficiency none of these tax breaks should last longer than three years and they should not be undertaken unless they are clearly evaluated and subjected to a cost-benefit analysis.  These tax breaks are basically State subsidies for the very wealthy.  Does the T&aacute;naiste propose to continue and expand them in the forthcoming budget?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not comment on specific tax issues but I will answer Deputy Burton&rsquo;s questions to the extent that I can.  The issue raised by the Deputy pertains to the roles tax relief schemes play in promoting economic and social development.  She referred to a review which I asked to be conducted and which recommends that in the future, consideration should be <Col N="1594"/>given to tax incentive schemes on the basis of their being time limited and specific.  I certainly see merit in that recommendation.</P>
        <P>I do not intend stating what I propose to do in the forthcoming budget.  The review took place during my tenure and I have sought to introduce measures to deal with the situation, while recognising that it is not a matter of being opposed to tax incentive schemes <i>per se</i> but of ensuring we target the incentivisation in our tax policies towards new priorities or areas that are now regarded as required in the present economic circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste indicated the existence of new priorities.  Would he like to tell the House what these new priorities might be in respect of tax breaks?</P>
        <P>Has he a clear idea of the cost of the proposals for co-locating private hospitals on the grounds of public hospitals?  For every &euro;1 million invested in a private hospital bed on a co-located site, the tax expenditure will be a minimum of &euro;410,000.  An additional PRSI element will also accrue.</P>
        <P>He seemed to indicate that he is thinking in terms of the budget.  What are the parameters of the additional tax breaks and will he follow his consultant&rsquo;s recommendations on a three-year <Col N="1595"/>duration and the publication of full cost-benefit analyses prior to the introduction of proposals?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy clearly made a specific interpretation of what I said.  I was speaking about matters of general principle rather than specifically addressing any impending issues.  The criteria set out in the tax review report, which I instigated, have a lot of merit.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I asked is that the Minister accepted the recommendations.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have accepted the recommendations on the one or two occasions I introduced specific schemes.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question was not related to the question she tabled.  Rather than surmise and be misinterpreted again, I ask the Deputy to table a question and I will give an accurate answer.  </P>
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that many people will find it unfair that in 2004 500 people earning more than &euro;500,000 per annum paid less than the standard rate of tax?  Does he propose to introduce any new reliefs?  He stated reliefs should be time limited and specific.  Will he also act on the third recommendation of the report, namely, that a cost benefit analysis be carried out to justify any new relief before its introduction?  Will he act on this recommendation before any new reliefs are introduced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister believe that increased restrictions on the use of specified tax reliefs by high income individuals would lead to a fairer taxation system?  For example, will he consider introducing a ceiling restricting the proportion of income high income earners could use for tax exemption purposes?  Would a figure of 10%  be reasonable? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, I introduced restrictions on tax reliefs, the benefits of which will emerge in the statistics over time.  Some of those who criticise me did not introduce these types of restrictions when they had an opportunity to do so. </P>
        <P>To respond to Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s point, an evaluation of the tax schemes I have introduced was published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  I am, therefore, aware of the recommendations.  As I indicated, in having a general discussion about tax reliefs I do not want to create anticipation that schemes will be introduced either in the budget or subsequently.  This is a matter for decision at the appropriate time.</P>

        <Quest> his proposals to weight vehicle registration tax in favour of cars with <Col N="1596"/>lower emissions; the estimated annual cost of this proposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[29589/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the budget on any tax or expenditure matters that might be the subject of budget decisions.  I am sure the Deputy will not wish me to depart from this practice given that budget day is so close.  He will, however, recall that in my 2007 Budget Statement, I announced it was intended to rebalance the current VRT system to take greater account of environmental policy objectives, in this case reducing carbon dioxide &mdash; CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> &mdash; emissions.  I indicated that there should be greater rewards built into the VRT system for choosing lower emission vehicles and that those choosing higher emission vehicles should pay more.  For that reason, a range of options was set out in the budget booklet for making such a move and a public consultation process was announced.  Any changes were to have effect from a target date of 1 January 2008.</P>
        <P>At the same time, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced he would consult on his proposals for a complementary rebalancing of annual motor tax.  Underpinning both of these initiatives would be a new mandatory labelling system for cars based on CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emission levels somewhat on the lines of that used for white goods.  The programme for Government further underpinned the commitment to examine this issue, stating &ldquo;we will introduce measures to further weight VRT and motor tax in favour of cars with lower emissions&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The consultation paper issued last December set out four broadly revenue neutral possible options for rebalancing VRT to take greater account of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  More than 60 submissions were received, of which 19 were from representative organisations or firms, with the remainder from individuals.  Representatives from the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have met eight representative organisations and some individuals to discuss their submissions.  Work on considering possible options has continued, taking into account the growing emphasis being placed on climate change at national and international level and the views expressed during the public consultation process.</P>
        <P>As I stated in reply to a parliamentary question on 3 October, as regards the timing of when any changes in VRT would be implemented, it is desirable that members of the public be given reasonable notice of changes being introduced.  For this reason, it is proposed to provide in the Finance Bill 2008 for changes to the VRT system <Col N="1597"/>that might be introduced, with an implementation date of around mid-2008.</P>
        <P>VRT is an important source of revenue for the Exchequer, yielding &euro;1.3 billion in 2006 or approximately 3% of the total net tax receipts.</P>
 
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
<P>In introducing changes to the VRT system it is desirable that the system be maintained as simple as is possible in terms of its administration and the ease with which it is understood.  In addition, the VRT yield should, as far as possible, be protected and retained at the level it would have achieved if the proposed changes had not been introduced.  Consequently, there is much to consider before any changes are decided.</P>
     </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>On the promise to rebalance the car taxation system in VRT and annual motor tax, members of the public want to know whether tax on the very large gas guzzling sport utility and other vehicles one sees in parts of central Donnybrook will increase.  As these vehicles are relatively new and their emissions will be lower than some older vehicles, with the result that the changes in the budget could benefit the owners of these vehicles and give a fiscal belt, as it were, to less well-off drivers with older cars that have higher emissions levels.  The Minister referred to rebalancing the system.  Has he made up his mind in this regard?  </P>
        <P>The programme for Government included a promise to produce an annual carbon budget immediately beside the budget.  This and the estimates for budget day are a surprise.  Will it set out the comparative emissions costs and the Minister&rsquo;s ambitions regarding vehicle emissions, in terms of VRT and annual road tax?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I provided detailed replies on the carbon report in response to previous parliamentary questions, including some of today&rsquo;s questions.  </P>
        <P>The proposal on vehicle registration tax is based on moving the focus of VRT from engine size to a vehicle&rsquo;s CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  I do not propose to provide details at this stage as this is a matter for announcement at the appropriate time.  The proposal is to replace the old system, which was based on engine size, with one based on CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>While I welcome the proposed change in vehicle registration tax, I will press the Minister on whether the initiative will be revenue neutral.  An important principle the public wants applied to green taxation is that revenue derived from taxing something undesirable should be recycled and should not result in an overall increase in taxation levels.  Will the Minister give a commitment that he will rebalance motor tax and vehicle registration tax <Col N="1598"/>on the basis of tax neutrality and that it will not raise revenue for Exchequer purposes.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>With any rebalancing there will be winners and losers.  In this case, the category into which one falls will depend on the type of vehicle one drives.  We are trying to achieve an outcome broadly in line with what the Deputy suggests. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a great deal of discussion about the imposition of higher VRT rates on larger engines.  Some people will continue to drive cars with larger engines regardless of what VRT rate is imposed.  If we are serious about addressing CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions, surely action can be taken in respect of matters over which the State has control, for example, public transport.  What is being done to introduce buses with hybrid engines?  As Deputy Bruton stated, surely it is time to ring-fence revenue extracted from people so that we can deal with the serious issue of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Measures such as the modernisation of the bus fleet obviously help to reduce the fleet&rsquo;s CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and its contribution to environmental damage.  A range of public transport initiatives have been introduced, including infrastructural projects and measures to remove trucks from some routes.  People can see the visible improvement these measures have had, for example, in improving the quality of life for people living in Dublin.  Deputy Barrett is correct in that everyone must put his or her shoulder to the wheel in the area of environmental protection and engage in more environmentally friendly behaviour, particularly in the area of transport.  The significant investment initiatives in public transport under Transport 21 are designed to reduce the rate of increase seen in private vehicle use and ensure that people have quality options which are more environmentally friendly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of possible changes in annual road tax, does the Minister propose to move away from the system where road tax is based on engine size?  The European Union has a long-standing proposal for a directive on car taxation and harmonisation, in favour of reducing tax on vehicles that have lower emission levels per kilometre travelled.  Does the Government agree with the overall EU approach to the harmonisation of motor vehicle taxation?  Is that consistent with the carbon budget principles outlined in the programme for Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Motor taxation is, primarily, a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as proceeds from it go to local government funds.  It is a devolved matter in terms of the availability of the resources to local authorities.  Therefore, I do <Col N="1599"/>not want to comment, pending the announcement of any arrangements the Minister wishes to make in that respect, particularly at this stage of the budgetary process.</P>
        <P>I am not <i>au fait</i> with the details of the directive and perhaps it would be better for the Deputy to make contact with the Departments of Transport and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or put a question to them to check the situation.</P>

	<P>The Minister is aware there are severe penalties for people who fall behind on repayments to sub-prime lenders.  The courts are currently witnessing hundreds of cases per month of sub-prime lenders moving against people who raised mortgages through them.  Does the Minister intend to introduce any regulations for the schedule of penalties and charges sub-prime lenders impose on lenders when they fall behind?  Many people are now beginning to have their homes repossessed and the penalty charges made by sub-prime lenders over a short period are extremely severe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is aware that this area of the market accounts for just 2% <Col N="1600"/>of the Irish mortgage market, compared to about 15% in the United States.  She is also aware that as regards lending in the market and taking steps to improve the situation for borrowers, people lending in the area uphold basic standards.  Section 19 of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007, which was recently enacted, amended Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997 to provide for a system of authorisation and regulation of retail credit firms and home reversion providers.  The primary purpose of the amendment was to extend to customers of these firms the benefits and protections provided for in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s consumer protection code.  This provides a line of redress to those treated wrongly by any of these providers.</P>

	<P>I want to ask the Taoiseach about the situation arising from the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la yesterday to grant planning permission for a major incinerator in Dublin city for 600,000 tonnes of waste.  The Taoiseach is aware that this incinerator is in addition to the incinerator in County Meath which has approval to deal with 200,000 tonnes of waste.  Furthermore, it is in addition to other planned incinerators around the country, one of which is on the M50 and which will deal with 330,000 tonnes of waste.</P>
        <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s decision and that for the incinerator in County Meath were based on what An Bord Plean&aacute;la understood to be Government waste management policy.  However, that waste management policy has had a different articulation in the past 24 hours, from the man responsible for the environment and Government policy in this area.  His view is that it is now Government policy to make the incinerator at Poolbeg redundant.  That is what he has said.</P>
        <P>On one hand we have one arm of Government, namely, Dublin City Council, going to spend &euro;300 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money on an incinerator to deal with 600,000 tonnes of waste.  On the other <Col N="1602"/>hand, we have the Minister &mdash; the helpless and hapless Deputy John Gormley.  He sits side by side with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Like the muppets Statler and Waldorf, they comment on everything but are not able to implement anything.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach, as head of Government, tell us what is Government policy on the disposal of waste?  Is it policy to provide two, four or eight incinerators or is it based on capacity of 400,000 tonnes?  Does the Taoiseach agree with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that Government policy is now to make the approved incinerator in Poolbeg redundant?  Is that Government policy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>An Bord Plean&aacute;la has granted permission to Dublin City Council to develop a municipal waste incinerator with a capacity of 600,000 tonnes at Poolbeg.  This incinerator is provided for in the Dublin regional waste management plan.  That plan is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authorities led by Dublin City Council.  While the Minister has certain powers under the Act in regard to these plans, they are limited and it is quite wrong to suggest he could use any of his powers.  Some people outside of the House have suggested he should use section 24 to vary a management plan in a way that would halt the Poolbeg incinerator.  That is not correct.  The clear advice available to him is that this power cannot be used in a retrospective fashion to seek to halt a project which is already the subject of a contractual arrangement and applications for planning consents.</P>
        <P>In line with national policy, the Exchequer does not fund heavy waste infrastructure, landfills and waste energy incinerator plants. They are to be provided as a purely private sector commercial initiative or by way of a public private partnership with local authorities, as this one is, and Dublin City Council, acting for the four Dublin local authorities, has entered into a public private partnership to advance the Poolbeg incinerator.  The planning process operates independently of Ministers and of Government collectively.  This is as determined by the Oireachtas for very good reasons.  The project will also require a waste licence from the Environmental Protection Agency.  The waste licence, as with planning, is independent of Ministers.</P>
        <P>On the Government policy on waste, the programme for Government identifies the potential for other technologies such as the mechanical and biological treatment, the MBT as it is known, to reduce our reliance on incineration.  I raised this in the House when asked about it two or three weeks ago.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has presented figures produced by his Department showing that with a developed MBT system, the quantity of residual waste requiring <Col N="1603"/>disposal, other than landfill, would be reduced to some 400,000 tonnes by the next seven or eight years.  These figures are based on waste arising of 3.2 million tonnes nationally reducing to 1.7 million tonnes through a recycling rate of 50%.  The programme for Government also provides for a comprehensive review of our overall approach to waste management.  That review will encompass an examination of these alternatives to incineration and how they might be promoted.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has already prepared the terms of reference for this review and has brought them to Government.

	<P>The Taoiseach is being paid almost &euro;6,000 per week and he has not answered any of the questions I asked him, so I will ask them again.  It is the citizens of this city who will becomes the patsies because they will have to pay one way or the other.  The citizens of this city, the capital of our country, will pay for the farce that is going on.  I would have thought the Taoiseach would have left aside the spin doctors&rsquo; notes and answered the question he was asked, which was very straight, and to which there is a yes or no answer.  </P>
        <P>I remind the Taoiseach of what the Minister, Deputy Gormley, said on more than one occasion.  He said this incinerator would not go ahead with the Greens in Government.  He said, this incinerator would never be built.  In fact, he told me when I was canvassing in Rathmines &mdash; I met him on his bicycle without the armed guard behind him &mdash; that it would be over his dead body this incinerator in Poolbeg would ever see the light of day.  To use a pun, it is becoming a hot topic.</P>
        <P>Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s opinion and is it Government policy that the Poolbeg incinerator, approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, be made redundant?  He has not answered the question as to Government policy on the number of incinerators required on the estimates of Government.  Previously the number was eight, then it became two and later it became four.  What is the position?  Has the Government a view and has it made a decision on this issue?  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has said that he has changed Government policy on waste incineration.  Will the Taoiseach explain to the House how he has changed Government policy?  What great debate did he bring to the Cabinet that all the members of Fianna F&aacute;il and the solitary member of the Progressive Democrats said, &ldquo;By God, John, you are right, we had better change Government policy and get away from this business of having incineration as we had originally planned&rdquo;?  How has he changed Government policy?  Is the Taoiseach happy that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is articulating Government policy accurately?  If not, has he called in the Minister to <Col N="1604"/>explain to him that, as a new Minister, Government policy is a collective responsibility and that he should understand what is Government policy?  I would like, in respect of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s position, if he would answer some of those questions directly, without reference to the spin doctors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The only notes I have are departmental notes.  Departmental officials who are experts in this area are not spin doctors, with the greatest respect.  I will try to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.  As regards incineration, there are two private sector proposed developments, one in Meath for municipal waste and one in Cork for hazardous waste.  They have received planning permission and they have also received waste licences from An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Environmental Protection Agency, respectively.  It is entirely a matter for the company with these permissions as to whether the projects proceed.  The State has no financial involvement as I have already said.</P>
        <P>On 16 October when I last dealt with this matter here, An Bord Plean&aacute;la had granted permission for the expansion of the proposed plant in Meath from a capacity of 150,000 tonnes to 200,000 tonnes.  This is an entirely private sector development in which there is no State or local authority involvement.  As I have already said, Dublin City Council, acting on behalf of the local authorities, is proposing to construct a waste energy plant at Poolbeg in partnership with the private sector.  We have no direct involvement in this project, which is the subject of applications again for An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the EPA.  We are precluded by law from involvement in these processes and, therefore, I will not comment on them, and neither has the Minister, Deputy Gormley.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The programme for Government, that is Government policy, commits us to increasing recycling rates and to meeting our targets to divert biodegradable waste from landfill under the EU landfill directive.  It identifies the mechanical biological treatment of waste as one of a range of technologies which can be deployed to achieve this.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has presented figures, produced by the experts in his Department, showing that with a developed MBT system the quantity of residual waste requiring disposal in the next seven or eight years, other than landfill, will be reduced to some 400,000 tonnes by 2016.  It is in that context he made his remarks.  The figures are based on waste arising of 3.2 million tonnes nationally, reducing to 1.7 million tonnes through a recycling rate of 50%.  Some 800,000 tonnes of this can be landfill, without exceeding our landfill directive targets and the remainder can be further reduced by the MBT to a residual fraction of 400,000 tonnes waste that cannot be landfill.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am giving the Deputy the calculation and I am giving him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that but does the Taoiseach share his view that it should be redundant?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the view I share.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, and his Department see enormous potential for the role of refuse-derived fuel and other technologies in dealing with a residual fraction in a cost-effective environmentally sustainable manner.  The regional waste management plants currently in place provide for a substantial over-capacity for incineration of the order of 2 million tonnes.  As a first step to giving effect to a reduced emphasis on incineration, the Minister has advised the local authorities that he is minded to issue a policy direction under section 60 of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that.  Is it Government policy to make it redundant?  That is what I want to know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked a fair question, namely what Deputy Gormley has done, as Minister, to move the Government to a particular position.  I am just answering that question.  Section 60 of the Waste Management Act provides that local authorities should not enter into commitments in the context of public private partnerships to guarantee a specific volume of waste to the plant operator, other than in respect of recycling or composting facilities.  As a further step, in meeting the programme for Government commitments, the Minister has directed his Department to commission a major review of waste management planning as provided for in that programme.  </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Very briefly, the Deputy asked a question about the Minister, Deputy Gormley&rsquo;s comment, about making Poolbeg redundant.  In fairness to the Minister, he made that reference to the overall capacity required nationally for incineration of terminal treatment.  I have already outlined,  as has the Minister, that if the recycling and MBT capacity is increased, that can reduce residual waste to a fraction of the waste to about 400,000 tonnes.  It is in that capacity that he believes it can be reduced.  That is the factual position.    </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>On 19 April the current Minister, Deputy Gormley, issued a statement chiding the then leader of the Progressive Democrats, Mr. Michael McDowell, on his record in regard to the proposed incinerator at Ringsend.  He drew attention to the fact that Mr. McDowell had said in 2002 that he would use his position in Cabinet to change Government policy on the incinerator and make sure it was stopped.  He went on to state the Green Party had been very clear that, if it was in government, the incinerator project would not go ahead.  He now states that, since he got into government, he has found he cannot do anything about it.  He must be the first politician to find on being appointed to ministerial office that he had less power than he had when he was an Opposition Deputy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What he said is not true, nor is what the Taoiseach has just said in respect of the powers of the Minister.  Under section 143 of the Planning and Development Act, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is required to &ldquo;have regard to the policies and objectives for the time being of the Government... [and] the Minister&rdquo;.  This was the precise section of the Act on which An Bord Plean&aacute;la relied when it overturned the inspector&rsquo;s report on the planning appeal against the incinerator in Ringaskiddy and decided the project would go ahead because it was in line with Government policy.  It is the same section on which An Bord Plean&aacute;la has repeatedly relied to give approval for roads and a variety of other infrastructural projects, notwithstanding what happens at the appeal hearing.  It is in line with Government policy or that of the Minister.</P>
        <P>Since last June the Minister has had the opportunity and power to change the policy.  Under the Planning and Development Act, he could have issued guidelines, a direction or even made a policy statement that there was a change in Government policy and that the Government was no longer in favour of incineration.  If that had happend, I presume An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in line with that policy, would yesterday have turned down the planning application for the incinerator in Ringsend.  Of course, the Minister did not do that.  Instead, the day after the horse bolted, he has announced that he is changing Government policy and will make the incinerator in Ringsend redundant.</P>
        <P>I have two questions for the Taoiseach, the first a simple one.  Will the incinerator project in Ringsend go ahead?  If, as I anticipate, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer is yes, what does the Minister mean when he says he will make it redundant?  The Taoiseach should not give me all the figures he gave Deputy Kenny regarding the mechanical and biological treatment, MBT, process the Minister will use.  What he is talking about is what goes into the brown bin; what goes into the black bin will be <Col N="1607"/>dealt with in Ringsend.  What does the Minister mean when he says he will make the Ringsend incinerator redundant?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The first answer which I have given is short.  There is private sector involvement with the four councils in Dublin.  The incinerator project received An Bord Plean&aacute;la approval and must go through the EPA process and meet whatever other standards with which it must comply.  If it complies with them, it can go ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not going to do it if it is not in accordance with Government policy.  Who would do it if it would not be used?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I also replied to the second question.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has indicated the overall capacity required nationally for incineration or thermal treatment.  If we increase recycling and MBT capacity, we can reduce the residual fraction of waste to 400,000 tonnes in the next seven years.  That is what the Minister and his Department will endeavour to achieve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer is no.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response that the incinerator project in Ringsend will go ahead, notwithstanding the pledge made by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, last April that the Green Party would stop it.  We are now working in a situation where the project will go ahead.  Will the Taoiseach explain why An Bord Plean&aacute;la which is required to comply with Government policy made a decision yesterday to grant planning permission for an incinerator with a capacity to deal with 600,000 tonnes if the Government&rsquo;s policy is to limit it to a figure of 400,000 tonnes?  I do not doubt the genuineness of the Minister&rsquo;s intentions last April when he told his constituents he would stop the project from going ahead.  Has he sold the pass on the Ringsend incinerator off his own bat or did the Taoiseach and the rest of the Government force him to do so?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy knows, this decision has been awaited for a considerable time.  The incinerator is provided for in the Dublin regional waste management plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This plan is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authorities, led by Dublin City Council.  While the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has certain powers under the Act in regard to the plan, they are limited.  He does not have powers that could halt the Poolbeg incinerator project.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>He does have the power.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has powers to promote waste management policies.  This is becoming a recycling society; we are moving away from a throwaway culture.  Recycling rates are increasing rapidly.  We are using modern, environmentally safe methods for the final disposal of non-recyclable material.  The Minister is driving this policy forward.  There is concerted enforcement to tackle illegal waste activity.  The Government programme will build on the achievements of recent years and re-energise the national effort to manage waste in a world class fashion.  As I noted, there are new technologies such as mechanical and biological treatment &mdash; MBT, as it is known internationally &mdash; to reduce our reliance on incinerators.  The Minister and his colleagues in the Department are endeavouring to increase that capacity.  If they succeed, we will not require incineration at the level we would otherwise require.</P>

	<P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach a question in respect of the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill.  This Bill was put into suspension before, for good reasons, when the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was in charge.  There were implications that it might send a wrong signal to a tribunal sitting on particular matters.  Obviously, the Taoiseach will have to do his business before the tribunal again.  Does he not think that it would be beneficial to leave this Bill aside for a couple of months in order not to send that kind of signal to the tribunal?  Is this not a symptom of a complete lack of legislative proposals from the Government?  Six months after the general election there is no legislative programme and we have statements this week which, in many respects, is not why we are here.  Has the Taoiseach not considered the implications of taking the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill now, in view of the fact that, in his capacity, he will have to appear before the tribunal and answer questions again in a few weeks&rsquo; time?  This could be better left for a period until that matter is out of the way one way or another.</P>
        <P>Did the Cabinet finalise its view today on the question of this country supplying troops to Chad on peace enforcement and peacekeeping duties?  Was the Cabinet satisfied by the Minister for <Col N="1611"/>Defence&rsquo;s briefing that sufficient logistical and air transport capacity is being supplied by other European countries so that the mission can be undertaken with the necessary degree of safety and protection for our troops?  When will that matter come before the House for discussion with a view to fulfilling the requirements before this country supplies troops to any other country such as Chad?</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first matter raised by the Deputy, there are nine Bills in committees and we are committed to publishing 17 Bills this session.  Admittedly, at the moment a number of those Bills are caught up in committee so it will take a week or so before there is further legislation.  A number of Bills are coming through, however.  There is no intention that the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill applies to the current tribunals.  They have all recently indicated their completion timescales to the Government.  The Tribunals of Inquiry Bill, which is based on what the Law Reform Commission stated and outlined, will be for future tribunals.  It is not likely that the Bill will be completed until next summer anyway so it will not affect the other issues.</P>

	<P>The force commander, Lieutenant-General Nash, is not yet satisfied because at least two, or maybe more, logistical issues have to be resolved.  The Government is obviously giving its approval but subject to when the force commander is satisfied.  It is a great honour that he is an Irish man, but that is neither here nor there in this instance.  It is his call and at the moment there are a few remaining logistical issues.  It is a difficult mission because Chad is an enormous country, bigger than the United Kingdom, Spain, France and Germany put together.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs was there last week and I am sure he will be talking to the House about it when dealing with parliamentary questions.  We must consider the plight of tens of thousands of people who are stuck in appalling circumstances and are literally begging for assistance from the international community.  However, we cannot make that decision until the force commander is satisfied.  Hopefully that can happen soon for everyone concerned because people are dying every day in tragic circumstances in 45 degrees of heat.

I raised this matter when the Bill reappeared on the Order Paper some weeks ago and inquired of the Taoiseach if the Bill was <Col N="1612"/>the same one introduced in 2005.

        <P Just="Left">Last week the Taoiseach stated the electoral boundaries would be amended in advance of the <Col N="1614"/>2009 local elections.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent electoral commission, which will become a standing constituency commission, with a raft of different functions and responsibilities.  Will legislation be presented to establish the commission?  Will it be in place, with responsibility for addressing the constituency boundaries, in advance of the local elections?</P>
        <P>The programme for Government clearly states a Green Paper on local government reform will be published within six months of the Government taking up office.  Given that that date is fast approaching, will the Green Paper be presented to the House before Christmas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should table a parliamentary question to the line Minister regarding the Green Paper.  The electoral Bill will be taken next year.  The entire reform of the local government system in line with the programme for Government would only delay the revision of constituencies.  Last week Members stated this should not be delayed unduly.  I have stated it could take a number of months, possibly five or six, before the review is carried out and completed.  There will be a review of the local electoral boundaries and an electoral Bill will be published next year.  However, a Bill addressing all the powers and functions in line with the programme for Government would not be passed in time.  Hopefully, the constituency review will be ready by May next year.</P>

	<P>In an attempt to be in order regarding the issue raised by Deputy Flanagan, the <i>Irish Examiner</i> published a hard hitting special investigation on drug use in Ireland today.  When the national drugs strategy was launched in the  Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department, it was accompanied by a promise by the Government that a review of the strategy would take place on an annual basis, which would be debated in the D&aacute;il.  When will this year&rsquo;s debate take place, given that it is needed?  In the context of a number of credible and not so credible reports on drug use in Ireland recently, when will that happen?  Has the Taoiseach a comment on RTE&rsquo;s accusations that it knows the identity of a Minister in his Government who uses cocaine on a regular basis?</P>

	<P>There has been much brouhaha about a series of programmes on the issues of drug abuse and drugs misuse and I would not give much credence to it nor would I <Col N="1615"/>give much credence to the book on which they were based.  However, today&rsquo;s<i> Irish Examiner</i> contains an insightful, comprehensive and thoughtful analysis of the drugs problem in Ireland.  Having regard to the legislative schedule, which is virtually non-existent, if the Whips sought a debate on Irish soccer, they would be likely to get it next week.  Will the Taoiseach make provision for a debate on the extent and scale of the drugs problem?  Has he any remarks to make on a very comprehensive investigation by the <i>Irish Examiner</i>?</P>

	<P>I welcome the interconnector between this State and Northern Ireland and what it could do for the country.  Could the Taoiseach provide time to discuss this?  A total of 3,000 people attended a meeting in Trim, County Meath, last night, the home town of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, at which politicians were not allowed to speak because the people believe this House is irrelevant.  It is important we debate this issue so that we know exactly what is the Government&rsquo;s strategy and whether we can support it or forget about it.</P>

	<P>Last July, Sir, the Government agreed to establish an internal HSE inquiry, the McElwee inquiry, into the actions of an academic who was convicted of attempted indecent assault in Amsterdam in 2002.  We were promised at the time that a report on the inquiry would be published in full as soon as possible.  Why has the inquiry not concluded?  The reason I ask is there was an expectation that all parties would fully co-operate with the inquiry when it was established on a completely voluntary basis.  The House has a right to know if people are not co-operating because a more formal statutory inquiry might then be expected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

When will that legislation be published?

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I oppose the taking of Second Stage at this time.  The reason the Labour Party does not consider it appropriate to take the Bill at this time has been well dealt with on previous occasions.  It is not that we take issue with the substantive Bill.  There is a need to update <Col N="1618"/>and modernise the law on public inquiries.  We are in favour of doing that, but we believe it is inappropriate to introduce this Bill at this time when the Taoiseach is due to make an appearance again before one of the tribunals.</P>
        <P>It is plainly wrong for the Taoiseach to say, as he did in response to Deputy Gilmore, that this Bill has no application to existing tribunals because it does.  Section 10 of the Bill before the House provides for the dissolution of tribunals.  Section 42, providing for transitional phases, makes that section relevant to existing tribunals.  Therefore, there is no question but that this Bill applies to existing tribunals.  As I understand it, both the Moriarty and Morris tribunals are in their concluding stages.  Therefore the only target of this Bill would be the Mahon tribunal.  It seems it is exceptionally ham-fisted, assuming there is no ulterior motive, that the Government would seek to bring forward this Bill at a time when the timeframe for the remaining duration of the Mahon tribunal has been clearly set out and when the highest officeholder in the land is awaiting a further summons to appear before the tribunal.</P>
        <P>It is not appropriate in our submission that the Bill be taken at this time.  We will signal broad support for the principles of the Bill when it comes before the House at a more appropriate time.</P>
        <P>If the Minister was to agree to the excision of the provisions that make the Bill applicable to current tribunals, we would have no difficulty facilitating its passage.  If the Minister contends, as he did all weekend, that it does not have application to current tribunals, why is he persisting with this Bill, section 42 of which makes it applicable to existing tribunals?  If the Minister is agreeable to excising the reference to existing tribunals, we will facilitate passage of the Bill.  Otherwise, it is our submission that it is not appropriate to take it at this time.  That is not to make any comment one way or the other on matters that have brought the Taoiseach before the tribunal or any evidence that he might give.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make a similar point in support of not taking this legislation today in view of its timing.  It has been said in recent days by a succession of Ministers when asked about the timing of it that this Bill made no reference  to and had no import on tribunals currently in existence.  I draw the attention of the House to an amendment in the name of each member of the Fine Gael Party that would have the effect of ensuring that this legislation did not have effect until such time as the tribunals currently in existence and with work under deliberation would have that work programme completed and dealt with and would have reported to this House.</P>
        <P>It seems that there is something sinister afoot and that this legislation is being brought forward between now and Christmas with a view towards <Col N="1619"/>ensuring that this House reflects a big stick approach against those engaged in the tribunal.  These tribunals were set up by orders of this House, as voted upon.  They were given certain terms of reference and told to set about doing the work that perhaps in other circumstances would have been done by this House.  This House chose not to do that work.  It chose to vest certain powers in tribunals and now legislation is being introduced that will allow the Government a draconian power, in the form of a sanction by resolution of this House, and given that our parliamentary democracy is such that the Government will have a majority, that the Government, a Minister or the Taoiseach, at the stroke of a pen, can not only suspend but dissolve in its entirety a tribunal of inquiry set up by this House.  We believe this is fundamentally unjust and unfair.  We ask that this legislation not be taken until such time as the Mahon tribunal in particular has concluded its business and reported to this House, which is what we asked it to do.</P>

Deputy Charles Flanagan neglected to do that, although the legislation reflects recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission, not recommendations dreamt up by a Government or political interest to pursue any particular end.</P>
        <P>Regarding the application of the legislation to tribunals, I have made it clear, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that it is not my intention to apply this legislation to the tribunals within the envisaged timeframes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte indicated that it was inopportune to consider the legislation at this time.  Of course, it was inopportune in the period leading up to the general election at the end of the last D&aacute;il and it is now inopportune at the beginning of a new D&aacute;il.  There is no time, apparently, when this legislation can be considered.  However, there is no intention to rush it.  What is required is a considered debate on Second Stage.  There is certainly no intention to rush the legislation before Christmas, or before next summer.  However, it is legislation which is required and which has been recommended on foot of the report of the Law Reform Commission.  The public would expect us to ensure any future tribunals established by the House would proceed in an expeditious, cost effective and efficient manner.  As I understand it, that is the purpose of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recommendations.  On that basis, I see no reason the Opposition has to take issue with the presentation of the Bill to the House on Second Stage. </P>
        <P>As regards the matter raised by Deputy Rabbitte, the power of dissolution of a tribunal, it is certainly not my intention to bring any proposals before the Government to dissolve the tribunals.  However, the public could ask us the question as to what would happen were a tribunal to trespass beyond its brief and continue endlessly.  The question might arise, but as I said, it does not because the tribunals have indicated timeframes for their completion.  If Deputy Rabbitte wishes to explore the issue further on Committee Stage as to whether the power of dissolution would apply to tribunals already established, I am open to considering an amendment in that regard.  The purpose of this legislation, however, is not in any way to interfere with the current tribunals.  Its purpose is to reassure the public that were the Oireachtas to resolve to establish tribunals in the future, they would perform under a modern code of legislation which regulated their operations.</P>

    <Title>Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005: Second Stage.  </Title>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am bemused by the amendment tabled in the name of Deputy Charles Flanagan.  It proposes that we delay consideration of this significant reform of the way in which we conduct tribunals until after the completion of the current tribunals which, as I made clear several times over the weekend, will not be affected by this Bill.  The Law Reform Commission has issued a report on tribunals and made recommendations to the House that would lead to more efficient and effective management of tribunals.  The Bill before the House relies heavily on the commission&rsquo;s report.  The Government believes it is important that future tribunals should be more efficient and cost effective.  That view is shared by the vast majority of taxpayers who have expressed frustration at the mounting cost of tribunals time and again, yet the main Opposition party has tabled a motion seeking to delay the passage of this responsible Bill.  This does not make sense.  It is, therefore, not surprising that Fine Gael has been languishing on the Opposition benches for the past ten years.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kenny accused the Government of trying to intimidate the current tribunals by bringing forward this legislation now.  It is my job to ensure tribunals are efficient and cost effective.  It is my duty to the taxpayer.  That is why the legislation is before the House today.  If it cannot be considered at the end of a D&aacute;il session, surely it can be considered at the commencement of another.</P>
        <P>Let me outline the details of this important legislation.  The main legislative vehicle for the public investigation of matters of urgent public importance is the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921, as amended by a sequence of legislative measures enacted between 1979 and 2004.  It may be useful to recall the seven amendments to the original Act that were found necessary in this period.  Usually, the need for the amendment became apparent in the course of the work of the relevant tribunal.  In this regard, consider the following examples.</P>
        <P>The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1979 remedied certain defects that had emerged in the course of establishing the inquiry into the Whiddy Island disaster.  That Act created a number of offences for non-co-operation with a tribunal.  It provided a statutory basis for the establishment of multi-member tribunals.  It also provided for the summoning of witnesses, compelling the production of documents, the issuing of a commission to examine witnesses abroad and, importantly, allowed a tribunal, where there were sufficient reasons rendering it equitable to do so, to make orders for the payment of the costs of a person represented before it.</P><Col N="1624"/>
        <P>The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1997 was a direct response to the McCracken tribunal and included a power for the tribunal to direct that its own costs could be paid by a person who had caused those costs to be incurred through his or her non-co-operation.  The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Acts, Nos. (1) and (2), of 1998 allowed for the changing of a tribunal&rsquo;s terms of reference at the request of the tribunal or following consultation between the tribunal and the Attorney General on behalf of a Minister.</P>
        <P>The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 2002 included provision to enable additional members to be appointed to a tribunal, as was necessary in the case of the Flood tribunal.  The Tribunals of  Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 2004 was necessary to ensure Mr. Justice Mahon, as the new chairperson of the tribunal to inquire into certain planning matters and payments, previously chaired by Mr. Justice Flood, could make orders regarding applications for costs incurred during the tenure of the preceding chairman.</P>
        <P>The extensive powers of tribunals set up under the tribunals of inquiry legislation have facilitated the tribunals in establishing the facts in respect of certain matters of serious public concern.  A tribunal of inquiry has a wide range of powers which, as I have outlined, have been strengthened in successive items of legislation to secure the co-operation of persons with their inquiries and there are significant sanctions for persons who fail or refuse to comply with a direction of a tribunal.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission carried out a comprehensive examination of tribunal legislation.  In May 2005, it published its report on public inquiries, including tribunals of inquiry.  The report provides a well-reasoned and well-informed basis for recommendations for reform.  There are over 50 recommendations which are designed to ensure the efficient and effective management of tribunals and cover areas ranging from the establishment of tribunals, the setting of terms of reference for tribunals, membership of tribunals, procedures at tribunals, preparation and publication of reports of tribunals and, of course, an issue of major concern to the Government, namely, the costs, particularly the legal costs of tribunals.  The Bill before the House has significant regard to that report.  I pay tribute to the commission on its report, which has informed the Bill before the House.</P>
        <P>I am happy to say the Bill, by providing a modern comprehensive statutory framework governing all aspects of a tribunal from the time of its establishment to publication of its final report, is also very consistent with the process of reform to which the Government committed itself in the 2004 White Paper, Regulating Better.  The Bill is also consistent with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to: &ldquo;imple<Col N="1625"/>ment comprehensive reform of the legislation governing Tribunals of Inquiry so that all future Tribunals will operate in accordance with modern and efficient management practices, with focused terms of reference, and in a manner which ensures that the costs and duration of Tribunals are known and controlled.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The issue of legal costs associated with the operation of tribunals of inquiry, especially third party legal costs, has been to the forefront of public and political consideration.  There is justified concern at the mounting legal costs of some current tribunals.  Indeed, I recall some Members opposite expressing such concern.  The need to control such costs is evidenced by the fact that, to the end of October 2007, the total cost to the Exchequer of completed and sitting tribunals of inquiry and other public inquiries was some &euro;316.6 million.  Of this, &euro;228 million was in respect of legal costs and &euro;88 million related to other costs.  The figure for legal costs includes &euro;110 million in respect of the third party legal costs awarded to date.</P>
        <P>In respect of tribunals of inquiry and public inquiries which are yet to be completed or for which claims for costs still remain to be settled, the total cost to the end of October 2007 is &euro;211 million, of which &euro;137 million is in respect of legal costs, of which &euro;42 million relates to third party legal costs.  These third party legal costs are expected to rise sharply as eligibility for such costs is generally determined only towards the end of tribunal hearings.</P>
        <P>We are all very much aware that the constitutional entitlement to legal representation for those whose good name or personal and property rights are at issue, combined with the necessity for a tribunal to be independent in its operations, means that it can be difficult to control costs once an inquiry is established.</P>
        <P>The provisions in the Bill will not prevent legal representatives from charging whatever level of fees they wish to or can agree with their clients.  It will, however, give a clear indication of the likely maximum level of fees for which the State will be liable.  The payment of any amounts of legal fees over and above the levels set down by the relevant fees regulation will be a matter for the legal representative and client to resolve between themselves.</P>
        <P>I propose to outline the provisions of the Bill.  I should say that many of the provisions restate, with minimal or no amendment, certain existing provisions of the current legislation concerning the operation of tribunals.  Part 1 of the Bill contains standard provisions dealing with preliminary matters such as the short title, commencement and interpretation.</P>
        <P>Part 2 contains many new provisions dealing with the establishment, terms of reference, suspension and dissolution of tribunals.  Section 3 provides that the Government may, by order approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, <Col N="1626"/>establish a tribunal to inquire into any matter of urgent and significant public importance.  The order must specify the matter considered by the Government to be a matter of urgent and significant public importance, the terms of reference of the tribunal and the Minister who is to have responsibility for the tribunal.</P>
        <P>Clarity is provided at section 4 of the Bill as to the inquisitorial nature of a tribunal and its independence &mdash; aspects of a tribunal which are often misunderstood.  It is important for tribunals to be able to function properly and to be resourced for this purpose.</P>
        <P>Section 5 enables the responsible Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to provide the tribunal with the administrative support, including counsel and solicitors, and resources considered necessary.  With a view to ensuring efficiency and value for money, the administrative support may consist of public servants by way of secondment or persons engaged from the private sector by the responsible Minister or the tribunal, if necessary by way of a competitive tendering process.</P>
        <P>It is important that the terms of reference for a tribunal should be drafted as precisely as is practicable and that they can be amended as required following approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Sections 6 and 7 of the Bill deal with this aspect and update the current provisions in the 1921 Act.</P>
        <P>Section 8 is a new provision which requires a tribunal within 30 days of, and not later than 60 days after, its establishment, in consultation with the responsible Minister, to prepare a statement containing an estimate of all the costs, including third party legal costs, likely to be incurred by the tribunal in performing its functions and an estimate of the timeframe for the submission of the final report.  This statement must be amended where it becomes apparent that the estimate is no longer appropriate.  The statement, or amended statement, must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to bring forward a technical amendment to section 8 on Committee Stage.  As currently drafted, the section could be interpreted as requiring a tribunal to include in the statement only such third party legal costs as may be incurred by the tribunal itself rather than such costs incurred by, for example, witnesses who have been granted legal representation before the inquiry.  The intention of requiring a tribunal to prepare a statement of estimated costs is to provide the State with a realistic estimate of the cost to the Exchequer of the inquiry.  The proposed amendment will copper-fasten this intention by clarifying that the statement must contain an estimate of all third party legal costs likely to be incurred in consequence of the inquiry and not just third party legal costs which may be incurred by the tribunal itself.</P><Col N="1627"/>
        <P>A tribunal of inquiry can only be established by the Oireachtas.  However, there is no statutory basis whereby the Oireachtas, should it so wish, can suspend or dissolve a tribunal.  Thus, having received the advice of the then Attorney General on this matter and in line with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, the Bill provides, in sections 9 and 10, that the Government may, for stated reasons and on foot of an order approved by each House of the Oireachtas, suspend an inquiry in whole or in part to allow for the completion of any other inquiry or the determination of any civil or criminal proceedings relating to matters to which the inquiry relates or dissolve a tribunal.</P>
        <P>Before the Government makes an order under either of these sections, the responsible Minister must consult with the tribunal.  I also intend to bring forward on Committee Stage, a technical amendment to section 10 which will ensure the chairperson will not be required, on dissolution of a tribunal, to deposit material which would prevent the tribunal from performing its functions in respect of preparation of its report or in respect of the making of an order for costs.</P>
        <P>Section 11 is a new provision which provides that an inquiry comes to an end when a tribunal, following submission of its final report to the responsible Minister, notifies the Minister that it has fulfilled its terms of reference.  Again, I intend to bring forward on Committee Stage a technical amendment to section 11 which will provide that the suspension or dissolution of an inquiry will not of itself cause any civil or criminal proceedings pending or in progress in respect of that tribunal to be discontinued or otherwise to fall.</P>
        <P>Part 3 of the Bill deals with issues of civil and criminal liability.  Being inquisitorial in nature, a tribunal cannot determine any person&rsquo;s civil or criminal liability.  Section 12 acknowledges this fact but in order to ensure that a tribunal can fulfil its terms of reference, provides that a tribunal is not to be inhibited in the performance of any function by any likelihood of liability being inferred from such performance.  Section 13 restates existing legislative provisions governing the non-admissibility in criminal proceedings of evidence given to a tribunal.</P>
        <P>Part 4 of the Bill modernises existing legislative provisions dealing with membership of tribunals and the appointment of experts and researchers.  Section 16 is new and provides that the responsible Minister may, by notice approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, terminate the appointment of a member or reserve member of a tribunal for specified reasons.  Before terminating an appointment of a member, the responsible Minister must inform the member of his or her intention, take into account any representations and consult with other members of the tribunal if requested by the member concerned and with the chairperson.  As with the provisions relating to <Col N="1628"/>the suspension or dissolution of a tribunal and in line with recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, termination of the appointment of a member or reserve member of a tribunal requires approval of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Section 17 is also new and provides for the appointment, subject to ministerial approval, and termination of appointment of experts by a tribunal.  Experts will not be members of the tribunal concerned and must not disclose information, documents or material obtained in the performance of their functions except where required by the tribunal, with the consent of the tribunal or on foot of a court order.</P>
        <P>Part 5 of the Bill contains many new provisions dealing with the proceedings of tribunals.  Section 18 requires a tribunal to carry out its functions as efficiently, effectively and expeditiously as practicable having regard to its terms of reference.  A tribunal is precluded from inquiring into a relevant matter unless it is satisfied that the cost and duration of that inquiry are likely to be justified by the importance of the facts that are likely to be established in consequence of the inquiry.</P>
        <P>Under section 19, a tribunal must establish rules and procedures, which must be given to all persons likely to be affected by them, relating to receiving evidence and submissions.  Section 20 allows uncontested evidence, which is essentially evidence in a written form and circulated to those persons who have a right to receive it, to be simply taken as if it had been read into the record.  A party who insists on such evidence being taken orally, notwithstanding the opinion of the tribunal that it should not be so taken, may be liable for any additional costs incurred as a result of the evidence in question being taken orally.</P>
        <P>By their very nature, tribunals of inquiry are held in public.  However, there may be instances where, in the opinion of the tribunal, it is in the public interest not to do so or where there is a risk of prejudice to criminal or civil proceedings that are pending or in progress.  In line with a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission, section 24 builds on existing legislative provisions in section 2(<i>a</i>) of the 1921 Act which prohibits a tribunal from refusing to allow the public to be present at any of the public proceedings of the tribunal except in cases such as those I have outlined.</P>
        <P>Part 6 of the Bill deals with representation before tribunals and is a matter which has given rise to much publicity in the context of the cost to the Exchequer of such representation.  Section 25 empowers a tribunal to grant, or refuse, an application for legal representation.  The person seeking representation must state the reasons why he or she considers that representation should be granted, the number of representatives required and whether junior counsel, senior counsel, solicitors or otherwise, and to the extent practicable, the particular proceedings, or the particular parts, modules or other divisions of <Col N="1629"/>proceedings before the tribunal for which representation is required.  A tribunal can only grant representation where it is satisfied the person&rsquo;s constitutional or legal rights are likely to be affected by the proceedings before the tribunal, or where there are exceptional circumstances for granting representation.  The tribunal must provide written reasons where it refuses an application for representation.</P>
        <P>Section 26 is new and empowers the tribunal, where it is authorising representation under section 25, to specify the maximum number of representatives which it considers may need to be retained by the person.  The tribunal can specify, to the extent practicable, the particular proceedings, parts, modules or other divisions of proceedings for which the tribunal considers that representation should be granted.  In the case of two or more persons, it can specify whether they should be represented on a joint basis in proceedings before the tribunal.  The tribunal can specify whether counsel for the inquiry could represent the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The person concerned is not obliged to follow the determination of the tribunal in this regard but, where he or she does not do so, the tribunal is prohibited from allowing costs over and above those which would have arisen had the person complied with the original determination.  Deputies will appreciate that this is a significant new provision which will assist the chairperson of a tribunal in determining the total amount of costs likely to be incurred by the tribunal for the purposes of the statement of estimated costs required under section 8 of the Bill.  Section 26 will also provide an indication to the person applying for representation as to the amount of costs which may be reimbursed if he or she co-operates with the tribunal.</P>
        <P>Part 7 of the Bill deals with the powers of a tribunal and enforcement matters.  Section 30, in line with a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission, provides for judicial review in respect of a challenge to a decision or determination of a tribunal.  Section 31 enables a tribunal to apply to the High Court for directions on the performance of its functions.</P>
        <P>Part 8 of the Bill, containing sections 32, 33, 34 and 35, provides a framework for the preparation of the report of a tribunal, an interim report at the request of the responsible Minister or of the tribunal&rsquo;s own volition, publication of the report or interim report and the admissibility of the report or interim report in civil proceedings.  This part of the Bill has been drafted along the lines recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage to clarify the timeframe within which a tribunal must prepare its report upon dissolution.</P>
        <P>Part 9 of the Bill deals with costs and I propose to outline the provisions of this part in some detail.  Section 36 modernises the arrangements currently contained in section 6 of the Tribunals <Col N="1630"/>of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1979 dealing with costs and provides that an application for costs by any person who has incurred costs as a result of co-operating with a tribunal may be made, at the discretion of the chairperson, on the conclusion of particular proceedings, or on the conclusion of particular parts, modules or other divisions of proceedings, or on the conclusion of all proceedings, before the tribunal.  It is a matter for the chairperson to determine if costs are to be paid and at what point.</P>
        <P>In determining whether to award costs to a person, the chairperson must have reference to the following criteria: the nature and extent of co-operation given to the tribunal, including whether false or misleading information was knowingly or recklessly given to the tribunal; the findings of the tribunal; the appointment or other retention of persons with professional expertise which was unnecessary or excessive; the extent to which any costs incurred by a relevant person would have been incurred whether or not the relevant person had any dealings with the tribunal, including any case where the relevant person&rsquo;s co-operation with the tribunal was given in whole or in part through an employee of the relevant person; the extent to which any costs incurred by the relevant person were disproportionate in respect of the nature and extent of co-operation required by the tribunal of the relevant person and all other relevant matters falling within the terms of the resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas or within the terms of the order establishing the tribunal.</P>
        <P>Section 20 contains a provision which requires a tribunal to refuse, unless exceptional circumstances exist, to grant the additional costs incurred as a result of taking evidence orally where it has ruled that such evidence should not be given orally.  Section 26 contains a similar provision which provides that the tribunal shall not, unless exceptional circumstances exist, allow costs over and above those which would have arisen had the person complied with the tribunal&rsquo;s original determination as to the level of representation required.</P>
        <P>The chairperson may award costs against a person for the benefit of the Exchequer, either of his or her own motion or upon application by the responsible Minister or the Minister for Finance, where that person added to the duration of the hearings by knowingly or recklessly providing false or misleading information to the tribunal or otherwise failing to provide appropriate co-operation when it was in that person&rsquo;s power to do so.  If the chairperson refuses an application for costs, he or she must give reasons for the refusal.</P>
        <P>In all of the considerations in section 36, it should be noted that the award of costs is also subject to maximum amounts to be set out under the provisions of sections 38 and 39.  I intend to bring forward technical amendments to section 36 on Committee Stage to make it clear that costs <Col N="1631"/>to be reimbursed by the State in the context of tribunals of inquiry will be costs that were necessarily incurred for the purposes of assisting the tribunal in its inquiry.  For example, in the past, costs have been awarded for the engagement of public relations consultants by persons appearing before a tribunal.  Such costs, which can fall to the State, must be circumscribed.  Therefore, an amendment on Committee Stage will clarify that one of the factors which the chairperson must have reference to will be the appointment or other retention of persons with professional expertise that was unnecessary or excessive for the purposes of assisting the tribunal with its inquiry.</P>
        <P>Other planned amendments to section 36 will introduce time limits for the submission of claims for costs and the possibility to request a tribunal to reconsider its order for costs in any given case.  Section 37 repeats the provisions of section 6(1A) of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1979, as amended by the 2004 Act, which empowers the chairperson of a tribunal to make an order for costs in respect of any costs incurred, but which had not been determined, before his or her appointment.  The chairperson must have regard to, <i>inter alia</i>, any final or interim report of the tribunal relating to its proceedings in the period before his or her appointment.</P>
        <P>Section 38 is a new provision which provides that an award of costs under section 36 must not exceed the relevant maximum amounts applicable to various categories of costs specified in regulations under section 39.  This section will provide a statutory basis for schedules of costs payable by the State on foot of tribunals of inquiry.  The provision at section 38 will apply to any tribunal to which regulations under section 39 are expressed to apply, and to all future tribunals, and all costs incurred under those tribunals which fall into any of the categories of costs specified in those regulations.  The Taxing Master of the High Court will not be permitted to allow any costs in excess of the maximum amounts specified in the regulations under section 39.  Section 39 includes a provision, suggested by the Taxing Master, for a Taxing Master of the High Court, where practicable, to assist a tribunal in making an order for costs or assessing and measuring any costs to which such an order relates.</P>
        <P>Section 39 is new and provides a regulation-making power for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and having regard to what would be reasonable remuneration for services, including legal services, provided in or in respect of inquisitorial proceedings, to determine the maximum amounts of various categories of costs which may be paid, pursuant to section 36, to counsel or solicitors engaged by parties <Col N="1632"/>appearing before the tribunal or to the tribunal&rsquo;s counsel or solicitors.  The regulations may specify different categories of costs; require the chairperson to provide reasons for granting or refusing costs; set the maximum amounts which may be paid by reference to, for example, a yearly, daily, hourly or other rate; and be expressed to apply to a particular tribunal, to particular proceedings or modules of proceedings or to specified costs or categories of costs.</P>
        <P>Part 10 of the Bill contains section 40, which modernises existing offences and the penalties attaching thereto.</P>
        <P>Part 11 contains sections 41 to 44, inclusive, which are technical provisions dealing with expenses, repeals and transitional matters, restriction of section 4 of the Data Protection Act and consequential amendments to other enactments respectively.</P>
        <P>The Bill represents a comprehensive reform of the tribunal legislation consistent with the need for reasonable updating and modernisation.  In summary, it contains the following significant features: the process for setting and amending terms of reference of a tribunal is clarified; within three months of its establishment, a tribunal will be required to produce a statement of estimated costs and duration of the tribunal which must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; this statement must be subsequently amended after significant developments; the Government, for stated reasons and following a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, will be able to suspend or dissolve a tribunal; provisions governing the taking of evidence, including a provision regarding the &ldquo;reading-in&rdquo; of evidence already available in written form and not disputed; the position with regard to the granting of legal representation before a tribunal is clarified to the effect that a relevant person must apply for representation and the tribunal will only grant the application where the person&rsquo;s legal or constitutional rights are likely to be significantly affected by the proceedings; the tribunal will state its opinion as to the numbers of the representation to be retained by a person that it will certify as being recoverable from the State; the responsible Minister will be able to request an interim report on the general progress of an inquiry, or of a particular aspect of an inquiry, from the tribunal; tribunal reports will be admissible in civil cases &mdash; the findings of facts in a report or the opinions expressed therein are <i>prima facie</i> evidence unless the contrary is shown; the position with regard to award of costs by a tribunal is clarified and co-operation with the tribunal remains the key determinant for an award of costs; and regulations, to be made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, will set out maximum amounts of legal costs recoverable.</P>
        <P>I am confident the Bill will contribute positively to the future effective operation of public <Col N="1633"/>inquiries.  I am willing to consider any amendments that might strengthen it.  By putting in place a comprehensive statutory framework governing all aspects of a tribunal, from the time of its establishment to the publication of its final report, along the lines of this Bill, the interests of justice and public accountability will be advanced.</P>
        <P>In commending the Bill to the House, I ask the Opposition, even at this late stage, to withdraw the amendment it intends to move so that, united in the House, we can proceed to make changes that are clearly in the public interest.  I reiterate what I made clear in the brief debate that took place before Second Stage was formally moved, namely, that there is no intention to apply this legislation to the current tribunals, which have indicated the timeframes they envisage for their completion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann having regard to the fact that existing Tribunals of Inquiry established by the Oireachtas have not completed the entirety of their work, declines the second reading of the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Bill and the circumstances that surround its origin and timing tell us everything we need to know about the Government.  It suggests an abundance of arrogance and a fair measure of deviousness, together with a disdain for democratic norms.  These all result from its having been in power for far too long.</P>
        <P>The justification used by the Government for its efforts to empower itself to shut down tribunals is to wring its hands and refer, as the Minister did, to a huge level of costs and an inordinate waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  We have been treated to the appearance of bizarre amounts of euro in media reports on an almost daily basis and the implication is that it is the tribunals, rather than a depressed housing market and an inept and helpless Government, that are responsible for the economic downturn.  The Government&rsquo;s newfound interest in saving taxpayers&rsquo; money is fascinating, not to mention seriously overdue.</P>
        <P>I wonder why we only hear of the Government&rsquo;s desire for financial prudence in respect of the health service and cutbacks relating thereto or the tribunals.  I do not recall any desire for financial prudence being expressed in recent weeks in the context of ministerial salaries, which now outstrip those of the majority of world leaders, or when, a few years ago, the Government felt like buying a second ministerial jet at a cost of &euro;50 million.  There was no question of value for money for the taxpayer when the Government agreed to provide indemnity for religious orders at a total cost of &euro;1.1 billion, when over &euro;200 million was spent on PPARS or when the site for a <Col N="1634"/>new super-prison was bought for &euro;30 million, twice the market value.  The Government is happy to hand over &euro;700,000 of Exchequer funds every year to pay for the storage of useless electronic voting machines that cost taxpayers over &euro;50 million to purchase in the first instance.  Each year, the Department of the Taoiseach spends just short of the average industrial wage to pay for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s make-up needs.  Well over &euro;1 million is spent each year on the services of special advisers who provide him with advice of a purely political nature that is given over and above that proffered by civil servants in his Department.</P>
        <P>There is plenty of scope for belt-tightening in all of these areas.  However, there is no evidence of a desire at Government level to engage in this.  To date, the Government&rsquo;s efforts to save a few euro have centred on our beleaguered hospitals and on the tribunals at Dublin Castle.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael recognises that the costs of tribunals must be addressed.  This issue has been pursued in the House for some time.  We are, however, concerned that the Government is using the costs issue as a smokescreen to disguise the fact that it wishes to suspend or shut down the Mahon tribunal before anything else unsavoury about the peculiar finances of Fianna F&aacute;il and its leader enters the public domain.</P>
        <P>Hard-pressed taxpayers also want to see their money spent in an appropriate manner.  They do not want to pay for tribunals of indefinite duration.  However, that is not to say they want the Taoiseach to be able to cast a shadow over judges and barristers who are legitimately investigating his personal finances, that they want newspaper editors jailed for printing information that is in the public interest or that they want normal democratic behaviour subverted to suit the needs of the Taoiseach and his Government.  The constant drip-feed of information and speculation regarding the cost of tribunals is a rather subtle ploy by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government and its associates to obfuscate the real issue at hand, namely, their belief that a particular tribunal is not dealing with a matter in a way that pleases them.</P>
        <P>In the short debate that preceded Second Stage, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made a telling admission when he stated that any tribunals already under way would not be subjected to a suspension order.  He indicated that tribunals would not be suspended if there was a belief that they were going beyond their brief.  I may have misquoted him but that is what I understood the Minister to have said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to their going beyond their envisaged timescales.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I put it to the Minister that his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, is reported to have said <Col N="1635"/>on more than one occasion that it is his belief, and that of sources close to the Taoiseach, that the Mahon tribunal had outstripped its brief and had already gone beyond what was envisaged when it was originally established. </P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dea was referring to the views of the Supreme Court.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>He stated it was his opinion the tribunal had gone beyond its brief, which is precisely what the Minister stated would be the type of instance the Government might consider with regard to exercising an order of suspension or an order of dissolution.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Last year, Judge Mahon felt compelled to write to Members of this House to contradict the assertion by one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s most staunch apologists, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. McDowell, that the Mahon tribunal would cost &euro;1 billion.  The judge asserted the final figure would be closer to one third of this, at &euro;300 million.  This was a vintage Fianna F&aacute;il approach which no doubt political scientists will be deconstructing for some time to come.</P>
        <P>I remind the House that it was successive Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers for Finance who set the fees being paid at tribunals.  Fine Gael supports the efforts of the Minister for Finance to achieve agreement on fees in advance of further tribunals.  However, I do not believe this is the major issue involved.</P>
        <P>Another issue repeatedly raised by those who would like to see the tribunals closed down is the length of time they take.  There are two reasons that the tribunals have taken a long time and neither has to do with costs or legal fees.  The first reason is that the sheer scale of corruption the tribunals had to investigate was by its nature time-consuming.  It had to be dealt with in a forensic way which may not have been envisaged when the tribunals were first established.  This factor, combined with on the one hand witnesses&rsquo; willingness to go to court at the drop of a hat to delay the tribunals and on the other hand their unwillingness to readily provide information to the tribunals, helped to significantly prolong the investigations.  These are the real reasons for lengthy sittings of the tribunal, and they have added much to the costs mentioned by the Minister in the course of his address.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach belongs in the category of those who failed to co-operate fully with the tribunals from the start.  I remind the House that on 14 September the Taoiseach accepted that he had not supplied the Mahon tribunal with comprehensive information it had requested concerning cash lodgements which the tribunal was investigating over a two and a half year period.  The tribunal was not told that some of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s financial transactions involved ster<Col N="1636"/>ling until more than two years after it began its inquiries.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the fact that both existing tribunals have almost completed their investigations, there is a strong and sound argument in favour of allowing them to complete their work programmes in accordance with their terms of reference.  Why not wait until they have finished completely before introducing this legislation, unless its real purpose is to wave a big stick at the tribunal&rsquo;s legal team in the weeks prior to the Taoiseach once again taking the stand or to shut down the tribunal altogether?</P>
        <P>As the Minister stated, this Bill was removed from the D&aacute;il Order Paper two years ago on the understanding that it would be inappropriate to introduce it in the context of the pending appearance of the Taoiseach before the tribunal.  What has changed since then?  The circumstances of the Taoiseach seem to be the fulcrum on which everything turns with regard to this proposed legislation.</P>
        <P>For example, take the timing of this legislative venture.  The Bill first emerged when it became apparent that the Taoiseach was to make his debut in the witness box at Dublin Castle.  It was dropped from the Order Paper when the Government&rsquo;s bluff was called by the Opposition.  We are now approaching the hour when the Taoiseach will once again take the witness stand and attempt to explain what to most independent observers and analysts appears the inexplicable.  What an amazing coincidence that the Bill should reappear at this time.</P>
        <P>If further evidence is needed of how desperately the Government wants to discredit the Mahon tribunal we need only consider the outlandish comments made by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s legal team.  Earlier this year, counsel for the Taoiseach told the Mahon tribunal that it had created a serious risk of interfering with the democratic process when it circulated documents relating to Mr. Ahern prior to the general election.  He went on to state that the tribunal was being used in a malicious campaign against the Taoiseach.  This extraordinary attack led to Judge Mahon feeling the need to respond, describing the remarks as an opportunity to launch a wide-ranging and unprecedented attack on the tribunal.</P>
        <P>If evidence were needed that the aim of this Bill is to browbeat and to punish we only need to examine the briefing document which accompanied its recent second coming.  I have never seen its like on an official briefing document and I have been in this House a long time.  The document states:</P>
        <P LI="1">An issue that may require consideration is &mdash; in view of recent experience of the publication of confidential material in the possession of the tribunal, or required to be circulated by it to interested persons &mdash; how the draft Bill can or should be amended to seek to ensure the necessary level of confidentiality for persons who <Col N="1637"/>have complied with their legal obligation to provide information to a tribunal.  The Bill currently provides,<i> inter alia</i>, that a person is guilty of an offence if he or she &ldquo;obstructs or hinders the tribunal in the performance of its functions&rdquo;.  The sanction on summary conviction is &euro;3,000 and 12 months&rsquo; imprisonment and &euro;300,000 and five years&rsquo; imprisonment on conviction on indictment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I find it bizarre that a paragraph included in an official briefing document refers to an issue which may require consideration at some stage.  It is interesting to note the Minister did not refer to these issues in his contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no current plans.  I outlined a number of amendments which I will introduce on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>If there are no current plans why is it included in the official one-page briefing sheet that normally contains the kernel of the issues at stake and provides a summary for Members of the House of the main and principal issues involved?  We now find there are no plans.  It is an extraordinary expression in a Second Stage briefing note.  What is interesting about this issue is that we have had leaks from tribunals for many years and the Minister and his colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il scarcely batted an eyelid.  However, when a leak occurred which directly affected the Taoiseach and revealed less than flattering information about his personal finances we had an immediate response.  We now have an official response in that the matter will be dealt with by this Bill.  We do not know how or when, but we know it will not be tolerated by the Minister or his colleagues.</P>
        <P>Initially, the Government attempted to divert attention from the substantive issue at hand by accusing no less a body than the Fine Gael Party of smearing the Taoiseach.  Now, we have this heavy-handed, menacing approach to leaks as evidenced by the quotation from the briefing note.  In the meantime, those who comply with their legal obligations &mdash; it is clear that the Taoiseach sees himself in this category &mdash; are to be protected.</P>
        <P>Once again, we have evidence of the championing of personal interest above the public good.  It seems that when anything displeases the Taoiseach, his fellow Fianna F&aacute;il TDs and his colleagues in Government, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats, are willing to indulge his petulant vengeance.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s idea of justice is that where a newspaper editor happens to come into possession of tribunal evidence that may be damaging to a politician but is in the public interest, he or she could face up to five years&rsquo; imprisonment in addition to a &euro;300,000 fine.  Contrast this with the treatment of a former leader of Fianna F&aacute;il who brought the office of the Taoiseach into <Col N="1638"/>major disrepute by taking millions of euro and pounds from wealthy businessmen over a long period of time to fund a lavish lifestyle.  The Government deemed that this man merited a State funeral and a graveside eulogy by the country&rsquo;s leader.  Fianna F&aacute;il must inhabit a parallel universe if it thinks this approach is honourable or acceptable.  Fine Gael is concerned this Bill is an underhand mechanism to allow new sanctions to be brought against certain journalists who are currently before the tribunal for obtaining leaked papers concerning the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>I have suggested that the Second Stage reading of the Bill should be deferred until the Mahon tribunal has completed its work, which will be in the near future.  However, it is appropriate to ask whether this legislation is necessary if, as the Minister suggested earlier, we can debate it but there is no hurry and it might not need to be progressed.  If it is not to be used in the manner which I have already suggested, for what purpose will it be used?  I can imagine many of the Ministers who are now clamouring about the unacceptable costs of the Mahon tribunal while also claiming this Bill in no way hinders current tribunals will be happy to justify a motion to shut down the tribunal with the favoured Fianna F&aacute;il refrain, &ldquo;that was then and this is now&rdquo;.  The guillotine will thereby be used on the Mahon tribunal in the same way that it is used on many of the Bills presented to this House.</P>
        <P>The Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 addresses issues that have been highlighted by those who wish to see an end to tribunals in Ireland, namely costs, duration and tight terms of reference.  This legislation provides that when issues of significant public concern emerge which heretofore would have necessitated the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry, they can instead be dealt with by a commission of investigation.  That more straightforward and efficient approach was deemed appropriate by Members of this House several years ago.  Therefore, we are unlikely to see many, or any, new tribunals being established in the future.  Accordingly, one may conclude that, contrary to the assertions made by the Taoiseach last week, this Bill either intends to target existing tribunals or the Government lacks faith in its own legislative initiative.</P>
        <P>The Government is legally and constitutionally accountable to the Oireachtas, yet it has sought to evade parliamentary accountability for its action, or in most cases inaction, by establishing quangos left, right and centre.  If the Government wants to remove the need for future tribunals, why does it not take a lead from the Constitution, which states the Government shall be responsible to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann?  The Administrations of the past ten years have done more than any of their predecessors to undermine that constitutional provision.  However, even people sitting on the Government benches recognise that such undermining of the role of Parliament does little <Col N="1639"/>to strengthen democracy or respect the will of the people.  Therefore, in place of this proposed legislation, I would like to see a strengthened parliamentary role in investigating matters of urgent public importance.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by making two simple points.  The timing and tone of this Bill indicates that, far from being an attempt at reform, it is an attempt to intimidate and dictate in a manner that was never envisaged when the tribunals were first established by this House.  If the Government wishes to prove that its intentions are honourable, it can easily do so by agreeing to remove this Bill from the Order Paper until the existing tribunals complete their work.  It can then proceed with the backing of this House on an all-party agreed basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Flanagan spoke at some length about the growing public perception that the introduction of this Bill at this time is designed to empower the Government to shut down the planning tribunal.  I mention the planning tribunal because the other tribunals, Morris and Moriarty being the main among them, are in their concluding stages.  The target, therefore, is the planning tribunal.  That public perception is abroad because the timing is regarded as odd given that the Taoiseach, having ensnared himself in conflicting stories to the tribunal, is due to reappear at Dublin Castle in a matter of weeks.</P>
        <P>However, it is not a conclusion I have been inclined to share.  No Government in its right mind would seek to terminate the Mahon tribunal at this stage of its inquiries into the Quarryvale modules.  In addition, the decision was made for the Government in a recent High Court case, in that the court prevented inquiry into new modules that might be a source of embarrassment for current or former Government figures or other powerful interests in our society.  Inquiries have been shut off in controversial circumstances because of a failure to comply on the part of the tribunal itself.</P>
        <P>If my conclusion is correct, why did the Minister work so hard over the weekend to leave the impression that the Bill does not apply to existing tribunals?  Why was it thought necessary to convey such an impression when the opposite is the case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>You tried to convey the opposite impression.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I made no comment on the matter whatsoever.  I was elsewhere.</P>
        <P>Section 10 of the Bill permits the dissolution of a tribunal for stated reasons.  Section 42(3) states plainly this power of dissolution applies to existing tribunals.  If this Bill is being introduced now because the Government has no legislation ready, why seek to misrepresent its contents?  It is remarkable at present that if the Opposition <Col N="1640"/>asked for a debate on the state of Irish soccer, the request is likely to be granted if it fills a day.</P>
        <P>Were it not for obstruction and calculated delaying tactics the investigation into the Quarryvale development would have concluded at least three years ago.  The Moriarty and Morris tribunals are both concluding.  Why insert provisions into this Bill that would enable the Government to shut down the Mahon tribunal?  If for some good reason we have not yet heard it is important that the Bill contains such provisions, why deny them in public?  The Minister knows better than me that his claims that he does not intend to apply the Bill to existing tribunals carry no weight in law.  I do not question his intentions for one minute but, if there is one thing we know in politics, it is that situations change.  If, for example, the Government&rsquo;s lifespan suddenly depended on using a power in this Bill to stay in office, does the Minister, who has joined us in the House more recently than some of his colleagues, seriously believe that Fianna F&aacute;il would refrain from using it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to discuss the legislation for the lifespan of the Government. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If that is the case, the Government Chief Whip needs his head examined to determine the reason he permitted the legislation to be brought before the House three weeks before the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reappearance at Dublin Castle. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government ran out of issues on which to have statements. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Either the Government has the sinister motive others are ascribing to it or it is simply hamfisted and can no longer conduct the business of the House competently.  </P>
        <P>If the Minister wants to agree to excise the provisions which make the powers of dissolution applicable to existing tribunals, the Labour Party will support the broad principles of the Bill.  It is accepted by all sides that it is necessary to consolidate and update the law regarding public inquiries.  The House of Commons took this step two or three years ago.  After a generation of experience of tribunals, we have all the jurisprudence we need to update and modernise the law in this regard.</P>
        <P>I was surprised to discover in the Minister&rsquo;s speech the extent to which he relied on making an argument about controlling costs.  There is no doubt that since the Goodman tribunal in the early 1990s, Irish taxpayers have direct experience of the fact that tribunals under the 1921 Act are slow, cumbersome and very costly.  Given the decision of the High Court in the In re Haughey case, it does not appear that it could be otherwise.  The cost and duration of tribunals are, however, greatly exacerbated by the tactics, sometimes tan<Col N="1641"/>tamount to obstruction, engaged in by parties to the tribunals, in particular the planning tribunal.   In this regard, it was reasonable to expect the Taoiseach to show good example.  Instead, we learned that his protestations about being anxious to get into the tribunal to tell his story were in sharp contradiction of the truth.  While it is for the tribunal and not the House to decide whether the Taoiseach obstructed, he certainly engaged in obfuscation and delaying tactics and when eventually he presented at the tribunal he told not one story but several stories.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Fergus Flood, in his second interim report, makes a relevant point in this regard.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">All parties from whom the Tribunal legitimately sought information had an obligation to provide such information truthfully and expeditiously.  The provision of misleading information or the withholding of relevant information has the capacity to hinder and obstruct the Tribunal, and inevitably leads to delay.  The conduct of a statutory public inquiry is a complex and costly exercise, and this Tribunal has endeavoured to carry out its statutory functions with expedition and as economically as possible, so as to comply with the express wishes of the Oireachtas contained within its Terms of Reference.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">This Tribunal continues its work more than four and a half years after its inception, not only because of the multiplicity and complexity of matters which it is obliged to investigate under its Terms of Reference, but also because of the failure of persons who have been required to provide information to the Tribunal, either documentary or otherwise, to provide such information expeditiously or, in some instances, at all.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Here, he notes the obligation on citizens to co-operate with the tribunal in a reasonably expeditious manner.  It is not my job to find whether the Taoiseach, for example, obstructed the tribunal or to make any such allegation.  However, as the holder of the highest office in politics, one would have expected him to co-operate with the tribunal.  We find that, like a man outside the pub after closing time who takes off his jacket and calls on others to hold him back, the Taoiseach engaged in a form of shadow boxing.  He could not understand the reason he was not being given access to the tribunal to tell his story.  Eventually, when he appeared before the tribunal it emerged that the delay was his responsibility.  That fact tells its own story.</P>
        <P>Some of us will cast our minds back to the extraordinary circumstances in which the general election was called.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s furtive journey to the Phoenix Park in the early hours of a Sunday morning when nobody but the deer was up was, I believe, inspired more by his imminent <Col N="1642"/>appearance at Dublin Castle than by the requirement that the D&aacute;il be dissolved.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister on one issue, namely, that no ordinary taxpayer can be comfortable with the huge costs that will eventually come home to roost from the tribunals established in recent years.  Deputy Flanagan made a good point in enumerating the instances of extraordinary waste of public money over the past decade and the apparent lack of Government concern about the matters he spelled out.  The Government is now exceptionally concerned about the costs of tribunals.  If one examines the pattern on this issue, one finds that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have at various stages over the past decade competed for attention about how upset they were about the costs of various tribunals.  The decibels of indignation were in direct proportion to the proximity to elections &mdash; if an election was in prospect, the Government became very concerned about tribunal costs.</P>
        <P>Some Members will recall the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, express concern about what he called &ldquo;this gravy train&rdquo;.  This occurred before he left us for his own gravy train, as he was entitled to do.  While no action was taken, the Government knocked two or three good weeks of publicity out of the issue.  The former Attorney General and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, who is now a private citizen, then followed Mr. McCreevy&rsquo;s example and joined the chorus.  However, he did so only after he, as Attorney General, negotiated increases in lawyers&rsquo; fees at which point he became extremely agitated about the cost of tribunals.</P>
        <P>One must be sceptical.  When we reached the point at which action became unavoidable the Government, having settled on a new schedule of fees, backed off and let the <i>status quo</i> obtain.  One formed the impression that there was an informal Government policy to beat the drum of indignation about tribunal costs in public while privately assenting to increased costs and the <i>status quo</i>.</P>
        <P>Having expressed my scepticism about the argument that there is something sinister about the timing of the introduction of this Bill, its introduction is odd, given that the horse has well and truly bolted.  Why introduce it now?  Hundreds of theses will be written by students about our experience of a generation of tribunals.  Have they been worth it?  Have they changed the culture?  Is there a more effective, speedier, less costly way to inquire into certain matters of public interest?</P>
        <P>What about inquiry by parliamentary committee.  Why has the Government, in all its complexions, allowed inquiry by parliamentary committee to fall below the radar.  The DIRT inquiry was praised by objective analysts and commentators.  It is not true, as the Minister knows, that the subsequent judgment in the Abbeylara case <Col N="1643"/>vetoed inquiry by parliamentary committee.  It made a specific finding that where a citizen&rsquo;s reputation could be adversely reflected on, in such extraordinary and unique circumstances as in Abbeylara, inquiry by parliamentary committee was not appropriate.  I accept that as it is common sense.  The judgment was not that inquiry by parliamentary committee was not appropriate in many other cases.  However, parliamentary inquiry has been allowed to wither.  No effort has been made by the Government to look at that judgment and to get inquiry by parliamentary committee up and running again.</P>
        <P>The legal profession was not in favour of the DIRT inquiry repeating itself.  As legal people see the world, that is their business, not the job of Parliament and parliamentarians.  The senior public service share that view, but for different reasons.  The senior Civil Service thoroughly disapproved of the DIRT inquiry.  How dare a committee of parliamentarians hold senior civil servants to account in public, worse still, on live television.  Uniquely, the Civil Service had no role in compiling the report.  The word went out that this could be the end of civilisation as we know.  There would never be another DIRT style inquiry.  So it has happened.  In the everyday polite trade-off that happens between the Executive and the mandarinate, a meeting of minds on no further inquiry by parliamentary committee was not difficult.  One party in permanent power makes such trade-offs almost routine.  The Green Party is as ineffective as the Progressive Democrats Party before it in challenging the suppression of inquiry by parliamentary committee.</P>
        <P>The former Attorney General, Mr. Michael McDowell, was probably correct when he told the DIRT inquiry on the question of tribunals versus parliamentary inquiries:</P>
        <P LI="1">Many people sitting on a bar stool would say &ldquo;surely the DIRT inquiry shows us there is a different and a better way.&rdquo;  Yes, it has shown up very important things, but it does not mean that it simply cannot be transferred holus bolus and applied to areas which are much more contentious.</P>
        <P FLI="0">On that occasion, Mr. McDowell, giving evidence in a personal capacity, went on to say:</P>
        <P LI="1">In short, I do not believe &mdash; and in the absence of a binding Supreme Court decision on the issue &mdash; that it is possible to state with total confidence as a matter of law that the establishment of a tribunal is always a mere policy choice, open as an alternative to conducting an inquiry by parliamentary committee.  Nor is a parliamentary committee necessarily always available as an alternative to the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I agree with that.  Neither can apply in all circumstances, but the suppression of inquiry by <Col N="1644"/>parliamentary committee is to be regretted and would have saved the taxpayer enormous sums of money.</P>
        <P>I am reminded of what Ted Heath said to the House of Commons in July 1982 on the appointment of the Falkland Islands review when he said the plain fact is that we have never succeeded in finding the perfect form of inquiry.  That is true.  However, we have had the opportunity to learn a great deal since the beef tribunal.  The most remarkable aspect of that tribunal for me &mdash; I appeared before it &mdash; was that it never made a single order for discovery.</P>
        <P>Ever since the beef tribunal, up to and including today, we have had an opportunity to learn a great deal about public inquiries, their suitability, terms of reference, procedures, costs, reports and so on.  From that point of view, I welcome the Bill.  Just because tribunals have been inordinately expensive, this does not mean taxpayers, in their capacity as citizens, are not interested in ensuring that matters of public interest are properly inquired into.  However, I am surprised at the extent to which the Minister&rsquo;s speech is almost entirely devoted to the costs issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that the cost to the Exchequer of completed and sitting tribunals of inquiry and other public inquiries was &euro;316.6 million.  What did he include in that?  Which inquiries are included?  Did that amount start with the beef tribunal and does it go up to the present day?  He said that of that sum, &euro;228 million is in respect of legal costs.  He goes on to say that with regard to tribunals which are yet to be completed and for which claims for costs remain to be settled, the total cost at end October is &euro;211 million.  Does that &euro;211 million come on top of the &euro;316 million?  I am not sure.  All I know is that the tribunals are inordinately expensive.  Many people believe that the figures they read in the newspapers are the cost of the tribunals, but they are not.  They are the cost of counsel for the State and related parties.  They do not include third party costs, which in most cases will not be calculated until the end of the tribunals.  Tribunals are expensive and it is incumbent on us to find a more efficient, speedy way to do our business.</P>
        <P>I have not taken the course of commenting on the extraordinary appearances at the tribunal of the Taoiseach or on his Byzantine financial affairs.  One does not have enough time here to go through that.  In any event, we are saved that challenge by it being the task of the tribunal.   I was, however, struck by the remarkable evidence last week of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  I admired his chutzpah when he went in railing and ranting about the outrageous nature of the allegation that he was in receipt of a six figure sum, when he only received a five figure sum, albeit some of it for charitable purposes.  The remainder was for his purposes, political purposes I presume.  It then became apparent that the Minister <Col N="1645"/>had set up a meeting for the donor with Mr. Bertie Ahern, who was Minister for Finance at the time.  Then we learned that the Minister for Finance had been in Los Angeles with the donor on business, which presumably was to the benefit of the State.  We know fact No. 4, that the tribunal is of the opinion that a very large amount of dollars was lodged to an account of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s.  There may be no connection between these four facts but, as an example of the most recent appearance before the tribunal, it shows that if we were to go back over the conflicting stories we have heard, we would be here all night.</P>
        <P>It ought to be enough, if the Government was not so remote, out of touch and arrogant, that it would not introduce this Bill at this time.  The Mahon tribunal is grinding to a halt &mdash; by that I mean it looks like continuing for another nine months in any event.  Given that we have waited this long and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform insists that the Bill is not aimed at any existing tribunal, we can wait that bit longer.  We have waited for ten years without taking action on spiralling tribunal costs.  We saw it before our eyes, yet we had the hypocritical situation of the Minister of the day ranting and raving about costs while, in his other capacity, in his prior capacity as Attorney General, he had agreed an increase in fees for the lawyers concerned.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have to accept there is good cause this side of the House should be sceptical.  We will have the opportunity to go into the detail of this on Committee Stage but I was struck by a number of things the Minister said in his contribution.  I note that he has promised some additional amendments between now and Committee Stage.  I wonder, given the freedom that chairpersons of tribunals have had up to now, what a prospective chairperson of a tribunal would say when asked by Government in future whether he or she would be prepared to chair a public inquiry.  There is no doubt that it is far more of a strait-jacket into the future than it has been up to now.  I am not complaining about that.  I would like time to consider the balance involved but it certainly is very different.</P>
        <P>I wish to point, in passing, to the Minister&rsquo;s script where he draws our attention to section 18 which requires a tribunal to carry out its functions as efficiently, effectively and expeditiously as is practicable having regard to its terms of reference.  A tribunal is precluded from inquiring into a relevant matter unless it is satisfied that the cost and duration of that inquiry are likely to be justified by the importance of the facts that are likely to be established.</P>
        <P>I am reminded, for example, of a decision of the Moriarty tribunal to inquire into the acquisition of Doncaster Rovers.  The remarkable thing about that is that at the time this House established the Moriarty tribunal, the purchaser con<Col N="1646"/>cerned had not even acquired Doncaster Rovers.  Doncaster Rovers was only purchased after the tribunal was established so it could not have been in the minds of the Members of the Oireachtas that caused the tribunal to come into existence.  Yet we find that quite some time has been devoted to inquiring into the acquisition of something that was not in the minds of the Members of this House when the tribunal was set up.  There are many other examples throughout the Minister&rsquo;s script where questions can be raised about whether we have got the balance right.  Nobody is disputing that we have to modernise the law in this regard.  The year 1921 precedes the foundation of the State and that is a long time ago.</P>
        <P>I am amused at the Minister&rsquo;s pointing out that costs were awarded for the engagement of public relations consultants by persons appearing before a tribunal.  I remember that well.  They were paid.  The man retaining them was not short of staff at the time, yet the open-handed State paid a fortune to PR consultants to spin the story from the tribunal.  It is remarkable when one thinks about it, it is an incredible waste of money.  At least in that regard I am at one with the Minister that it is time to call a halt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am supportive of the Bill on the basis that it is properly and thoroughly discussed and not rushed because it is very important.  I was encouraged by the broadly constructive contribution of Deputy Rabbitte who, if I understand him correctly, said he would support the Bill provided there was written into it an assurance that it did not apply to sitting tribunals.  In response to one of his points, if, as is the stated intention, the main existing tribunals will draw to a close over the next 12 months or so, this is the proper time to consider the basis on which such tribunals will be conducted in the future.  From my knowledge of the academic world, I think there might be about a dozen theses written about tribunals.  I do not think there are hundreds &mdash; that might exhaust it.  </P>
        <P>That contribution contrasted with the previous contribution of Deputy Flanagan which seemed to show a total inability to treat the issue on its merits and was simply unremittingly partisan in nature and with little constructive content about the reform of tribunals or any recognition of the necessity of it, apart from a passing reference to commissions of investigation.</P>
        <P>Nothing I will say is a reflection on the good work done in tribunals or the conscientious efforts made by lawyers, judges or other parties to attain or ascertain evidence and to try to draw secure conclusions.  It is normal in debates, where relevant, to declare an interest.  This immediately raises a slightly awkward problem in that tribunals wish to keep their correspondence with witnesses confidential.  Some years ago one of the tribunals was in correspondence with me in relation to a matter I dealt with as a special <Col N="1647"/>adviser on Northern Ireland.  Needless to say, nothing I say will be influenced in any way by that.  In passing, some derogatory reference was made to special advisers by Deputy Flanagan.  I was a policy adviser not just a political adviser and I believe that I provided some value for money.  It is a complete distortion to think that they are solely or mainly spin doctors giving partisan political advice.  They are people who are genuinely concerned to solve problems.  That was just as true of, say, the programme managers and advisers that served the Labour Party when we were in government with that party.</P>
        <P>It is obvious tribunals need reform and the problems extend beyond this jurisdiction.  At a media conference a few years ago, a well known journalist declared there was tremendous competition among journalists to find material for the next tribunal.  I, of course, draw a distinction between tribunals that are related to mainly political matters and other tribunals which, while perhaps having great social importance, are not as politically sensitive.</P>
        <P>The Flood-Mahon and Moriarty tribunals have lasted nearly ten years, a length far beyond anything envisaged when they were being set up, and the Bloody Sunday tribunal in Derry has also lasted many years.  All of them have cost hundreds of millions.  It is safe to say that while people will continue to demand them, and in certain instances in regard to the North the Government has supported them, as a matter of practical reality there will be no more such tribunals unless the basis on which they are conducted is reformed.  The notion that they are a shortcut to truth through curtailing legal procedure has proved to be something of a mirage.</P>
        <P>Much has been said inside and outside this House &mdash; I am not referring to anyone present &mdash; about the immense superiority of the English common law system, which we in this country share.  As one who spent time studying the French legal system, I am not so sure.  Indeed, as I stated previously in the House, I have huge admiration for the work of the investigating judge in Spain, Baltasar Garz&oacute;n.  It would be interesting to explore whether the system of an investigating judge or magistrate could be grafted on to our system, although probably the Law Library hands would go up in horror at the suggestion.</P>
        <P>Some of the best tribunals and commissions are ones that are admirably short.  I thought the report of the McCracken tribunal, which sat for no more than three or four months, was admirable and its conclusions were universally accepted.  I can think of an analogous body, although it was not a tribunal, namely, the Mitchell commission which reported on decommissioning.  That took about six weeks and it stood the test of time.  It is not necessarily the case that tribunals and commissions which last a <Col N="1648"/>very long time, go into vast detail and cost a great deal of money are the best.</P>
        <P>The problem with tribunals, certainly so far as some of the principals are concerned, is that the rights of individuals come into play.  The way tribunals are conducted is potentially seriously prejudicial to people&rsquo;s reputations, a point that has been made in various recourses to the High Court and so on.  There is a sense that no appeal is possible, except perhaps to public opinion, from a judgment of a tribunal and that the usual recourses are not available.  In some way, from a humanitarian point of view, I am glad the Moriarty report on Charles Haughey was not produced until after his decease.</P>
        <P>We all extend our sympathies to Deputy Michael Lowry on the recent loss of his mother.  Deputy Lowry has suffered Chinese torture over the past ten years, during which his reputation has been in suspense because the tribunal, for various reasons, not all its own fault, has taken so long in coming to a conclusion.  Such inordinate delays are very unfair, although they are not entirely peculiar to tribunals and can happen in courts of law.  The case of a constituency colleague in south Tipperary is being deferred repeatedly, which is not fair to him.</P>
        <P>There is also the fact that tribunals can come to very trenchant judgments &mdash; sometimes one might even consider them cavalier and crowd-pleasing judgments.  Although it is not in the least a popular point to make, I was shocked that the Flood tribunal report on the former Deputy and Minister, Ray Burke, simply came to the conclusion, which was vociferously welcomed in the press, that he was corrupt even though it stated it had not been able to find any actions corresponding to the funds he had been given.</P>
        <P>Naturally, it is never an opportune time to reform the law on tribunals.  The Government is now doing so but that does not protect it from the accusations it is trying to control criticism or acting for some short-term partisan advantage.  In the case of the Opposition there may be no particular advantage for it in this regard.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s courage in bringing forward the Bill.</P>
        <P>We have had much debate inside and outside this House with regard to costs and the remuneration of higher civil servants, office holders and so on.  However, some of the tribunal lawyers are better paid than any of the categories mentioned.  The former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, and the former Deputy, Michael McDowell, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform rather than as Attorney General, attempted at one point to rein in from a certain date lawyers&rsquo; fees but found they had to pull back.  Our Attorney General is not paid a daily rate on the basis of what he could earn in the courts, nor, for that matter, are judges.  While this is only hinted at in the Minister&rsquo;s speech, there is much to be said for having salaried barristers <Col N="1649"/>work for tribunals for two or three years.  There would then be an automatic limitation of at least some of those costs.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the Minister for Education and Science to the House and thank her for taking this debate.  Today and tomorrow we will discuss an absolutely crucial area of education, namely, the current shambolic nature of psychological assessment.  I have brought this matter to the floor of the House as it requires urgent attention from the Government.</P>
        <P>Despite promises by the Minister for Education and Science that a comprehensive schools psychological service would be put in place, eight years after the establishment of NEPS about half of all primary schools have no service while the number of secondary schools with a designated psychologist is falling.  Our schools have one of the worst ratios of psychologists to pupils in Europe.  Is there any wonder why we continue to hear about the appalling tragedies of young lives lost, broken or even ended because there is no psychological intervention?  Having a proper psychological service is not a luxury, it is a basic necessity in modern education and the catch-up under way in Irish education leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
        <P>The most basic requirement on the part of the Department of Education and Science where a child presents with special needs is to have that child assessed as soon as possible so that an individual educational plan can be put together for the child.  That is not happening at the moment as students have to wait many years for a proper assessment to take place.  If one speaks to school principals on a regular basis, as I do, the issue that is highlighted repeatedly is the appalling waiting time for psychological assessments.  While the waiting goes on, the child is in a classroom setting, often disruptive and unable to contribute to the work of the class.  The child&rsquo;s experience of education becomes a day-by-day frustration as deeper problems go unchecked within our school system.</P>
        <P>This motion demands that the Minister for Education and Science gets to grips with this issue.  She and her predecessors have had long enough to resolve the bottlenecks that have been evident in the NEPS service in recent years.  She has had long enough to recruit additional psychologists into the service and roll out the service to all schools.  It is time that excuses came to an end and promises were fulfilled.</P>
        <P>If one looks at the NEPS budget for next year, what is proposed is a cut of 6% from the amount of money received this year.  One of the few areas in the education budget where cutbacks are proposed in the context of next year&rsquo;s Estimate is under the national educational psychological service.  How can the Minister propose a cut in a service where she knows that the demand exists and where she has failed to keep her pre-election promises?</P>
        <P>Parents and schools are increasingly turning to charitable organisations to get their children <Col N="1651"/>psychologically assessed.  The situation is so bad that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has become one of the largest providers of psychological assessments.  It is a disgrace that a charitable organisation has to fund the ongoing psychological assessment of children in our school system.  Until September this year, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul funded at least 20 assessments every week at a cost of &euro;320 per assessment, with between 600 and 1,000 children being assessed annually.  Primary and secondary school principals from every part of the country regularly sought support from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for such assessments.</P>
        <P>No doubt the Minister will say that the new protocol agreed between her Department and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is in place from September 2007 to January 2008, even though this issue first came to public attention last March or April.  Effectively the Department has asked the Society of St. Vincent de Paul not to foot the Bill for these assessments.  Because parents and principals are being asked to go directly to NEPS in the first instance, this will place additional pressure on the service between now and next January.  There is considerable unease about the manner in which that protocol was negotiated between St. Vincent de Paul and the Minister&rsquo;s Department when the issue first came to public attention last March and April.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 185,000 school-age children with disabilities and special educational needs in Ireland, including about 86,000 with mental health difficulties, 63,000 with specific learning disabilities and just under 5,000 with autistic spectrum disorders.  Twenty three school-going children died by suicide last year, yet the Government has repeatedly broken its promise to provide an adequate psychological assessment service for our schools.  Eight years after the psychological service was established, half of all schools still do not have a service to which to turn.  There are 800,000 pupils in primary and secondary schools, but only enough State psychologists to assess one in every 50 children.</P>
        <P>The number of psychologists working with the State service is 134.  Where are the 31 additional posts the Minister promised last January?  At the last count, she repeated that promise on 21 occasions from January to the general election.  She promised 31 full-time additional psychologists to work with the NEPS service, yet only seven have been provided this year.  That is a shocking indictment given the scale of the promises and commitments she entered into before the election.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s document, An Agreed Programme for Government, pledged 200 school psychologists by 2009, but how will this happen when the budget for 2008 is to be cut?  At this rate the Government will miss its 2009 target and hun<Col N="1652"/>dreds of school children will continue to go without adequate assessment.</P>
        <P>When NEPS was first established, the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, promised that within five years the service would have 200 psychologists.  That promise was made in 1999 and is yet another example of the grotesque spinning machine that operates under the Government.  It is typical of this Administration that promises are made and broken, without so much as an apology or an explanation, and become part and parcel of the way the Government does its business.  When the former Minister made that promise of 200 psychologists by 2004, it was 200 fewer then the requirement estimated by the National Council for Special Education.</P>
        <P>NEPS should be put on the same statutory footing as organisations such as the National Council for Special Education and the National Educational Welfare Board.  That was the original intention when NEPS was first established, an intention fully supported by the then Minister, Deputy Martin.</P>
        <P>Under the existing departmental guidelines only two children out of every 100 can be assessed each year.  A principal recently told me that if there are 400 children in a school and only eight can be picked for assessment, one must choose the most severe cases.  Effectively, that means that fourth, fifth and sixth class students are not given priority because that goes to younger children.  It means children with real learning difficulty are going into post-primary education without ever getting treatment.</P>
        <P>Little or nothing is done for the vast majority with a disability, which is estimated by the National Council for Special Education at 18% of children.  They travel through the education system with little or no support and are often the first to fall through the system when they get to post-primary education.</P>
        <P>When a student makes the transition from primary to post-primary education, pupils do not carry the resources with them.  It seems crazy that an entirely new assessment has to be carried out, which in itself delays the resource response from the Department and makes life much more difficult for students and their families.</P>
        <P>I recognise that the Department has introduced resources at primary level to deal with learning support under the general allocation model, which allows for a certain number of resource teachers for schools depending on their status as disadvantaged or otherwise.</P>
        <P>However, at second level, the only way to get resource teachers is to have students formally assessed.  Once they have been assessed as being in need of support, resource hours will be allocated, which places additional pressure on the NEPS system.  Although it is clearly important to put significant resources into primary schools to ensure early intervention, many children do not <Col N="1653"/>receive the supports they need in primary school.  The ASTI has highlighted that 40% of pupils who go forward for assessment are deemed not to be in need of additional supports because they are marginally above the cut-off point for assistance.  These children then progress through school without additional help because the assessment process has essentially ruled them out of even before they have started.</P>
        <P>Teachers do not receive the in-service training required to cope with children in need of learning support.  Additional training was supposed to be provided to coincide with the introduction of the EPSEN Act 2004 but neither the Act nor the training programme has been implemented in schools, despite the NCSE publishing recommendations in October 2006 on how the Act should be implemented.  I am aware in recent weeks of a proposal from third level colleges where psychological assessments of not less than three years old, of any applicant with dyslexia or other learning difficulty who has applied to obtain a college place, must take place.  Requiring students with a specific learning difficulty to furnish psychological assessments carried out in the past three years to support their college application puts even more pressure on them and the NEPS.  Almost 2,000 of the 60,000 applicants for CAO courses last year were students with physical or learning difficulties.</P>
        <P>The Minister will claim schools that do not have recourse to a dedicated psychologist and are outside the NEPS system can obtain support through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA.  A panel of private psychologists is provided for schools but the restrictions on the number of assessments that can be carried out in any year means that the number of children waiting for assessment grows and grows.  Recently I was informed by the Minister, by way of a reply to a parliamentary question, that fewer private psychologists were available to carry out assessments now by comparison with the start of the year.  The rate of payment for assessments under the SCPA has not increased since 2001, an issue that has been repeatedly brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.</P>
        <P>While the NEPS psychologists provide not only assessments, but also support and development in schools, private psychologists simply carry out an assessment.  The automatic follow-up provided for under the NEPS model does not apply.  There is evidence that not only are psychologists pulling out of the scheme, but also that some are taking the minimum number of assessments in order that they can remain as NEPS approved psychologists.  Schools report that since the fee paid to them by the Department has not been increased, SCPA psychologists are negotiating with schools and completing two assessments in the time it would normally take to do one.  This rules out proper briefing time with parents and teachers, with the result that the child does not obtain the <Col N="1654"/>service needed to support him or her in the school system.</P>
        <P>Attracting new psychologists into the NEPS requires not only funding but also proper planning to deliver sufficient college places for those likely to be employed by the State.  One of the main difficulties with recruitment of suitably qualified psychologists is the lack of graduates.  Approximately eight educational psychologists graduate from UCD every year, with a similar number qualifying from Queens University Belfast.  The Government and the Department are not doing enough to provide more places for psychologists at third level, which is clear because the demand cannot be met.</P>
        <P>I will return to this issue tomorrow evening.  The current system is shambolic and the Minister must be held accountable for not delivering on her promises.  Children&rsquo;s lives are being destroyed by a failure to carry out assessments.  That is what the motion is about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion because more educational psychologists are needed.  The recent debacle concerning the withdrawal and restoration of the NEPS to 29 schools raises deeper issues.  It is positive that psychologists have been appointed but the Minister has adopted a ham-fisted approach.  Not enough is being done to provide a secure future for children at risk.  When the NEPS was set up in 1999, the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, stated 200 psychologists would be appointed within five years.  There was cross-party support for this but the number of psychologists has never exceeded 130.  The result is that young vulnerable people are very exposed.  Primary and post-primary schools need psychological services.  Government policy which opposes giving the NEPS a statutory footing is inexplicable.  This issue must be resolved.</P>
        <P>I attended a meeting on child care ten days ago and one woman made a wonderful speech highlighting the value for money achieved through child care.  Her point was that if money was invested in caring for our children and providing them with a good education, fewer of them would engage in criminal activity.  Most young detainees have mental disorders and mentally ill children fuel a lifetime cycle of crime and violence.  Value for money can be achieved.  It is a crying shame that the issue has not been addressed.  I am concerned that with the proposed cutbacks, it may not receive the attention it deserves.  The motion has been tabled to highlight this serious situation and ensure appropriately funding is provided.</P>
        <P>Research has found that eight out of ten boys incarcerated in detention schools have at least one psychological disorder and, on average, three.  They are plagued by mental health problems and many are addicted to alcohol and drugs, including cannabis and cocaine.  One in five under age criminals is intellectually disabled.  If the <Col N="1655"/>appropriate assessments were carried out, vulnerable young people could be caught early.  A potential crime spree could be curbed as a result.  The children concerned are the tip of the iceberg but once they have been detained for committing a crime, it is too late.  Psychological assessments should be carried out when they are in school.</P>
        <P>Good work has been done by my colleague, Deputy Neville, on suicide, youth suicide in particular.  Various groups provide ASIST courses.  However, more funding for psychologists could curb the ever increasing problem of youth suicide.  The NEPS addressed more than 100 critical incidents in schools in 2006 and 2007.  It is estimated Ireland has the seventh highest rate of youth suicide in the European Union.  Parents, siblings, teachers and friends of youth suicide victims participate in ASIST courses and they all ask themselves whether they could have done anything else.  If more psychologists were available in schools, they would have provided a great deal of help and eased much pain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Deputy Hayes on tabling the motion and the Fine Gael Party for giving priority to school children and their special needs which are not being catered for by the education system.  I speak on this motion having been in the front-line of the teaching profession for many years and having experienced at first hand the frustrations of principals, teachers and parents at the inability to get access to help that is so badly needed by students to give them a chance to keep pace with the system.  If they get access to that system, the recommendations made are often either, at worse, refused or, at best, cut back.  On the positive side, I have seen the progress students can make when early intervention occurs.  I have seen students who began school with great difficulties end up with masters&rsquo; degrees as a result of the help they received at an early stage.  </P>
        <P>The other side of the coin, unfortunately, is much more prevalent in classrooms throughout the country because of the under-resourcing and shortage of psychologists to make vital assessments specifying the help students need.  As a teacher I have witnessed at first hand what happens in these cases.  All the pupils in the class are affected.  This is an important point.  Students with special needs fall further and further behind.  The brighter students are also affected because their progress is restricted.  Class discipline becomes a problem and the teacher is helpless to deal with the position because he or she does not have any in-service training to deal with the special needs provisions.  There is also a major deficit in the allocation of resource teachers particularly in second level schools.</P>
        <P>Many schools are not covered by NEPS.  The schools that are covered are restricted in the number of assessments they may receive each <Col N="1656"/>year depending on their status as disadvantaged or otherwise and also on the number of the pupils at the school.  These criteria are simply not acceptable and action is needed by the Minister to make appointments she promised at the beginning of the year.  The psychologists who are in place find themselves in an impossible position.  Some of them cater for up to 15 schools.  They cannot spread themselves in all directions.</P>
        <P>A number of other important points need to be made.  In recent days I met parents who had to seek private assessments for their children because this service was not available through the system, but to add insult to injury their children were not given the help recommended in the assessments they received.  In one case, the special educational needs organiser gave one and a half hours tuition when three hours were recommended.  Who is accountable for this?  A laptop was recommended in another case but was refused.  One-to-one help was specified as necessary in another case, yet three or four pupils with different needs were grouped together, one had dyslexic difficulties, another had ADHD and another had numeracy problems.  What will be the rate of progress in that group?  The answer is fairly obvious.</P>
        <P>I spoke to a school principal yesterday who still cannot obtain an assessment for a second year student as we approach Christmas, even though the student has been in second level for up to 15 months.  The system is in disarray and the sooner that is acknowledged, the better because it is only then that we can begin to find a solution.</P>
        <P>NEPS was introduced seven or eight years ago.  If it was implemented and resourced properly, the number of assessments required at second level should be on the decrease because students&rsquo; special needs should be picked up at an earlier stage in the primary system.  We all know that the need for these assessments is increasing, as are parents&rsquo; frustrations with not getting them for their children.</P>
        <P>How is a school principal expected to adhere to the EPSEN Act and the Disability Acts if the necessary backup is not provided under NEPS?  I strongly commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>This topic is most important.  I hope the Minister will not be in denial of what it proposes, tell us that all is well and give us a litany of statistics of the hundreds of millions of euro that have been spent here, there and everywhere.  That will not wash anymore.</P>
        <P>It was stated by colleagues that early intervention is crucial.  Issues such as ADD, ADHD, dyspraxia, dyslexia, autism, Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome, depression or other mental health issues, family problems, abuse problems, drug and alcohol issues, behavioural problems, including bullying in the classroom on which we had a debate last year and about which teachers are concerned, <Col N="1657"/>demand the intervention of trained psychologists.  Teachers cannot be expected to cope on their own, yet more than half our schools do not have the support of a psychological service.  The Minister will say there is a system for commissioning psychologists.  While that is all very fine, I put it her that system is for commissioning assessments.  According to the NEPS website, its mission is to support the personal, social and educational development of all children through the application of psychological theory and practice in education, having particular regard for children with special educational needs.  In other words, all schools in the State should have the support of a psychological service and not only an assessment service.  NEPS website has links to information for parents, etc. but that is not enough.  Every school should be visited by a trained psychologist a number of times a year not only to carry out assessments but to speak to and support staff, students and management in the work they do.  Psychologists should not only take fire brigade action. That is important.  Many colleagues will speak about the serious major issues in schools but we need to go beyond that.  We need to examine the vital support that a properly resourced psychological service can provide to schools.</P>
        <P>Another aspect of this issue, which does not come under the Minister&rsquo;s remit but comes under the Government&rsquo;s remit, is the adolescent and psychological service provided by the HSE.  I was advised recently that in the HSE southern region children can wait up to two years for an assessment.  Children are sent for assessment to the HSE and parents are told their children are on a routine waiting list.  One young boy was diagnosed with ADHD a number of years ago.  His GP said his behaviour is getting progressively worse.  He is out of control, he rarely sleeps, he has no sense of danger and is quite violent towards his family.  His tantrums have left his home in uproar and are having a serious impact on his schooling.  His teacher is worried about his behaviour in the classroom and towards other children.  His concentration is extremely poor and he needs constant attention in the classroom.  He was placed on the HSE waiting list in May 2007.  Despite the severe nature of his case I was advised by the HSE at the start of this month that, based on the information provided at referral stage, the boy was on a routine waiting list and this would only be reviewed if more information is provided.  That is not good enough.  A service should be available through the school system for that child and his family.  His mother is at her wits&rsquo; end and is finding it increasingly difficult to cope, yet according to the HSE&rsquo;s waiting time for assessment this boy may have to wait for a long time before he gets the treatment he urgently requires.</P>
        <P>In May of this year I was advised by the HSE that there are 658 children awaiting assessment in Cork and an amazing 4,312 are awaiting speech <Col N="1658"/>therapy services.  This should not be the position given that the Government has been in office for ten years and has had such funds at its disposal.</P>
        <P>I want to bring another issue to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  When parents approach public representatives such as myself and other colleagues on all sides of the House to make representations to the NEPS on their behalf, those in NEPS are not allowed to talk to us.  Officials in most other State agencies and bodies will talk to us.  Even if we have a parent&rsquo;s written permission, those in NEPS advise me that they cannot talk to us because the Minister will not allow it.  I ask the Minister to change this position.  I tabled a parliamentary question on this issue and that is the response I was given.  I ask the Minister to review this position.  If a parent gives a public representative written permission to make representations to and secure information from NEPS&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Early intervention is crucial.  Times have changed.  Some 20 years ago many of the conditions I mentioned were not recognised.  Conditions such as ADHD, ADD, dyspraxia, dyslexia, autism etc. were not recognised or discovered.  It was the &ldquo;bold child&rdquo;, a &ldquo;nervous child&rdquo; or an &ldquo;awkward child&rdquo; where dyspraxia was concerned, or the parents were bad parents.  Parents are sometimes hauled in and grilled about their behaviour.  Things have changed and we have to move on.  In the past many of these children did not stay at school but dropped out early.  Thankfully, they are now staying and they need the supports, but are not getting them. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this motion.  It is probably one of the most important issues we have discussed so far this session.  Nobody knows better than the Minister about the importance of timely intervention for vulnerable children.  The educational assessment and the education plan which follows it is the gateway to the services a child needs.  If the gateway is closed owing to the absence of an assessment, no resources in terms <Col N="1659"/>of the help a child needs are released, even if they are in place. </P>
        <P>This has implications for every child in the class, not just the one experiencing difficulties.  If there is a disruptive, unhappy, underachieving, undiagnosed child, that causes enormous problems, of necessity.  It absorbs the teacher&rsquo;s attentions and energies and affects every single child in the class so that they are all disadvantaged, in effect.  The reality is that in most classrooms today it is not just one child but one in every five children who experience some learning difficulties.  The problem may be very minor.  It could be slight autism, a mild hearing problem, dyslexia or whatever.  In many cases the child can be saved through timely intervention and can go on to lead a perfectly normal, happy life, availing of all the educational opportunities that exist towards helping him or her to achieve full potential.</P>
        <P>However, if the safety net is not there, a child&rsquo;s future will be different, characterised by a series of lost opportunities throughout his or her life.  It is not just a failure to move on and achieve gainful employment, but rather the inability to grow emotionally, and form meaningful and supportive relationships towards developing a sense of self-esteem.  All the literature and research indicates that what happens to such children can lead to depression, even suicide, or to a cycle of crime that ends in prison.  At best it leads to a lifetime of underachievement and lost potential.  I do not believe anything is sadder than that.  We can spend money on nothing better if we are to avert that fate for children.</P>
        <P>We know the value of early intervention in averting disaster.  The introduction of NEPS was an acknowledgement of that.  It begs the question why we are not getting these assessments and the accompanying follow-through.  The only explanation for the lack of assessment and the consequent lack of an education plan is the rationing of the scarce therapeutic resources that are available.  If the need for intervention is not recognised, the enormous gap in resources in effecting the plan that  should follow is not identified.  The gateway is being slammed in the face of children at that crucial time in their lives.  There is no excuse for not having the type of personnel called for, the language and occupational therapists, physiotherapists, psychologists etc.  There is no explanation, but the need was well signalled.</P>
        <P>When NEPS was introduced this was an acknowledgement of the need for it.  The Disability Act, which clearly guaranteed an assessment of every child, of necessity immediately demanded a vast increase in the supply of high calibre trained therapists.  If that was not enough, there was the growing population.  We know there will be 58,000 children in the primary school system within a few years.  How will they get the additional assessments if we are training eight <Col N="1660"/>educational psychologists a year through the MA course?</P>
        <P>The greatest irony and the biggest tragedy in this is the impact of the Disability Act.  This long-awaited legislation, in which so many people had placed their hopes, gives a statutory right of assessment to a child with a disability, but that applies only to children up to age five.  The impact of this is that all the new therapeutic resources which are becoming available to do assessments, including educational psychologists, are being directed to this age group.  That is absolutely essential and very welcome, but it was never intended to replace the resources allocated to children in school.  Children up to five have the right to an assessment or perhaps can avail of services within the community, but once they go to school they lose it.</P>
        <P>It is an absolute outrage that this is what is happening as a result of the introduction of the Disability Act.  It is a part of the same problem because not enough educational psychologists or therapists are being trained.  It is absolutely essential that this matter is addressed urgently and there is no excuse for not dealing with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I congratulate Deputy Hayes on his initiative.  I should like to address the section of the debate noting that a reported 23 school-going children died by suicide in the last school year.  That is tragic and we have repeatedly raised the issue of the difficult area of youth suicide.  Ireland has the fifth highest level in Europe of youth suicide in the age group 15 to 24 years.  Those at a higher level are Lithuania, Estonia, Finland and Latvia.  Ireland has the highest level of suicide in western Europe and the Government continues to ignore that fact.  It will not put in the resources to give adequate support to the National Office for Suicide Prevention to put prevention programmes in place for all ages, particularly among the youth and children.  Children include persons up to the age of 18. </P>
        <P>We know very little about the one in every seven young men who die by suicide.  Anecdotally, we know some of them.  Certainly, if we have adolescent or young adult children, we will know some of them because they will have been among their friends and colleagues.  Most young people nowadays know of someone who has taken his or her life, whether a school colleague, somebody from the parish, a relation or whatever.  Most young persons tend to know someone who has taken his or her life.  Children as young as seven know about suicide and discuss it among themselves in their own way.  Little systematic study, however, has been carried out in respect of those young people and no published psychological autopsy studies have been done in Ireland.  We do not study what is happening or why.  The resources are not being put into this area by the State.</P><Col N="1661"/>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>A psychological autopsy study is an in-depth interview with the people closest to the young person who has died by suicide and attempts to clarify those issues which, in the final months of his or her life, may have contributed to the suicide.  Such studies have been carried out with this age group in the United Kingdom and the United States and detailed references are available.  I cannot say that these studies relate specifically to the Irish situation, but they can inform us.  Young people live within families, communities and social networks and factors impact on young people at each of these levels, just as they impact on the systems that surround them.  Being male is one of the factors associated with taking one&rsquo;s life.  Males tend to use &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; methods, from which there is no coming back, to take their lives.  I refer to hanging, for example.  Young people from the lower socio-economic groups are over-represented in studies in the United Kingdom, but not so in the United States.   However, we do not know what is happening in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, is present, as I know of his interest in this area.  I ask the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, to ensure the Cabinet supports him with the resources necessary to do what I believe he wants to do.  His predecessor, Tim O&rsquo;Malley, did not receive the necessary resources, although his heart was in the right place.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">One of the Minister of State, Deputy Devins&rsquo;s key functions is to promote the co-ordinated delivery of services in the health and education sectors to people with disabilities and special educational needs.  In that respect, he has a key role to play in the context of access to speech and language therapies.  He will address the points raised in the Private Members&rsquo; motion about those services and also deal with the issue of youth suicide which falls within the mental health aspect of his portfolio.  I will focus on the issue of access to educational assessments.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to outline to the House the progress made in this area.  It is important to set out the wider context on developments in special education in recent years to explain how the role of psychological assessments has evolved in line with other developments.  Since the Government decision in 1998 to provide for an automatic response for children with special needs, the number of staff working solely in the area of special education has grown exponentially.  There are now over 6,000 primary school teachers working directly with children with special educational needs compared with fewer than 1,500 in 1998.  At post-primary level, over 2,450 whole-time equivalent teachers support special needs students compared with just 200 in 1998.  The number of special needs assistants has increased from a mere 300 in 1998 to <Col N="1663"/>over 8,800 this year.  With this dramatic increase in staffing &mdash; there are now over 17,000 people working solely with children with special educational needs and learning difficulties &mdash; children with special needs are getting far better support than ever before to help them reach their potential.  Since reference was made to children with autism, it is worth noting that there are now over 270 units for such children.  In the past year alone 75 additional new units have been set up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Rightly so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The procedures for accessing extra support have also been improved with the establishment of the National Council for Special Education and its team of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs.  Through this service, parents and teachers have, for the first time, local personnel to help them obtain the appropriate support for their children.  All of these improvements have been made possible by a significant increase in funding.  Over &euro;820 million is being provided for special education this year.  This amounts to &euro;180 million, or nearly<?oasys _jy ?>30%, more than what was provided in the 2006 Estimates.</P>
        <P>Further improvements in services are on the way with the roll-out of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act which provides for an educational assessment for children with special needs and the entitlement to an individual educational plan.  It also provides for parents to be consulted and informed at different stages of the process.  Parents will also have recourse to an independent appeals board which will have the power to compel bodies, including the Health Service Executive, to take specific actions to address matters before it.</P>
        <P>Guidelines on devising and implementing individual education plans have been issued to schools by the council.  It is the council&rsquo;s intention that these guidelines will provide a benchmark for best practice pending full implementation of the Act and thatschools will use them to draw up school policies and procedures on individual education plans in advance of the mandatory requirement for them to do so.</P>
        <P>A further significant development in recent years that has reduced the need for assessments has been the introduction of the general allocation model of providing resource teachers for primary schools.  Since September 2005 all schools have been allocated resource teaching hours based on their enrolment figures to support children with high incidence special needs and learning difficulties.  The reasoning behind the introduction of the general allocation model was simple.  Children with special needs such as dyslexia or mild learning difficulties are found in almost every school.  It, therefore, makes sense <Col N="1664"/>that every school should have a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school, while recognising the special additional requirements of boys&rsquo; schools and schools in disadvantaged areas.  This is a major improvement on the previous system, under which every child required a psychological assessment before being given resource teaching hours.  This was a time-consuming process that often led to delays in children getting the support they needed.  Resource teachers are now in place in the school from the start of the first term; thus children who need their assistance can avail of it immediately.  Early intervention is facilitated by the fact that the resources are in place when the child enrols.</P>
        <P>Individual allocations for pupils with special educational needs arising from more severe learning disabilities continue to be made.  These are being processed by the National Council for Special Education.  On the need for assessments, it should also be noted that the NEPS, in common with other psychological services, encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention in consultation with its assigned NEPS psychologist.  It is only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, that a child should be referred for individual psychological assessment.  This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</P>
        <P>The NEPS has recently produced a set of guidelines and resource pack for primary school teachers which outlines such a graduated problem solving model of assessment and intervention.  It comprises three distinct processes, at the levels of the classroom, school support and external support to the school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Where there is no NEPS psychologist assigned to a school, how can it take responsibility for an initial assessment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, the NEPS has recently issued a set of guidelines and resource packs for all schools outlining exactly the nature of the graduation model.  The full, thorough psycho-educational assessment is only necessary for the small number of pupils for whom assessment and intervention within the school has not worked and for those who have clear and significant special educational needs on entry to school.</P>
        <P>Such a staged process should also be used by school principals in prioritising children for assessment through the private scheme.  Most children with special educational needs do not, therefore, need individual assessments in order to access extra supports at school.  However, all <Col N="1665"/>schools have access to assessments for their pupils either directly through the NEPS or through the scheme for commissioning private psychological assessments.  Through this scheme, schools that are not yet served directly by the NEPS or Dublin VEC psychologists can commission assessments from any one of 140 private psychologists and the NEPS will pay for them.  As a general rule, schools can commission assessments from psychologists on the private panel for up to 2% of their pupil population in any given year.  It is up to school principals to decide which pupils need these assessments.  Principals who consider that there are exceptional circumstances that warrant additional assessments may consult the NEPS about these cases.</P>
        <P>During the last academic year some 4,400 assessments were funded under the SCPA, at a total cost of nearly &euro;1.5 million.  Almost 5,800 assessments were carried out by NEPS psychologists in the same period.  Therefore, in total, over 10,000 assessments were paid for by my Department in the last school year alone.  It is also estimated that an additional 5,000 students benefited from specific advice and consultation provided by NEPS psychologists for their teachers.  NEPS psychologists also provided recommendations on some 2,800 students seeking reasonable accommodations in the leaving certificate examinations in the last school year.</P>
        <P>The Private Members&rsquo; motion before the House refers to charities paying for assessments.  I take it this relates to the publicity earlier this year about some branches of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul covering the cost of assessments last year.  Given the fact that more than 10,000 assessments were funded by my Department that year and that the introduction of the general allocation model which allocated resource teachers to every primary school had reduced the need for assessments, I was genuinely concerned to hear the Society of St. Vincent de Paul had been paying for assessments.  Officials from NEPS met the society to explore the nature of these referrals and I also discussed the matter at a meeting with the head of the society.  Through the interaction that has taken place between NEPS and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in recent months, a greater understanding of the overall context in which the psychological service is provided to schools exists and a process has been agreed between the two bodies to record and monitor demand.</P>
        <P>As I have already explained, all schools have access to assessments either directly through NEPS or through the private scheme. The number of schools served directly by NEPS is, therefore, only half the picture.  Nonetheless, the Government is committed to expanding the number of NEPS psychologists so that more schools can receive a direct service.</P><Col N="1666"/>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the National Educational Psychological Service did not exist at all until 1999.  This Government not only established NEPS: we have trebled its staffing to a current total of 134 psychologists.  In addition, a further 16 psychologists provide a service through the Dublin city and county VECs.  Taken together, there are currently 150 educational psychologists working in services paid for by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the 31 that were promised?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come to that.  The Government is committed to increasing the number of NEPS psychologists to 200 by 2009.  As part of this expansion, funding was made available earlier this year for 31 extra psychologists to be appointed to NEPS in 2007.  In April 2007, there were 128 educational psychologists, including four that have been assigned to the dedicated national behavioural support service and the further education service.  Since then, nine educational psychologists have been appointed.  However, as is common with all organisations, some members of NEPS have retired or resigned, with the effect that the current complement of educational psychologists stands at 134.  However, the Department has recently contracted a further five psychologists, with three due to take up duty later in November and one in December this year.  Another psychologist will take up duty in early January 2008.</P>
        <P>My Department had originally hoped that the 2007 vacancies could be filled from the existing panels.  When it became apparent that this would not be possible, agreement was reached with the Public Appointments Service to conduct a new recruitment competition.  As there has been substantial recruitment to the three eastern coast regions that serve Dublin and its surrounding counties, it was decided that the new competition would focus on the other seven regions.</P>
        <P>An advertisement was placed in the print media and on the <i>publicjobs.ie</i> website inviting applications for the position of psychologists, with a deadline for receipt of applications by 25 October 2007.  Approximately 120 applications have been received and arrangements are being made for short listing and for interviews.</P>
        <P>The recruitment of educational psychologists can be a protracted one, given the limited number of people who have the required skills and qualifications.  Applicants must have a recognised first or second class honours degree in psychology or an equivalent qualification, a recognised postgraduate qualification in educational psychology or a related field and at least three years&rsquo; supervised postgraduate professional experience as a psychologist working with children and young people, preferably in an educational setting.  Con<Col N="1667"/>sideration may be given by the Public Appointments Service to a recognised teaching qualification and at least three years&rsquo; teaching or related experience in the primary sector or in a relevant specialised role in the post-primary sector.  As educational psychologists work with children, they are also subject to Garda vetting prior to recruitment.</P>
        <P>To try to make sure the process is as efficient as possible, my Department has only allowed candidates to apply for a maximum of three regions in the latest competition.  In previous competitions, candidates could apply for all regions and this caused further delays in recruitment as candidates turned down offers of posts in regions which they did not wish to accept even though they indicated a preference in their application.</P>
        <P>The biggest challenge is persuading psychologists to work outside the greater Dublin, Cork and Galway areas.  Candidates will only be given a maximum of five days to accept or decline an offer in order to ensure that the post can be offered to the next panel candidate in a timely fashion.  I assure Deputies that the Government is doing all it can to fill the NEPS vacancies as soon as possible.  It is expected that offers of appointment will be made to candidates in the first quarter of the new year.  I do not agree with the proposal in the Private Members&rsquo; motion to streamline the number of psychologists on the private panel.  I believe that this would make the service less convenient for schools and restrict local and regional coverage.</P>
        <P>The motion refers to the tragedy of suicides of school-aged children.  I am, of course, aware of the serious problem of youth suicide and of the vital role that schools can play in its prevention.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Devins, will outline in more detail how we are addressing the promotion of positive mental health for young people through programmes such as social, personal and health education and through the provision of extra guidance counsellors to schools.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Psychological Service also has a role to play in this area.  NEPS will shortly publish revised guidelines for schools on responding to critical incidents, which will outline preventive approaches that schools can adopt in creating a safe and supportive environment.  It also outlines how schools can plan for crises.  The advice and information contained in these publications is based on research in the area of critical incidents and is further enriched by the experience of psychologists and schools who have been involved in this difficult work.</P>
        <P>NEPS psychologists offer assistance to all schools which experience critical incidents.  This relates in the main to sudden deaths within the school system, where NEPS psychologists, upon request from school authorities, provide an advis<Col N="1668"/>ory and support function for teachers to deal with the after effects.  During 2006 and 2007, some 118 such incidents, including accidents, traffic accidents and killings, were recorded.  In many situations, it involved two NEPS psychologists supporting schools for an average of two days input.  I take this opportunity to sympathise with families and communities bereaved following tragic events.  I also acknowledge the wonderful support given by schools to students, parents and indeed the whole community during such sad times.  In many of these circumstances, the whole community turns to the schools for leadership and schools have responded in a most professional, ethical and sympathetic way.</P>
        <P>To conclude, all schools have access to psychological assessments for their pupils.  Those schools that are not yet directly served by NEPS psychologists can have assessments carried out by private psychologists and NEPS will pay for them.  The Government is committed to increasing the number of NEPS psychologists.  This is shown by the fact that the recruitment process is under way.  We will continue to build upon the significant improvements that have already been made in supports for children with special needs in recent years through increased investment, additional staffing and an improved legislative and administrative framework.</P>

	<P>Suicide is an issue which affects every element of our society.  The impact on people bereaved by suicide and whole communities caught up in its aftermath is shattering and closure can be hard to find.  International evidence shows that reducing the suicide rate requires a collective, concerted effort from all groups in society, including health services, social services, other professionals, communities and community leaders, voluntary and statutory agencies and organisations.  It also requires fostering the development of a culture in which people in psychological distress do not hesitate to seek help and a culture that recognises the signs and signals of distress and is willing to help.</P>
        <P>Thankfully, the level of discussion and openness on mental health issues, including suicide and self harm, has increased significantly in recent years.  This is a very welcome development but we still have a long way to go.  We should be encouraged by the progress that has been made to date in Ireland, in particular, the launch of two important strategy documents, Reach Out &mdash; A National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention, which was launched in the south of Ireland in September 2005 after an extensive consultation and examination of the research evidence, and Protect Life, which was launched in Northern Ireland in October 2006 following a similar process of consultation.  Both strategies set out plans <Col N="1669"/>over an agreed time period ranging from general population approaches to improve awareness and education to specific plans for special groups of identified vulnerable people.  The establishment of the HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention plays a vital part in developing and progressing suicide prevention policies.</P>
        <P>The action areas identified in Reach Out have led to the implementation of national training programmes, the availability of self-harm services in accident and emergency departments throughout the country, a review of bereavement services and support for voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In light of the increased information around suicide and self harm, it has been agreed with the National Office for Suicide Prevention that an interim target of a 10% reduction in suicide be achieved by 2010.  In addition, it has been agreed that a 5% reduction in repeated self harm be achieved by 2010 and a further 5% reduction be achieved by 2016.  I know that tackling the problem is not easy but we simply must continue to strive relentlessly to prevent the further tragic loss of lives.</P>

	<P>The main aim of this campaign is to promote positive attitudes and a greater understanding of mental health issues.  We are also working on delivering the actions outlined in an all-island action plan on suicide prevention initiatives.  This plan acknowledges the benefits that can be achieved through North-South collaboration.  The Government is committed to the provision of quality care in mental health.  The current level of expenditure on mental health services has trebled since 1997.  The overall funding available in 2007 to support suicide prevention initiatives is &euro;8 million.</P>

	<P>An estimated &euro;1 billion is being spent on mental health services and <Col N="1670"/>services to suicidal and potentially suicidal people and their families.</P>
        <P>While clinical diagnosis of mental health problems is a matter for the appropriate health professionals, as the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, stated, schools have a vital role to play in suicide prevention.  Prevention must be addressed at whole school level through provision of relevant curricula for all children, through effective implementation of the social personal and health education programme, and through the provision of care afforded by a good pastoral system, including the capacity to respond appropriately to early signs of difficulty.  The development of self-esteem, general coping skills and personal effectiveness is the most appropriate way to help young people to deal with life pressures and stress.  It is clear that negotiating one&rsquo;s way from childhood through adolescence to adulthood requires the development of complex skills and values.</P>
        <P>They must be prepared not only for social and economic participation and lifelong learning, but also equipped with skills that will enable them to build positive and healthy relationships and friendships, promote responsible decision making, and support adult relationships and family and community commitments into the future.  Our students need to become confident, self-aware and open, and have the knowledge and understanding to navigate the world in which they live, and to negotiate their relationships with others.</P>
        <P>Since September 2003, social personal and health education is taught to all pupils in primary schools.  Its introduction was supported by a national programme of professional development for teachers.  Its aim is to foster personal development, health and well-being of children and to help them create and maintain supportive relationships and develop the skills and attitudes for responsible citizenship.  From the beginning of their primary schooling children learn, in an age appropriate way, how to identify, explore and express feelings and emotions, how to communicate with others, to resolve conflict and to respect difference, the importance of caring for one&rsquo;s body, treating oneself and others with dignity and respect, and how to identify people, places and situations that may threaten personal safety.</P>
        <P>Social personal and health education has also been compulsory in the junior cycle of post-primary schools since September 2003.  The modules at junior cycle deal specifically with belonging and integrating, handling conflict constructively, bullying, dealing with peer pressure, coping with stress, emotional health and well-being, influences on decision making, and relationships and sexuality education.  In third year, an awareness of the range of agencies who can help students in difficulty is promoted, as well as the skills of knowing when and how to seek help.</P><Col N="1671"/>
        <P>Social personal and health education is designed for implementation in the context of a caring whole-school approach supported by the pastoral care structures in schools.  Implementation of social, personal and health education in schools is assisted by a full-time support service which operates on an integrated basis in collaboration between the Department of Education and Science and the HSE.  A programme in social personal and health education for senior cycle is also currently being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>
        <P>Many schools also use Mental Health Matters, a resource pack on mental health for 14-18 year olds developed by Mental Health Ireland.  All post-primary schools are allocated guidance counselling hours by the Department of Education and Science.  Qualified guidance counsellors are trained to provide counselling support to students.  From the start of 2005-06 the schedule governing provision of guidance counsellors in schools improved, with the result that there are now almost 700 guidance staff employed in second level schools.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science funds the provision of ongoing professional support for guidance counsellors in their counselling work, through a counselling supervision service.  In addition, the Department provides funding for the professional development programmes of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors and its local branches.  Through this, guidance counsellors are provided with workshops on how to respond to critical incidents in schools.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention is also working with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors to support their members&rsquo; work in this area.</P>
        <P>In addition to guidance counsellors, class year tutors and home school liaison co-ordinators provide important assistance in promoting students&rsquo; well-being and in ensuring that potential difficulties can be identified early and that where necessary referral can be made to the appropriate health agencies.  NEPS has also developed an advice and information pack for schools on responding to critical incidents.  NEPS provides support and guidance to school staff who are dealing with the pupils on a daily basis.  When requested, the service is available for consultation and advice in regard to individual students causing concern.</P>
        <P>The Government is also keen to promote positive mental health through the youth sector.  In this regard, the national youth health programme, a partnership between the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, has been in operation for over ten years.  The programme has developed a range of health and well-being promotion initiatives in partnership with stakeholders such as the Rutland Centre, the HSE, the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and BelongTo.  It supports youth work organisations <Col N="1672"/>in dealing with mental health issues through training and policy and practice development.</P>
        <P>Applied suicide intervention skills training, known as the ASIST programme, has also been designed to help care-givers become more ready, willing and able to help persons at risk.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>

Interdepartmental co-operation between education and health has been prioritised and I intend to build on this in my role as Minister of State with responsibility in both Departments.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to speech and language therapy services.  Therapy services, including speech and language therapy, are provided by the HSE and it is envisaged the HSE will continue to provide these services.  An application for speech and language therapy should be made to the applicant&rsquo;s local health office in the HSE.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>A particular priority for the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates, including speech and language therapists to deal with the problem referred to by Deputy Stanton.  Additional courses in speech and language therapy were established in three universities.  University College Cork, National University Ireland Galway and University of Limerick established courses in speech and language therapy with an initial intake of 25 places on each course.</P>
        <P>The University of Limerick courses are at Masters level and the first cohort graduated in 2005.  The first cohort from the bachelor degree programmes in University College Cork and National University Ireland Galway graduated this year.  This investment represents an increase in training capacity of 320%, from 25 to 105 places, in speech and language therapy.  Demand for speech and language therapy in the health services is very significant, hence the substantial investment provided over the past number of years.</P>
        <P>The number of speech and language therapists employed in the public health service rose from 281 whole-time equivalents in 1997 to 648 whole-time equivalents at end December 2006, which is an increase of 131% over the period.  The Government is committed to further investment in disability services, via the multi-annual investment plan, and in primary care services.  These services will see further increases in the speech and language therapy resources available.</P><Col N="1673"/>
        <P>I wish to refer briefly to funding for people with disabilities.  Between 1997 and 2006, additional revenue and capital funding of &euro;851 million was invested in health-funded support services for people with disabilities.  Of this, &euro;549 million was provided for persons with intellectual disabilities and those with autism.  A sum of &euro;75 million for revenue purposes was provided for disability services in the 2007 budget.  Of this, &euro;41 million was provided for people with intellectual disabilities and those with autism.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Fine Gael Party for tabling this motion.  I agree with those who stated that this is an extremely important issue.  I share all the concerns expressed in the motion.  Deputy Stanton and I spent many hours in committee rooms debating every aspect of what became the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act with the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, in an attempt to ensure that we got matters right.  The Minister of State, Deputy Devins, did not have time to conclude his speech, but judging by what is stated at the end of the script, it seems that it will be 2010 before that legislation and the relevant parts of the Disability Act will be implemented in respect of older children up to the age of 18 and for adults.  While we try to get legislation right, its implementation seems to take an extraordinarily long time.</P>
        <P>Legislation is particularly important in this area in the context of the crucial importance of ensuring that young people receive it, as early as possible, when they need it.  Any parent whose child has a learning difficulty will state that they will do anything to obtain support for their child within the system as quickly and as early as possible.</P>
        <P>I recently attended a meeting with a special educational needs organiser, SENO, a parent and a school principal.  Everyone agreed that the child who was the subject of the meeting needed support, access to a special needs assistant and some additional hours with a resource teacher.  The only way the mother could procure the necessary intervention was to do so on a private basis.  Luckily enough she was able to scrape the money together to facilitate her child in this regard but even then she was informed by the SENO that a particular diagnosis, made by a certain type of medical specialist and indicating that her child had dyspraxia &mdash; her child may only have had a version of this condition &mdash; would have to be <Col N="1674"/>forthcoming before the required resource hours could be provided.</P>
        <P>People such as the woman to whom I refer spend a great deal of time dealing with the child and adolescent mental health services.  Those who do not fall into the categories of more common incidence are placed on waiting lists.  I recently raised the case of another child in my constituency whose parent was informed that they would be obliged to wait 20 months for access to the service.  During the 20-month period, the child, who is six years old, was not going to receive any support at his school.  When I contacted the services in my constituency, I was informed that there were 98 children on the waiting list for the east Limerick team and that the latter also receives many emergency referrals which must take priority, a point I accept.  I was further informed that attempts were being made to get a second team for east Limerick but that, to date, there has been no success in that regard.</P>
        <P>When I tabled a parliamentary question in respect of this matter I was informed that there are 3,598 children on the waiting list for the child and adolescent community child psychological services.  It is to the latter that parents trying to obtain support in schools must go.</P>
        <P>It is extraordinarily wrong that children who need support in school are obliged to go on these general lists &mdash; the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, might agree with me in this regard.  There are health and educational issues involved here which are being mixed together and this is not working.  Early intervention is crucial and I do not believe the system is serving the needs of children properly.  The Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children need to come together to see if a better system to provide support for children in schools can be arrived at.</P>
        <P>SENOs inform us that under the rules by which they must abide, they cannot provide support, even though they know it is needed.  At the meeting to which I referred, everybody agreed that the child in question needed support.  However, those responsible were not in a position to give it until the special diagnosis relating to the child was obtained.  This appears to be a crazy way to use scarce health resources.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Science has left the Chamber.  However, she is aware that when I served as my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on education I continually pointed out that the weighted model &mdash; she referred to it as the general allocation model &mdash; was simply wrong in terms of the provision of support within schools.  That model allocated support on the basis of numbers in a school rather than on the basis of the needs of the children.</P>
        <P>One of the delegates, a teacher at an inner city school in Dublin, at the Labour Party&rsquo;s conference last weekend pointed out that supports were given to areas such as Foxrock.  I apologise for singling out areas but the delegate highlighted <Col N="1675"/>that schools such as that in Foxrock were given two supports per 100 pupils and a special allocation of resource teachers.  The school in question might only have had a small number of children with special needs.  Schools in the inner city and in my constituency were given virtually the same allocation.  There was a slight increase as a result of disadvantaged area status but this did not amount to much.  There are large numbers of children in certain schools who need the support provided by resource teachers.  However, they do not receive it precisely because they attend these schools.  If they had been in other schools in more wealthy areas, they would have received them.  This represents a major disservice to children who need special educational supports and it is ultimately wrong.</P>
        <P>The general allocation model is not working.  In certain areas as many as one third of children have literacy and numeracy difficulties.  The schools they attend are obliged to approach the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to have assessments carried out.  If one is not in an area covered by NEPS, one is only entitled to two psychological assessments per 100 children.  That is not nearly enough for certain schools that deal with disadvantaged families, in which there is a high incidence of people requiring special needs support.  That is an absolute fact and studies were compiled by the Department of Education and Science to highlight it.  Despite the evidence, the weighted model is being pushed on the system.  This is a serious problem and it must be addressed.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to the area of suicide.  Deputy Neville walked out of the Chamber in disgust when it emerged that some of the ASIST programmes, to which the Minister of State referred, have been cancelled due to a shortage of funding.</P>

	<P>This is an issue of major importance.  Educational psychologists are well trained in a holistic way.  The Minister for Education and Science stated that if there is a bereavement or some other tragedy at a school, these psychologists are sent to assist.  However, <Col N="1676"/>we should aim at reaching a position where all schools have access to that kind of  holistic support for all their pupils.  If the latter were the case, we would be able to build a positive attitude and approach to mental health within schools.  Educational psychologists should not merely carry out assessments, they should be in a position to provide the broader supports that should be available in all schools.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity I have been given to speak on this matter.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I fully support the motion tabled by Fine Gael.  This is one of the most important issues we could possibly debate because early intervention is crucial when children have special learning needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan for sharing her time.  I welcome this motion and the opportunity to address the need for psychological services in our schools to be available to all who need them.  This is the critical point.  The Department of Education and Science must ensure that every child, regardless of where he or she goes to school, has quick access to an educational psychologist on the basis of need.  This is not happening.</P>
        <P>Certainly, the mechanism and the framework for providing such a service is in place.  The establishment of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, in 1999 was welcome and long overdue.  NEPS is tasked with providing psychological services in public and private primary and post-primary schools.  Its stated aim is to support the personal, social and educational development of all children through the application of psychological theory and practice in education.  The agency has particular responsibility for children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>It is worth recalling that the aims of NEPS are to provide direct contact and services to young people needing the support of an educational psychologist; provide a consultancy service aimed at developing competencies and the effective use of educational resources; develop a service model that caters for support and development, assessment and systems work; provide the Minister for Education and Science with advice and support and to influence educational policy; develop effective communication with other sections of the Department of Education and Science and other bodies that deliver services to children and follow the best practice in educational psychology in conducting research.</P>
        <P>The psychologists employed by NEPS are located in ten regions.  They work directly with a number of schools and their work includes engaging in individual casework with children and young people, providing a consultation service for teachers and parents, participating in school-based projects relevant to educational psychology and promoting mental health in schools.  NEPS is the mechanism for delivery and its aims and work <Col N="1677"/>programme are clearly set out.  However, it is hampered in its work due to the insufficient number of psychologists being recruited.  As a result, it is not fully operational and cannot reach its potential in terms of life-changing assistance for children.</P>
        <P>All the experts strongly assert that early intervention is vital.  With early diagnosis of special educational needs, intervention can be triggered and a child can make significant progress as a direct result.  That school children have to wait far too long to access educational psychologists is extremely damaging to their development.  American research shows that in 75% of cases where children with reading disabilities are not identified and provided with appropriate teaching interventions by the age of nine, their problems are likely to persist into their late teens and beyond.  Children having to wait more than two years to access speech and language therapy makes a mockery of Government commitments to early intervention.  Sadly, all of us in this House are aware of the terrible trauma these long delays create for caring parents who want to access essential supports for their child with special needs.</P>
        <P>Getting a child assessed proves extremely difficult for many parents.  Parents who can afford to do so must resort to expensive private psychological assessments and they do so in increasing numbers.  It is extremely unfair that the children of parents who cannot afford to obtain these expensive private assessments should have to suffer.  Charities are stepping into the void left by Government failure.  As Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan highlighted, the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul has privately funded more than 1,000 psychological assessments of children and young people.  This is an indictment of Government failure in this regard.</P>
        <P>School children deserve access to speedy assessments and this will only come when NEPS is adequately resourced.  Eight years after its inception, NEPS still does not have its promised 200 psychologists.  It will have to wait until 2009 to receive the full complement.  This means that many individual psychologists in its service are extremely overworked.  While parents have stated that the service provided is excellent, availability is inadequate and patchy.  Not enough assessments are carried out and more follow-up is required.  Children assessed in first class are not reviewed until fifth or sixth class and this is clearly inadequate.</P>
        <P>Children are precluded from being assessed due to the limited number of assessments annually.  The fact that not all children recommended to be assessed are seen results in children slipping through the net.  According to one estimate, 51% of schools do not have access to the service, which is an incredible statistic.  The number of children in primary schools is set to increase and the number of primary schools is increasing in major <Col N="1678"/>areas of growth and development in the State.  With this growth will come greater need for these services.  If the Government does not get its act together more and more children will fall behind.</P>
        <P>The Union of Students in Ireland, USI, pointed out that students with learning disabilities are being let down by the long waiting lists for psychological assessments.  Students with learning disabilities finish secondary school and enter third-level education without having received an up-to-date psychological assessment.  The USI also highlighted the implications of a new proposal by the disability advisers working network that students with a specific learning disability should be required to provide a psychological assessment carried out in the past three years to support their third-level CAO application.  As a result of the long waiting list for a State assessment, students would have no choice but to pay for an expensive private assessment should this new proposal be implemented.</P>
        <P>The USI also reported that students are being forced to wait for up to two years for a psychological assessment by the NEPS.  A student with learning disabilities who does not receive an up-to-date psychological assessment could miss out on critical educational supports.  Students deprived of a State assessment because of the waiting list could now face a financial penalty.  The USI stated: &ldquo;Requiring students with a specific disability to furnish a psychological assessment carried out in the past three years to support their college application would simply be the wrong way forward.&rdquo;  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, and the Minister for Education and Science give their views of this proposal by the disability advisers working network in their responses to this debate?</P>
        <P>I remind the House that in 2005, Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies tabled a Private Members&rsquo; motion on special educational needs.  It provoked an informative debate and, I hope, helped in some way to spur the Government on to further action as, I hope, will tonight&rsquo;s debate.  Replying to that debate the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, stated: &ldquo;In particular the Minister for Finance is obliged to have due regard to the State&rsquo;s duty to provide for an education appropriate to the needs of every child under the Constitution and the necessity to provide equity of treatment for all children.&rdquo;  That was a true statement and I hope it is applied to the forthcoming budget in terms of increased allocations for special needs education in general and the psychological assessment service in particular.</P>
        <P>It is imperative that the Government increases resources for NEPS, immediately employs additional psychologists and expands the service to all schools so that any child who requires an assessment gets one as soon as practicable.  Our children deserve no less.</P>

	<P>The decision by the European Union to remove a refund of almost 3.5 cent per litre of fuel used in passenger transport services will have a detrimental effect on private bus operators in rural areas and the passengers who use their services.  It will also add to the cost of bussing children to school.  The EU derogation which was sought by the Government will be discontinued at the end of the year.  Some of the people involved in the business report that the decision will put an additional burden of up to 10% on their costs.  The users of the services will have to pay for this.</P>
        <P>Problems also arise in respect of private bus owners.  While this rebate will apply to Bus &Eacute;ireann as well as to private carriers, many bus owners believe the level of subvention given by the Government allows CIE companies to mask the loss of the rebate whereas the full cost will be met by private operators.  I do not need to tell the D&aacute;il what will happen if competition is removed from the sector because we all know what private operators have done for bus transport.  Had they not existed, the cost of travel would be much higher.</P>
        <P>One of the criticisms made by private bus operators is that they only read about the decision in last week&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>.  For whatever reason, it was one of the most closely guarded secrets in the country.  It is hard to understand why the Government did not ensure the operators received adequate notice because the people directly in the eye of the storm should have been informed.  I call on the Minister for Transport to delay the decision for at least a year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s intention to remove fuel rebates on school contract work from 31 December 2007 came to the attention of private bus operators through an article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> on 4 November 2007.  The announcement, which came out of the blue, places private bus operators in a difficult financial situation, especially in light of enormous increases in fuel prices.  Operators are in the middle of a contract agreement with Bus &Eacute;ireann and the withdrawal of the fuel rebate puts them in a no man&rsquo;s land because the rebate was used as a bargaining tool when negotiating the contract.  The usual response from Bus &Eacute;ireann was that operators would always have <Col N="1680"/>the fuel rebate.  The fact that the company knew about the imminent removal of the rebate further infuriates the private operators, who were aware that the prices agreed were for a period to June 2008 and based on receiving 3.4533 cent per litre of a refund for fuel consumed on each contract.</P>
        <P>I received a number of letters from operators, one of whom states:</P>
        <P LI="1">We presently employ eight school bus drivers on our payroll and transport approximately 550 children daily to and from school.  The impact that this withdrawal will have for us will be devastating as we now have to operate for six months of 2008 without the rebate which we based our figures on initially, and which Bus &Eacute;ireann allowed us do, knowing full well that it was to be withdrawn.  This is coupled with the fact that we had to absorb the costs of the seat belt changes over the last few years but these were for the overall good of the school transport system unlike this present problem which will inevitably push operators out of the business.  The long term issue will be who will transport children to and from schools in the 2008-09 school year.</P>
        <P>Another operator wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">All of my prices and contracts for 2008 are based on this fuel rebate and they cannot be withdrawn.  My business will fail.  I do not know what I can do now with such short notice and I plead with you to make the strongest representation on my behalf to have this decision at least postponed to allow me seek alternative arrangements.  I have been put at a serious disadvantage also, as the State company, Bus &Eacute;ireann, were made aware of the removal of this rebate last year.  I employ two people and carry approximately 70 kids to school each day.  The removal of this refund, 3.4533 cent per litre, will make my business unsustainable and I will be forced to cease trading.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Another operator wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">All of my prices and contracts for 2008 are based on this fuel rebate and they cannot be withdrawn.  My business will be severely disadvantaged.  I don&rsquo;t know what I will do at such short notice and I plead with you to make the strongest representation on my behalf...I employ 20 drivers on a part time basis, and run numerous amount of tours from March to November each year.  The removal of this refund, 3.4533 cent per litre, will make my business unsustainable and I will be forced to lay off workers earlier in the season, and I might even be forced to cease trading.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to postpone the decision until June, when the contract ends.  That is reasonable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues, Deputies Deenihan and Connaughton, in high<Col N="1681"/>lighting the need for the Minister for Transport to outline his plans to alleviate the hardship caused by the sudden removal of the refund of excise duty on fuel used in passenger transport services, which will seriously impact on the private transport industry and lead to increased fares and the closure of many businesses.</P>
        <P>It is outrageous that a plan to remove a tax relief worth &euro;29 million to public and private bus operators in order to comply with an EU directive should be kept from the private bus industry.  Every effort was made to keep them in the dark.  Shame on the Minister and his colleagues for creating a situation whereby private operators accidentally discovered that the rebate was to be removed.  So much for transparency and openness.  The Minister has placed the private transport industry in a grave situation, yet the Government is once again hiding its head in the sand.</P>
        <P>I have been approached by a number of private bus operators in Longford-Westmeath who were devastated by the news which came to them by rumour rather than direct communication from the Government.  Of course, the Government did not fail to make the situation clear to CIE, which has the ability to hold an entire city to ransom.  The private sector is the only sector that will suffer from the removal of the refund of excise duty on fuel used in passenger transport service.  The removal of the tax relief will be cost neutral to CIE and the Exchequer but the private transport sector will bear the brunt as its costs cannot be absorbed.  Many companies will be forced out of business.  They were not even given the courtesy of official notification by the Government.  These companies have benefitted from the lower rate of excise duty of 2.3 cent per litre of fuel compared with the EU&rsquo;s minimum rate of 30.2 cent.  Removal of tax relief will result in an increase in the price of a litre of diesel and impact on operational costs, which will be reflected in increased fares and excessive operational costs.  Can the Minister of State even begin to imagine the panic among private bus operators who have already signed contracts for 2008, having agreed rates for schools and set fare levels on scheduled services which reflect the refund of excise duty?  Much of the fault lies with the usual passing of the buck between Departments.  The Department of Finance has stated that the EU viewed the fuel excise derogation as a form of state aid and there is now no tax solution.  It has transferred the matter to Transport where, if there is any justice, it will force the resignation of the Minister &mdash; it is more likely to fade from sight.</P>
        <P>The removal of tax relief would be a death sentence for private coach operators and would deliver an appalling blow to rural communities, particularly those in remote areas who do not have regular public services and rely heavily on private coach companies.  Shame on the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I speak on behalf of the Minister for Transport.  The Government is aware of the importance of the fuel duty rebate scheme for passenger bus transport services.  The current scheme is a matter, in the first instance, for the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The background to this issue is that the 2003 EU energy tax directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of members states.  In the Irish context, these derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for scheduled public and private bus services and bus tour services.  While the derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland and other member states sought retention of their derogations beyond that date.  However, the European Commission, the deciding authority, has refused all such requests.  The Commission maintains that, in keeping with the EU energy tax directive, member states must apply at least the EU minimum rates of excise on fuels in such circumstances and any further favourable excise treatment is not allowable.  The Commission&rsquo;s decision was published on its website in March 2007.  I understand the Minister for Finance will avail of the forthcoming Finance Bill to provide for the necessary legislative changes to conform with the directive.</P>
        <P>As I stated, the Government is aware of the importance of the fuel duty rebate scheme for the passenger bus transport sector.  With this in mind officials from the Department of Transport are engaging with officials from the Department of Finance to explore the possibility of replacing the scheme, where appropriate, by alternative non-tax financial support mechanisms to achieve the same policy objectives, subject to EU state aid requirements.  I understand that in the interim the reduced rates applicable to fuel used for public transport services will be maintained.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to speak on this topic concerning orphanages in Bulgaria.  Although not immediately significant to this Parliament, this is an incredibly important and tragic issue which requires the greatest possible airing.</P>
        <P>Some Deputies may have seen a BBC documentary on Sunday entitled &ldquo;Bulgaria&rsquo;s Abandoned Children&rdquo;.  It was made by film-maker Kate Blewett who last year visited the Mogilino social care home to investigate the conditions in which the children are kept.  I am not exaggerating when I say that this is one of the most disturbing programmes I have ever seen.  The circumstances shown in the film appear to be replicated throughout Bulgaria and I understand <Col N="1683"/>similar conditions obtain in at least 11 other orphanages.</P>
        <P>I bring the issue to the attention of the House to ask what we can do.  I cannot sit idly by without trying to publicise this issue.  There are 75 children living at Mogilino, ranging from toddlers to teenagers approaching their 20s.  Many have been abandoned to the orphanage because they have severe mental disabilities with which their parents simply could not cope.  Others are affected by mild and treatable cases of cerebral palsy.  Some were blind or deaf when they entered the orphanage.  Many of the children at Mogilino cannot speak and they are neither taught nor spoken to.  They cannot interact with each other or their carers whose job does not appear to extend beyond washing and feeding the children.  It is clear that not much caring takes place.</P>
        <P>The children are considered incapable of being educated and receive no treatment for their disabilities.  While they are diagnosed on admission to the facility, their diagnoses are not re-evaluated at any point during their lengthy stay.  Even the children with the mildest forms of disability degenerate quickly.  They rock endlessly in chairs, bereft of any mental stimulation, and many are heavily sedated.  They all appear to be malnourished and many sit on potties all day because it is easier for their carers to leave them in this position.  Their limbs resemble those of children in famine-torn African countries.</P>
        <P>One 18 year old girl who broke her leg was filmed lying curled up in a ball in bed.  Her condition was not noticed until the television crew asked her what her problem was and only then did she received medical attention.  Another child, a young boy, walked only when led by the hand by a carer.  If the carer moved away from him, he stood motionless until the carer returned.</P>
        <P>An 18 year old girl named Didi who has mild cerebral palsy initially wrote letters to her mother but these were never posted.  She also interacted with the television crew in a typically lively teenage fashion.  However, when the television crew returned eight months after initially meeting her, she had become a mute child who had adopted the rocking motion practised by all the other children.  I was equally concerned by a scene in the programme where two male carers supervised a group of adolescent women, many of whom were fully developed physically, as they showered.  This occurred in a home staffed almost entirely by females.</P>
        <P>It is not an exaggeration to say that domestic animals are treated better than the unfortunate boys and girls in the Mogilino home who are condemned to rock silently while they slowly waste away in mind and body.  Nothing on television this year has brought me closer to tears.</P>
        <P>What can Ireland do about this case?  How has Europe permitted this to happen while allowing Bulgaria to enter the European Union?  Will we <Col N="1684"/>turn away from this pain and suffering?  I hope not.  We all remember watching similar scenes from Romania 20 years ago.  The scenes I describe are taking place in 2007 in Bulgaria, a member state of the European Union.  I ask the Government to take action in this matter.  It should contact Ms Kate Blewett who is setting up a charity known as Bulgaria&rsquo;s abandoned children&rsquo;s trust to campaign for immediate changes to address the plight of the children in the Mogilino orphanage.  Bulgaria is a European country with a population of more than 8 million in which one in every 50 children is growing up in an institution.  As Kate Blewett stated in the television programme, it is not a destitute, war-torn or famine-stricken country.  Many of the large number of Irish people who visit Bulgaria as tourists buy apartments there.  Our role must be to try to influence the Bulgarian authorities and, more important, the Bulgarian people.  I sincerely hope action will be taken on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I share the deep concern and disquiet provoked by the recent BBC documentary &ldquo;Bulgaria&rsquo;s Abandoned Children&rdquo;.  The large number of children resident in state-run institutions in Bulgaria is a difficult legacy of past policies and attitudes.  This sad reality must now be addressed and further reforms must be made to protect a particularly vulnerable section of society.</P>
        <P>The Bulgarian authorities have been working on the issue for some time.  It was a topic of concern that formed part of discussions during Bulgaria&rsquo;s negotiations for EU accession.  While some progress was made before accession, concerns were expressed by the European Commission and member states regarding areas where further actions are required.  In particular, concerns have been expressed regarding living and sanitary conditions in many institutions.  The Deputy can be assured that the EU continues to support the process within Bulgaria to reform this sector.  Next year, some &euro;5 million of EU Structural Funds will be directed towards the development of alternative care arrangements for children such as those featured in the documentary.</P>
        <P>We have been told that the Bulgarian Ministry of Labour and Social Policy is committed to closing the institution mentioned in the documentary and similar ones that still exist in Bulgaria.  Since 2001, the number of children in them has decreased by over 30% to approximately 8,500.  Of course, this figure is still too high.  Ideally the type of care to be provided involves finding relatives or foster families to look after these children.  Placing them within a safe, reliable and family oriented environment must be the goal.  This need is recognised by the Bulgarian authorities.</P><Col N="1685"/>
        <P>A group of non-governmental organisations, working together with UNICEF, the Bulgarian Association for the Protection of People with Disabilities, and the Bulgarian authorities, have drawn up an action plan to deal with the situation at the Mogilino institution.  Medical evaluations of the children have been carried out and a group of specialists have provided some basic training to the staff.  They plan to assess the needs of the children and provide an alternative form of care.  The orphanage will be closed and specialist care provided by the creation of smaller group homes.</P>
        <P>A special screening of the documentary took place in Sofia last week and was attended by a representative of our embassy.  Attendance at the event also included representatives of the Bulgarian Government, members of civil society, academics, social workers, journalists and foreign diplomats.  Children with disabilities and their families also attended.  Following the screening of the film, there was wide-ranging debate on the issue.  There was general recognition that a quick-fix to the problem is not realistic and that closing the particular institution in question immediately would simply shift the problem elsewhere.</P>
        <P>The solution must be well thought out, lead to change across the system and have the interests of the children as the driving force behind it.  I understand that contributions made by representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, and the Ministry of the Interior, indicated their strong support for continuing to work with the NGO sector to bring about real change.</P>
        <P>Our embassy in Sofia has regular contact with organisations working to improve the living conditions of the children and young adults in such institutions.  A number of Irish citizens and organisations are also involved and the embassy supports them in their work where possible.  Over the past five years, the Government has supported NGOs active in Bulgaria in the protection of children at risk and the rehabilitation of people with intellectual disabilities.  Organisations supported include the Bulgarian Association for People with Intellectual Disabilities.</P>
        <P>The Deputy can be assured that we will continue to remain engaged and to encourage the implementation of the important reform process.  Our embassy has been instructed to seek a meeting at senior level with the Bulgarian Ministry of Labour and Social Policy to convey our concerns and to get an update on the situation.  It will also inform the Bulgarian authorities of the strong public interest in Ireland, and across the EU, in seeing a dramatic improvement in the standards of care given to orphaned or abandoned children in Bulgaria.</P>

	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this important issue and to see the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science here.  He can imagine the <Col N="1686"/>frustration and anger of the board of management of Ballyea, given the fact it has spent almost &euro;200,000 on a temporary site and should have had prefabricated portacabin buildings in place for September. </P>
        <P>The first application for a new school in Ballyea was made approximately eleven years ago and the board has worked hard since to get that school in place.  I will not go into the history of the application because the Department has that information.  However, I want to hear tonight when the construction of this badly needed school will commence.  I do not want to hear that all building projects have been put on hold while waiting confirmation of the budget allocation from the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>The Ballyea project had gone further than any other project.  I raised the issue in a parliamentary question last week and was told the tender report was currently under examination, but my information from the Department is that the tender report has been approved and a contractor has almost been appointed.  Somebody is misleading someone with regard to the Ballyea project and the result is that nothing has happened since last September with regard to the putting in place of the temporary school that should have been set up.  The local board of management has entered a lease agreement with the local GAA club for 12 months for the use of the car park, facilities have been put in place and &euro;200,000 has been spent, but nothing has happened with regard to provision of the buildings.  The board is frustrated and angry about this and has been in constant contact with the Department in an effort to find a resolution.</P>
        <P>Deputy Carey and I want confirmation of a date from the Department tonight as to when the project will commence.  It should have begun in September, but unfortunately it did not.  Is it the case that the Department has overspent and there are no further funds?  If so, why was a supplementary budget not put in place to meet this demand?  I am angry about the situation and want a  commencement date from the Department.</P>

	<P>Ballyea national school is in my parish.  The current school was designed to cater for three class groups, essentially 75 to 85 pupils.  As of September 2007, the school has 159 pupils.  There is an overcrowding crisis in the school.  Ballyea is a rapidly expanding area on the outskirts of Ennis and has a genuine need for a new school.  The board of management, parents, staff and children first submitted an application for extra school accommodation eleven years ago.</P>
        <P>After many delays, the new school got full sanction from the Department of Education and Science.  This decision was greeted with delight by the residents of Ballyea.  The promise of a new school made it easier for staff and pupils to continue to deal with the dreadful overcrowding problems.  The development of a new school <Col N="1687"/>requires the demolition of the existing school and temporary accommodation must be provided.  The local GAA club has given permission for the use of its car park for the development of the temporary accommodation.</P>
        <P>Now, however, the news has come that funding has been suspended.  To date, &euro;200,000 from the public purse has been spent on the development of the temporary site.  The board of management of Ballyea national school has been in constant contact with the Department to get final approval for buying the portacabins, but it has encountered major problems.  I want some good news for my fellow parishioners and the people of Ballyea.  Will the Minister of State inform us tonight that funding will be provided immediately to Ballyea?  It is outrageous that this project has been put on hold.  We have been waiting eleven years for it to come to fruition.  Give us the money and let the project proceed.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputies for giving me the opportunity to outline my Department&rsquo;s position regarding the provision of a new school premises at the location referred to by them.  The proposed project involves the construction of a new two-storey eight classroom generic repeat design school, preceded by associated decanting works to facilitate the main project.  Planning per<Col N="1688"/>mission and a fire certificate have been obtained and the tender report for the project is being examined by my Department&rsquo;s building unit.</P>
        <P>Under the National Development Plan &euro;4.5 billion is assigned to the capital requirements of the primary and post-primary sectors.  More than &euro;540 million will be spent this year on school buildings.  The level of construction alone in the primary and post-primary sectors in 2007 is such that it will deliver more than 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for approximately 17,500 pupils.  The progression of all large-scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction is considered on an on-going basis in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme in which the main focus is to deliver school places within rapidly developing areas.  The progression of the school referred to by the Deputies will be considered in this context, as is the case with all large-scale projects.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputies that the Department is committed to providing suitable high quality accommodation for the school in question at the earliest possible date.</P>

	<P>The most recent Consumer Price Index figures show that in the 12 months to <Col N="1690"/>October 2007,  the category of goods classed as &ldquo;fuels and lubricants&rdquo; has increased in price by 7 per cent, with its component parts &mdash; petrol, diesel and motor oil  &mdash; increasing by 7.5 per cent, 5 per cent and 6.2 per cent respectively, while liquid fuels (which would include home heating oil) have increased by 8.5 per cent over the same period. It should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol and other oil products and away from other VAT liable spending, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.</P>

	<P>I have stated previously that taxation can play a part in attaining environment objectives which includes promoting energy efficiency and reducing emissions. Using taxation as a mechanism to subsidise activity that yields overall benefits to the economy has been a tool used by successive administrations, often delivering very positive results.</P>
        <P>In order to promote the development of biofuels in Ireland, I provided for an appropriate excise relief scheme in Finance Act 2006. Under the scheme, biofuels produced under approved projects are exempt from excise duty.  This serves to reduce the additional costs associated with the production of biofuels and consequently allows them compete with conventional fossil fuels.</P>
        <P>With regard to whether this approach represents a cost effective way of reducing emissions, I would point out that this relief is in place for a period of five years to assist in the development of a domestic biofuels industry.  Long-term <Col N="1691"/>general excise reliefs are not anticipated.  In this regard the Deputy might wish to note that there are additional non-fiscal measures that can be used to promote biofuels. To provide further market certainty and encourage projects of scale, the Government has signalled its intention to move to a Biofuels Obligation by 2009 which will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual sales. The &lsquo;obligation&rsquo; will fall under the remit of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Prior to 1999 the remuneration of chief executive officers of commercial State bodies was set by the relevant Ministers on the basis of recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  In 1998, on foot of recommendations from the Review Body, the Government adopted new arrangements for setting the remuneration of these posts.  Management consultants were asked to review the pay of these posts based on comparison with similar posts in the private sector.  The recommended rates were approved by the Government in 1999.</P>
        <P>Remuneration for CEOs could be set by the boards of their companies within the range of 80% of the median identified by the consultants to the median.    In addition, CEOs were eligible to take part in a performance-related pay scheme with maximum bonus not exceeding 25% of salary.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?><P>The Government again commissioned management consultants to size the chief executive positions of all the commercial State bodies by reference to comparable positions in the private sector and rank them according to job score.  Based on <Col N="1693"/>an analysis of rates across the private sector for jobs of comparable size, the consultants identified median rates for the various job score levels.  The Government have now considered the conclusions of the report and decided that:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the boards of commercial State companies will be informed of the recommendations of the consultants and the relevant Ministers and the T&aacute;naiste will as appropriate consider proposals in relation to  the pay of Chief Executives on the basis of the findings of the Hay Report. Where increased rates on foot of this report come to be applied, these will in due course be published in the annual accounts of the bodies concerned.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the pay of chief executives of commercial State bodies should continue to be fixed within a range running from 80% of the market median identified by Hay to the median.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />where higher rates already apply in a limited number of cases, there will be no change to existing rates.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />from 2008 the maximum possible annual performance bonus should be increased from 25% to 35% of basic pay reflecting the significant increase in the performance-related element in the remuneration package of private sector chief executives of comparable companies. Of this a minimum of 10% of basic pay should be applied to a multi-annual, e.g. three or four year, bonus scheme related to multi-annual objectives, subject to the overall maximum of 35% of salary per year over the period. The existing conditions governing the operation of performance-related pay schemes for CEOs will continue to apply. These are that the performance criteria for each body should be drawn up by the board in consultation with the relevant Government Department and should have regard to the specific requirements of the appropriate Minister as shareholder. The performance-related system should be implemented by a remuneration committee of the board, which should include a civil servant from the appropriate Department, whether he or she is a member of the board or not, who would represent the Minister&rsquo;s requirements as shareholder. Even following this increase in the maximum potential performance bonus for State company CEOs, performance bonuses of many private sector chief executives will still be considerably higher.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my response to Parliamentary Question No. 54 which I answered on 1 November this year.  In that response I pointed out that the Programme for Government is a five year programme in which a number of guiding principles in relation to economic and budgetary matters have been set out.</P>
        <P>At the time, I also pointed out that the Pre-Budget Outlook, which set out my Department&rsquo;s latest budgetary and economic assessment for 2007 and the coming three years, had been published in mid-October.</P>
        <P>The Pre-Budget Outlook is based on the technical assumption of providing for the existing level of public services. It also specifically provides for, in the aggregate, the capital commitments required to deliver the National Development Plan; and includes a technical indicative unallocated current provision. The Pre-Budget Outlook sets out a technical budgetary position for the coming three years. On that basis, it is forecast that the General Government position will be in deficit at -0.4 per cent of GDP in both 2008 and 2009 before returning to a balanced position in 2010. This fiscal position is predicated on a weaker economic outlook than generally expected earlier in the year when the Programme was agreed. Based on information as at end-September, my Department&rsquo;s assessment is that GDP growth will average 3&frac12; per cent over the period 2008-2010. I will, as is the norm, give details of the latest economic and budgetary view on Budget Day.</P>
        <P>I believe that the Pre-Budget Outlook is another important step in the budgetary process which will be a unified process this year. The next step, which is ongoing, is the formulation and agreement by Government of spending and taxation plans for 2008. These will be presented to the House on Budget day which is 5 December next.  At that time, I will announce the first instalment of this Government&rsquo;s delivery of the agreed Programme for Government and as is the norm the Budget measures will be costed in the usual comprehensive fashion.</P>
        <P>As I have said previously, the Programme for Government is a five year programme.  Budget 2008 will be the first instalment of the delivery of this Programme.</P>

	<P>I have received many representations regarding the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme. This scheme provides relief from VAT and Vehicle Registration Tax (up to a certain limit) on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, as well as relief from excise on the fuel used in the car, up to a certain limit.</P>
        <P>The disability criteria for these concessions are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. To get a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of these Regulations.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there was an interdepartmental review of the Scheme.

	<P>At Budget time I forecast that inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) would average 4.1 per cent for 2007. The most recent inflation figures  released by the Central Statistics Office are for October and show CPI inflation running at an annual rate of 4.8 per cent.</P>
        <P>On foot of the information available at end September, I published a revised set of economic forecasts in the Pre-Budget Outlook, which forecast that the increase in the CPI in 2007 would average 4.9 per cent for the year as a whole.</P>
        <P>By far the largest contributor to inflation as measured by the CPI over the last two years has been mortgage interest rate increases. Mortgage interest rate increases account for about 2 per cent of the current annual rate of CPI inflation of 4.8 per cent &mdash; so that excluding mortgage interest rates from the CPI would  result in an inflation rate of 2.8 per cent. There have been seven interest rate increases by the European Central Bank since December 2005, which have doubled the Bank&rsquo;s rate to 4 per cent. These increases have of course been passed on by the lenders here. The ECB sets its rates independently of the euro area governments.</P>
        <P>The Budget day forecast for the rate of Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) inflation &mdash; the EU inflation measure &mdash; was 2.6 per cent. In the Pre-Budget Outlook the revised forecast for HICP inflation in 2007 was 2.8 per cent.</P><Col N="1696"/>
        <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to those families whose main or only source of income is derived from social welfare payments, and perhaps also to families whose income earners could be classified as low paid.</P>
        <P>While many of those families encompassed by the terms social welfare dependent and low income would not hold mortgages, it is estimated, based on Census 2006 figures, that only approximately 40 per cent of households hold mortgages. That 40 per cent can avail of mortgage interest relief, which currently applies at 20 per cent and to a ceiling of &euro;8,000 single or &euro;16,000 married for first time buyers for the initial seven years of their mortgage, and &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000 for all others.  The current level of mortgage interest relief for married first time buyers is sufficient to cover the interest arising on a mortgage of up to approximately &euro;321,500 over 33 years at an interest rate of 5.0 per cent, which is well above the average mortgage.</P>
        <P>In my time as Minister for Finance, I  have consistently placed improving the position of the less well off at the top of my priorities. An example of this can be seen in respect of Budget 2007, which included social welfare increases ranging from over 8 per cent to over 12 per cent in weekly rates. Thus, even when compared with the revised inflation forecasts contained in the Pre-Budget Outlook, I have ensured that those in receipt of, and reliant upon, social welfare payments will have seen real net gains in 2007.</P>
        <P>The changes to the tax system introduced by both myself and my predecessor, over the last 10 years, have ensured that all those on the minimum wage are exempt from tax in 2007. This means that almost 868,000 earners; that is almost two out of every five earners, are outside the tax net, as compared to 380,000, or one in four, in 1997. In addition, the income of the average worker in 2007 is not liable to the higher rate of tax.</P>
        <P>Successive Governments&rsquo; policies over the last ten years have focused on helping to ensure that families on low incomes are protected from the effect of inflation.</P>

        <P>While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, who are the deciding authority, have to date refused all such requests.  The Commission maintain that, in keeping with the EU Energy Tax Directive, Member States must apply at least the EU minimum rates of excise on fuels in such circumstances and that any further favourable excise treatment is not allowable. In this regard the Commission&rsquo;s decision was published to its website in March 2007. At the Commission&rsquo;s behest my officials have indicated that Ireland will avail of the forthcoming Finance Bill to make the necessary legislative changes to conform with the Directive.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, the relevant line Departments who have primary responsibility in this regard are, in conjunction with my Department, exploring alternative non-tax support mechanisms that could be put in place where appropriate to maintain the assistance currently being provided, subject of course to compatibility with EU State Aid requirements. In the interim the reduced rates applicable to fuel used will be maintained.	</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under Section 124 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, stamp duty of &euro;40 is chargeable in respect of credit card accounts and charge cards maintained by a financial institution at any time during the twelve month period ending on 1 April in each year (referred to as the year of charge).  In the case of credit cards, the duty is levied on the account and in the case of charge cards it is levied on the card.  In accordance with the legislation, Stamp Duty is not chargeable in respect of &lsquo;store cards&rsquo; cards.</P>
        <P>I am advised that Revenue is not aware of credit cards or charge cards, operating in precisely the same manner as those liable for stamp duty, but where duty has not been levied.

The Pre-Budget Outlook published last month, which contains forecasts updated to take into account developments up to end September 2007, projected growth rates of 4<?oasys _fr3,4- ?>% in GDP terms and 4<?oasys _fr1,4- ?>% in GNP terms for 2007. The revision to growth is as a result of weaker domestic demand, mainly due to developments in the new housing market, where completions are now likely to be lower than initially assumed. As is the norm an updated economic view will be given when I present my Budget to the House on 5th December next.</P>

	<P>The Revenue Commissioners are dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion and are very effectively using the additional powers they have been given in recent years.  For example, Revenue special investigations, capitalising on the powers given in the Finance Act 1999 and subsequent legislation, have yielded a total of &euro;2.4 billion to date. Revenue&rsquo;s normal audit programme each year also continues to recover significant tax, interest and penalties and these successes are reflected in the settlements revealed in the published quarterly defaulters lists.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their high level of success in securing settlements is also the result of a more sophisticated and targeted approach on their part to focus its audit and enforcement resources on those areas where they are needed most.  An associated strategy is to minimise the number of contacts with largely compliant taxpayers. Accordingly, as Revenue&rsquo;s audit selection is now increasingly targeted at areas of highest risk, the level of published settlements must be seen in that context and it would be wrong to draw any conclusions from the published lists (which still include a number of &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; investigation cases) about the current level of tax evasion.</P>
        <P>I am further advised by Revenue that tax compliance generally is improving.  This is partly attributable to lower rates of direct taxation and partly due to the highly visible success of Revenue&rsquo;s special investigations and ongoing audit and enforcement programmes, backed up by appropriate powers.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 108 together.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that mortgage interest relief is applied at source since 1st January 2002.  Under this scheme, a borrower applies for tax relief on a self-declaration basis. The relevant institution then confirms the existence of the loan and once approved by Revenue, the lender, in most instances, reduces the monthly mortgage repayment by the correct amount of tax relief as instructed by Revenue. Revenue in turn credits the lender with the sum of the tax reliefs applied.</P>
        <P>A qualifying loan for the purpose of mortgage interest relief is a secured loan, which must be used solely for the purchase, repair, development or improvement of a principal private residence. Where a part of a loan is used for any other purpose, only the percentage relevant to the principal private residence qualifies for mortgage interest relief.</P>
        <P>There are a number of facets to the comprehensive compliance programme operated by Revenue part of it focused on the lenders and part of it focused on the mortgage holders.</P>
        <P>There are 15 main lenders registered to operate tax relief at source, with additional institutions, for example Credit Unions, administering a small number of mortgage loans. In 2003, a programme of compliance visits to main lenders was initiated. The purpose of these visits is to ensure that each lender is administering the TRS system in accordance with the provisions laid out in Section 244A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and with agreed operational guidelines. The compliance visit will also ensure that the tax relief is applied to the correct mortgage account correctly and at the earliest opportunity. To date, all major mortgage lenders have been subjected to compliance visits for tax relief at source. Sixteen such compliance visits have been undertaken by Revenue since 2003.</P>
        <P>In relation to individual mortgage holders, while Revenue examines all applications for mortgage interest relief at application stage, the &ldquo;qualifying loan&rdquo; condition as defined above operates largely on a presumption of honesty basis in accordance with Revenue&rsquo;s Customer Charter, based on a declaration by the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>All loans are also monitored through the monthly electronic exchange with the mortgage providers and where difficulties or concerns are identified by Revenue these are followed through. As part of the overall compliance programme, interventions are also targeted at and through the lenders whereby a selection of individual mortgage accounts are examined in detail <Col N="1701"/>during the visits to the lenders already alluded to. I am advised by Revenue that in the region of 50 to 80 accounts &mdash; depending on the size of the institution &mdash; are selected for intervention in each compliance visit with the lenders. While the majority of accounts are and have been found to be fully qualifying accounts, a small number require some adjustment to their mortgage interest entitlement and this is subsequently addressed by Revenue with the mortgage holder in each instance.</P>
        <P>Since January 2007 and building on the risk assessment made by Revenue from the compliance activities already referred to, and taking account of the increase in the ceiling on mortgage interest relief for first time and non-first time buyers from 1 January 2007 a further element of the compliance campaign now involves direct engagement with the mortgage holder. The purpose of this element of the programme is to identify potential higher risk cases that may not be fully in compliance with the terms of the tax relief at source scheme and, where necessary to apply appropriate measures to bring such cases into compliance, including the withdrawal of relief and the recovery of any monies due to Revenue.  In this element of the overall compliance programme so far in 2007, Revenue selected 2,133 cases for detailed review. That review has been concluded in 1859 cases. Revenue has withdrawn all the tax relief in 6% of the cases concluded and additional 8% of claims have had the percentage of the loan qualifying for relief reduced. The total value of the relief in those cases is &euro;67,638 of which &euro;28,015 has already been recovered. No cases have to date been referred for prosecution as a result of this element of the compliance programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s system of financial regulation is based largely on a comprehensive and detailed EU template and conforms to international best-practice standards.  The role of the Minister for Finance as regards financial regulation is to develop policy and bring forward proposals to the Oireachtas for the regulation of the financial services sector.  Once that legislation has been enacted, the task of implementing and applying it on a day-to-day basis rests with the Financial Regulator, which is independent of the Minister in the exercise of its statutory functions.</P>
        <P>The remit of the Financial Regulator is quite broad and covers a wide range of financial service activities. These are usually considered under three main categories; firstly, there are credit institutions &mdash; which comprise banks and building societies; secondly, there is securities activity; and thirdly, there is insurance, which also covers reinsurance activities.</P>
        <P>All in all the Financial Regulator supervises more than 10,000 financial service providers of varying size and nature, including banking, insurance, collective investment, asset management firms, as well as credit unions, exchanges, retail intermediaries etc.</P>
        <P>Credit institutions are defined in accordance with EU Directives as any institution which accepts deposits or other repayable funds from the public and grants credit for its own account. Such institutions must be authorised and approved by the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>There are, of course, certain institutions which do not accept deposits from the public but which make loans from their own resources and these do not require a licence from the Financial Regulator. In so far as such entities engage in retail lending to the public, the Deputy will be aware that, Section 19 of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007 amended Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997 to provide for a system of authorisation and regulation of retail credit firms and home reversion providers. The primary purpose of this amendment was to extend to customers of these firms the benefit of the protections provided for in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.</P><Col N="1703"/>
        <P>There are also non-deposit-taking lenders who do not engage in retail lending but who lend to commercial entities or sophisticated borrowers and these are not subject to supervision by the Financial Regulator under the relevant European Directives.  Such companies that trade under Irish Company Law are subject to the general corporate governance requirements of that legislation.</P>
        <P>As regards overseas property developments, the position is that my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will bring forward the Property Services Regulatory Authority Bill in 2008. The Bill will provide for the licensing of all property services providers, including all those involved in the sale and letting of property wherever it is located.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Ecofin Council, at its meeting on 9 October last, decided on a preliminary set of issues to be analysed and addressed following recent financial market developments.  This review is to be undertaken by the Commission and the EU&rsquo;s Financial Services Committee on which Ireland is represented.  The work carried out on this review and its conclusions will be important inputs to the process of ensuring that the EU regulatory system remains aligned with financial market developments.</P>

	<P>The Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO), established in April 2005 to deal with consumer complaints about financial service providers, has made a very significant contribution to protecting and promoting the interests of consumers of financial services. Where a complaint is upheld the Financial Services Ombudsman can direct the financial service provider to pay compensation to the complainant for any loss, expense or inconvenience sustained by the com<Col N="1705"/>plainant and can also issue directions to the financial services provider concerned to change a practice relating to its conduct. To end September 2007 the Financial Services Ombudsman has received 10,463 complaints and has concluded 9,608 cases, 60% of which were settled in the complainants favour.</P>
        <P>The role and functions of the FSO in dealing with consumer complaints strongly complements that of the Financial Regulator in protecting the interests of consumers of financial services as a whole. During the passage of the FSO legislation through the Oireachtas in 2004 it was stated, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, that the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit essentially is to deal with individual complaints from customers of financial institutions and it is the responsibility of the Consumer Director in the Financial Regulator to deal with general issues relating to the protection of consumers.</P>
        <P>The relevant legislation provides for co-operation between the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator on general issues relating to the protection of consumers. A Memorandum of Understanding has been concluded between the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator to ensure the efficient and effective handling of complaints.  An issue drawing attention to a general breach affecting consumers can be referred by the Financial Services Ombudsman to the Financial Regulator. Such issues can then be examined by the Financial Regulator to consider if there are any suspected breaches of the relevant regulatory requirements including the Consumer Protection Code. The Financial Regulator can, as part of its administrative sanctions regime, seek to mediate or take regulatory action in relation to a firm including an order to make refunds to a firms&rsquo; customers where appropriate.</P>
        <P>A recent High Court judgement confirmed in that context that the Financial Services Ombudsman&rsquo;s power of direction, except in relation to a change in general practice, may only relate to an individual claimant and does not extend to payment of compensation for other consumers in relation to similar conduct of the financial service provider.  The FSO and Financial Services Ombudsman Council have asked me to review the implications of the recent High Court decision and to consider if a change in legislation is warranted.  I propose to refer this issue to the Advisory Forum on Financial Legislation which has recently commenced its work to consolidate and modernise legislation governing financial services regulation. In the interim my Department is asking the FSO and the Financial Regulator to review their current co-operation arrangements to ensure that these work smoothly where a finding of the FSO in an individual case may have implications for a broader group of customers of a financial services firm.</P><Col N="1706"/>
        <P>Of course, it is open to individuals in similar cases to that dealt with in the recent High Court case to make their own individual complaints to the Ombudsman.</P>

	<P>The most recent assessment of the financial markets was reflected in the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s Financial Stability Report published last week. The Report states that, when assessed by the usual indicators of financial health such as asset quality, profitability, solvency, liquidity and credit ratings, the stability and health of the Irish banking system remains robust. The Bank&rsquo;s central expectation is that the Irish banking system is well placed to withstand pressures from possible economic and sectoral developments in the short to medium term. The Bank&rsquo;s Report notes that the strength of the Irish economy continues to support the stability of the financial system.</P>
        <P>In terms of output, the Deputy will note that forecasts for the Irish economy show that progress achieved in recent years is being consolidated. In the Pre-Budget Outlook, average GDP growth for the period 2008 to 2010 of 3&frac12; per cent was forecast by my Department. Although we are in a period of uncertainty, with growth in the short term set to moderate below that of recent years, the aggregate growth rate will still remain favourable in international terms.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will recall that my Department&rsquo;s projections of future pension liabilities were published in the Stability Programme Update of last December and presented to the D&aacute;il on Budget Day. The Government&rsquo;s Green Paper on Pensions, which was launched in October of this year, updates these projections to take account of more recent developments. The projections presented in the Green Paper indicate <Col N="1707"/>that the cost of Social Welfare pension provision will increase from around 3&frac12;% of GDP today to over 10% by 2050. This follows from the ageing of our population.</P>
        <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) was established under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000. The purpose of establishing the Fund was to meet as much of the Exchequer cost of Social Welfare and Public Service pensions as possible from 2025 to at least 2055. These costs are expected to increase significantly due to increased life expectancy and declining birth rates, and will give rise to serious budgetary issues, in particular the capacity to continue to fund Social Welfare and Public Service pension liabilities on a pay-as-you-go basis. The legislation requires that 1% of GNP be paid every year from the Exchequer into the Fund. The amount being paid into the Fund this year is &euro;1.616 billion. According to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, the market value of the Fund at end-September 2007 was &euro;21.26 billion.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it was never the intention that the Fund would cover the full cost of Social Welfare and Public Service pensions. As envisaged from the outset, the assets accumulated in the NPRF will go some way towards easing future funding concerns, but will fall short of projected pension liabilities.</P>
        <P>A range of measures that could help address the challenges we face in meeting pension commitments are discussed in the Green Paper. The consultation process currently underway provides an opportunity to consider these in detail.</P>
        <P>I might add that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 provides that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission is to commission, from time to time, assessments of the projected profile of Exchequer outlays on Social Welfare and Public Service pensions, after consultation with the relevant Ministers.</P>

	<P>An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to increase in Budget 2008 the ceiling on mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers and those who bought a house in the past seven years, from &euro;8,000 to &euro;10,000 for single people and from &euro;16,000 to &euro;20,000 for couples or widowed persons.  I am <Col N="1708"/>informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated cost of this measure on a pre-Budget 2008 basis is about &euro;20 million in a full year.  The estimated cost has increased relative to a previous cost estimate which was provided to the Deputy last month as a result of a recent exercise conducted by Revenue in relation to the cost and number of beneficiaries of mortgage interest relief.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> his views on whether the present structure of stamp duty is equitable in its impact; and if the faltering in the housing market presents an opportunity for reform. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of equity in the treatment of housing, of which the stamp duty code is a part, must be seen in the context of the overall tax treatment of property owners.  The OECD has reported that Ireland &ldquo;has some of the most generous tax provisions for owner-occupied housing&rdquo;.  Ireland is the only country to allow tax relief on rent, mortgage interest payments, capital gains and capital acquisitions, while not applying an annual property tax.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, stamp duty helps fund public services such as health and education, while keeping the direct tax burden low.  This facilitates continued economic success, which benefits all taxpayers and their families.  This has allowed us to reduce taxes on work and enterprise with clear benefits for the economy as a whole.</P>
        <P>It is a long-standing tradition that the Minister for Finance does not comment on tax measures in the run-up to the Budget.  I would, however, note that the Programme for Government commitments in this regard have already been met.  The Finance (No. 2) Act 2007 introduced a full exemption from stamp duty for first-time buyers in accordance with the commitments made in the Programme for Government.  This change brought about a positive impact upon the ability of first-time buyers to purchase their first home.  This has widened the choice available to first-time buyers and it has removed an obstacle to first-time buyers establishing their own homes in the neighbourhoods and in the communities where they grew up.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Financial Stability Report 2007 recently published by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland <Col N="1709"/>(CBFSAI) points out that there are no firm indications of a significantly higher level of mortgage arrears in the banking system. The report notes that although the rate of non-performing assets on mortgage credit has picked up slightly over the last year or so, this increase has occurred from historical lows over recent years and the level remains relatively low in overall terms.</P>
        <P>In this context, reports of a higher level of court proceedings for home repossessions need to be interpreted with caution, given the variety of circumstances that give rise to such cases and the very small proportion of housing loans involved.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, a small minority of borrowers develop debt problems but house repossession is generally a last resort for lenders. I understand that member institutions of the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) have voluntarily adopted a Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears and a Code of Practice for Personal Customers.  These include provisions for helping customers in financial difficulty.	</P>
        <P>I have consistently highlighted the need for responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders and in particular the need to factor into their financial decision making the effects of potential future changes in economic and financial conditions.</P>
        <P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt, or in danger of getting into debt.  MABS offices throughout the country work with people in order to assist them with their financial planning and budgeting for the future.</P>
        <P>In relation to MABS&rsquo; resources I would point to the fact that the provisional outturn figure for 2007 is &euro;4.1m higher than the corresponding figure for 2006 and that the recently published Pre Budget Outlook (estimate) contains a figure of &euro;17.7m for MABS for 2008. The Programme for Government supports further development and enhancement of the Money, Advice and Budgeting Service.</P>

	<P>The Director General of the Central Statistics Office (CSO) has sole responsibility for, and is independent in, deciding the statistical methodology and professional standards to be <Col N="1710"/>used in compiling the Consumer Price Index (CPI).</P>
        <P>The CPI is designed to measure the change in the average level of the prices paid by consumers for goods and services.  It measures in index form the monthly changes in the cost of purchasing a representative basket of consumer goods and services.</P>
        <P>The CSO publishes a detailed breakdown of the component parts of the CPI at the same time each month that it releases the overall CPI figures. This separate publication is called the &ldquo;Consumer Price Index Detailed Sub-Indices Release&rdquo; and it serves to demonstrate the comprehensive nature of the CPI.</P>
        <P>Maintaining a moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance in relation to competitiveness. The Government is focusing on areas it can control and is taking positive actions to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies. For example, we have not increased excise duties for the last three years, apart from tobacco excise, which was done for sound health policy reasons. We are promoting greater price competition through various measures. We are also investing in public infrastructure, as evidenced by the National Development Plan 2007-2013, which will enhance our ability to produce goods and services more efficiently and thereby keep inflation down.</P>

	<P>As part of the work on the Green <Col N="1711"/>Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out into the current regime of incentives for supplementary pension provision.  This was done with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area.  The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>The review also drew on newly-available 2006 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising <Col N="1712"/>from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 which aimed to improve data quality.  Arising from the review, the following estimates of the cost of tax and other reliefs for private pension provision for 2006 have been made, together with the numbers of contributors in respect of whom tax relief is provided on contributions, to the extent they are available.  Further work will be necessary to provide similar estimates for 2005 and I understand that this is ongoing.</P>
        <P>As similar data sources would not be available for previous years, it is not possible to provide costings on a similar basis for those years.</P><Col N="1711"/>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 145 and 146 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that where rents are paid directly to a person who is resident outside the State, the tenant is obliged to deduct income tax at the standard rate of 20% <Col N="1716"/>from the rental payment and to give the landlord a certificate of the tax deducted.  Direct payments include a situation where rent is paid into a bank account in the name of the non-resident landlord. The tenant is then required to make a return and pay to Revenue the tax that he or she has deducted from the rent. The landlord is entitled to a credit for the tax deducted by the tenant against his or her final rental income tax liability and is obliged to pay any additional tax that may be due.</P>
        <P>The tenant is not responsible for discharging the landlord&rsquo;s liability to tax on rental income. Instead, the withholding of tax on rental income by tenants of non-resident landlords is primarily a control measure. It is designed to promote greater compliance in this area having regard to the obvious risk factors associated with non-resident taxpayers. Where it applies, it provides in a very direct manner, valuable information for Revenue which might otherwise be difficult to obtain.</P>
        <P>Where rent is paid to an Irish agent of a non-resident landlord, such as an Irish-based estate agent acting on behalf of the non-resident landlord, the tenant is not required to deduct income tax from the rent payable. In such cases, the non-resident landlord is chargeable to tax in the name of the Irish agent.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of reviewing this arrangement, I should point out the operation and impact of the assessment and collection of taxes are monitored and/or subject to review on an ongoing basis as part of the normal work of my Department and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not have complete information on the number of tenants who pay rent to non-resident landlords and the number of non-resident landlords engaged in tenancies here.  According to the annual returns of income for non-PAYE taxpayers for the year 2005, the latest year for which information is available, gross rents of &euro;1.1 million were payable to non-resident landlords by 113 taxpayers.</P><Col N="1717"/>
        <P>The amount of income tax that may have been withheld by tenants is not separately identified.  Revenue does not have similar information for PAYE taxpayers.  Following an amendment to the return of income (Form 11) for the year 2006, non-resident landlords when completing a return of income will have to indicate the amount of income tax that was withheld from rents paid by their Irish tenants and the PPSN(s) of tenants who deducted tax from rent payments. Likewise, the return of income for PAYE taxpayers (Form 12) for 2006 has also been amended to request details of the gross rent paid to non-resident landlords in 2006. This information will be available early in 2008.</P>
        <P>Inclusion of this information on Tax Returns for 2006 and subsequent years will enable data to be collected, which should result in more information becoming available in due course on the number of non-resident landlords engaged in tenancies in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they are not aware of any situation where a rent credit relief claim has been refused on the grounds of failure on the part of the tenant to deduct tax from rent payable to a non resident landlord. On the question of the number of appeals, it follows that, as there have been no refusals, there are no appeals.</P>
        <P>If the Deputy has information that Rent Relief has been withheld because of a failure to deduct tax, he should supply details to the Revenue Commissioners who will investigate the matter further.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 169 together.</P>
        <P>I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the comprehensive and positive assessment of the health of the Irish financial system contained in the Financial Stability Report 2007 published in the last week by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  I welcome the CBFSAI&rsquo;s overall assessment in the Report, based on key indicators such as asset quality, profitability, solvency, liquidity and credit ratings, that the Irish banking system is sound and robust.  The CBFSAI states in its Financial Stability Report 2007 that Irish credit institutions do not have significant exposures to the sub-prime market, either directly or indirectly. The Report concludes that domestic banks&rsquo; capacity to respond to unexpected developments has not been much reduced by recent market events.	</P>

	<P>A progress report by the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) was submitted to me and published on 8th October last. The Group reported that implementation of the civil service element of the Decentralisation Programme is progressing satisfactorily.  At the end of October 2007, over 3,000 staff had been assigned to decentralising posts.  Almost 1,300 of these are currently in place, in 20 new locations, while the remainder are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available. In addition to these 20 locations there are a further 9 locations in which state agencies have established a presence.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that by the end of 2007 public services will be delivered from 33 of the decentralisation towns with approximately 2,000 staff transferred. The precise numbers moving within that time frame will depend on the availability of property as well as timeframes for completion of fit out and installation of necessary ICT (information communications technology) and telecommunication cabling and equipment.</P>
        <P>The OPW conducts a review of the property timeframes for permanent accommodation on an ongoing basis. Based on its experience to date in relation to timeframes for property selection and acquisition, brief and design issues, tendering periods, planning issues and contractual arrangements, it has provided an updated schedule of the likely availability of accommodation. In that context I expect that the Civil Service elements of the programme should be substantially completed by end 2009.</P>
        <P>While I am satisfied with the progress reported so far, I am anxious to ensure that the momentum of the programme is maintained and developed and in that context my Department has now asked Secretaries General of decentralising departments to review these timeframes in association with the OPW and the DIG to assess where earlier progress could be made either in relation to permanent accommodation or advance accommodation.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent year for which complete information on the cost of rent relief to the Exchequer is available is for the income tax year 2004. Using that data, the full year cost to the Exchequer of rent relief is projected at &euro;69 million in 2007 terms. On this basis, a doubling of the allowance could cost in the region of an additional &euro;69 million but could be less, depending on the extent to which the additional tax relief could be absorbed by claimants and assuming no significant increase in the level of take up by taxpayers.</P>
        <P>One year leases of dwelling houses at a rent not exceeding &euro;19,050 per annum are exempt from stamp duty.  The particulars of one year leases that are chargeable to duty are aggregated in Revenue&rsquo;s stamp duty records with the details of other leases, both residential and non-residential, and cannot be separately distinguished for analytical purposes. Accordingly, it is not possible to provide specific statistical information in respect of one year leases.</P>

	<P>Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission controls and manages the National Pensions Reserve Fund. The Commission has discretionary authority to determine the Fund&rsquo;s investment strategy in accordance with the Fund&rsquo;s statutory investment policy of securing the optimal total financial return provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the Commission.</P>
        <P>The Commission joined a group of the world&rsquo;s largest institutional investment funds in signing <Col N="1721"/>the UN-sponsored Principles for Responsible Investment when they were launched in April 2006. The aim of the Principles is to integrate consideration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into investment decision-making and ownership practices and, thereby, to improve long-term returns.</P>
        <P>As set out in its Annual Report 2006, the Commission&rsquo;s initial focus in its implementation of the Principles is on the development and implementation of a comprehensive proxy voting policy and development of the capacity to engage on ESG issues with the companies in which Fund moneys are invested. As implementing a comprehensive voting and engagement policy has considerable resource implications, the Commission has decided to contract a third-party service provider to deliver these services. The service was put in place in July of this year when the Commission announced the appointment of Hermes Equity Ownership Services to execute proxy votes on the Fund&rsquo;s behalf and to engage with companies on ESG issues across its worldwide equity portfolio.</P>

	<P>The responsibility for undertaking project appraisals rests in the first instance with the individual Departments and Agencies. They are prepared to facilitate and inform the internal decision making process.  It has not been the practice to publish these appraisals as they generally contain commercially sensitive information, the publication of which could be prejudicial to the State&rsquo;s capacity to get best value for money in procurement of capital projects. In these circumstances, I would not consider it appropriate to require that details of appraisals of NDP projects be published as a matter of course. </P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the scope for reducing the VAT rate on environmental goods and services from the standard VAT rate of 21 per cent to the reduced rate of 13.5 per cent. I should mention that this is just one of a number of initiatives in the Programme aimed at delivering a cleaner environment.</P>
        <P>In carrying out this examination account will be taken of the growing range of environmental and renewable energy products which present opportunities to reduce our dependence on conventional energy systems and can make a contribution to tackling Climate Change. For example, energy-efficient insulation materials, renewable energy systems including wind, solar and geothermal systems, and the options arising in the bio-energy crop sector will be examined.</P>
        <P>In considering a change in VAT arrangements for these, or indeed any other, goods and services, it is important to bear in mind that the treatment of goods and services is subject to EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.</P>
        <P>It is important however to point out that the reduced rate of VAT of 13.5 per cent may currently be applied to insulation materials and renewable energy systems where these products are supplied and installed as a single contract and where the VAT-exclusive cost of the goods does not exceed two-thirds of the total VAT-exclusive charge to the customer. I understand that the bulk of supply and install contracts are likely to meet this so-called &ldquo;two-thirds&rdquo; rule, resulting in the reduced VAT rate of 13.5 per cent rate being applied. Consequently, under existing VAT arrangements, the reduced VAT rate can apply to environmental products where they form part of such a supply and installation arrangement.</P>
        <P>Therefore the current VAT classifications will be examined to ascertain what scope exists within EU VAT law to further extend the application of <Col N="1723"/>the reduced VAT rate in the area of environmental goods and services. This and other measures under the Programme for Government clearly demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the environmental challenges which we face.</P>

	<P>Report No 42 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, dealing with the seventh general review of the remuneration of top public service, posts was completed by the Review Body on 14 September 2007 and submitted to the Government.  In line with the established Government policy of accepting the recommendations of this independent review body, the Government decided to accept and implement the recommendations in Report No 42 on levels of remuneration of top public servants.</P>
        <P>The increases are to be implemented on the following phased basis:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(a)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />5% from 14 September 2007, the date of the Report, or where the total increase is less than 5%, the full increase from that date;</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(c)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />the remaining balance from 1 March 2009.</P>
       <P el="5" FLI="0">The Standing Terms of Reference of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector had provided that it should carry out general reviews of the posts covered by it every four years. The sixth general review was completed in September 2000 and the next review would in the normal course have been due to commence in 2004. This review was deferred and the Government decided on 12 April 2005 that the Review Body should be asked to carry out its seventh general review of the remuneration of those covered by its terms of reference and to report thereon in the second half of 2007. This timing was intended to bring the date of finalisation of the review broadly into line with the next report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body.</P>
        <P>In its interim report in 2005, the Review Body stated that the relevance of superannuation arrangements in the public service as a component of overall remuneration had assumed a <Col N="1726"/>greater importance than was the case at the time of the last general review. It indicated that it would investigate this issue further in this general review and consider the extent to which the value of public service superannuation arrangements should be offset against the remuneration packages available in the private sector.</P>
        <P>As part of the general review the Review Body commissioned a detailed examination of the value of public service pensions for the grades covered by its remit by reference to pensions arrangements in the private sector. The key finding of the study was that the pensions of the groups covered by its terms of reference are significantly more valuable than the pensions of comparable groups in the private sector. The superior value was assessed by the Review Body as being 15% of salary. Accordingly, in making comparison with levels of remuneration in the private sector the Review Body applied a discount of 15% to reflect the value of public service pensions.</P>
        <P>The Review Body found that the remuneration of many senior public service posts is below private sector levels even when allowance is made for the superior value of pensions in the public service. However, the position varies among the different groups. The salaries of the largest jobs, such as Secretaries General, the Dublin City Manager and the Garda Commissioner, are very much behind private sector levels. The gap is significantly less in the case of some other jobs and in a number of cases salaries are not out of line with the lower quartile of private sector rates. This follows the general pattern identified by the Review Body over a number of reviews where the gap between public service and private sector salaries is more pronounced at the higher managerial levels.</P>
        <P>The Review Body did not consider that private sector practice should be followed in all cases. In particular, it did not attach significant weight to published information on the remuneration packages of the chief executives of the top Irish PLCs. Companies in this category comprise a small segment of the private sector and are not representative of the private sector as a whole.</P>
        <P>The overall effect of the review is that the salaries recommended are below the average level of salaries in the private sector since they are based on the lower quartile of private sector salaries and have been discounted to allow for the superior value of public service pensions relative to the private sector.</P>
        <P>The pay of most public servants has been determined by negotiation between management and trade unions and, where necessary, recourse to third party adjudication by the Labour Court or arbitration board.  More recently the benchmarking process has been established by agree<Col N="1727"/>ment between public service employers and trade unions.</P>
        <P>The top posts in the public service are in a different position.  Their pay cannot be determined through the industrial relations machinery.  Standard round increases under the successive national pay agreements are applied to these posts but the local bargaining or similar provisions of these agreements cannot in practical terms apply to these top posts. Instead the pay of these posts is determined by the Government: it is adjusted on the basis of recommendations by this independent Review Body which is requested to carry out reviews from time to time.</P>
        <P>There are various pay review or pay claim processes that apply to every group &mdash; the Review Body, the Benchmarking Body, the Labour Court, etc. The Review Body has been there for nearly forty years and every Government since has accepted that it is the best way to determine top public servants&rsquo; pay and accepted the recommendations. The only significant variations by Governments have been the timing of implementation.</P>

        <P>The Freedom of Information Act, which covered 67 public bodies when it commenced in April 1998, now applies to over 500 bodies across the public sector.  My Department is involved in an ongoing programme of FOI extension and is actively engaged with Government Departments about a number of bodies that remain outside the scope of the Act.</P>
        <P>Arrangements have been put in place by my Department to ensure that the Information Commissioner is kept informed of legislation impacting on the FOI Act.

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</P>
        <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) was established under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000.  The purpose in establishing the Fund was to meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from 2025 until at least 2055. These costs are expected to increase significantly, due to increased life expectancy and declining birth rates, and will give rise to serious budgetary issues, in particular the capacity to continue to fund social welfare and public service pension liabilities on a pay-as-you-go basis.</P>
        <P>The legislation requires that 1% of GNP is to be paid every year from the Exchequer into the Fund. The amount being paid into the Fund this year is &euro;1.616 billion and the market value of the Fund at end-September 2007, according to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, was &euro;21.26 billion.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it was never the intention that the Fund would be able to cover the full cost of social welfare and public service pensions. As envisaged from the outset, the assets accumulated in the NPRF will go some way towards easing future funding concerns but are not expected to meet the full cost of projected pension liabilities.</P>
        <P>I might add that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 provides that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission is to commission, from time to time, assessments of the projected profile of Exchequer outlays on public service pensions and on social welfare pensions, after consultation with the relevant Ministers.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the recently-published Green Paper on Pensions included projections in relation to the future cost of public service and social welfare pensions.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the concerns expressed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his most recent report at the significant underestimation of tax revenues by his Department in each of the past three years; the steps he is taking to ensure a more accurate level of forecasting by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should note that the Comptroller and Auditor General has not expressed concerns in this matter. In his report on the 2006 Accounts he has reviewed tax forecasts, recorded the facts and the views of the Accounting Officer. The report also referred to an October 2005 analysis by the International Monetary Fund of Ireland&rsquo;s track record on forecasting fiscal balance. It said: &ldquo;On the revenue side the [IMF] analysis found that stronger-than-expected economic growth and buoyant asset price developments were the main reasons for the overshooting of tax revenue. In terms of economic growth forecasts, upon which the tax forecasts are based, it was outlined that Department of Finance forecasts were not dissimilar to those of other institutions, and the difficulty in forecasting economic growth in a period of strong economic growth was highlighted. The IMF recommended the continuation of what it called the &ldquo;prudent approach&rdquo; to budget forecasts given the risks that asset developments may not continue to contribute significantly to large upside surprises. It also stated that the institutional framework for fiscal policy and budget forecasting practices in Ireland are relatively strong compared with other countries.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Exchequer tax revenues in each of the last three years have been better than Budget Day estimates. In 2004 tax revenues were 6.5 per cent ahead of target. In 2005, receipts were 4.7 per cent ahead of target and in 2006 tax revenues were 9.3 per cent ahead of target. These additional receipts allowed for a significant reduction in debt levels which is a welcome outcome. One of the reasons for the improved revenue performance was stronger economic activity in the years in question.</P>
        <P>Excluding the impact of special investigations receipts, which, by their nature, could not be forecast with any degree of accuracy, the &ldquo;big four&rdquo; taxes &mdash; VAT, income tax, corporation tax and excise duties &mdash; which have accounted for around 85-90 per cent of actual tax revenues in the last three years have been close to target, particularly in 2004 and 2005.</P><Col N="1730"/>
        <P>Nevertheless, my Department is anxious to provide the most accurate tax forecasts possible in order to assist in managing the economy and the budgetary process. Therefore, the approach to tax forecasting is kept under review on an ongoing basis. For that reason, a Group chaired by a Senior Economist from the Central Bank, currently on secondment to the Department of Finance, was formed to conduct a review of the methodology employed. As I have only recently received the report my consideration of the findings and recommendations of the report is still ongoing.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 112 together.</P>
        <P>Capital allowances are available in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of a private hospital which falls within the definition of a qualifying hospital set out in Section 268 (2A) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</P>
        <P>To be a qualifying hospital in accordance with the legislation, a private hospital must meet certain capacity requirements.  It must have an operating theatre or theatres, related diagnostic and therapeutic facilities, and it must be able to provide a range of specified services.  The hospital must also give an undertaking to the Health Service Executive to make available at least 20% of its capacity to public patients awaiting in-patient or out-patient hospital services at a fee rate of not more than 90% of that which would be charged to private patients.  The Health Service Executive is required to certify that the private hospital meets these criteria.  Such certification is required annually for a period of either 10 or 15 years from the time that the hospital is first used, <Col N="1731"/>or first used following refurbishment depending on whether this occurred before or after 1 February 2007, respectively.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information on the scheme of tax relief for private hospitals was for the first time specified and separately included in personal income tax returns for the tax year 2004, which were due for filing in October, 2005.  No specific Revenue information on the cost of the scheme is available for the tax year 2002 (when the scheme of relief for private hospitals was introduced) or for 2003.  Based on the information that has been received and collated to date for the tax year 2004, there were 37 claims for &euro;4.5 million capital allowances for the construction of private hospitals.  This figure would correspond to a maximum Exchequer cost of the order of &euro;1.9 million for these returns in terms of income tax foregone.</P>
        <P>Corresponding data available for the tax year 2005 indicates that there were 60 claims for &euro;7.7 million capital allowances for the construction of buildings used for private hospitals. This figure would correspond to a maximum Exchequer cost of the order of &euro;3.2 million for these returns in terms of income tax foregone.</P>
        <P>Data for the tax years 2006 is not yet available as the income tax returns for those years was not due for filing until October 2007.  Other information such as the number, name and location of the relevant private hospitals in respect of which claims for capital allowances have been made is not available to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the VAT Directive Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive. As Annex III does not list the supply of road safety products, the rate that can apply to such products is the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%.</P>
        <P>In relation to amending Annex III of the VAT Directive, the Deputy will be aware that this could only be done in the context of an overall review at Community level of reduced rates. Whilst the Commission has launched a debate on reduced rates in July 2007, as yet, no specific Commission proposals have been brought for<Col N="1732"/>ward. Generally, any significant review of the application of VAT across the different EU Member States can be complex.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the employment of civil servants on constituency work for Ministers and Ministers of State is to enable Ministers and Ministers of State to devote their time to their Departmental duties, both at national and international (including EU) level, while at the same time enabling them to provide an appropriate service  to their constituents in their capacity as public representatives. This purpose has long been recognised by all political parties that have served in Government.</P>
        <P>The Minister and Secretaries Act 1924 (section 2) authorises Ministers to appoint staff to their Departments, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance. The Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 (section 17) makes the Minister for Finance responsible for the control and regulation of the civil service.</P>
        <P>My Department circulated Guidelines to Departments in 1997 which consolidated arrangements which had been in place up to then in relation to the staffing of Ministerial Offices. These Guidelines limit the number of staff who may serve in constituency offices to six in the case of Ministers and five in the case of Ministers of State, and provide that no more than two of these in each case may be personal appointees (i.e. not established civil servants). The Guidelines were updated in 2002 and again this year.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax debt outstanding at 31 March 2007 and as reported in its annual report was &euro;1,107million.  This represents 1.8% of gross receipts, a level that is exceptionally low by international standards. The amount under appeal was &euro;315million leaving the remainder, &euro;792million available for collection.</P>
        <P>The debt of &euro;792m represents a snapshot of the debt at a particular point in time [in this instance 31 March 2007] and is a constantly changing figure as additional debt arises and activity by Revenue results in debt being collected. This changing element of the debt composition makes it difficulty to accurately predict the likely reduction in the debt figure. However, Revenue estimate that the collectible debt of &euro;792m plus additional debt that arises from new or revised tax charges will be reduced by up to 97% over a five year period. The remaining debt will be under control, under appeal or at enforcement. Revenue is not in a position to estimate the likely collection from debt currently under appeal.</P>
        <P>The strategies and methodologies adopted by Revenue to achieve a reduction over a five-year period are subject to annual review and evaluation that is carried out within the context of the business planning process.  In the context of the preparation of a new Statement of Strategy for 2008-2010, Revenue is considering the appropriate strategies and targets in relation to debt management for the period ahead.</P>

	<P>The World Bank group comprises the International Bank for Reconstruction and <Col N="1734"/>Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).  Together the IBRD and IDA provide low-interest loans, interest-free credit, and grants to developing countries.  The IFC promotes private sector investment by supporting high-risk sectors and countries, while the MIGA provides political risk insurance (guarantees) to investors in, and lenders to, developing countries.  The ICSID settles investment disputes between foreign investors and their host countries.</P>
        <P>The new President of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick, has begun a process to review the strategic direction of the Bank aimed at ensuring the world&rsquo;s poorest also share in the benefits of globalisation.</P>
        <P>The IDA is the &ldquo;soft&rdquo; loan arm of the World Bank.  It provides highly concessional financial resources to low-income countries to help them reduce poverty and achieve faster, more environmentally sustainable, broad based growth.  It is the single largest source of concessional financial assistance to the world&rsquo;s poorest countries. The IDA provides both loans at zero interest with a 10-year grace period and maturities of 35 to 40 years and more recently grants.</P>
        <P>These loans and grants are provided by donors, such as Ireland, and are financed by the Irish and other taxpayers, and by the return reflows from past loans.  Conditions in relation to the provision of such loans and grants are always necessary to ensure that borrowers and grant recipients carry out the projects as intended and repay the funds loaned.  This allows donors to be sure that the intended purposes of IDA actions are met and that, where relevant, the resources return to IDA for future reuse to assist poor countries.</P>
        <P>Ireland participated at a meeting of the IDA 15 Replenishment Round which took place in the Grand Hotel in Malahide on 12th and 13th November.  The Government remains committed to fully participating in the business of IDA and the business of other World Bank institutions to ensure that resources are made available to the poorest and least developed countries in an effective and timely manner.	</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the PAYE allowance, as it was then, was introduced in 1980 to improve the tax progression of PAYE taxpayers and to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally then had the advantage of paying tax on a preceding year basis. The argument was also made at the time that the general scheme of allowances for expenses discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers.</P>
        <P>There have been changes since 1980 for example, as mentioned by the Deputy in his question, the self-employed now pay tax on a current year basis. In addition, the PAYE allowance has become a tax credit. However, significant timing benefits remain, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer. In addition, the expenses regime remains somewhat more liberal than that afforded to the PAYE sector.</P>
        <P>The cost to the Exchequer of extending the PAYE credit to farmers and the self employed, including proprietary directors, would be significant and is estimated at &euro;610 million in a full year.  The cost of abolishing the PAYE credit and increasing the personal credit by the same amount is estimated at &euro;750 million in a full year.  The additional cost would arise because the personal credit is transferable between spouses.</P>
        <P>As indicated in my reply to a similar question on 13 November 2007, it should be borne in mind that there is already in place a generous package of reliefs and specific arrangements that continue to be available exclusively to the farming sector.</P>

	<P>The level of interest rates is determined by the independent European Central Bank, ECB, in fulfilment of its mandate to secure price stability for the Euro area as a whole. The impact of ECB interest rate changes on household incomes in Ireland is an important element of the context for the Government&rsquo;s overall economic and fiscal strategy.</P><Col N="1736"/>
        <P>This strategy has successfully delivered sustained economic growth, record levels of employment, low unemployment and rising incomes. It has also underpinned the achievement of a strong and responsible fiscal position within which significant tax and expenditure priorities have been achieved. It enables us to plan the delivery of a major programme of investment in our economic and social infrastructure under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.</P>
        <P>Households currently experiencing higher mortgage repayments on account of rising interest rates benefit significantly from a range of supportive economic and financial factors, including, for example, low income tax rates and a relatively high savings rate in respect of which savers are increasingly benefiting from higher retail interest rates. The Finance Act 2007 gave effect to measures that are designed to sustain our economic performance and improve both take-home pay and the affordability of housing. These measures include a doubling in the ceiling for mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers as well as increases in relief for other mortgage holders. The Finance (No. 2) Act 2007 introduced a full exemption from stamp duty for first-time buyers in accordance with the commitments made in the Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>I have consistently highlighted the need for responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders and in particular the need to factor into their financial decision making the effects of potential future changes in the economic and financial conditions.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Director provides extensive information to help consumers make informed choices regarding mortgage products. The Consumer Director&rsquo;s cost surveys, consumer guides and fact sheets assist consumers in shopping around for the best available mortgage deal. Against the backdrop of the rising trend in interest rates, the Financial Regulator has published information for consumers on the potential impact of these increases on different mortgage products.</P>
        <P>Mortgage interest rates in Ireland remain low by historic standards. This reflects both the current level of ECB rates, which are lower than those prevailing in either the United States or the United Kingdom, and the increasingly competitive nature of the Irish mortgage market which ensures that margins on mortgage lending remain low. I am confident the economic and fiscal framework now in place is properly aligned to the current requirements of the economy and can adjust to potential changes in the financial environment over time.</P>
        <P>The Financial Stability Report 2007 recently published by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBFSAI) points out that there are no firm indications of a signifi<Col N="1737"/>cantly higher level of mortgage arrears in the banking system. The report notes that although the rate of non-performing assets on mortgage credit has picked up slightly over the last year or so, this increase has occurred from historical lows over recent years and the level remains relatively low in overall terms.</P>
        <P>In this context, reports of a higher level of court proceedings for home repossessions need to be interpreted with caution, given the variety of circumstances that give rise to such cases and the very small proportion of housing loans involved.</P>
        <P>In relation to MABS&rsquo; resources I would point to the fact that the provisional outturn figure for 2007 is &euro;4.1m higher than the corresponding figure for 2006 and that the recently published Pre Budget Outlook (estimate) contains a figure of &euro;17.7m for MABS for 2008. The Programme for Government supports further development and enhancement of the Money, Advice and Budgeting Service.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost of mortgage interest relief by way of tax relief at source for the years in question was as follows: 2004, &euro; 232 million; 2005, &euro; 279 million; 2006, &euro; 352 million and from January to May 2007 inclusive, &euro;211 million.</P>
        <P>On the basis of trends to date the cost of mortgage interest relief given through the tax relief at source system for 2007 is estimated at about &euro;560 million. This cost takes account of the increased ceilings introduced on 1st January 2007 for first time buyers and also takes account of applications for mortgage interest relief for prior qualifying years. It should be noted that in 2007, there was an increase of 25% in the number of applications for mortgage interest relief which included applications for relief in respect of previous years.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are not in a position to estimate how many properties currently qualify for mortgage interest relief, as a property may be the subject of more than one loan or a claimant may claim mortgage tax relief in respect of a mortgage paid by them for a separated/ divorced spouse, and/or a dependent relative (i.e. widowed parent, elderly relative) for whom they are claiming a dependent relative tax credit. However, there are currently 570,000 qualifying loans in respect of which tax relief at source is applied. This compares to 550,000 qualifying loans at the end of 2006; 527,000 qualifying loans at the end of 2005 and 445,000 qualifying loans at the end of 2004.</P>

	<P>The Irish deposit protection scheme is established under the harmonised arrangements set out in the EU Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive 94/19/EC. The Directive currently provides for a minimum level of protection of &euro;20,000 or 90% of the loss incurred by a depositor when a credit institution cannot repay funds, whichever is the lesser. The Exchequer or the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBFSAI) do not fund the scheme; it is funded by a levy of 0.2% on bank deposits.</P>
        <P>The Ecofin Council, at its meeting on 9 October last, decided on a preliminary set of issues to be analysed and addressed following recent financial market developments.  These <Col N="1739"/>include reviewing possible enhancements of the deposit guarantee schemes in the EU. This review is to be undertaken by the Commission and the EU&rsquo;s Financial Services Committee on which Ireland is represented. This review is to report by mid-2008.  The work carried out on this review and its conclusions will be important inputs to the process of ensuring that arrangements to safeguard financial stability in Ireland continue to conform to international best practice standards.</P>
        <P>It is always well to remember that sound prudential supervision aimed at ensuring the continuing solvency and liquidity of banks provides the best protection for depositors. Ireland prides itself in matching best international practice in all aspects of financial regulation, whether they involve international activities or domestic activities. According to the IMF itself, our regulatory regime is up to the best international standards.  Additionally, the CBFSAI has indicated in its Financial Stability Report of 2007 that the stability of the Irish banking system remains robust when assessed by the usual indicators of financial health such as asset quality, profitability, solvency, liquidity and credit ratings.</P>

	<P>The Financial Stability Report 2007 published by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBFSAI) last week is a comprehensive and detailed assessment of the impact of international financial market conditions on the Irish financial sector and on financial conditions in the economy generally.</P>
        <P>I welcome the CBFSAI&rsquo;s conclusion that the Irish financial system is well placed to withstand any adverse economic and sectoral developments in the short to medium term. The report highlights that based on key indicators such as asset quality, profitability, solvency and liquidity the Irish banking system is strong and robust and it is clear that domestic banks have no significant direct or indirect exposure to US sub-prime mortgages. The report also notes that the domestic banking sector has minimal direct investment in the Irish sub-prime residential mortgage market and that in any case the market is small in relative terms with generally modest average loan-to-value ratios.</P>
        <P>There is also a co-ordinated EU response to international financial, market conditions.  EU Finance Ministers have agreed on a set of com<Col N="1740"/>mon principles and a roadmap of further actions to enhance financial stability arrangements and the ability of authorities to respond to market developments  Ireland is of course participating fully in this work to ensure there is an effective EU-wide system to maintain financial stability taking into account the important cross-border linkages that now exist in EU financial markets.</P>
        <P>As regards regulation of what is termed sub-prime lending in the domestic market, Section 19 of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007 amended Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997 to provide for an appropriate system of authorisation and regulation of retail credit firms engaged in specialist or sub-prime lending and home reversion providers not currently subject to financial regulation in respect of their lending activities. The primary purpose of this amendment was to extend to customers of these firms the benefit of the consumer protections provided for in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.</P>

        <Quest> his Department&rsquo;s forecast for the expected increase in the consumer price index for the full year of 2007; the way this compares with the forecast he gave in his budget 2007 speech; his views on whether the level of inflation continues to run at 5%; the measures he will take to deal with this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>On Budget day, 6th December 2006, my Department forecast that Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation would average 4.1 per cent this year. This forecast was based on the normal technical assumption of unchanged interest rates. In accordance with usual practice, my Department published updated inflation forecasts in the Pre-Budget Outlook in October, and the CPI was assumed to average 4.9 per cent for this year.</P>
        <P>Since Budget day there have been three quarter-point interest rate increases. Interest rates are outside the control of the Government and are a matter for the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB). In the first ten months of this year CPI inflation has averaged 4.9 per cent year-on-year. Mortgage interest currently accounts for a significant proportion of this increase. Excluding mortgage interest, the year-on-year CPI average would have been 2.8 per cent. On the normal assumption of no further interest rate increases, the rate of inflation is expected to moderate next year, and this is reflected in the Pre-Budget Outlook forecast for CPI inflation of an average increase of 2.2 per <Col N="1741"/>cent over the period 2008-2010. The Budget day forecast for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) inflation &mdash; the EU inflation measure &mdash; was 2.6 per cent for this year.</P>
        <P>The best measure of underlying inflation is the EU comparable measure of inflation, the HICP. It is used by the ECB because it removes the effect of interest rate increases, which are made in order to reduce inflationary pressures. It is important therefore that we do not seek to compensate ourselves for these rises in interest rates as this would only lead to a wage/inflation spiral and reduce both our competitiveness and ultimately our real standard of living. In the recently published Pre-Budget Outlook, the HICP was forecast to average 2.8 per cent for this year.</P>
        <P>Where possible, this Government will take action to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies. Indirect taxes have not been raised in the three budgets which I have brought before this House with the exception of an increase in tobacco excise which was in support of health policy.</P>

The Office of Public Works (OPW) is currently negotiating a lease for suitable accommodation and it is expected that Revenue will be in a position to move to Navan in the first quarter 2008.  To date forty nine (49) staff have accepted offers for Athy, forty four (44) of whom are currently serving in Revenue in Dublin.  To date, two Clerical Officers from other Departments have accepted offers for Athy, both are serving in Dublin.  It is intended to send an advance party of approximately 50 staff to Athy by the end of 2007 and the OPW are examining a number of possibilities for permanent accommodation.</P>

	<P>The Review Body is an independent standing body whose primary function is to advise the Government on the general levels of pay appropriate to those covered by its terms of reference. It makes recommendations on levels of remuneration but has no role in relation to the making of awards.

        <P LI="1" FLI="0">and such other posts as it may be asked to examine from time to time&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the past ten years the Review Body has issued the following reports: Report No. 38 &mdash; Sixth General Review  &mdash; 25 September 2000; Report No. 39 &mdash; Higher posts in the Third Level Education Sector &mdash; 5 March 2001; Report No. 40 &mdash; Interim Report on the Seventh General Review &mdash; 27 June 2005; Report No. 41 &mdash; The remuneration of certain posts in the Health Service Executive &mdash; 16 December 2005; and Report No. 42 &mdash; Seventh General Review &mdash; 14 September 2007.</P>
        <P>The details of the recommendations of the above reports can be accessed on the website of the Review Body www.reviewbody.gov.ie.</P>
        <P>The standing terms of reference of the Review Body have been amended from time to time mainly to include or exclude certain groups.  The following are some of the significant changes.  In 1986 the Body was asked, on foot of the third general review in relation to the groups covered, to report on &lsquo;Whether it is desirable and feasible that such remuneration should take account of individual performance on the job and, if so, the criteria and mechanisms which might apply&rsquo;  (Report No. 30).</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In January 1991 the terms of reference were amended to provide that the Review Body should carry out general reviews every four years.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Following the approval by the Government of the recommendations of the Review Body in Report No. 37 of 20 December 1996 (fifth general review), the remuneration of the chief executives of commercial state-sponsored bodies and of the harbour authorities was deleted from the terms of reference and is no longer considered by the Review Body.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />In December 1999 the Government decided to include in the forthcoming general review: </P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is2p0- ?>1.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />the remuneration of the heads of third level institutions, bursars, registrars and secretaries, as well as state solicitors. </P><Col N="1755"/>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is2p0- ?>2.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />to ask the Review Body to recommend an appropriate civil service grade to which the pay of D&aacute;il Deputies would be linked for the future and the proportionate relationship that the remuneration of Senators should have to that of Deputies. </P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is2p0- ?>3.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officers of the new Eastern Regional Health Authority and the three new Area Health Boards, the Director of Planning and Commissioning and the Financial Director  in the EHRA and the grade of Programme Manager in the Health Boards.</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is2p0- ?>4.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />For the first time the remuneration of hospital consultants was included in the general review (they had previously been examined separately). </P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is2p0- ?>5.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />Subsequently the Review Body was also asked to review the remuneration of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Following the approval by the Government of the recommendations of the Review Body in Report No. 38 of 25 September 2000, the salaries of members of the Houses of the Oireachtas are no longer considered by the Review Body (the remuneration of political office holders is still covered). The Government also decided at that time that the revised terms should no longer provide for reviews at specific intervals since it was intended that future reviews would coincide with benchmarking exercises; the timing of which would be negotiated with the public service unions. In Report No. 42 the Review Body strongly urge that there should be a reversion to the arrangement of having reviews carried out every four years. The Government will consider this point in due course.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">The Review Body is an independent body and its records are retained by the Body. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance does not have access to these records and consequently is not in a position to inform the Deputy of the number of times the Review Body has met in the past ten years.</P>      </Speaker>

        <P>The measures taken to improve traffic safety including the one-way system at the Chapelizod and Islandbridge Gates of the Phoenix Park are contained in the Phoenix Park Transportation Study which was published in September 2006.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works together with the consultants, Messrs Faber Maunsell, engaged in an extensive consultation process prior to the formulation and publication of the study and sought submissions by means of press advertisements, website notice and invitations to all key stakeholders including St Mary&rsquo;s Hospital.  Numerous public presentations were made following the publication of the study and indeed representatives from St Mary&rsquo;s attended at least one of these presentations on 11th October 2006 .</P>
        <P>Details of the proposed one-way traffic system at Chapelizod and Islandbridge Gates were disseminated in January 2007.  St Mary&rsquo;s Hospital was notified about the proposals and the system was introduced in June 2007.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are no plans to re-open any closed gates or roads in the Phoenix Park. These gates and roads were originally closed for safety reasons and the curtailment of traffic across Chesterfield Avenue has led to a reduction in traffic accidents within the Park and enhanced the visitor experience of the Park amenities.</P>

        <Quest>  the aggregate cost of projects which are to be supported by the Irish Government under the heading All Island Co-Operation outlined in chapter five of the National Development Plan; if value for money evaluations will be conducted in each project; and if a protocol has been worked out with the British <Col N="1757"/>and Northern Irish administrations as to the way evaluations will be conducted and monitored.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Chapter 5 of the National Development Plan sets out the existing level of co-operation with Northern Ireland across a wide range of areas and our proposals for significant Irish Government investment in North/South projects and initiatives of mutual benefit.  Progress has been made on agreeing these with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, since its restoration.  The initiatives and strategic projects outlined in the Chapter are at varying stages of progress.  The individual cost and progress of projects is a matter for the particular Departments concerned. All-Island Cooperation will, along with the other horizontal objectives under the NDP of balanced regional development, environmental sustainability and development of the rural economy, be specifically monitored under the reporting arrangements for the NDP.  It will also feature in the annual report on the implementation of the NDP, the first of which will be submitted to the Oireachtas in mid-2008.</P>
        <P>As regards securing value for money, it is Government policy that all capital expenditure funded by the Exchequer is subject to the Capital Appraisal Guidelines of February 2005 as amended by the Value for Money Circular of January 2006.  All capital projects are subject to project appraisal, with the nature and extent of the appraisal being related to the type and value of the particular project.  The responsibility for undertaking such appraisals rests in the first instance with the individual Departments and Agencies.  The primary purpose of the guidelines is to reinforce the need for rigorous appraisal of projects at all stages including selection stage.</P>
        <P>The arrangements for the management and implementation of projects with a cross Border dimension, including the conduct of project evaluations, is the subject of ongoing discussions with the authorities in Northern Ireland.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138, 141, 144, 153, 154 and 156 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputies may recall that I have answered Parliamentary Questions on this issue over the past year, including on 4 July 2007 and in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of <Col N="1759"/>Member States.  In the Irish context, these derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.</P>
        <P>While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, who are the deciding authority, have to date refused all such requests.  The Commission maintain that, in keeping with the EU Energy Tax Directive, Member States must apply at least the EU minimum rates of excise on fuels in such circumstances and that any further favourable excise treatment is not allowable.  In this regard the Commission&rsquo;s decision was published to its website in March 2007. At the Commission&rsquo;s behest my officials have indicated that Ireland will avail of the forthcoming Finance Bill to make the necessary legislative changes to conform with the Directive.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, the relevant line Departments who have primary responsibility in this regard are, in conjunction with my Department, exploring alternative non-tax support mechanisms that could be put in place where appropriate to maintain the assistance currently being provided, subject of course to compatibility with EU State Aid requirements. In the interim the reduced rates applicable to fuel used will be maintained.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Ireland has been allocated some &euro;901m in EU Structural Funds over the period 2007-2013. The European Commission has approved the National Strategic Reference Framework which sets out the strategic orientation of the funding for this period.  This will be implemented through three operational programmes, one national ESF programme (managed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment) and two regional ERDF programmes (managed by the Border, Midland and Western and Southern and Eastern Regional Assemblies). No EU funding has been received to date under the 2007-2013 round of funding.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the position in relation to travel tickets is that where an employer provides an employee with an annual or monthly travel pass, the cost of such a pass is not taxable. In addition, where an employee foregoes salary, and such salary foregone is used by the employee to purchase an annual or monthly travel pass, then the salary foregone is not taxable. Both of these instances are subject to certain conditions.</P>
        <P>The relevant provisions are not confined to State owned forms of public transport.</P>
        <P>At present, the requirement is that the travel pass must be issued by an &ldquo;approved transport provider&rdquo;, defined as: CIE, any of its subsidiaries or a person who provides a passenger transport <Col N="1762"/>service under an arrangement entered into by CIE in accordance with Section 13(1) of the Transport Act, 1950; a private bus operator holding a passenger licence under Section 7 of the Road Transport Act 1932; the Railway Procurement Agency, any of its subsidiaries or a person who has entered into an arrangement with the agency in accordance with section 43(6) of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 to operate a railway; a person who provides a ferry service within the State, operating a vessel which holds a current valid passenger ship safety certificate, passenger boat licence or high-speed craft safety certificate issued by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources; or a railway designated as a light railway or as a metro in a railway order made under section 43 of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001.</P>

	<P>I have no role in the valuation of properties, which is the function of the Valuation Office.  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Act, 2001 and the making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole prerogative. </P>
        <P>However, I understand there is a revision process in place under which the person concerned can apply, in writing, to the Valuation Office for the revision of the rateable valuation of his prem<Col N="1763"/>ises to take account of any changed circumstances in the use of the premises, enclosing the prescribed fee of &euro;250.  Should he be dissatisfied with the revision outcome he will, as per statute, have a right of appeal in the first instance to the Commissioner of Valuation and subsequently to the Valuation Tribunal.</P>

	<P>As I told the House on 31 October 2007, Ireland has been strongly supportive of the full implementation of debt relief and, where appropriate, cancellation. </P>
        <P>In 2002, the Department of Finance and the Department of Foreign Affairs published a joint paper on the question of debt relief which I refer to the attention of the Deputy. That set out the position in detail regarding such issues as debt sustainability and cancellation. In particular, it emphasised the need for donor support for debt cancellation, which has been partially successful. The poorest countries are already eligible for 100 per cent debt cancellation on their bilateral debts under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, as well as 100 per cent debt cancellation on their debts to the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and African Development Bank under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). In addition to an earlier contribution of &euro;30m towards the costs of implementation of the HIPC Initiative, we were the first country to pay its full share of the costs of the MDRI &mdash; &euro;58.6m out of the approximately US$37 billion total cost. We will remain actively <Col N="1765"/>engaged in ensuring that international commitments to dealing with the debt burden on developing countries are met.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Irish citizens, who are non-resident for tax purposes, are obliged to file Irish tax returns only in respect of: income arising in Ireland e.g. income from directorships, rented properties etc; and gains from the disposals of land, buildings and certain other assets in the State.</P>
        <P>I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the 2005 income tax year was the first year for which it was possible to capture the number of returns of income and gains made by Irish citizens who are not resident here for tax purposes. The number of individuals who filed their 2005 tax returns on this basis was 3,030.  A breakdown of this along the lines sought by the Deputy is not possible.  The information for 2006 is not available as the filing date for returns for this year was 31st October 2007 in the case of paper returns and 15th November 2007 in the case of returns filed on line.</P>

	<P>The scheme of capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of buildings used as private hospitals was introduced in the Finance Act 2001 and came into effect in May <Col N="1767"/>2002. Provided that capital expenditure on the proposed co-located private hospitals, which are designed to free-up capacity in public hospitals, conforms with the existing legislation governing that scheme, normal tax relief will apply.</P>
        <P>The cost of such tax relief will ultimately depend on the level of qualifying capital expenditure and no such expenditure on the proposed co-located hospitals has yet been incurred.  For each &euro;100 million of qualifying capital expenditure on these hospitals, the cost of tax relief to investors (assuming a marginal tax rate of 41% for those investors) would amount in gross terms to &euro;41 million spread over 7 years.  Of course, with the additional activity generated by the construction of the hospitals, the employment generated and the related services provided on which taxes will be paid, additional revenues would accrue to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>The Board of the Health Service Executive has approved preferred bidders for six co-located hospital sites.  The hospitals and the preferred bidders have been working towards finalising the Project Agreements for these sites. It is expected that the Project Agreements for the sites will be concluded in the near future. Two further hospitals are at an earlier stage of the procurement process.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may recall that I have answered Parliamentary Questions on this issue over the past year, including on 4 July 2007 and in recent weeks.  The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States.  In the Irish context, the derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.  While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland along with other Member States sought retention of their derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, which is the deciding authority, has to date refused all such requests.  The Commission maintains that, in keeping with the EU Energy Tax Directive, Member States must apply at least the EU minimum rates of excise on fuels in such circumstances and that any further favourable excise treatment is not allowable.  In this regard the Commission&rsquo;s decision was published on its website in March 2007.  At the Commission&rsquo;s behest my officials have indicated that Ireland will avail of the forthcoming Finance Bill to make the <Col N="1769"/>necessary legislative changes to conform with the Directive.  In the circumstances, the relevant line Departments which have primary responsibility in this regard are, in conjunction with my Department, exploring alternative non-tax support mechanisms that could be put in place where appropriate to maintain the assistance currently being provided, subject of course to compatibility with EU state aid requirements.  In the interim the reduced rates applicable to fuel used will be maintained.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information available on the repayments made under the Passenger Road Services Scheme between 2002 and 2006, is as follows:</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>A progress report by the Decentralisation Implementation Group was submitted to me and published on 8 October last.  The group reported that implementation of the Civil Service element of the Decentralisation Programme is progressing satisfactorily.  At the end of October 2007, over 3,000 staff had been assigned to decentralising posts.  Almost 1,300 of them are in place in 20 new locations, while the remainder are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available.  In addition to these 20 locations there are a further nine locations in which State agencies have established a presence.  It is envisaged that by the end of 2007 public services will be delivered from 33 of the decentralisation towns with approximately 2,000 staff transferred.  The precise numbers moving within that timeframe will depend on the availability of property as well as timeframes for completion of fit-out and installation of necessary information communications technology and telecommunication cabling and equipment.</P>
        <P>The OPW conducts a review of the property timeframes for permanent accommodation on an ongoing basis.  Based on its experience to date in relation to timeframes for property selection and acquisition, brief and design issues, tendering <Col N="1770"/>periods, planning issues and contractual arrangements, it has provided an updated schedule of the likely availability of accommodation.  In that context I expect that the Civil Service elements of the programme should be substantially completed by the end of 2009.  While there are a number of challenges remaining, which have been identified by the DIG in its latest report, my Department and the wider management of the public service will continue to work closely with staff representatives to seek appropriate solutions to address the concerns of the professional and technical staff in the civil service and those employed in state agencies, while also ensuring the delivery of the Government programme.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that the Government is determined to make progress towards advancing the State agency elements of the programme during the lifetime of this administration.  In this context I refer the House to the remarks of the Decentralisation Implementation Group that over 1,000 employees of State agencies have expressed a preference on the CAF to relocate with either another public service or Civil Service organisation and it is not unreasonable that these applicants would expect that their applications would have been advanced at this stage.  The recent Labour Court recommendation in relation to F&Aacute;S provides unions and management with a fresh opportunity to address this issue constructively.  My Department is currently pursuing this matter with ICTU.</P>

The precise numbers moving within that time frame will depend on the availability of property as well as timeframes for completion of fit-out and installation of necessary information communications technology and telecommunication cabling and equipment.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 and 168 together.</P>
        <P>The Director General of the Central Statistics Office has sole responsibility for, and is independent in, deciding the statistical methodology and professional standards to be used in compiling the Consumer Price Index.  The index is designed to measure the change in the average level of the prices paid by consumers for goods and services.  It measures in index form the monthly changes in the cost of purchasing a representative basket of consumer goods and services.  Maintaining a moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance in restoring competitiveness.  We have no control over some of the factors influencing competitiveness, such as the exchange rate.  However, we must always seek to ensure that our domestic cost base does not undermine competitiveness.  In this context, it is important to maintain low inflation, pursue a sensible incomes policy and keep public spending growth at sustainable levels in the medium term.  This will allow us to keep the burden of taxation low, thus helping to maintain competitiveness and to maximise our economic potential.  Regarding wage costs, the Government remains focused, through the partnership process, on securing a responsible approach to earnings growth in the economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to note that the Commission has not adopted any proposal for EU tax harmonisation.  The Deputy may have in mind that the Commission services have been working at a technical level on developing a proposal in relation to a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB).  In view of the fact that the technical specifications for a CCCTB are only being developed by a Commission-led technical working group, it is not possible at this stage to estimate the economic impact of such a proposal.  However, Ireland&rsquo;s opposition to tax harmonisation is well known.  The Government&rsquo;s position has been clearly stated in the Programme for Government.  Articles 93 and 94 of the EC Treaty specifically provide that any taxation proposals from the EU Commission require the unanimous agreement of the Council of Ministers.  Ireland&rsquo;s stance should however not be misconstrued as one of opposition to European economic policy co-operation.  On the contrary Ireland has a long <Col N="1774"/>and distinguished record of advancing the European agenda, but corporate tax harmonisation is neither necessary nor good for Europe.  We do not see how it will advance European competitiveness or the Lisbon agenda or, indeed, how it will assist business generally.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 and 171 together.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive system of banking supervision is in place under both EU and domestic law to ensure that credit institutions do not put customers&rsquo; deposits at risk through imprudent lending practices.  Banking supervision encompasses the authorisation of banks and building societies, their prudential supervision on an ongoing basis and the development of supervisory guidance and requirements for their operation.  Prudential supervision involves monitoring the business of banks and building societies and how it is planned, managed, and controlled and checking compliance with statutory and non-statutory requirements.  This system of prudential regulation is administered in Ireland by the Financial Regulator, who can increase the level of surveillance of particular practices in circumstances that a concern arises.  The Financial Stability Report 2007 recently published by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland notes that the domestic banking sector has minimal direct investment in the Irish sub-prime residential mortgage market and that in any case the market is small in relative terms with generally modest average loan-to-value ratios.  As regards regulation of what is termed sub-prime lending in the domestic market, section 19 of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007 amended Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997 to provide for an appropriate system of authorisation and regulation of retail credit firms and home reversion providers.  The primary purpose of this amendment was to extend to customers of these firms <Col N="1775"/>the benefit of the consumer protections provided for in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.</P>

        <Quest> if, in view of the turmoil in the financial markets caused by the US sub-prime mortgage crisis, he is satisfied that there is adequate prudential supervision in operation by the Irish financial regulator over all the banking and financial sectors operating here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[30006/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always worth remembering that sound prudential supervision aimed at ensuring the continuing solvency and liquidity of banks provides the best protection for depositors.  As the Deputy is aware, Ireland&rsquo;s system of financial regulation is based largely on a comprehensive and detailed EU template and conforms to international best practice standards.  According to the IMF, our regulatory regime is up to the best international standards.  Additionally, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland indicated in its Financial Stability Report of 2007 that the stability of the Irish banking system remains robust when assessed by the usual indicators of financial health such as asset quality, profitability, solvency, liquidity and credit ratings.  The report states that the Irish market is characterised by limited involvement by mainstream banks in what is termed sub-prime lending, the relatively small size of the market and generally modest average loan-to-value ratios.  It states that domestic banks have no significant direct or indirect exposures to US sub-prime mortgages.  The Deputy may also wish to note that section 19 of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007 provides for a system of authorisation and regulation of retail credit firms and home reversion providers not previously subject to regulation.  This includes firms engaged in specialist or sub-prime lending.  The primary purpose of this amendment was to extend to customers of these firms the benefit of the protections provided for in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.</P>

	<P>A progress report by the Decentralisation Implementation Group was submitted to me and published on 8 October last.  The group reported that implementation of the Civil Service element of the Decentralisation Programme is progressing satisfactorily.  At the end of December 2006, over 2,400 staff had been assigned to decentralising posts in Dublin and this number had increased to over 3,000 at the end of October 2007.  Almost 1,300 of them are in place, in 20 new locations, while the rest are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location when accommodation becomes available.  In addition to these 20 locations there are a further nine locations in which State agencies have established a presence.  It is envisaged that by the end of 2007 public services will be delivered from 33 of the decentralisation towns with approximately 2,000 staff transferred.  The precise numbers moving within that timeframe will depend on the availability of property as well as timeframes for completion of fit-out and installation of necessary information communications technology and telecommunication cabling and equipment.  From the announcement of the Programme in December 2003, the focus has been on detailed planning and organisation of the property, staffing and business aspects.  The Decentralisation Implementation Group has considered it essential that organisations take the necessary time to prepare this groundwork to ensure effective implementation of a programme of this scale and complexity.  Its focus has not been on how speedily the programme can be achieved but how well.  It is important to remember that the programme is not just about moving public services.  It fundamentally impacts on the staff in those organisations, on their career choices and their expectations.</P>
        <P>While I remain confident that the public service will deliver this programme in a con<Col N="1777"/>sidered, sensible and sensitive manner, I am anxious to ensure that the momentum of the programme is maintained and developed.  In that context my Department has asked the Secretaries General of decentralising Departments to review these timeframes in association with the OPW and the Decentralisation Implementation Group to assess where earlier progress could be made either in relation to permanent accommodation or advance accommodation.  There are, however, a number of challenges remaining, which have been identified by the group in its latest report.  My Department and the wider management of the public service will continue to work closely with staff representatives to seek appropriate solutions to address the concerns of the professional and technical staff in the Civil Service and those employed in State agencies, while also ensuring the delivery of the Government programme.  With regard to the State agencies, the group has noted, in its most recent report that the pace of progress in relation to the State agency part of the programme continues to be slow.  The Government has always recognised that this aspect of the programme presents different challenges from that of the Civil Service but is determined to make progress towards the objective of moving all the State agency posts as announced in December 2003.  I anticipate considerable progress on this element of the programme over the lifetime of this Government.  With a view to advancing this aspect of the programme, the DIG is engaging in a round of meetings with each agency&rsquo;s CEO and the Secretary General of the parent Department in each case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Department of Finance does not have a breakdown of Stamp Duty receipts on an Exchequer basis, the Revenue Commissioners have provided a breakdown of Stamp Duty on a net receipts basis.  Revenue net receipts differ from Exchequer receipts due to accounting and timing issues.  Stamp Duty from <Col N="1780"/>Residential Properties on a Revenue net receipts basis for 2005 were &euro;945 million, or 35% of total net Stamp Duty receipts.  Stamp Duty from Residential Properties on a Revenue net receipts basis for 2006 were &euro;1,311 million, or 36% of total net Stamp Duty receipts.  Stamp Duty from Residential Properties on a Revenue net receipts basis for 2007, up to the end of September, were &euro;902 million, or 32% of total net Stamp Duty receipts.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to furnish precise figures of the VAT take from the residential housing sector, as the information furnished on VAT returns does not require the yield from particular sectors of trade to be identified.  However, based on data published by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the estimated yield from this sector, which includes VAT on repairs and maintenance, was &euro;2,841 million, or 24% of Exchequer VAT receipts, in 2005; &euro;3,247 million, or 24% of Exchequer VAT receipts, in 2006; and &euro;3,501 million, or 24% of the Budget VAT target in 2007.  The figure provided for 2007 is the estimated amount for the full year.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a breakdown of capital gains tax by <Col N="1781"/>asset type is not available.  However, it is possible to provide a proportional breakdown by reference to asset types of the aggregate consideration underlying chargeable gains, that is, the total selling price prior to allowing any offsets or deductions, for the tax year 2005.  On the basis of the 2005 Form 11 tax returns, 18% of the aggregate consideration was attributed to the disposal of residential property.  Data for the tax year 2006 is not yet available as the income tax returns for that year were not due for filing until October 2007.  Similarly, 2007 data will not be available until late 2008.  While tax revenues from Stamp Duties and Capital Gains Tax have made an increasing contribution to the Exchequer in recent years, it is important to put that contribution in context.  The Budget forecast of yields from Stamp Duties and CGT in 2007 together represent approximately 15% of tax revenues overall.  By contrast, the main four taxes &mdash; Income Tax, VAT, Corporation Tax and Excise Duties &mdash; together account for about 85% of expected revenues this year.  Care has been taken not to plan the public finances around the assumption that tax receipts from the property and wider construction sector continue to grow in future years as they have done previously.  The 2007 forecasts for Stamp Duties and CGT together assumed a modest increase over their 2006 out-turn on the basis that the property market would begin to ease back to more sustainable levels of growth.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as the information furnished on tax returns does not generally require the yield from a particular sector or sub-sector of economic activity to be identified, the precise figures of net yield of tax revenues collected in respect of the activities specified in the question cannot be readily identified.  Information can, however, be provided as to the estimated gross amounts of certain taxes paid (i.e. before allowing for repayments) by taxpayers in the construction industry.  This information is not yet available in respect of 2007.  The Revenue Commissioners have supplied the information in relation to 2005 and 2006.</P>

        <P>The sector identifier used on the tax records is based on the 4-digit &ldquo;NACE code (Rev. 1)&rdquo; which is an internationally recognised economic activity code system.  The NACE codes are not essential for the assessment and collection of taxes and duties and the correct allocation and maintenance of these codes is subject to the limit of available resources.  While the accuracy of the NACE codes on tax records is sufficient to underpin broad sector-based analyses there will undoubtedly be some inaccuracies at individual level.  This should be borne in mind when considering the information provided.   The figure provided for the estimated gross yield from the construction industry has been expanded to include the yield from activities and businesses, which are related either in whole or in part to the construction sector.  An example of these would be architecture, engineering and the manufacture of products used in construction but not real estate activities.</P>

	<P>Maintaining and improving Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position is imperative to ensure Ireland continues to grow strongly and remains an attractive location for inward foreign direct investment.  Recent IDA data shows that 2006 was another positive year with regard to new investment projects coming to Ireland. Some 71 new business projects, involving a total investment in the coming years of more than &euro;2.6 billion, were negotiated in 2006.  Some 54 Research and Development projects were sup<Col N="1784"/>ported involving a total investment in excess of &euro;470 million, an 81% increase over 2005, a record in number and value.  Over 85% of these were located outside Dublin.  Over 50% of all new jobs in IDA-backed projects now pay in excess of &euro;40,000 per annum.  Total employment in IDA supported companies has increased by a net 3,795 to 135,487, the highest gain since 2000.  I am confident that Ireland remains an attractive location for overseas investors.  Our burden of tax is low, and we have demonstrated that we pursue sensible budgetary policies.  Our workforce is highly skilled.   Infrastructural development has been prioritised.  These key policy orientations equip Ireland with the skills, infrastructure, facilities and overall operating environment that will allow us to compete effectively for projects at the upper end of the high skill/high wage spectrum, which is where our competitive advantage now lies.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Any apparent discrepancies in the totals in the above table are due to rounding of constituent figures.  The 2007 figures are not yet finalised and are subject to change.  The Budget 2007 forecast for Stamp Duty was for &euro;3,925 million to be collected in 2007, a year-on-year growth rate of 5.6% above the 2006 out-turn.  Stamp Duty was expected to represent 8% of total tax forecast for this year.  Stamp Duty at the end of October was &euro;472 million or 14.5% below profile.  This mainly reflects the return to more normal market conditions in land and property transactions generally.  In response to Question No. 209 of October 16 2007, I indicated that it is currently anticipated that the amount of revenue collected as Stamp Duties for 2007 will be short by about &euro;600 million below the Budget day forecast.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information requested in relation to repayments to PAYE taxpayers is that 663,837 repayments, amounting to &euro;418 million, were made in 2006 and 748,222 repayments, amounting to &euro;490 million, had been made in 2007 up to 16 November last.  The repayments made in 2006 refer to the years 2002 to 2006, inclusive.  The repayments made in 2007 refer to the years 2003 to 2007, inclusive.</P>
        <P>The PAYE system is designed to collect, in so far as possible, an employee&rsquo;s correct liability to <Col N="1786"/>income tax during the year.  This is achieved through a cumulative system where liability and reliefs are accumulated on a payday to payday basis.  In this way, at any point in time during the course of the year, the amount of tax deducted from the employee should be appropriate to his or her earnings up to that point.  In a large majority of cases the PAYE system collects the right amount of tax because people have claimed their due entitlements and employers have supplied income updates in their annual P35 returns.  However, some claims, such as for medical expenses relief, can generally only be made after the end of the tax year.  In relation to an assessment of underclaimed reliefs, the Revenue Commissioners can only allow reliefs and credits on the basis of the information that is known to them.  Consequently, there is no way to accurately assess underclaimed entitlements where changes in individual circumstances have not been notified by the people concerned.  However, in relation to the granting of credits and reliefs, the policy of the Revenue Commissioners is that, once claimed, the majority of these are generally carried forward automatically from year to year by the Revenue computer system.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners also send out claim forms automatically in certain circumstances where a claim is considered likely, for example, Med 1 claim forms for medical expenses relief are automatically sent out where such a claim has been made in the previous year.  In addition many of the more significant reliefs are now granted through the Tax Relief At Source arrangement.  For example, mortgage interest relief and medical insurance relief are provided at source through the taxpayer obtaining a reduction in repayments or premiums equivalent to the tax relief.  Recurring reliefs, like those for trade union subscriptions or bin charges, once claimed, are allowed on an ongoing basis and reappear each year in the taxpayer&rsquo;s certificate of tax credits.  As announced in Budget 2007, Revenue are now granting age-related tax credits <Col N="1787"/>automatically where a verified date of birth can be established through Revenue and Social Welfare records.  In addition, credit institutions have been enabled to operate DIRT-free accounts for those aged 65 and over and for those who are permanently incapacitated, where their income falls below the relevant income tax limits.  Previously, both categories had to reclaim the DIRT paid.  For 2008, Revenue plan to move to automatic repayment in respect of unreimbursed expenditure under the drugs refund scheme.  Also in 2008, tax relief on medical insurance paid by employers (that has been subject to benefit-in-kind taxation) will be automatically included in the employee tax credit.</P>

	<P>The annual contribution required as a percentage of salary to notionally fund pension benefits is Principal officer, 29%; Assistant Secretary, 32%; and Secretary General, 38%.  These figures show the estimated total cost of notionally funding the benefits for each grade.  These costs are before any allowance is made for employee contributions which, on average, amount to approximately 5% of pay for those to whom a personal pension contribution applies.  Certain categories, such as civil servants recruited prior to 6 April 1995, do not make such a contribution and their salary scales are correspondingly lower by 5%.  The figures depend on the assumptions used.  In the case of Assistant Secretary and Secretary General, the assumptions generally follow those used in the recent Report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  For example, the same discount rates and mortality assumptions used by the Review Body were used.  In particular, the costs relate to the benefits which accrue during the period a person serves in each of the above grades; this approach follows that adopted by the <Col N="1789"/>Review Body.  The pay of grades below Assistant Secretary, including Principal, is being examined by the Public Service Benchmarking Body and the cost of their superannuation terms are being considered in that context.  The Benchmarking Body is due to report around the end of the year.  The Review Body advisors carried out an analysis of the cost of standard public service terms for those covered by its remit and the cost of the pension terms for a comparable employee in the private sector.  On the basis of this, the Review Body concluded that it should discount by 15% the rates it was recommending for public service posts, to take account of the greater value of the public service terms (see Chapter 3 of Report No 42 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector).</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.  As the EOCP concludes on 31 December 2007, no further capital or staffing grants will be made available under it.  The NCIP came into effect from 1 January 2006, with an allocation of &euro;575 million for the five-year period between 2006 and 2010.  This programme aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality childcare supports and services, which are grounded in an understanding of local needs.  It is building on the success of the EOCP and incorporates among its key objectives increasing the supply and improving the quality of early childhood care and education services.  Services eligible for support include those providing care for babies, full-day care, part-time, sessional playschool and other pre-school places, school age child care including &ldquo;wrap around&rdquo; child care places, and childminding.  Special consideration is given to supporting services which provide a range of these services.</P>
        <P>Eligibility for capital grant funding under the NCIP is assessed under a number of criteria &mdash; chiefly the nature and extent of the need locally for the service proposed, the applicant&rsquo;s capacity to deliver the project proposed and value for money.  All proposals are expected to demonstrate how they will increase the supply of quality child care and community-based projects are expected to demonstrate a focus on disadvantage.  The maximum capital grants available under the scheme for the building or expansion of childcare <Col N="1790"/>facilities are &euro;1.2 million per facility for community-based not for profit providers and &euro;100,000 per facility for private providers, subject to a maximum of 75% of the total cost, and a maximum of &euro;500,000 for multiple services in different catchment areas.  In addition, a small grant scheme is available for Parent and Toddler Groups.</P>
        <P>Following a review of the operation of the Programme to date, and in the context of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP, revised guidelines for the assessment of capital applications were introduced in April this year.  These include provision for grant funding of up to &euro;5,000 per additional place for short-time sessional playgroups and similar services which do not meet the minimum operating periods required under the main grant schemes.  Subject to the programme criteria, grant aid is also available to assist in the renovation and equipment of existing services, including playschools.  To apply for NCIP funding applicants should contact their local City or County Childcare Committee which will provide advice and assistance in the completion of applications.  Staffing funding under the EOCP will be succeeded by the new Community Childcare Subvention Scheme under the NCIP from 2008.  This scheme has been allocated &euro;153 million over the next three years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme.  Under the new scheme, community not-for profit services will be grant aided according to the service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  In turn, the subvention received by the services will be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients under the EOCP staffing scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1 July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing child care services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which is currently being  received from applicants.  If appropriate, any adjustments necessary to secure the best outcomes for child care services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data, well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>

Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.  As the Deputy may be aware, an additional sum of &euro;75 million for revenue purposes was provided to the Health Service Executive for Disability Services in the 2007 Budget.  This amount incorporates the 2007 element of the Government&rsquo;s multi-annual investment programme for the National Disability Strategy.  This Strategy is committed to enhancing, the level and range of multidisciplinary support services to adults and children with an intellectual, physical and sensory disability and those with autism, including therapy services.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to people and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of GP services.  In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children who do not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.  The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs.  In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards.  They are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.  As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The Disability Federation of Ireland in its pre-budget submission estimated the cost of introducing a payment of &euro;40 per week at &euro;183 million per annum but I am not aware of the basis for this estimate.  There are significant limitations on the available data to enable an estimate of the cost of introducing a payment of &euro;40 per week.  The annual cost would be dependent on the eligibility criteria and consequently the number of persons eligible.  Significant assistance is available to mitigate the impact of the additional costs incurred by people with a disability.  These measures include weekly/monthly allowances, additional income supports, other benefits such as medical cards, free travel and mobility allowance, and tax concessions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 262 together.</P>
        <P>The Revised Estimates Volume 2007 provides &euro;13,431 million for day-to-day spending by the Health Service Executive which is an increase of 10.6% over the underlying 2006 provision.  This substantial increase in funding means that the HSE is being well resourced.  It comes in the wake of substantial year-on-year increases for some time now.  The role of the board and accounting officer of the HSE is to deliver Health Services within the funding approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The management of resources and service planning is a matter for the HSE in the first instance.  That is why the HSE was established to provide for the &ldquo;single delivery of health services&rdquo;.  The Health (Amendment) Act 2004 explicitly provides for the preparation by the HSE of a Service Plan in line with approved funding; for the Service Plan to be submitted to the Minister for approval; and for the Service Plan to reach to all services / business levels within the HSE.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that to date this year, the HSE has exceeded the Service Plan targets in certain service areas, including acute hospital services, and has treated substantially more people than in the same period last year.   In order to deal with expenditure pressures in recent months and to remain within approved funding, the HSE has put in place a number of corrective measures.  Accordingly, HSE Management has decided that all foreign travel is cancelled for the remainder of the year, all Hotel bookings for meetings etc. are cancelled for the remainder of the year, all recruitment is suspended temporarily after which the situation will be reviewed and all &ldquo;non-frontline&rdquo; expenditure is to be critically reviewed.  It is intended that these measures will not impact on &ldquo;frontline&rdquo; services which will be maintained in line with the National Service Plan and provision is made that where critical or essential vacancies arise, they may be filled by re-deployment of existing staff.  The HSE is ensuring that patient care is not compromised and that it continues to maintain and improve the high level of service being provided.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 to 194, inclusive, 212 to 214, inclusive, and 264 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has received correspondence from the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and other interested parties concerning the new reimbursement pricing arrangements for drugs and medicines under the GMS and community drugs schemes.  Officials from my Department have met with the HSE on a number of occasions to discuss wholesaler and pharmacy issues.  I have also, with officials from my Department, met with the organisations, including the one named by the Deputy, representing the wholesaler sector.  These meetings covered a wide agenda and the discussions that took place were frank but very useful in seeking to move this process forward.  As the Health Service Executive has operational responsibility, under the Health Act 2004, for the management and delivery of health and personal social services no direct meetings have taken place between my Department and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union on the matters referred to.</P>
        <P>I have previously outlined in detail to the Oireachtas the legal provisions under competition law which prevent the Health Service Executive from negotiating with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union on fees, prices or margins for their members.  When it became clear that the HSE could not negotiate with pharmacists or wholesalers on fees or margins, a detailed, fair and transparent consultation process, including independent economic analysis and public consultation, was carried out to inform the final determination of the new reimbursement pricing arrangements for drugs and medicines under the GMS and community drugs schemes.  These new arrangements were announced by the HSE on 17 September 2007.</P>
        <P>In regard to the new reimbursement prices, the main wholesaler companies have confirmed to the HSE that they will charge community pharmacists the same price for these drugs and medicines as pharmacists will be reimbursed by the HSE for these products.  Furthermore, there are no changes planned by the HSE to the operation of the GMS medical card and community drugs schemes, and all patients continue to receive their entitlements in the normal way.  My Department understands that the HSE has not received formal notification from any community pharmacist regarding cessation of services under the GMS and community drugs schemes.  I do not accept <Col N="1796"/>that some pharmacists may not be able to continue to provide a service under the GMS and community drug schemes, nor do I accept there is any basis for community pharmacists threatening to withdraw from these schemes and it would be disappointing if some pharmacists seek to threaten and scare the most vulnerable members of our society in this manner.</P>
        <P>To address concerns expressed by the IPU, on behalf of community pharmacists, about the implications of the legal advice on competition law on their right to negotiate fees through the union, a process of dialogue was established, chaired by Bill Shipsey SC, to explore ways in which concerns raised by the IPU about the implications of this legal advice might be addressed.  Despite the suspension of this process during the recent withdrawal by individual pharmacists of methadone services, there has recently been renewed engagement between the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the HSE under the auspices of Mr. Shipsey.  I am also exploring in consultation with the Attorney General, the other relevant Departments, and the HSE the best way of progressing the development of a new contract with pharmacists.</P>

	<P>Section 46 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004, which was commenced on 5 November 2007, requires that couples intending to marry in the State must give a minimum of 3 months notice of intention to a registrar and that they must present in person at the office of the registrar and sign a declaration that there is no impediment to their marriage in the presence of the registrar. When they visit the office, the registrar explains the procedures and requirements for marriage to couples and, if everything is in order, a Marriage Registration Form, which must be signed by the parties, the solemniser and the witnesses following the ceremony, and is a legal requirement for a valid marriage, is issued to the couple. These procedures give the highest possible degree of assurance to couples and the registrar that everything is in order and that the marriage can proceed as intended.</P>
       <P>Section 46 (3) of the Act provides for a fee, to be prescribed in regulations, for this service. The fee is set at &euro;150 in the Civil Registration (Marriages) (Fees) Regulations 2007. Prior to the introduction of the new procedures, various fees for services such as entries in the Marriage Notice Book, certificates of such entries, licences for marriage, entry of caveats, solemnisation of marriages, issuing registered letters containing copies of notices and fees for registration of places of public worship were payable under the Civil <?oasys _dc28- ?>Registration (Marriages) (Fees) Regulations 2005.<?oasys _dc0- ?> The requirement for these services, which varied according to the religious ceremony involved and whether the ceremony was civil or religious, was abolished by the introduction of the new provisions and the fees incurred have been replaced by the notification fee, which is payable by all couples, irrespective of religious denomination or whether the ceremony is civil or religious.</P>
       <P Just="Left">Registrars are employed by the Health Service Executive and the notification fees collected will be retained by the HSE. The Civil Registration Service has been undergoing an extensive modernisation programme in recent years, at a cost of some 7 million Euro to date. Legislation dating back to the Victorian era has been thoroughly revised and replaced with the provisions of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 and registration procedures and records have been computerised, using the most up to date technology available. The notification fees will be paid to the HSE and it is anticipated that this will facilitate the delivery of an improved Civil Registration Service.</P>

I have allocated additional revenue funding of &euro;5.0m to the Service this year for this purpose and an additional 30 posts have been approved.  Women aged 25 to 44 years old will be screened every 3 years; women aged 45 to 60 will be screened every 5 years.  The Service is planning to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP. Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>
       <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

The Group requested a review of their current level of staffing grant support, and this was undertaken by Pobal, who administer the grants on behalf of the Office of the Minister for Children.  Following this review, the Group&rsquo;s request was considered by the Programme Appraisal Committee (PAC), which did not recommend additional funding for the Group, as their current level staffing grant is deemed <Col N="1807"/>appropriate for the level of service being provided.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Group in question has been approved funding under the NCIP Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS), and a letter of approval has issued this week from the Childcare Directorate of my Office for the period January 2008 to December 2010.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>At present, medical cards are granted primarily on the basis of means and individual circumstances.  Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  Persons aged seventy years and over are automatically entitled to a medical card, irrespective of means.  The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</P>
        <P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  In June 2006 I agreed with the HSE to raise the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.  For Medical Card and GP Visit Card applications, the HSE now considers an applicant&rsquo;s income after tax and PRSI are deducted, rather than total income.  Allowances are also made for expenses on childcare, rent and mortgage costs and the cost of travel to work.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group as a whole.  However, my Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and <Col N="1811"/>personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible.</P>

	<P>The Primary Care Strategy aims to increase health service capacity through the development of services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of occupational therapists, general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists and others.</P>
        <P>It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.  The HSE received funding totalling &euro;32m in 2006 and 2007 for the establishment of 200 Primary Care Teams, which altogether will involve the appointment of some 600 additional front-line professionals. The development of these teams will facilitate a significant increase in capacity, including public health nursing service capacity, to meet people&rsquo;s health and social care needs in the community.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed under the Towards 2016 agreement to the establishment of 300 Primary Care Teams by 2008; 400 by 2009; and 500 by 2011.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 247 to 250, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to provide 1,500 extra public acute beds. The co-location initiative which was announced in July 2005, aims to deliver about 1,000 of these additional beds for public patients through the development of private co-located hospitals on public hospital sites and the transfer of private activity to those hospitals.</P>
        <P>In service terms, this means that the co-located facility will be required to treat all the private patients that are currently treated in the public hospital subject to limited exceptions, for example A&amp;E, radiation oncology or organ transplantation services. In these exceptional cases, the public hospital will continue to provide such services to private as well as public patients. The Project Agreement which will apply to co-location projects will require the private hospital to have sufficient staff and other resources available to enable it to discharge its obligations as well as setting out requirements for clinical governance including quality assurance structures and compliance with best practice in terms of medical accreditation and patient outcomes.</P>
        <P>The Board of the Health Service Executive approved preferred bidders for the following six co-located hospital sites at its July meeting:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Waterford Regional Hospital</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Cork University Hospital</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Limerick Regional Hospital</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Sligo General Hospital</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Beaumont Hospital</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />St. James&rsquo;s Hospital</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">Since then the hospitals and the preferred bidders have been working towards finalising the Project Agreements for these sites.  It is expected that the Project Agreements for the sites will be concluded in the near future. Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital, which are also participating in the co-location initiative, are at an earlier stage of the procurement process. A tender in relation to the former is under consideration. It is expected that the invitation to tender (ITT) for Tallaght Hospital will issue in the near future.  My Department has asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Health Service Executive to forward directly to the Deputy details of the preferred bidder consortia and the proposed number of beds at each co-located site.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would <Col N="1821"/>otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 to 267, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>MRSA is not currently a notifiable disease.  However, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE collects data on MRSA.  The data is not available in the exact format or on an individual hospital basis as requested by the Deputy.  It is collected on the first episode of blood stream infection of MRSA per patient per quarter.  This system shows that there were 445 cases in 2002, 480 cases in 2003, 553 cases in 2004, 592 cases in 2005 and 588 in 2006.  Figures for the first six months of 2007 show that there were 292 cases.</P>
        <P>The HPSC carried out an analysis on the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) in Ireland data from 1999 to 2006 (inclusive).  During that time there were 79 cases of MRSA BSI (Bloodstream Infection) in children aged 14 years or less, 1,185 in patients aged 15-64 years, and 2,146 in patients aged 65 years or greater. Children accounted for 2.3% of the total cases.  In contrast, patients aged 65 or greater accounted for 62% of the total cases.  The latter is in keeping with the HPSC&rsquo;s previous finding that age is a significant risk factor for MRSA BSI.</P>
        <P>At present, it is not possible to identify the number of fatalities attributable directly or solely to MRSA as most cases involve significant co-morbidity factors.  There is currently no comprehensive data on MRSA related deaths.  The proposed Coroners Bill 2007 now defines MRSA as a reportable death.</P>
        <P>A new National Surveillance System has recently been established by the HSE to collect data and provide information on a quarterly basis on four key areas, to monitor Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) in our healthcare system:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. Staphylococcus bacteraemia;</P>
        <P LI="1">2. Antibiotic consumption;</P>
        <P LI="1">3. Alcohol gel use;</P>
        <P LI="1">4.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />MRSA surveillance in Intensive Care Units.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The first report is expected shortly and eventually 52 hospitals and 30 local health offices will report into the system.  I can assure the Deputy that tackling HCAIs, including MRSA continues to be a priority for the government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).</P>

	<P>Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) staffing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008, provided they enter the new Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) by submitting the data required as part of the application process of the new scheme.  Therefore I would urge Groups with applications outstanding to forward the completed applications to the Childcare Directorate of my Office as soon as possible to avail of the transitional funding.  This funding is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which has been received from applicants this month.</P>
        <P>Initially 780 Groups in receipt of EOCP staffing grants who had no compliance issues in respect of their current grant aid were requested to complete applications for the new subvention scheme.  Of these, some 550 had forwarded returns to the Childcare Directorate of my Office by last week.  A further 52 Groups were forwarded applications with a deadline of completion and return of later this month.  These returns, together with a significant number of Groups who have contacted the Childcare Directorate and the City/County Childcare Committees requesting an extension, are expected by the end of November.  The data from these returns is being collated and analysed and this analysis will be completed and published by early 2008.  If appropriate, adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question does not refer to any specific type of application but it is assumed may refer to applications to the General Register Office for certificates of life events or to applications for funding from the National Lottery.</P>
        <P>Statutory responsibility for the administration of Civil Registration in Ireland rests with An t&Aacute;rd-Chl&aacute;raithe&oacute;ir (Registrar General).  &Aacute;rd-Chl&aacute;raithe&oacute;ir receives applications from members of the public relating to the wide range of services provided by the General Register Office. The General Register Office is the central repository for records of all life events occurring in the State.</P>
        <P>A total of 36,000 applications were made in 2006 to the General Register Office for copies of entries in the registers of births, stillbirths, adoptions marriages and deaths (including photocopies).  Applications for certified copies are usually processed within 3 to 5 days. The General Register Office provides a walk-in service in respect of searches of its indexes. Applications in person for photocopies for research purposes are generally processed on a same day basis or at times of peak demand within 24 hours.</P>
        <P>Part 6 of the Civil Registration Act 2004, which includes a requirement that marriages be solemnised by a registered solemniser, came into effect from 5 November. The Act provides that religious bodies may apply to have members registered in the register of solemnisers. Nominating bodies were given notice of the requirement well in advance of the commencement date and approximately 5,000 applications have been processed.  Current applications are being processed on the day of receipt.</P>
        <P>To date there have been three applications for a correction to entries in the register of stillbirths.  The time taken to process such applications varies, depending on the complexity of each case.</P>
        <P>A total of 162 applications were made to my Department for funding from the National Lottery in 2007.  There is a protocol in my Department for processing applications for National Lottery grants.  When a completed application form is received it is registered and then forwarded to the relevant Service Division for its assessment, evaluation and recommendation. In addition, the views of the Health Service Executive are necessarily sought on a large number of applications.  All applications are then considered in the context of the recommendations of my Department and the HSE and the overall level of funds available. Assessments are carried out on an ongoing basis, and the funding is generally awarded twice a year. Every effort is made to decide applications as speedily as possible.</P>
        <P>To date grants have been approved in respect of 72 applications, 49 applications have been processed and are awaiting final approval, 34 appli<Col N="1825"/>cations are being assessed and 2 applications have been withdrawn. 5 applications were not properly completed and could not be processed.</P>

	<P>Separated children seeking asylum going missing from care is not a phenomenon unique to Ireland.  Evidence from other countries indicates this is a substantial problem.  The HSE have reported that 53 Unaccompanied Minors/Separated Children Seeking Asylum went missing from care in 2006 with 6 subsequently relocated, and that 27 Unaccompanied Minors/Separated Children Seeking Asylum went missing from care during the period Jan-Oct 2007 with 11 subsequently relocated.</P>
        <P>Most of the unaccompanied minors/separated children seeking asylum in Ireland are placed in the voluntary care of the Health Service Executive under Section 4 of the Child Care Act, 1991.  Approximately 270 young people of this group are currently in the care of the HSE.  The majority of unaccompanied minors/separated children seeking asylum are placed in residential care (i.e. hostel, registered children&rsquo;s centre) while others are placed in foster care and supported lodgings.  The HSE are devising a National Operational Policy for unaccompanied minors/separated children seeking asylum.  This is being finalised and it is understood to include the principle that all children in the care of the HSE should receive the same standard of care whether they be unaccompanied minors/separated children seeking asylum or indigenous children in care.  The policy will also reflect the principle of good practice that younger children under 12 should be placed in foster care with older less vulnerable young people placed in supported lodgings where appropriate.</P>
        <P>My Office has asked the HSE to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety and welfare of these young people.  The HSE has assured the Department that all possible steps are taken to protect these children within the resources available.  The 2001 &ldquo;Policy on Absence without Leave&rdquo; is being followed in respect of these children.</P>
        <P>Each child who goes missing is reported, (on an agreed template with photograph and physical description), to the following:</P>

        <P>The Task Force supports the establishment of first responder programmes and recommends that priority should be given to programmes, geographical locations and facilities identified as having the greatest need.  All programmes should be coordinated by the HSE ambulance services, with best practice guidance from the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council.</P>

	<P>The case referred to by the Deputy concerns the rights of a person who has undergone gender reassignment surgery to recognition of her acquired gender.  In particular, the person in question sought a declaration pursuant to section 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 that the Civil Registration Act 2004 is incompatible with the provisions of Articles 8, 12 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights in failing to allow for a correction to the person&rsquo;s birth registration.</P>
        <P>In a High Court judgement delivered on 19 October 2007, the judge indicated that he intends to issue a declaration of incompatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights.  Section 5(3) of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 provides that a copy of any order containing such a declaration be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 sitting days of the date when the order is made.</P>
        <P>The judgement delivered on 19 October was an oral judgement only.  The written judgement and finalised order of the Court are not yet available. <Col N="1828"/> When the order of the High Court becomes available, all the necessary arrangements will be made to comply with the requirements of section 5(3) of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 274 and 275 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A Forum on Fluoridation was established to review the fluoridation of public water supplies in Ireland. The Report of the Forum, published in 2002, concluded that water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly. The Forum recommended that the fluoridation of piped public water supplies should continue as a public health measure.</P>
        <P>The effectiveness of water fluoridation in preventing dental decay continues to be endorsed by a comprehensive range of international bodies including the World Health Organization, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Public Health Service and the United States Surgeon General, the FDI World Dental Federation and the International Association for Dental Research.  In addition, these bodies are also satisfied that ingestion of fluoride at optimal levels does not pose a threat to human health.</P>
        <P>The Forum on Fluoridation recommended that an Expert Body be established. The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health was set up in 2004 to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the Forum; to advise the Minister and evaluate ongoing research &mdash; including new emerging issues &mdash; on all aspects of fluoride and its delivery methods as an established health technology and as required and report to the Minister on matters of concern at her request or on its own <Col N="1829"/>initiative. More details on the Expert Body are available on their website <i>www.fluoridesandhealth.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Finally, the new Programme for Government contains a commitment to carry out a national study of total fluoride intake in the population and work on this study is underway.</P>

	<P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has informed me that there are currently 1560 level crossings on the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann network of which 73 are electronically operated, 204 are manually operated <Col N="1832"/>and 1283 are unmanned.  A programme of automation of manned crossings is underway and 40 have been automated since 2006. This programme will continue over the period of Transport 21.</P>
        <P>I am also informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that since 1999 538 unmanned crossings have been closed and upgrading works undertaken on 387. This programme of elimination/upgrading will continue but it is not proposed to automate the majority of these.  I understand from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that it is examining options for Reilly&rsquo;s Crossing and Ashtown crossing including both automation and grade separation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.</P>
         <?oasys _it1p0- ?><P>The Deputies may recall that I have answered Parliamentary Questions on this issue over the past year, including on 4 July 2007.  The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States.  In the Irish context, these derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.</P>
         <?oasys _it1p0- ?><P>While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, who are the deciding authority, have to date refused all such requests.  The Commission maintain that, in keeping with the EU Energy Tax Directive, Member States must apply at least the EU minimum rates of excise on fuels in such circumstances and that any further favourable excise treatment is not allowable. In this regard the Commission&rsquo;s decision was published to its website in March 2007.  At the Commission&rsquo;s behest my officials have indicated that Ireland will avail of the forthcoming Finance Bill to make the necessary legislative changes to conform with the Directive.</P>
         <?oasys _it1p0- ?><P>In the circumstances, the relevant line Departments who have primary responsibility in this regard are, in conjunction with my Department, exploring alternative non-tax support mechanisms that could be put in place where appropriate to maintain the assistance currently being provided, subject of course to compatibility with EU State Aid requirements.  In the interim the reduced rates applicable to fuel used will be maintained.</P>

        <Quest>   the steps he is taking to establish Cork and Shannon Airports as independent, debt-free authorities in line with the State Airports Act 2004 and previous written commitments by his Department.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[29494/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The State Airports Act, 2004 provides the framework for the establishment of Shannon and Cork as independent airports.  Under the Act, both the Minister for Finance and I will have to be satisfied as to the state of operational and financial readiness of the three airports before any vesting of assets can take place.</P>
        <P>The actual timing of airport restructuring will depend on the creation of the appropriate conditions that will ensure the financial sustainability of each of the three State Airports.  The restructuring process will require coordinated strategies for the achievement of operational and financial readiness of each airport.  In this regard, the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) has a key role to play in finalizing the financial framework and coordinating the individual business plans for the three airports that will enable airport separation to take place.</P>
        <P>Shannon Airport Authority (SAA) recently submitted its business plan to the DAA.  I under<Col N="1835"/>stand that there will shortly be engagement between the two parties on the plan content.</P>
        <P>In parallel with this I would also expect a similar engagement to occur between the Cork Airport Authority and the DAA relating to the Cork airport business plan once that plan has been submitted to the DAA.</P>
        <P>Clearly, the debt issue is crucial to the Cork business planning process and there will have to be agreement on this point between the Cork Airport Authority and the Dublin Airport Authority DAA, before the Cork business plan can be completed and submitted to the Minister for Finance and myself.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s position is that the funding of the new terminal and other works at Cork Airport will have to take account, not only of what is commercially and financially feasible for Cork Airport, but also what is commercially and financially feasible for the Dublin Airport Authority.</P>
        <P>Subject to satisfactory progress being made on the plans, I await the DAA&rsquo;s overall considered views on airport separation to enable the plans to be examined by the Minister for Finance and myself.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to previous replies to Questions Nos. 217 and 233 of the 13th of November and Question No. 172 the 7th of November.</P>
        <P>My Department has received preliminary proposals from Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann in relation to the provision of additional terminal capacity at Broadstone.  These proposals envisage the development of a new terminal station at Broadstone and the reinstatement of the 2.5 km double track spur to Glasnevin Junction.  I understand they do not provide for a station or stations between Broadstone and Glasnevin Junction.</P>
        <P>Booz Alan Hamilton are expected to report on this by the end of this month.  On receipt of the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann proposal in relation to the use of the Broadstone alignment, my Department requested Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) under the terms of this contract, to provide advice in accordance with the following terms of reference: The Department is seeking independent advice from BAH on the optimal transport use of the Broadstone alignment taking account of the capi<Col N="1836"/>tal investment framework under Transport 21 and the possible future strategic rail transport requirements in the Greater Dublin Area.  The Department is seeking a review of work already carried out by the transport agencies in relation to: The transport case for the reopening of the Broadstone station and the reinstatement of the double track section as proposed by Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann, whether the reopening of the Broadstone station, as proposed by Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann, best meets the deficit in city centre terminal capacity having regard to the capital framework in Transport 21, previous Exchequer investment in Docklands station, the location of Broadstone, the planned Interconnector and the future strategic requirements of the heavy rail commuter network in the Greater Dublin Area; the transport case for a light rail line to Liffey Junction through Broadstone, and whether such a line best meets the possible future requirements for a light rail connection to north-west Dublin and the future strategic transport requirements of north-west Dublin, whether such a line could be provided by an alternative on-street alignment, which would meet the same objective, within the capital framework of Transport 21 having regard to the future strategic transport requirements in the area.</P>
        <P>The ultimate aim of the assignment is for BAH to provide an analysis of the respective merits (pros and cons) of the two proposals (heavy rail and LUAS) for the use of the Broadstone alignment and provide advice on the optimal transport usage of the alignment in the development of an integrated public transport network in the Greater Dublin Area.

        <P>On receipt of the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann proposal in relation to the use of the Broadstone alignment, my Department requested Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) under the terms of this contract, to provide advice in accordance with the following terms of reference: The Department is seeking independent advice from BAH on the optimal transport use of the Broadstone alignment taking <Col N="1837"/>account of the capital investment framework under Transport 21 and the possible future strategic rail transport requirements in the Greater Dublin Area.  The Department is seeking a review of work already carried out by the transport agencies in relation to: The transport case for the reopening of the Broadstone station and the reinstatement of the double track section as proposed by Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann, whether the reopening of the Broadstone station, as proposed by Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann, best meets the deficit in city centre terminal capacity having regard to the capital framework in Transport 21, previous Exchequer investment in Docklands station, the location of Broadstone, the planned Interconnector and the future strategic requirements of the heavy rail commuter network in the Greater Dublin Area; the transport case for a light rail line to Liffey Junction through Broadstone, and whether such a line best meets the possible future requirements for a light rail connection to north-west Dublin and the future strategic transport requirements of north-west Dublin, whether such a line could be provided by an alternative on-street alignment, which would meet the same objective, within the capital framework of Transport 21 having regard to the future strategic transport requirements in the area.</P>
        <P>Advice should be provided on a phased basis, through a series of reports to the Department, in line with a timeframe to be discussed and agreed between BAH and the Department.  The ultimate aim of the assignment is for BAH to provide an analysis of the respective merits (pros and cons) of the two proposals (heavy rail and LUAS) for the use of the Broadstone alignment and provide advice on the optimal transport usage of the alignment in the development of an integrated public transport network in the Greater Dublin Area.

Public transport is now becoming a viable alternative to the use of the private car in Dublin and the NDP investment has provided a good basis for achieving significant modal shift under the planned improvements under Transport 21.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 to 296, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The questions posed by the Deputy include requests for a range of statistical information relating to the licensing of public bus services operated by private bus operators.  The information that is available to my Department is being collated and will be forwarded to the Deputy under separate cover in the coming days.</P>
        <P>Those data will include details of all 562 licences currently on issue.  However all information relating to applications that are being processed or applications that were not approved, including details relating to the identity of the <Col N="1840"/>applicant and the services to which the application relates, require the protection of the commercial interest of the applications and are, therefore, treated as confidential and as a result will not form part of the data that will be supplied.</P>
        <P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, as amended, provides the statutory basis for regulating the provision of public bus services by private bus operators.  The Act provides for the grant of annual continuous licences, annual seasonal licences and occasional licences.</P>
        <P>Section 11 of the Act establishes specific criteria for the determination of applications, which provide that: The service is required in the public interest having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service; whether the service is sufficient in terms of frequency and duration to meet the requirements of the public; whether the applicant has the organisation and equipment necessary to carry out the service.  Failure to meet the test established by reference to those criteria will result in the refusal of an application.</P>
        <P>The remit of the 1932 Act does not extend to the operation of services by Bus Eireann or Dublin Bus.  However both of those companies are required to notify my Department of the introduction of new services or the alteration of existing services.  Where proposed services by either company are deemed to be in competition with services that are the subject of a licence under the 1932 Act, they are required to obtain my consent under section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 before they can introduce such services.</P>
        <P>The assessment process applicable to the consideration of a licence application, including the length of such consideration, reflects in the first instance on the type of service to which the application relates.  Because of their nature, applications for occasional licences are processed on an immediate basis provided the data required to support their consideration are made available.  Applications for annual licences are generally dealt with on a first come, first served basis.  However the processing of applications is critically influenced by issues such as the complexity of the application or the presence of prior services on the route, or part of the route, to which the application relates.  The presence of prior applications for a licence from other private operators, or a notification from Dublin Bus or Bus Eireann on a route, necessitates that the consideration of a subsequent application must be held in abeyance until the prior application has been determined.  Accordingly it is not possible to establish a specific time frame within which all licence applications are assessed.  However, where applications are straightforward, they are processed within a matter of weeks.</P>
        <P>Applicants are kept informed of the position in relation to each application and detailed guide<Col N="1841"/>lines relating to the assessment of applications are made available to all prospective applicants.  The guidelines are published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  All licences issued under the Road Transport Act 1932 have standard conditions associated with them and, depending on particular circumstances, additional conditions may be attached.  This is particularly the case where there is a need to avoid head to head running with an existing operator on a route.  The standard conditions include a requirement to adhere to relevant transport and road safety legislation, to introduce all licensed services within a certain timeframe and to adhere to the approved timetable.  Compliance with the conditions imposed is the responsibility of the service operator in each instance.</P>
        <P>The operation of a passenger road service without a licence issued by my Department is a criminal offence and the enforcement of such activity is a matter in the first instance for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Accordingly my Department does not have statistical data available in relation to the numbers of instances where the Garda&iacute; have instigated prosecutions against unlicensed operators.</P>
        <P>It has long been recognised that the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, is in need of significant reform so that the legislative provisions better reflect the realities of modern transport services.  The reform programme for the public transport market that I am pursuing will address these needs.  In the meantime, my Department will continue to promote improvements in the administration of the bus licensing service based on the principles of due process and fair procedures.</P>

The remainder of the new fleet will be delivered and brought into service by the Spring of 2009.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has to secure acceptance of the Safety assessment of the new rolling stock from the Railway Safety Commission before it can be introduced into service.  The deployment <Col N="1842"/>of the railcars on particular services is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.

While recognising that Pakistan faces threats to its peace and security, we are firmly of the view that stability and development can only be achieved through democracy and the rule of law.  Along with our EU colleagues, and as has been clearly stated to the Pakistani Ambassador, the Government calls on the Government of Pakistan to take urgent action to restore the Constitution; to ensure that commitments on holding free and fair elections on schedule in January are respected in full, and that the necessary conditions to ensure this are put in place; for President Musharraf to honour his commitment to step down as Chief of Army Staff; to release all political prisoners, including members of the judiciary, lawyers, journalists and human rights defenders; to pursue reconciliation with the political opposition; and to relax media restrictions.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is Irish Aid&rsquo;s Headquarters, will decentralise to Limerick.  This is scheduled to take place in early 2008 on completion and fit-out of the permanent premises in Henry Street. Good progress has been made and personnel have either been assigned to, or identified for, 103 posts or approximately 83% of the 124 posts scheduled to be decentralised.</P>
        <P>An advance party involving 55 staff has already decentralised to interim office premises in Limerick.  Forty-nine of these were Dublin-based applicants and the remaining 6 were from provincial locations.

However, other officers may have chosen Limerick as lower preference i.e. anything from 2nd to 10th preference.  It is in the nature of the process that the numbers involved change over time as more applications are received and as assignments are made, or as some of those who applied withdraw or amend their applications.</P>

	<P>My Department does not provide direct funding or grants to businesses but provides funding to a number of State Agencies, including the County and City Enterprise Boards, Enterprise Ireland and F&Aacute;S, through whom assistance is delivered directly to businesses.</P>
        <P>The 35 County and City Enterprise Boards provide a source of support to small businesses with 10 employees or fewer.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants.  All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of enterprises provided that the projects, which should generally be in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector, have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities.  In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.</P>
        <P>I would suggest that the people concerned should, in the first instance, make direct contact with their local CEB and explore what level of assistance, if any, may be available to them.  Contact details for individual CEBs can be found by accessing the following website; www.enterpriseboards.ie.</P>

        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s participation in this competition, involving 49 countries with 824 participants in 47 skills areas, benchmarks our strong craft/technical vocational education training against the technological advances in training in other countries.  The WorldSkills competition was established with the aim of achieving world-class standards and competencies in commerce, services and industry. Ireland first competed in 1957 and has hosted the competition in Dublin in 1963 and in Cork in 1979.</P>
        <P>WorldSkills Council Ireland manages the selection, training and participation of Ireland&rsquo;s team for the WorldSkills competition.  I understand that the Council is chaired by the Department of Education and Science and is representative of the various partners in vocational education and training including the Department of Education and Science, F&Aacute;S, Institutes of Technology, the Dublin Institute of Technology, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Irish Vocational Education Association.</P>
        <P>The WorldSkills competition is held every two years. Prior to the 2007 competition in Japan the last three competitions were held as follows: 2005 Helsinki, Finland; 2003 St. Gallen, Switzerland; 2001 Seoul, Korea.</P>

        <Quest> the strategy the Government have in relation to job creation and re-training in the Border counties, specifically in County Donegal; if Enterprise Ireland, IDA and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta have a unified approach to same; the amount of jobs envisaged in the future; and the time-frame for their creation. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite past difficulties in County Donegal, due to the demise of traditional industries such as agriculture, fishing and textiles, there is clear evidence that the county is successfully engaged in a transition to the new economy.  Live register figures at 8,340 and 8,370 for September 2006 and 2007 respectively, are lower then any year going back to 1993.  The Interdepartmental Group Report on Donegal, which I launched last year, identified the various infrastructure developments required to support enterprise development in the County.  The report noted, not just that much progress had been made, but also that there were financial provisions available to complete major infrastructure projects, including new roads, to equip Donegal further as an attractive location for enterprise development.</P>
        <P>The State development agencies under the auspices of my Department, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the County Development Board and F&Aacute;S, as well as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta cooperate and liaise on an ongoing basis with a view to supporting the creation and maintenance of jobs in County Donegal.</P>
        <P>Donegal is a key target location for IDA with the County now competing for a different type of business to the labour intensive manufacturing, on which it relied successfully in the past.  Progress has been made in securing new high value investments from Pacificare, Pramerica, SITA and Abbott Diabetes with approximately 1,200 new jobs being added in the County by overseas firms over the last five years.  These companies continue to recruit and are actively seeking new staff.</P>
        <P>With regard to Enterprise Ireland input, during the years 2004 to 2006, a total of 1,156 jobs were created in Enterprise Ireland client companies in County Donegal as against job losses of 980 leaving a net gain of 176 jobs.  Since the beginning of 2004 Enterprise Ireland approved over &euro;15m in <Col N="1851"/>support to its client companies in Co. Donegal and made payments of over &euro;7.5m.  Evidence of continued support for enterprise development can be seen from my announcement on 19 November that Enterprise Ireland is to provide &euro;0.65m in support of a new Community Enterprise Centre in Ballybofey and Stranorlar, as well as an expansion of the North East Inishowen Tourist Development company in Moville.</P>
        <P>In addition to the foregoing, the role of the Donegal County Enterprise Board, funded by my Department, is to provide support to micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  Through the provision of both financial and non-financial support the Board supports individuals, firms and community groups provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.  Financial support is available in the form of Capital Grants, Employment Grants and Feasibility Study grants.  From the Board&rsquo;s inception in 1993 to-date they have paid out over &euro;6.7m in grant assistance to over 300 clients, which has assisted in the creation of 1,385 jobs.</P>
        <P>As regards re-training, which comes under the remit of F&Aacute;S, F&Aacute;S liaises on an ongoing basis with other State development agencies and industry in order to identify and meet the needs of workers.  F&Aacute;S has provided many tailored and specific programmes to meet the needs of workers in County Donegal, particularly in the context of the changing nature of employment as the County transitions from traditional industries to new knowledge based sectors.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that supports and initiatives for enterprise creation in County Donegal is, and will remain, a priority for the State development agencies under the auspices of my Department.</P>

However while the marriage is being <Col N="1852"/>validated the non EEA national requires an employment permit.  The current policy in relation to new first time work permits will apply to all such applications.  This includes the requirement for a minimum gross salary of &euro;30,000 and a labour market needs test.

	<P>My Department <Col N="1855"/>is required to relocate 250 posts to Carlow under the Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation Programme and this is planned to occur by the end of 2009.  In order to accommodate staff who wished to move earlier than the projected building completion date of late 2009, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, opened an advance office in Carlow on July 30th 2007.   </P>
        <P>The number of posts in this decentralised advance office is 98.  Of the staff in place in this office, 37 were decentralised from locations outside Dublin with the remainder decentralised from Dublin.  The number of posts in Business Units decentralising to Carlow is 288.  As well as the 98 posts already decentralised to Carlow, my Department has 47 staff due to decentralise in the substantive move scheduled for 2009, with a further 39 Carlow-bound applicants yet to be assigned from other Departments. It is hoped to have all decentralising posts filled in sufficient time to ensure that staff are adequately trained in advance of the move to Carlow.  Ninety-eight staff currently in my Department have applied to decentralise with other Departments.  Of these staff, 16 are based outside of Dublin.</P>

        <P>In order to qualify for rent supplement a person must satisfy a number of conditions including; the person must be a bona fide tenant, must be habitually resident, must have a housing need and must satisfy a means test. In addition, the Executive must be satisfied that the accommodation is suited to the persons needs and the rent payable is within the prescribed limits.</P>
        <P>In the case of private rent accommodation anti-social behaviour by a tenant is a matter for the landlord in the first instance. There are a number of avenues open to landlords in such cases, including the mediation service for landlords and tenants operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board. If necessary, the landlord may seek termination of the tenancy which, if effected, would result in the termination of rent supplement.</P>
        <P>Social Welfare legislation provides the Health Service Executive with the authority to refuse, suspend or terminate payment of a rent supplement in the case of a person who has been required to deliver up possession of a dwelling provided by a housing authority or an approved body where the reasons for that requirement include anti-social behaviour or the interests of good estate management.

	<P>The Construction Federation Operatives Pensions Scheme, was first put in place in  1965, and operates as a Registered Employment Agreement under the Industrial Relations Acts. There is a statutory obligation on employers to register eligible employees in the scheme and to pay the necessary contributions. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The scheme was reformed in 2006 after an extended review process between employers and unions operating in the industry and a new scheme, known as the Construction Workers Pension Scheme, was registered with the Labour Court on the 19th May 2006. Compliance with the terms of the scheme is enforced through the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency, the Labour Court and the Labour Inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. My Department has no direct role in relation to the operation of the scheme.  The Pensions Board has a role in relation to the scheme in so far as compliance with the various aspects of the Pensions Act are concerned, including provisions relating to the remittance of pension con<Col N="1859"/>tributions to scheme trustees.

She has weekly means of &euro;309.00 derived from benefit of partner&rsquo;s earnings.  In practice the Department does not issue payments each week for such small amounts but this award will entitle her to credited pay related social insurance contributions.  The person concerned has appealed this decision and her case is currently with the Social Welfare Inspector for review.</P>
        <P>The person concerned also made a retrospective jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance application for the period from 23 May 2007 to 8 Aug 2007.

It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision and a form for this purpose has issued to her.  Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.

	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season. Fuel <Col N="1862"/>allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April and are not intended to meet the full cost of heating.</P>
        <P>Eligibility to the fuel allowance scheme is subject to means and other conditions. The main conditions that apply to the fuel allowance scheme are that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, must satisfy a means test and must either be living alone or with a qualifying dependant.</P>
        <P>People in receipt of short-term social welfare payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, short-term jobseeker&rsquo;s assistance (i.e. less than 13 weeks), illness benefit or occupational injuries benefit are not normally eligible to receive a fuel allowance.</P>
        <P>However, there is a special arrangement in place to pay the smokeless fuel allowance element (&euro;3.90 per week) to people who live in one of the designated urban smokeless fuel areas and who have been receiving one of these social welfare payment types for 13 weeks or more.</P>
        <P>To be eligible for this &lsquo;supplementary fuel allowance&rsquo;, applicants must satisfy the other standard conditions of the fuel allowance scheme, in particular that the combined weekly household income must not be more than &euro;100 above the reference old age contributory pension rate applicable to the family size. As with the standard fuel allowance, only one smokeless fuel allowance is payable per household. Applications for this smokeless fuel allowance should be made through the local social welfare office.</P>
        <P>Any changes to the fuel allowance scheme, such as allowing eligibility to people on short-term social welfare schemes, would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.</P>

	<P>My Department provides income support to carers by way of carer&rsquo;s allowance, <Col N="1863"/>carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant. The respite care grant, which is an annual payment for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention, is payable from age 16. The payment is made regardless of the carer&rsquo;s means or social insurance contributions but it is subject to certain qualifying conditions. From June 2007 the value of the grant was increased from &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,500 per year in respect of each care recipient. Carer&rsquo;s allowance, which provides income support to people who are providing certain older people or people with a disability with full time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit, is payable from age 18.</P>
        <P>As you are aware the Working Group on Long Term Care was established by the Minister for Health and Children and my predecessor, Minister Brennan, in January 2005 to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care. It comprises senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and my own Department. My officials have brought the issue of young carers to the attention of the Working Group. The report of that Working Group is being considered by Government.</P>
        <P>The national partnership agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; includes a commitment to a study of the extent to which children undertake inappropriate care roles in order to establish the extent and degree to which this issue arises and the levels of impact it has on the lives of children concerned. The office of the Minister for Children has the lead role in relation to this study and my Department will engage with it as appropriate.</P>
        <P>I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me. However, I consider that it is through the provision of health and education services rather than income that we can best support young carers.</P>

	<P>There are two strands of the scheme &mdash; back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) for self employed and back to work allowance (BTWA) for employees. The allowance is payable at a tapered rate of the qualifying payment. The self employed strand is payable at 100% of the qualifying payment in year one, 75% in year two, 50% in year three, and 25% in year <Col N="1864"/>four. Participants on the employee strand receive 75% of the qualifying payment in year one, 50% in year two, and 25% in year three. Participants also retain entitlement to certain other secondary benefits.</P>
        <P>In 2006 the total expenditure on the scheme was &euro;56,486m and there were 8,567 participants on the scheme at the year end.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that the proposal by Combat Poverty to extend the back to work allowance to five years with a phased reduction of 20% per year would result in a 20% increase in the overall cost of the back to work enterprise allowance strand and an increase of 100% in the overall cost of the back to work (employee) strand of the scheme.</P>

	<P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P>One of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; is the development of a national carer&rsquo;s strategy and this commitment is reiterated in the Programme for Government.  I am aware that one of the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs &ldquo;Report on the Position of Full Time Carers&rdquo; which was published in 2003 was that such a strategy should be developed.  I am pleased that we are now in a position to act on that recommendation.</P>
 <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The strategy will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community.  While social welfare supports for carers will clearly be a key issue in the strategy, other issues such as access to respite and other services, education, training and employment will also feature strongly. Co-operation between relevant Government departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.  For that reason all relevant departments and agencies will be involved in the strategy and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners.</P>
        <P>My officials have been in discussions with their colleagues in other relevant Departments in order to decide on the best approach to the development of the strategy.</P><Col N="1865"/>
        <P>In view of the need to ensure that appropriate arrangements and structures are in place to support its development, it will not be possible to complete the strategy by the end of this year as had been intended originally.</P>
        <P>An inter-Departmental working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, will be established in the coming weeks to draw up the strategy and I expect it to be completed by summer of 2008.</P>
        <P>The recent improvements in the income supports available from this Department represents major improvements in supports available to carers in the community.  The development of a national carer&rsquo;s strategy provides us with an opportunity to build further on these improvements and to consider other areas where progress can be made.</P>

	<P>No direct fund<Col N="1869"/>ing is provided from my Department to town councils or other local authorities for the provision of Christmas lights in the Irish language.</P>
        <P>However, funding has been provided by my Department under the Fo-Chiste Gn&oacute; of Ciste na Gaeilge to voluntary and business groups to assist them in promoting the Irish language among the local business community. In order to qualify for funding, a group must provide a business plan to include specific targets relating to the promotion of Irish and a clear exposition as to how these targets will be met.  Funding from my Department is provided on the basis that funding (a minimum of 25%) is secured by the applicant from the local authority or from the local business community. To date, two applications for funding to erect Christmas lights in Irish have been approved.</P>
        <P>While the Fo-Chiste Gn&oacute; remains open to new applications, I should say that funding is limited and it may not be possible to meet all requests made.</P>

	<P>Waterways Ireland informs me that as part of the feasibility study phase of the project referred to by the Deputy, consultants were commissioned to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment, which is at present being finalised. The associated Environmental Impact Statement is expected to be available before the end of 2007.  I understand that Waterways Ireland has also begun to conduct a series of information meetings with statutory bodies and other stakeholders.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware my Depart<Col N="1870"/>ment provides capital funding for projects through a number of schemes and programmes, details of which are available on the Department&rsquo;s website www.pobail.ie. Each of these schemes and grant programmes operated by my Department are governed by rules and eligibility criteria, which projects have to meet in order to qualify for funding.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Deputies specific query, under the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, which is administered by the Department, the standard conditions governing the provision of capital funding include the following:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The normal terms and conditions of the relevant Statutory Agency (generally the Local Authority) through whom the funding is channelled apply;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />All projects must be able to demonstrate a clear focus on the target group of the YPFSF.  To this end, there must be a clear policy of allowing access by the target group to all facilities. This is enforced, where appropriate, by the involvement of the Local Authorities and/or the VECs in the management structure. In the case of sports clubs and other organisations where Local Authorities or VECs are not directly involved in the management structure, the project must clearly demonstrate how the target group will be reached and quantify the extent of that access to the Statutory agency through whom the funding was channelled;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A schedule of access for the target group of the YPFSF is agreed in writing between the facility manager and the Local Development Group;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Project Promoters will be required to show that all initiatives are, where relevant, additional to and integrated with existing initiatives, particularly those funded by the Drugs Task Forces, and that the use of existing resources is maximised to the fullest extent possible;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />As part of the normal terms and conditions all promoters will be required to show that their rules and actions are in compliance with current anti- discrimination legislation and that all facilities and equipment are accessible by people with disabilities.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">My Department manages the Programme of Grants for Locally-Based Community and Voluntary Organisations which funds Refurbishment Grants for existing premises used by such groups. As the focus of this funding is providing moderate levels of once-off funding to local groups, no additional obligation is placed on the groups in terms of making their facilities more broadly <Col N="1871"/>available. However, the groups involved with this funding scheme are, in the main, broadly focused within their local communities and their premises would frequently be used for a wide range of community activities. Indeed the extent to which a proposal involves participation of the local community is one of the key criteria for the assessment of such applications.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides grant assistance towards the building or refurbishment of Community Facilities in Gaeltacht areas, such as Community Centres, Sport Facilities and Irish Colleges.  It is a condition of these grants that the facilities in question are made available to other community groups/committees at appropriate and agreed times.  Similar conditions apply in the case of capital grant assistance that is provided for non-Gaeltacht islands.</P>
        <P>The operating rules governing the delivery of the LEADER Programmes place no specific obligations on recipients of aid for sports clubs and community centres to make their facilities available to other community, voluntary and sporting groups, however recipients of funding are encouraged to do this.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism, provides co-funding to sports clubs and organisations under the RAPID and CL&Aacute;R Programmes. The terms and conditions of the Programme are set by that Department, and my department does not attach additional obligations on the recipient.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question 46 on 27 September 2007.  As indicated in that and replies to other questions, it is a matter for individual Departments to prioritise projects under the <Col N="1872"/>RAPID programme that come within their<?oasys _jy ?>remit.</P>
        <P>Subhead O of my Department&rsquo;s Vote provides for the capital costs of small projects in RAPID areas under a number of Leverage Schemes co-funded with other Departments and agencies and support for the RAPID Area Implementation Teams in the 46 RAPID areas. I am satisfied that the capital allocation of &euro;7.8m is sufficient to meet the funding commitments I have approved for these schemes.  I hope to in a position to offer new funding opportunities to RAPID areas as the Programme progresses and new demands are identified by the local AITs.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will wish to note just under &euro;2m has been committed to projects in the Tallaght RAPID areas under the Leverage Schemes of which &euro;1.2m has already been paid to projects.  Following the enactment of the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005, further funding was ring-fenced to support priority projects in RAPID areas.  Under the 2006 round of funding some &euro;1.25m has been allocated to the Tallaght RAPID area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 360 to 363, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>There was no census of agriculture conducted in 1997.  The nearest year for which farm data on a county basis is available is the census of agriculture conducted by the CSO in June 2000.  These numbers are reflected in table 1 for pigs, table 2 for poultry and table 3 for sheepmeat.  The 2007 data tables 1 and 2 have been obtained in accordance with the European Communities (Registration of Holdings and Identification of Animals) Regulations 1996 for pigs, and the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 (Registration of Poultry Premises) Order 2005 for poultry.  These figures relate to all holdings where pigs or poultry, (including egg holdings), are kept.</P>
        <P>The most recent data available regarding the sheep flock is the National Sheep and Goats Census, conducted in December 2006. According to this source, there were a total of 35,277 sheep flocks in the state in December 2006.  A breakdown of the data on a county basis is given in the table underneath.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s support ranges from the single farm payment to specific sectoral initiatives. <Col N="1876"/>For pigmeat, by far the main difficulty facing the pig sector is the very high cost of feed.</P>
        <P>The EU Council of Agriculture Ministers has, in response to the pressures on the international cereal and feed markets, agreed to suspend the obligation to set 10% of arable land aside.  This will ensure that more arable land is available for cereal cultivation in 2008.</P>
        <P>A scheme of financial assistance for the private storage of pigmeat has been in place since October 29.  This was adopted by the European Commission in response to a request from me and some other Member States.  I have also impressed on the Commission the desirability of export refunds for fresh and frozen pigmeat and this will be kept under consideration.</P>
        <P>Pigmeat features prominently in Bord Bia&rsquo;s programme of promotion on the home and export markets.  I have asked the Bord to intensify its Autumn pork and bacon promotion campaign in order to ensure that the market remains firm over the coming months.  Additional funding is being made available for this.  The Bord Bia quality assurance schemes are also a good tool in maintaining consumer confidence and, in this context; the pigmeat scheme is well established and managed.</P>
        <P>On the export front, Irish pork has access to important markets worldwide and pork is included in overseas promotion drives and market access initiatives.</P>
        <P>Other initiatives aimed at sustaining the pig industry that I have introduced include the extension of the farm waste management scheme to the pig sector and my Department&rsquo;s programme of financial assistance for the transition to welfare-friendly sow housing.</P>
        <P>For poultry, overall, it is my policy that this industry should develop to its full potential and be in a position to meet the demands of today&rsquo;s consumers and withstand the very strong competition from abroad.</P>
        <P>An Expert Group to advise on steps to ensure the future success of the industry will finalise its work shortly and I look forward to receiving its report.  That report is likely to cover areas such as production, marketing and promotion, environmental protection and animal welfare.</P>
        <P>I should also point out that Bord Bia, working in conjunction with the poultry industry and my Department, have in operation the very successful Chicken and Egg Quality Assurance Schemes which are viewed by consumers as a guarantee of quality and I am confident that the market position of our poultry will be enhanced as a result.  It is important that consumer confidence is maintained and I believe that the Quality Assurance Schemes will be a valuable tool in this regard.</P>
        <P>Recommendations for action to address the challenges facing the sheep sector in Ireland were set out in the report of the Sheep Strategy Development Group in June 2006 and in the report of the Implementation Group in April 2007.  The recommendations are supported by my <Col N="1877"/>Department through assistance for breeding and management, processing facilities, mechanical grading and quality assurance.  In addition and in line with the Group&rsquo;s report, sheep farmers are major beneficiaries of various schemes being operated by my Department.  Under REPS 4, a new supplementary measure aimed at sheep farmers has been introduced.  A budget of &euro;28m a year has been allocated to fund the proposed new supplementary measure at an overall cost of over &euro;170m for the period to 2013.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am aware that a significant number of family farm units have ceased mushroom production in this period in spite of the support provided.  While the level of output of the mushroom industry has remained relatively stable over the past ten years, production has moved from small-scale units to larger-scale operations.  In the 1980s and 1990s enterprises were established with relatively low capital costs and family labour was used to grow and pick the mushrooms.  Family and local labour has become scarce and more capital-intensive methods of production are required.  This has considerably raised the cost of mushroom enterprises.</P>
        <P>Under the NDP Horticulture Programme (2000&ndash;2006) my Department prioritised the mushroom sector for grant aid and it has paid out grants in excess of &euro;5m for approved investments of some &euro;14.5m to 190 applicants during the period 2000 -2006, many of these family farm units.  The new NDP Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of Commercial Horticulture (2007-2013) has just recently been launched and mushroom producers may apply for capital grant aid in respect of specialised equipment and facilities.</P>
        <P>The mushroom industry has also been greatly assisted by the EU Producer Organisation Scheme with &euro;23.4m of aid paid to organisations since 2000.  The key aim of the PO scheme is to enable fruit and vegetable growers, including mushroom growers, to concentrate supply, reduce production costs, stabilise producer incomes and use their combined strength to sell their product in a very competitive market environment.</P>

	<P>FIRM, the Food Institutional Research Measure funded by my Department, is the primary funding mechanism for competitive public good food research at third level (universities, Institutes of Technology and Teagasc).  FIRM and the earlier Non Commissioned Food Research Programme have funded foundation type, pre-commercial research <Col N="1881"/>since 1994 with the key aim of establishing a knowledge base and expertise in generic technologies that can support an innovative, consumer focused and sustainable food industry.  </P>
        <P>An analysis of 58 completed projects, which were funded under FIRM in the 2000-2006 period, has shown that 30 projects resulted in outputs with commercial potential.  Of the remaining 28, seven led to industry uptake or changes in industry behaviour and one secured funding from Enterprise Ireland for further development.  Another two led to the development of new methodologies.  Many projects funded under FIRM have drawn on consumer interest in quality foods and healthy lifestyles.  FIRM has funded the development of gluten free cereal based convenience foods, organic breads and confectionery and reduced fat cheese for pizza toppings.  Projects awarded funding in 2006 are tackling issues such as low-salt consumer products and functional foods.</P>
        <P>FIRM has increased collaboration and capacity building in Irish research centres and established a cadre of food researchers, trained to PhD and postdoctoral level, with specialist skills of benefit to the Irish food sector.  Projects are usually carried out by multi-disciplinary teams from two or more institutions, some linked with food manufacturers, which promotes centres of excellence.  Research outputs are communicated to industry by a dedicated dissemination team, RELAY.</P>
        <P>As it is a public good programme FIRM does not fund commercialization of research but research bodies and companies may avail of Enterprise Ireland support measures in this area.</P>
        <P>I consider that it is very important to secure optimum benefit for the food industry from the research results emanating from FIRM.  With that purpose in mind I recently established an industry led food Research Group representative of all stakeholders.  The Group will advise on themes and priorities for research under my Department&rsquo;s research programmes.  It will also interact with and provide an Irish view and input for the EU Technology Platform and the Framework Programme.</P>

	<P>The person named completed his contract in REPS 1 on 31 March 2001, having received all his full basic REPS payments.  He had also undertaken the organic farming supplementary measure, which was paid in arrears.  He applied for his fifth payment for this measure on 24 May 2001.  So that his application could be processed, he was asked on 25 May 2001 and again on 9 July 2001 to submit his organic licence for the final year of his REPS 1 contract.  He did not respond, and it emerged subsequently that the organic certification body had withdrawn his licence in November 2000.  </P>
        <P>He applied for REPS 2 in October 2001 but his application was rejected because the matter of his fifth organic payment was still unresolved and there was the possibility that my Department would have to ask him to return the four organic payments he had received.  The situation was reviewed within my Department and it was decided on 8 April 2003 that, exceptionally, the person named would not be asked to return those payments.</P>
        <P>He subsequently applied for REPS 2 in April 2004 and commenced his contract on 1 May 2004.  He has so far received his first four annual payments in full.</P>
        <P>The person named is now contending that he was at the loss of two and a half years&rsquo; REPS payments because of the delay in starting his REPS 2 contract.  However he was partially responsible for the delay due to his own failure to provide the documentation my Department requested after he applied for his fifth organic payment in 2001, and he was reasonably treated by not being asked to return the four organic payments he had received before his organic licence was withdrawn.  The series of events I have outlined has also been set out in a letter dated 19 September 2007 from my Department to the person named.  In this letter he was informed of his <Col N="1883"/>right to appeal to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office.</P>

	<P>In Budget 2007, &euro;8 million was made available over the period 2007-2009 for a new Bioenergy Scheme to incentivise farmers to plant miscanthus and willow for use as a renewable source of energy. The Scheme was launched in February 2007 to provide establishment grants for up to 50% of the costs associated with establishing miscanthus and willow, subject to a maximum grant of &euro;1,450 per hectare. The response to the Scheme was encouraging with some 700 hectares of miscanthus planted.  </P>
        <P>In addition to establishment grants, farmers who grow miscanthus can also qualify for a new National Energy Premium, of &euro;80 per hectare, which is payable in addition to the EU premium under the EU Energy Crops Scheme. It is intended that the &euro;80 payment will apply for three years and will be subject to a maximum ceiling per producer over the three years. The current maximum area per producer over the three-year period is 37.5 hectares. My Department is pursuing EU approval to increase this hectarage ceiling.</P>
        <P>I have extended the aid paid under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme (DAS) to areas planted with miscanthus. On the REPS area, farmers can receive an adjusted REPS 3 payment of &euro;155 per hectare increasing to &euro;189 per hectares in REPS 4, up to a maximum area on REPS holdings of 10 hectares or 25% whichever is the greater. On the DAS area, farmers can qualify for an adjusted rate of grant consisting of the appropriate DAS amount less the EU Premium available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme, subject to a maximum area of 10 hectares per applicant.</P>

	<P>I have now received the approval from the EU Commission of Ireland&rsquo;s state application to restructuring the fishing fleet.  This restructuring programme will permanently remove some 35% of the Irish Whitefish Fleet from the sea and is an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s Cawley Strategy to develop a restructured, profitable and sustainable seafood industry.</P>
        <P>I met with Fisheries Commissioner Borg last month and explained to him the urgency of getting his early approval of the scheme.  I am glad to say that he has now responded favourably to my request.  This substantial scheme will bring the Irish fleet into balance with sustainable available fishing opportunities.</P>
        <P>The total recommended budget for decommissioning recommended by the Cawley Strategy was &euro;66 million.  Of this amount &euro;58 million has been identified for the substantive element of the scheme, the decommissioning of the over 18 metre vessels in the polyvalent and beamer segments of the fishing fleet.  The eligibility criteria will be set down in the published scheme and will include length of vessel, age of vessel, recent track record in fishing.  The level of proposed payments under the scheme will be dependent on a range of criteria including age of vessel, track record of vessel, gross tonnage of vessel and accordingly the payment to individual vessels will depend on their individual situation.</P><Col N="1888"/>
        <P>In relation to tax treatment of payments, these are determined by the tax regime in place which is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  I have received proposals from industry representatives for a more favourable taxation regime, and I am currently examining these proposals.  I am working to deliver the necessary budget for the scheme for 2008 and future years and I am planning to launch the scheme as early as possible.</P>

	<P>The proposal by the Commission is for a Framework Directive intended to establish a common strategy across all Member States for the protection and sustainable use of soil. Its aims include the integration of soil concerns into other policies, preservation of soil functions within the context of sustainable use, prevention of threats to soil and mitigation of their effects, and restoration of degraded soils. While some of the measures relate to agriculture, the proposals would also extend to other sectors and as such a number of Government Departments are involved.</P>
        <P>The national position on this proposal was developed by the Department for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with input from my own Department, as well as from others.  I expressed my own views on the subject in relation to the agriculture sector at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council in January. It remains my view that any policies to be adopted in the proposed Soil Framework Directive must <Col N="1889"/>be flexible and adaptable given the diverse nature of soils in the Member States. In addition, they should not replicate or cut across existing measures and should avoid imposing an untoward financial burden on Member States. Ireland has also supported similar concerns expressed by a number of other Member States in relation to the proposals.</P>
        <P>Discussions have continued on a variety of compromise proposals and amendments intended to address the concerns of the various Member States. My Department will continue to work closely with the Department for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in putting forward the Irish position on the proposals.</P>

	<P>Since my appointment as Minister with responsibility for fisheries, I have been meeting the main representative bodies for the industry.  While inshore fishermen are represented, to an extent, by the main representative body for the catching sector, the Federation of Irish Fishermen, the inshore sector has not a formal representative structure in place.  Under the Shellfish Management Framework, put in place to develop management plans for shellfisheries around the coast, representatives of shellfisheries are on the Species Advisory Groups put in place under the Framework and these Groups are represented on the Implementation Group (SSIG) for the Seafood Strategy, Steering a New Course.  In the context of that Committee, Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) is facilitating discussions within the inshore sector on quota management and the interaction of the sector with quota management <Col N="1890"/>proposals currently being progressed under the SSIG. </P>
        <P>BIM has also been supporting the inshore representative on the SSIG in bringing forward proposals, developed by the Species Advisory Groups which will facilitate the introduction of management plans for the shellfisheries, for consideration.  The Seafood Strategy sets down a range of measures for the seafood industry which will provide support for the inshore sector and these proposals are currently being developed as part of the implementation programme for the Strategy.</P>
        <P>I consider that there are real opportunities for inshore fisheries development and I will endeavour to ensure that the Seafood Strategy provides the necessary support to ensure that this sector delivers fully on its potential.  I and my Department officials are willing to meet with representatives of the inshore sector to discuss their concerns at any suitable occasion.</P>

In January 2007 the report of the Seafood Industry Strategy Review Group, under the Chairmanship of Noel Cawley, was published.

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Implement a new, devolved, Fisheries Management Regime</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Establish a legal entity to oversee quota management.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Industry representatives have been mandated to bring forward proposals for quota management in line with the recommendations of the Seafood Strategy.   I understand that the industry representatives are developing a new model in this regard and are having internal discussions to ensure that all interest groups are consulted.   Discussions have also commenced between my Department and industry representatives to progress the implementation of these recommendations with a view to industry presenting formal proposals for my consideration.  I await an agreed set of proposals which I hope will take account of the situation and needs of all of the industry.</P>

	<P>The Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, provided for the establishment of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA). This independent authority was established on January 1st 2007. The Act clearly provides that the Authority is independent in the exercise of its functions and as such I have no remit as to its work programme or its relationships with other bodies.  The act states that the Authority can consist of up to three members. The Board currently consists of two members; Mr Peter Whelan, Executive Chairman <Col N="1893"/>and Mr Andrew Kinneen, Board Member. A competition has been held to recruit the third authority member. The successful candidate has been offered a contract of employment.</P>

	<P>Agreement was reached between the trustees of the three existing post primary schools in Skibbereen to amalgamate into a single school.</P>
        <P>The Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works (OPW) was requested to source a suitable site to facilitate this amalgamation. To date, however, the sourcing of a green field site has proved very difficult. Following advertisement a number of site were identified and examined. Those considered potentially suitable were then discussed with the Local Authority &mdash; Cork County Council. Following this process no site emerged that was deemed suitable from the perspective of both my Department/OPW and Cork County Council.</P>
        <P>Because of the difficulty in sourcing a green field site my Department decided to investigate the possibility of utilising the Rossa College site to facilitate the proposed building project. To this end a feasibility study of the site and building was commissioned in order to determine how best to provide for the long term accommodation needs of the proposed school. While the outcome of the feasibility study was indeed positive with regard to the provision of a new school there were some issues to be resolved regarding access and my Department requested the OPW to actively pursue a solution in this regard.</P>
        <P>My Department has been advised by the Trustees of the amalgamating schools that they are <Col N="1896"/>opposed to the use of the Rossa College as the site of amalgamation. However, because of the opposition to the Rossa College site this option is no longer being pursued.  My Department will continue to work to identify a suitable site for this amalgamation project and will keep the Trustees informed of progress in this regard.  Once a suitable site has been secured the project will then be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s School Building and Modernisation Programme.</P>

	<P>It is the policy of my Department to provide all new schools with access for all facilities and special toilets for disabled teachers and students. In addition, new schools with two or more storeys are provided with lifts. My Department advises school authorities and their design teams of accessibility requirements during the architectural planning process of projects.</P>
        <P>In relation to existing schools, my Department will respond as promptly as possible to requests from school authorities for funding for adaptations necessary to allow any person with mobility problems to access school buildings.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 393, 394, 415 and 421 together.</P>
        <P>The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) is a second &mdash; chance education initiative, which is funded by my Department, for unemployed persons who are at least 21 years of age and in receipt of certain social welfare payments for at least six months. It is operated through the Vocational Education Committees. The aim of the Scheme is to give unemployed people education and training opportunities which will develop and prepare them to go into paid employment, or on to further education opportunities leading to paid employment.</P>
        <P>A training allowance is paid by the VECs to students who previously drew unemployment benefit or assistance. The student ceases to receive an unemployment payment and, instead, receives a VTOS training allowance at a rate equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit, plus a payment for an adult or child dependant, if appropriate. VTOS students also retain their social welfare secondary benefits.</P>
        <P>The allowances for VTOS students for meals and travel referred to in the questions are equivalent to these paid to participants on F&Aacute;S training courses. VTOS students may be entitled to a travel allowance if they reside more than 3 miles from a centre. These allowances are increased periodically in line with increases in F&Aacute;S rates. The current rates are in operation since 2002. There are no plans to increase them in the near future.</P>

	<P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to the Dormant Accounts Funded Small Scale ICT Scheme for DEIS Schools. </P>
        <P>In April 2007, I announced details of this once-off scheme, which was among the priority funding measures approved for support in 2007 under the Educational Disadvantage category of the Dormant Account Fund. Eligibility for the scheme was restricted to the 873 primary and post primary schools that are participating in my Department&rsquo;s School Support Programme under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools).</P>
        <P>The scheme provides for small scale grants primarily for the purchase of the following types of ICT equipment to support children&rsquo;s learning and development:</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 396 to 398, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Results of a survey on the uptake of Stay Safe carried by the Child Abuse Prevention Programme, (CAPP) and my Department  in 2006 show that 78.4% of schools in Westmeath are teaching Stay Safe, 72.5% of schools in Longford and 84.1% nationally.  There was a very high response rate to this questionnaire &mdash; 91.8%.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that of the schools nationwide that indicated in the survey that they were not teaching Stay Safe, 52% reported that child abuse prevention was covered as part of the curriculum using all or some of the following resources, RSE, Walktall Programme, Kidscape and Alive O.</P>
        <P>In-service training for school staff by CAPP is provided on request to schools. Typically these sessions include the following:</P>
<P el="8"><Miles com="bull66" />Teaching Stay Safe within the context of the SPHE programme.</P>
<P el="8"><Miles com="bull66" />Developing a school policy on child protection.</P>
<P el="8"><Miles com="bull66" />Responding to disclosures or suspicions of abuse.</P>
<P el="8"><Miles com="bull66" />Guidelines and procedures for reporting child abuse.</P>
<P el="8"><Miles com="bull66" />Response of the health services to cases of child abuse.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">CAPP trainers will also facilitate board of management/parent information meetings on Stay Safe and related child protection issues.</P>
        <P>Following the 2006 survey, schools which were not teaching the programme, or not teaching all parts of it, were contacted and offered training. Two additional regional development officers were seconded to the programme in September 2007 to assist in the provision of this training.</P><Col N="1908"/>
        <P>In addition to this in early 2008 the Primary Curriculum Support Programme will provide child protection training for Designated Liaison Persons in primary schools nationwide</P>

	<P>Among the priority funding measures approved for support in 2006/2007 under the Educational Disadvantage category of the Dormant Account Fund and the RAPID Leverage Fund, was a scheme addressing educational infrastructure in disadvantaged schools.  Eligibility for the scheme was restricted to primary and post primary schools participating in my Department&rsquo;s DEIS programme; schools in, or serving, RAPID areas; and special schools.</P>
        <P>The scheme consists of four measures and a number of sub-measures. The four measures are: (1) Outdoor Play Facilities; (2) Libraries; (3) Parent Rooms; and (4) Dining Areas.  Eligible schools were allowed to submit prioritised proposals under each of the measures.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;20.5m has been made available to fund the scheme.  The scheme was launched on 16th January 2007, with a closing date for applications of 1st March 2007.  The scheme was over-subscribed with over 2,270 individual project proposals submitted for funding. The total amount of grant aid sought exceeded the funding available under the scheme.</P>
        <P>In light of the very large number of project proposals received it was decided that the proposals should be assessed on a phased basis. Phase I involved the assessment of proposals identified by applicants as Priority 1, 2 &amp; 3 under the Outdoor Play Facilities Measure; lower priorities were not assessed because there is insufficient funding available.  On 14 June 2007 the Depart<Col N="1909"/>ment wrote to all of the schools concerned to inform them of the position.</P>
        <P>The proposal referred to by the Deputy was identified by the school as its fourth priority and as such it was not assessed because there is insufficient funding available.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 401 and 402 together.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s four Student Maintenance Grant Schemes, grants are payable to candidates pursuing approved full-time courses who meet prescribed conditions, including those pertaining to nationality, residency, means, age and previous academic attainment.</P>
        <P>Under the residency requirement a candidate&rsquo;s parents, or in the case of an independent mature candidate, the candidate herself/himself, must have been resident in the State from the 1st October of the year prior to entry on an approved course.</P>
        <P>Under the Nationality clause of the Scheme all E.U nationals, including Irish Nationals, are eligible to be considered.  However, candidates who are E.U. nationals and who do not satisfy the residency requirement are eligible to apply for a means-tested fees only grant in respect of approved courses in the Republic of Ireland, provided they have been ordinarily resident, for a purpose other than wholly or mainly to receive full-time education, in an E.U. Member State from 1 October, of the previous year. Such candidates shall apply to the Local Authority in which the college they propose to attend is situated.</P>
        <P>Apart from the funding provided through the student maintenance grant schemes, the Department also provides funding to approved third level institutions to operate a Student Assistant Fund to assist students in a compassionate and sensitive manner who may otherwise have to leave college due to financial hardship.

	<P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students. These are the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees&rsquo; Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses. The Higher Education Grants Scheme is administered by the local authorities. The other three schemes are administered by the Vocational Education Committees.</P>
        <P>The most recent information available to my Department from the VEC sector indicates that approximately 75 whole-time equivalent staff are involved in the administration of the VEC grant scheme.</P>
        <P>My Department carried out a survey of the 66 local authorities and VECs early in 2007 in respect of the status of applications for student grants for the academic year 2006/07 as at mid-January 2007. The survey indicated that over 37,000 applications had been received, of which less than 10% had been refused.</P>
        <P>In relation to the number of students receiving financial assistance under the student support schemes, the most recent figures show that over 56,000 students benefited under the schemes in 2006/07, of which approximately 13,200 benefited from the special rate of maintenance grant in addition to the basic maintenance grant.</P>
        <P>The process of assessing eligibility for third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.   Even where application forms are completed in full, further clarification may need to be sought in order to verify that the terms and conditions of the grant schemes are met, including those relating to means, residency, nationality or a candidate&rsquo;s previous academic achievements.  It is not possible, therefore, to indicate the average time it takes an assessing body to award a grant.</P>
        <P>I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students and to consolidate the administration of this unified grants scheme in the VEC sector. This will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administrative system. The scheme, which will be underpinned by a new Student Support Bill, will facilitate consistency of application, improved client accessibility and timely delivery of grants.</P>
        <P>The Student Support Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation, and I hope to be in a position to publish it shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 407 and 408 together.</P>
        <P>Under the relevant pension schemes for VEC and Institutes of Technology officers, on appointment to a permanent post a person is required to purchase previous temporary and part-time service where this was not pensionable.  In the case of an officer who becomes liable on permanent appointment to Class A rate PRSI, the cost of purchasing such prior service is determined on the officer&rsquo;s rates of pay applicable to the permanent post at the time the payment is made.</P>
        <P>In the past, where a delay occurred on the part of the employer in notifying the officer of the contributions payable, through no fault of the officer, the cost could have increased.  It has recently been agreed, following the outcome of a determination by the Pensions Ombudsman within the general area covered by the Local Government Superannuation Scheme, to amend the charging mechanism for prior service in the case of officers appointed to permanent pensionable positions who are liable to pay class A PRSI.  In such cases  the cost of purchasing prior service, where purchase is compulsory, will be determined on the person&rsquo;s current pay applicable not later then 3 months from the date of appointment to the permanent post.</P>
        <P>While payment of main scheme contributions are compulsory on appointment to a permanent post, a number of options for the payment of contributions to the Spouses&rsquo; and Children&rsquo;s Scheme exists. Where a person opts to pay the Spouses&rsquo; and Children&rsquo;s contributions immediately on appointment to a permanent post, then these contributions fall to be determined in the same manner as contributions under the main scheme.</P>
        <P>My Department is preparing a circular for issue to VECs and Institutes of Technology advising them of the revised position and this will be issued in the near future.  As the individual appointments and superannuation status are matters directly managed by the VECs and Institutes concerned, my Department does not have details of the actual numbers involved.  However, I would point out that this particular <Col N="1914"/>compulsory feature is confined to a very specific period.  More recently introduced improvements in superannuation terms means that compulsory purchase will no longer arise in the case of newly appointed permanent personnel as temporary or part-time service is now considered pensionable on an ongoing basis.</P>

	<P>My Department provides funding to secondary schools for the provision of caretaking and other ancillary services via the school services support fund.  This grant, which is paid on a per capita basis, allows schools discretion in the application of the funding in accordance with their own needs and priorities.  In particular, it represents a major resource for schools with difficulties in the provision of secretarial and caretaking services.  It is a matter for each school to determine how best to meet its caretaking requirements and to employ caretaking staff as it deems appropriate.  Accordingly, my Department has no direct role in determining the employment capacity of caretakers employed by schools.</P>

	<P>The report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education made detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students.  The target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; was defined in terms of the dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled.  The special rates of grant are also available to mature students who meet the prescribed conditions.  The Special Rate of Maintenance Grant is available to students in receipt of the ordinary maintenance grant under each of my Department&rsquo;s four maintenance grant schemes.</P>
        <P>In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, including the following: 1. An applicant must qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant; 2. Total reckonable income in the relevant tax year must not exceed the lower income limits as set out in the relevant Maintenance Grant Schemes and, where applicable, net of Child Dependent Increase payments; 3. As at the prescribed date &mdash; i.e. 31 December each year &mdash; the source of income must include one of the eligible long-term Social Welfare payments.  The prescribed income limit for the special rate of maintenance grant for the academic year 2007/2008 is &euro;18,055.  Under my Department&rsquo;s student maintenance grant schemes, I am committed to ongoing improvements in the student support schemes including increasing the rates and income limits, as resources permit.  It is not pro<Col N="1917"/>posed to depart from the existing arrangements for the determination of the eligibility threshold.</P>

	<P>Schools&rsquo; running costs are met by my Department&rsquo;s scheme of capitation grants which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.  These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of schools.  This flexibility allows schools to engage interpreters to facilitate interaction with deaf parents where necessary.  The primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years.  Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from &euro;57.14 per pupil to &euro;163.58 from 1 January, 2007.  This represents an increase of over 186% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  The current rates range from &euro;418 to &euro;805 per pupil.  There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools.  With effect from January 2007, the standard per capita grant was increased by &euro;18 per pupil and now amounts to &euro;316 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of &euro;30 per pupil in 2007 in the support services grant bringing that grant to &euro;189 per pupil.  The cumulative increase of &euro;48 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to over &euro;500 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.  For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over &euro;290,000.  This represents an increase of 83% since 2000.</P>
        <P>Budget allocations for schools in the VEC and Community and Comprehensive sectors are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant.  All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.  The provision that I have made for these significant increases in the funding of schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to <Col N="1918"/>address the needs of schools so that they are already accessible to people with disabilities.  I have no plans to introduce further specific measures.</P>

	<P>The Special Education Appeals Board (SEAB) was established under section 36 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 to hear and determine appeals pursuant to a number of sections of the Act.  Members of the inaugural appeals board have been appointed and are currently working on the development of processes and procedures which need to be in place before the relevant sections of the Act, which underpin the appellant process, are commenced.  In the interim, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will undertake to review a decision taken by a special educational needs organiser (SENO) on foot of a request from a school or parents/ guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information, which may not have been to hand at the time of the decision.  The NCSE has outlined this process in its Circular 01/05.</P>

	<P>The Special Rate of Maintenance Grant is available to students in receipt of the ordinary maintenance grant under each of my Department&rsquo;s four maintenance grant schemes.  In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, including the following:&mdash;</P>
<P LI="1">1.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />An applicant must qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant;</P>
<P LI="1">2.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />Total reckonable income in the relevant tax year must not exceed the lower income limits as set out in the relevant Maintenance Grant Schemes and, where applicable, net of Child Dependent Increase payments;</P>
<P LI="1">3.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />As at the prescribed date &mdash; i.e. 31 December each year &mdash; the source of income must include one of the eligible long-term Social Welfare payments.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">The prescribed income limit for the special rate of maintenance grant for the academic year 2007/2008 is &euro;18,055.  It is not proposed to depart from the existing arrangements for the determination of the eligibility threshold.</P>
        <P>The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority &mdash; i.e. the local authority or VEC.  These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.  Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional <Col N="1920"/>circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>

	<P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) was required by the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004, to provide a report on the Implementation of the Act.  This report is, essentially, advice to the Minister for Education and Science, regarding the steps the Council considers necessary to implement EPSEN, within a period not greater than five years from the starting date of the Council.  The timelines in the Implementation Report are not, as mentioned by the Deputy, &ldquo;promised commencement&rdquo; dates.  In the report, the Council itself comments that timelines are included to ensure a speedy, but realistic, approach to the implementation of EPSEN, and signals the broad range of issues, and areas where discussion needs to take place, in advance of implementation.  Steps have been taken by my Department in regard to these areas.  In particular, a series of consultations have been held with the education partners, including school management bodies, teachers&rsquo; unions and parent representative bodies, at which a range of issues were explored in the context of delivering the provisions of the Act.  Arising from this process, my Department is developing proposals for the implementation of the Act and it is hoped to complete this work shortly.  At the same time, my Department continues to provide for the allocation of additional resources through the Council, to enhance the capacity of the educational system to meet special educational needs.</P>

        <Quest> the reason her Department have refused to give technical or financial assistance to a school (details supplied) in Dublin 24 in view of the fact that a suspected gas leak occurred in close proximity to this school; if she will intervene directly with this school in order that these matters will be resolved; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent years much greater authority has been devolved to local school management boards to manage and deliver smaller building projects, minor works etc., thereby freeing my Departments technical and professional staff to concentrate on the larger scale projects.  This had become necessary due to the huge increase in larger scale projects being progressed through my Department.  For instance this year alone over &euro;540 million will be spent on school building infrastructure with over 1,500 projects on my Department&rsquo;s school building programme.  The school in question does not have a gas supply on site, however, periodically; there is a smell of gas in the school premises.  Following advice from my Department, the school had their sewers etc. checked by a specialist firm but these were given the all clear.  My Department undertook to fund the cost under the devolved emergency works scheme.  My Department will also fund the cost of employing an engineer to resolve the problem.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> the number of cases that have been brought to the attention of the National Education Welfare Board where a student misses 20 days of school in one academic year and where the NEWB is legally obliged to become involved; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[29489/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Educational Welfare Board is developing a nationwide service on a continuing basis that is accessible to schools, parents/guardians and others concerned with the <Col N="1926"/>welfare of young people.  For this purpose, Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) have been deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the Board&rsquo;s functions locally.  The Board operates through 5 regional teams, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  A service is provided from 26 locations nationwide.  Staff are deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme.  In addition, the Board follows up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.  Educational Welfare Officers play a pivotal role in implementing the service provided by the NEWB through monitoring school attendance and working to improve it.  The EWOs also help parents that are experiencing a difficulty with getting a school place for their child.  The NEWB has also issued an Information Leaflet to every family with children of schoolgoing age advising them of their rights and responsibilities in relation to education and school attendance and where they can get help.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the allocation to the Board for 2007 is &euro;9.808 million.  This represents an increase of 20% on the 2006 allocation and of 50% on the 2004 level.  This substantial increase in funding is a clear indication of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk.  Sanction for 15 additional staff was given in 2007 and this brings the current authorised staffing of the Board to 109 posts of which 90 are allocated to working directly in the service delivery area.  The staffing complement is comprised of 19 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 13 Senior EWO&rsquo;s and 72 EWO&rsquo;s.  It should, however, be remembered that the Board is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to improve school attendance and encourage more young people to finish school.  In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and services such as breakfast clubs and homework clubs.  In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 600 staff within the education sector with a role in school attendance.  Home School Community Liaison <Col N="1927"/>Coordinators, in working with parents, promote school attendance and its importance for success in school.</P>
        <P>School attendance is a central objective of the School Completion Programme with attendance tracking a core feature and one of its preventative strategies.  Access to these services is being increased with the continued roll-out of services under DEIS, the Action Plan for tackling educational disadvantage.  The first national data on school attendance was collected for the 2003/2004 school year.  Attendance data relating to the 2005/06 school year are currently being analysed by the NEWB.  The findings from the 2004/05 analysis, which are consistent with the findings for the previous year, indicate that approximately 84,000 children under the age of 16 miss more than 20 days each year.  The explanation for the absences are for a variety of reasons ranging from unexplained absence to explained absence such as ill health.  On average the Board estimates that it works with 10,000 cases per annum involving students with reported school attendance difficulties.  The findings from the analysis of the Annual Attendance Reports continues to inform the work of the Board.  It is encouraging to note that in relation to the effectiveness of the service, research findings show that attendance at school in the areas where EWOs are working intensively improved by 4% in 2004/05 compared with the previous year.</P>
        <P>I have been informed that since January 2007, the Board has worked on 8381 cases involving children who are experiencing difficulty with school attendance. 4358 of these cases are now closed and 4023 are still ongoing.  This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education.  Through increased investment and improved services we are determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.</P>

        <Quest> if there are sufficient primary school places in a town (details supplied) in County Cork to accommodate the projected intake of junior infants in September 2008; the number of children on the enrolment book of various primary schools in the town; and the steps her Department is taking to ensure that every child in the town will have a place in a school in the town in September 2008. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is aware that Carrigaline and its surrounding environs are experiencing population growth particularly in the projected pupil population, a position that <Col N="1928"/>almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision.  In this regard, officials from my Department recently met with the Patron and representatives from the majority of the national schools in the area to discuss this issue with a view to ensuring that there is adequate capacity for eligible pupils.  The Department is monitoring the situation in conjunction with the schools on an ongoing basis.  However, the Deputy should note that owing to a high incidence of duality across pre-enrolment lists, together with inward and outward migration, and the practice of accepting multiple school places, access to such enrolment data alone will not fully or adequately inform the Department when planning additional school places.  It is open to the school authorities to apply for additional accommodation where necessary and my Department has made it clear to the schools that same will be provided when requested. As with all areas experiencing significant population growth, the situation will continue to be monitored to ensure that there are sufficient places to meet demand from eligible pupils into the future.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to promoting the Irish language in our schools and colleges and to the continuation of teaching of Irish as an obligatory subject from primary to Leaving Cert level while fostering oral and written competence.</P>
        <P>As part of the minimum academic entry requirements for primary teacher training, all <Col N="1931"/>candidates must have a minimum of a Grade C3 at Higher Level in Irish in the Leaving Certificate or an approved equivalent. This requirement embodies both the written and oral element of a student&rsquo;s proficiency in Irish.</P>
        <P>I consider it to be the minimum standard in Irish necessary for students entering a teacher training course which will equip them to teach Irish to pupils at all levels in primary schools. This applies equally to persons who qualified as teachers in other jurisdictions, as to those who train in Ireland.</P>
        <P>EU Directive 2005/36/EC governing the recognition of professional qualifications came into force on 20 October 2007. The Teaching Council is the designated authority for recognition of qualifications for the regulated profession of primary and secondary teachers.</P>
        <P>Persons wishing to be registered as teachers in this country must apply to the Teaching Council for recognition of their qualifications. Once all requirements have been met by applicants, and their qualifications are recognised by the Teaching Council, applicants may apply to be registered as primary or post-primary teachers.</P>
        <P>The Council reviews and recognises a number of teacher training courses in Ireland for these purposes. The Council also assesses and where appropriate recognises a very wide range of other degrees and post-graduate qualifications presented by applicants from a range of countries.</P>
        <P>In relation to the teaching profession, qualifications which are recognised in another Member State must be recognised in the host Member State. Where a comparison of the content of a qualification reveals a substantial difference vis-&agrave;-vis that needed in host Member State, recognition may be refused, except in the case where the level is just one level below that required, when recognition must be allowed but a compensation measure (aptitude test or period of supervised practice) can be applied to compensate for a substantial difference.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Irish Language requirement, this may be addressed by successfully completing the &rdquo;An Scrud&uacute; le hAghaidh Cail&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to drop the Irish language requirements for entry to primary teacher training.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 438 to 454, inclusive and 456 to 460, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the extent of housing developments in the Lucan area and the pressure that this has created for school places.</P>
        <P>In light of this, the Department has expanded capacity significantly at both primary and post primary level to cater for existing and newly emerging demands for pupil places.</P>
        <P>The Department monitors primary pre-enrolment lists in the area on an on-going basis to ensure adequate capacity and will provide extra accommodation if needed. A total of 4,832 pupils were enrolled in the 12 primary schools in Lucan in September 2006. The enrolment figures increased to 5,128 this September and there are now 13 primary schools serving the Lucan area.</P>
        <P>At post primary level, recent building projects have increased capacity to 3,000 pupil places which will cater for not only the current enrolments of 2,476 pupils but provide additional capacity of over 500 places. In addition, a building project for Lucan Community College will further increase capacity by 200 pupil places. My Department has also recently agreed that a building project for St. Joseph&rsquo;s College will provide an additional 200 places.</P>
        <P>My Department does not yet have figures on the enrolment in individual grades in the schools listed by the Deputy. Information on pupils&rsquo; addresses is not collated by my Department. We are, however, confident that given the extent of the current extra capacity in the post-primary schools and the developments underway, there will be enough places. The situation will continue to be monitored to ensure that there are sufficient places to meet demand into the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In May 2002, my Department approved the provision of 175 additional therapy training places to tackle shortages of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists as identified in the report &ldquo;Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists&rdquo;, which was undertaken by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates in 2001 on behalf of the Department of Health and Children. </P>
        <P>Commencing from 2003, there has been an increase of 75 places on new courses in Speech and Language Therapy.  The additional places were equally divided between the BSc course in UCC, the BSc course in NUIG, and the Masters course in UL.  The increase in intake has resulted in a significant increase in the number of Speech and Language Therapists graduating from the third level sector.  Data on the number of graduates for 2007 are not yet available but it is expected that there will be in the region of 94 graduates.  These 75 new places were in addition to the 25 places already in TCD.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of therapy services, including speech therapy for people with disabilities, is a matter for the Health Services Executive (HSE) and funding is provided to the HSE for such purposes. Responsibility for the recruitment of these therapists rests with the HSE.  My Department does not employ speech therapists for the delivery of speech therapy services to schools or determine the children that should receive these services.  I have no plans to develop a Speech and Language therapy service within my Department.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that there are currently 59 special classes for children with specific speech and language disorder in primary schools nationwide.  The classes operate at a pupil teacher ratio of 7:1.  The Health Service Executive funds the provision of speech and language therapy services for the children attending these classes.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through the local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing appli<Col N="1939"/>cations from primary and post primary schools for special needs supports, including applications for the establishment of special classes, including classes for specific speech and language disorder.</P>

        <?oasys _cl11- ?><P>The Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works (OPW) was requested to source a suitable site to facilitate this amalgamation.  To date, however, the sourcing of a green field site has proved very difficult.  Following advertisement a number of site were identified and examined.  Those considered potentially suitable were then discussed with the Local Authority &mdash; Cork County Council.  Following this process no site emerged that was deemed suitable from the perspective of both my Department/OPW and Cork County Council.</P>
        <P>Because of the difficulty in sourcing a green field site my Department decided to investigate the possibility of utilising the Rossa College site to facilitate the proposed building project.  To this end a feasibility study of the site and building was commissioned in order to determine how best to provide for the long term accommodation needs of the proposed school.  While the outcome of the feasibility study was indeed positive with regard to the provision of a new school there were some issues to be resolved regarding access and my Department requested the OPW to actively pursue a solution in this regard.</P>
        <P>My Department has been advised by the Trustees of the amalgamating schools that they are opposed to the use of the Rossa College as the site of amalgamation.

	<P>The Government Decision on decentralisation, announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on 3 December 2003, provides for the transfer of all of my Department&rsquo;s Dublin based Civil Service staff to Newbridge, Co. Kildare.  The number of staff to be relocated to Newbridge is 200.  A total of 338 personnel have made applications to decentralise to Newbridge, the vast majority of whom are Dublin based applicants.  Currently, 135 Newbridge bound staff are in their decentralising posts.  All of these staff were Dublin based prior to any decentralisation-related moves.  No staff have transferred to Newbridge yet, as the construction of the Department&rsquo;s new headquarters is not expected to be completed until 2009.</P>
        <P>A total of 14 staff have transferred from Dublin based posts to the Civil Defence Board which decentralised to Roscrea, Co. Tipperary in 2006.  A further 7 staff have transferred from Dublin based posts to my Department&rsquo;s existing offices in Renmore, Co. Galway.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In December 2006, the Law Reform Commission published a Consultation Paper on Multi-Unit Developments which drew attention to a broad range of issues arising in relation to the governance and operation of such developments, including problems arising from the manner in which company law currently applies to property management companies.  The Consultation Paper made it clear that action to address these problems would be required across several policy fields, including company law, consumer protection law and the development of regulatory structures.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the cross-cutting nature of many of the issues identified by the Law Reform Commission in its Paper, a high-level interdepartmental committee has been established to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive response to the problems arising in this area.  A key task of this committee is to identify the legislative and administrative actions to be taken in response to definitive recommendations for legislative reforms which, following a lengthy consultation process, will be set out in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s forthcoming Report on Multi-Unit Developments and to determine a timescale for their implementation.</P>
        <P>The targeted study and consultation process undertaken by the Law Reform Commission is currently nearing completion and I can assure the Deputy that I am determined to ensure that whatever action is required will be taken sooner rather than later in response to the Commission&rsquo;s forthcoming Report and its recommendations for reform.</P>

	<P>I assume the proposed new arrangements that the Deputy refers to in his Question relate to recent media coverage that Ireland and Great Britain are in the process of developing electronic border information systems.</P><Col N="1946"/>
        <P>I understand that both systems will be developed on the basis that data is collected in respect of passenger travel and run against watchlists of persons of interest to both States.  There will be collaboration between the two jurisdictions to maximise the benefits that can be derived from the operation of the systems.</P>
        <P>My officials have been informed that there is a provision in the British e-Borders contract for the supplier to provide data on passengers travelling between the UK and Ireland.  While the manner of the collection of such data has not yet been finalised, the use of passports for this purpose cannot be discounted as they already contain some passenger information in electronic format.  However, I would like to assure the Deputy that there are no fixed controls on the land border between North and South and there are no plans to introduce any such controls.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the development of an Irish Border Information System will focus on travel between this State and countries outside the Common Travel Area.  The capture of data on passenger travel within the Common Travel Area is something that will be considered at a later stage.</P>

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</P>
        <P>The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency.  This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.</P>

        <P>Following publication of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s Consultation Paper on Multi-Unit Developments in December 2006, the Government established a high-level, interdepartmental committee to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive response to the broad range of issues arising in relation to multi-unit developments and the governance and operation of property management companies.

	<P>The recent attacks on PSNI officers are clearly of great concern.  I am sure I speak for all Deputies in being thankful that they were not fatal and wishing both officers speedy recoveries.</P>
        <P>Counter-terrorism and combating the activities, both terrorist and criminal, of dissident republican groups remain high priorities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in the border areas and throughout the State.  Close co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland is maintained in this regard.</P>

        <Quest> if he plans to appoint a new judge for the District Court in Donegal, in view of the fact that there is a two year waiting list for hearings; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that up to forty Garda&iacute; are tied up in the District Court at any given time due to the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of extra judicial resources in the Donegal District is a matter, in the first instance, for consideration by the President of the District Court.  I will be guided by the President of the Court as to the need for additional permanently assigned judges.</P>
        <P>The President has at her disposal unassigned judges who can be used to assist the permanently assigned judges where pressure of work demands.  As the Deputy may be aware, fourteen additional judges were appointed within the past few months, of whom six are in the District Court.  These additional judicial resources will have a significant and positive impact on waiting times in Donegal and elsewhere.</P>
        <P>I am informed that waiting times in Donegal generally are less than six months for cases other than family law cases (as regards the latter cases, delays are about six months).  As the Deputy will appreciate, individual cases will sometimes have longer waiting periods for reasons not within the control of the Courts Service, such as adjournment applications from parties to the case.</P>
        <P>My Department is cognisant of the demands on Garda time and every effort is made to streamline their court commitments on both a legislative and administrative basis.  I understand that additional court sittings have been scheduled in District No. 1 (which covers Donegal) in the period September to Christmas in an effort to deal with the backlog.  To this end, thirty special sittings have already been arranged so far this year.</P>

	<P>When a member of the Garda&iacute; suspects that a motorist is driving under the influence of any intoxicant the Garda may arrest the suspect under Section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, and may require that person to go to a Garda station and submit to a blood test or to provide a urine sample.  An intoxicant includes alcohol, drugs or any combination of drugs or of alcohol and drugs.  Identification of the presence of drugs is more complex than for alcohol and unlike alcohol there is no legal limit for drugs. </P>
        <P>The Department of Transport has responsibility for Road Traffic legislation.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety which comes under the aegis of that Department is responsible for the approval, supply and testing of apparatus for indicating the presence of alcohol in the breath.  While at this time there is no legislative provision for the approval, supply and testing of apparatus for indicating the presence of drugs at a meeting of the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in July 2006, representatives from all over Europe addressed the issue of random drug testing of drivers at the roadside in the light of the most up to date developments throughout this region.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na participated in that seminar, which concluded that there is currently no device considered to be reliable enough in order to be recommended for roadside saliva screening of drivers for drugs.  I am informed that the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is keeping abreast of developments in this area and will continue to monitor the development of reliable devices.  The new Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012 which was approved by Government and published in October contains a commitment to review legis<Col N="1952"/>lation on the issue of driving under the influence of drugs.</P>

Following completion of a Service Performance Evaluation &mdash; which involves rollout of infrastructure in a significant part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region and surrounds &mdash; and the signing of contracts by the Department of Finance, nationwide rollout will commence.  I am advised that preparation and planning by the Garda authorities is already well advanced with nationwide rollout planned to commence in the first quarter of next year.  The entire project is expected to be completed over a 2 year period.  I can assure the Deputy that the Garda Commissioner and I are anxious that the new secure radio service will be fully rolled out as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The opening hours of Garda Stations is a matter for the Garda Commissioner but a general point which should be borne in mind is that an extension in the opening hours of any particular Garda Station would necessitate the employment of additional Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.</P>
        <P>Garda personnel assignments throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually <Col N="1953"/>monitored and reviewed by Garda Management.

	<P>The Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime was established by my predecessor in March, 2005 with a three year remit to disburse funding for victim support and assistance measures and to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future.  I understand that since its establishment in 2005, the Commission has allocated almost &euro;2.5 million to organisations who provide support to victims of crime and of this &euro;102,250 was allocated to the organisation called Victim Support Ltd.</P>
        <P>To date this year the Commission has allocated &euro;926,125 to some 37 organisations listed in the table.  I should point out that the Commission is entirely independent in the performance of its functions and it would not be appropriate for me to comment or intervene in any way with a decision taken by the Commission in relation to the allocation of funding.  As I understand it, the Commission, while it has provided financial support to Victim Support in previous years, it has not  allocated funding to it this year, for reasons that, I understand, have been shared with that organisation.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The average cost of keeping an offender in custody is calculated by averaging the current running costs of the prisons and places of detention <Col N="1956"/>against the average number of offenders in those institutions.  These costs include certain items which are fixed, no matter the number of <Col N="1957"/>offenders in custody, e.g. utilities, staff salaries, etc.  It also includes the cost of central services to each prison, e.g. Headquarters, Prison Service Training Centre, I.T., etc.</P>
        <P>The comprehensive Change Agreement reached with the Prison Officer&rsquo;s Association in 2005, which has been successfully rolled out throughout the Service, has brought to an end the chronic problem of escalating overtime costs and has introduced a range of other efficiencies.  The savings arising from these efficiencies are contributing significantly to the control of costs, including the overall cost of keeping an offender in custody.</P>
        <P>In addition, the planned development of new prison facilities, particularly at Thornton, Co. Dublin and in the Munster region, will provide an opportunity to further reduce operating costs <Col N="1958"/>while providing an improved regime for prisoners and staff.</P>

	<P>The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.   </P>
        <P>The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.  I am informed by the Immigration Division of my Department that there is no record of an application for permission to remain from the persons referred to by the Deputy.  The persons concerned should contact the Immigration Division of my Department, General Immigration, 3rd Floor, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, outlining <Col N="1958"/>their future intentions in the State and enclosing supporting documentation.</P>

	<P>Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006. In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003. I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.</P>
        <P>I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to her.  I should add that my Department has established a new Executive Office, Cosc: the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-<Col N="1959"/>based Violence.  Cosc is working with the Courts, the Garda&iacute;, the Probation Service, other relevant state agencies, and NGOs, to develop evidence-based strategies to combat these crimes.</P>

As a result of targeted policing of the area a number of persons have been arrested for public order offences, possession of a controlled substance and an offensive weapon.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that the area referred to is in Clontarf Garda sub-District and is regularly patrolled by uniform and plain-clothes patrols including the District Detective and Drug Units and the Garda Mountain Bike Units supplemented by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel. A member of the local Community Policing Unit is also allocated to this area and liaises with the local community providing crime prevention and security advice. A meeting between the Community Policing officer and residents was held recently to discuss matters of concern.</P>
        <P>Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in this area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 507 and 508 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are regularly inspected by their supervisors when reporting for duty, which includes an examination and verification of identification numbers, at each Garda operational briefing prior to being deployed on duties relating to the ongoing protest actions at Bellanaboy, Co. Mayo.  Moreover, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are under the direct supervision of personnel of higher ranks who regularly ensure that all members are correctly attired and wearing identification numbers.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that since the commencement of the policing arrangements at Bellanaboy, it has been Garda policy to &rsquo;videotape&rsquo; each event.  As a result, the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na detailed for duty, and their identification numbers, are easily and readily identifiable at each of the protests.</P>
        <P>In respect of the other matter raised by the Deputy, I am informed that, on 23 October, 2007, an engineering company was carrying our drilling investigations in lands at Glengad on behalf of Shell, with the full permission of the owner of the lands.  A complaint was made to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a number of protestors had entered these lands, without the permission of the owner or any other relevant party.  In response, members of the <Col N="1961"/>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the direction and supervision of the District Superintendent attended the scene in order to preserve law and order.  In accordance with the law, the protestors were directed to leave the lands in question.  Accordingly the District Superintendent and the other members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na present were carrying out their duties in accordance with the law.</P>

	<P>Non-visa required nationals who enter the State to reside with an Irish spouse are required to attend their local Registration Office within 90 days and request permission to be registered as resident in the State on the basis of marriage to an Irish national.  In some cases, the local registration office will refer the matter to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service for further investigation. </P>
        <P>Visa required nationals are subject to pre-entry clearance before travelling to the State. If such persons wish to reside in the State with an Irish spouse, they must apply for a visa on the basis of marriage to an Irish national.  This application process involves an investigation into the status of the marriage in question. At that time if the Visa Officer is satisfied as to the bona fides of the marriage, a D-visa may issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The procedures employed to assess an applicant for naturalisation are as set out in summary form as follows.</P>
        <P>Upon receipt, each application is examined to determine if the statutory application is completed fully.  Incomplete application forms are returned to the applicant for amendment.  Valid applications are then examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.  Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and enquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary.  Since this procedure was introduced on 1 April 2005, over 3,500 applicants who applied since that date have been found to be ineligible.  All such applicants are informed of any shortfall in their residency and will be able to reapply when they have the required residency.</P>
        <P>The next stage of the process involves assessing an applicant&rsquo;s financial status in respect of their ability to support themselves in the State.  Enquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard.  At the same time enquiries are also made with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to clarify if the applicant can be deemed to be of good character.  There may also be circumstances in individual cases which require a greater level of investigation.  Once all enquiries are com<Col N="1963"/>pleted, the file is referred to me for a decision.  The Deputy will appreciate that while these processes can take a lengthy time to complete, I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.</P>
        <P>Applications for certificates of naturalisation are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  This practice is not deviated from except in exceptional circumstances.  If an individual applicant feels that his or her personal circumstances are such as to warrant taking their application out of sequence, that person can set out his or her reasons for wishing to have the application expedited and any such request will be given full consideration.  More generally, it is my intention to review the criteria for eligibility for citizenship through naturalisation and my Department is carrying out some work on this at present.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Section of my Department in September 2006.  On examination of the application it was determined that the person concerned did not satisfy the residency requirements as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.   A letter informing the applicant of this was issued on 14 February 2007  If the individual in question keeps his permission to remain in the State up  to date he will be in a position to lodge a new application in February 2010.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the first individual referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Section of my Department in January 2004.  Officials in that Section inform me that processing of the application has commenced and the file will be forwarded to me for a decision in the near future.  An application for a certificate of naturalisation on behalf of the second individual mentioned was submitted by his mother to the Citizenship Section of my <Col N="1964"/>Department in January 2007.  Due to the fact that applications on behalf of minors generally require less processing than standard adult applications, it is usually possible to finalise them more quickly.   Based on current processing trends, it is likely that the application on behalf of the person concerned will be finalised in the second half of 2008.  I will inform the Deputy and the persons concerned when I have reached a decision in each case.</P>

	<P>In my view, the Report of the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group and the recommendations it contains make a very valuable contribution to the debate on the future direction for criminal law reform.  The Deputy will be aware that several recommendations were already given effect in the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  Part 4 of the Act, which came into effect on 1 July of this year, gave effect to the recommendations on the right to silence first made in the Interim Report delivered in February and contained again in the Final Report delivered in mid March.</P>
        <P>In addition to the main recommendations in relation to the right to silence, the 2007 Act also took on board other recommendations in that area &mdash; see pages 97 and 98 of the Final Report. The fine levels in section 15(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 (withholding information regarding firearms or ammunition) and in section 19(2) of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 (withholding information regarding stolen property) have been adjusted.  These amendments were effected by sections <Col N="1965"/>48(c) and 47(b), respectively, of the 2007 Act. In both instances, the fine levels were increased to &euro;5,000.  Section 56 gives effect to the recommendation on the supply to suspects of the videotape of their interview by the Garda&iacute;.  Section 57 gives effect to the recommendation on the question of the need for a written note of the interview when a recording exists.  My Department is currently undertaking an examination of the remaining recommendations.  On completion of that examination I will decide what further action to take.</P>

	<P>Swinford District forms part of the Mayo Garda Division.  The personnel strength of the Mayo Division on 31 October, 2007 (the latest day for which figures are readily available) was 311 (all ranks). Kilkelly is in the Swinford Garda District. The personnel strength of Swinford District on 31 October, 2007 (the latest date for which figures are readily available) was 49.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner states that on the date the incident referred to occurred there were seven members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, one (1) Sergeant and six (6) Garda&iacute; deployed between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m., one of whom was detailed as Station Orderly. The remainder were patrolling the District in Swinford, Charlestown and Ballyhaunis in official patrol vehicles. Three (3) members of the Divisional Traffic Corps, based at Ballina Garda Station, were also deployed on duty in Swinford Garda District.</P>
        <P>Many incidents of public disorder occur at weekends between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m., placing extra demands on Garda resources.  On the night in question, three violent incidents <Col N="1966"/>occurred in the Swinford Garda District within a short period of time and within a radius of fifteen miles.  The first call relating to this incident is recorded as being received at 11.03 p.m.   Three arrests were made by 11.30 p.m.  I am informed that all incidents were attended to without any unnecessary delay.</P>
        <P>Swinford Garda District has benefited from increased allocations of Garda personnel in the last two years (1 sergeant, 1 D/Garda and 9 garda&iacute;). Local Garda management is satisfied that there were adequate resources, including the Divisional Traffic Corps Unit, deployed on duty on the night the incident referred to occurred.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of  Swinford Garda District will be fully considered by him within the overall context of the needs of Garda Districts/Divisions throughout the country.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government provides for a Garda Charter to be introduced which will ensure that the level of service provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the public is maintained at a high level.  The Charter will set out targeted Garda response times and levels of service which the public can expect.</P>
        <P>The Garda Public Attitudes Survey 2006 shows that one in twenty respondents sought an emergency Garda response in 2005 by dialling 999 or 112, a rate similar to previous surveys. Of those who did seek an emergency response, 80% had their call answered within 10 seconds. Where an emergency response involving the attention of Garda&iacute; was provided, it came mostly within 15 minutes. For a number of reasons it is not always necessary that a Garda car respond to a 999 call, for example the call may have been misdirected and another emergency service was needed, not the Garda&iacute;. The survey also shows that a majority of respondents (70%) were satisfied with the emergency response received, 1% more than in the 2005 report.</P>

	<P>As I stated in my reply to the Parliamentary Question to which the Deputy refers, the individual concerned was refused permission to remain in the State under the IBC/05 Scheme because of her failure to provide evidence of continuous residence in the State since the birth of her Irish born child on 18 October, 2001.  Specifically she has failed to provide evidence of residency for a period of approximately 3 years &mdash; from the time she left the State with her child in early 2002 until her asylum application in January 2005.  I&rsquo;m sure the Deputy would agree that such an absence from the State could not be regarded as short-term.</P>
        <P>As stated, Judicial Review proceedings have been initiated in respect of this refusal, and my Department is also appealing a number of matters relating to the IBC/05 Scheme, including the issue of continuous residence, to the Supreme Court. The application in question may be considered further in light of the findings of the Court.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 522, 540, 541 and 543 to 545, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Scheme of Housing Aid for Older People is part of a revised framework of grant aid, introduced on 1 November 2007, to assist older people and people with a disability with their accommodation needs.  The scheme, which amalgamates the provisions of the old Essential Repairs Grant Scheme and the existing Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme, is designed to provide targeted support to improve conditions in the existing housing of older people.</P>
        <P>The new scheme facilitates the implementation of a Government Decision, taken in February 2006, to transfer the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme from the Health Service Executive to the local authority sector.  The Government Decision arose on foot of a recommendation made in the Core Functions of the Health Service Report which stated that a more integrated service and better value for money may be achieved by transferring responsibility for the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme to the local authorities, who already had responsibility for the Essential Repairs and Disabled Persons Grant Schemes.</P>
        <P>The Regulations underpinning the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme do not specify an age qualification.  Local authorities have been advised, in general, to restrict the payment of grants under the scheme to people aged 60 years and over.  However, where in the opinion of the local authority, genuine cases of hardship exist or where there are specific relevant medical grounds, local authorities may consider the payment of a grant to individuals who are less than 60 years of age.</P><Col N="1970"/>
        <P>In order to facilitate a smooth and seamless transfer of the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme from the Health Service Executive to the local authority sector, and to ensure the satisfactory resolution of outstanding issues, it has been agreed that the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme will continue to operate, and be administered by the Health Service Executive, until 31 March 2008.   From 1 April 2008, that Scheme will cease operation (except for the processing of applications on hand as of 31 March 2008) and all future applications for grant aid will be processed by the local authorities under the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the meantime, my Department will continue to work with the Health Service Executive to ensure that all outstanding issues are addressed satisfactorily.  In particular, I am very aware that the integrity and flexibility of the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme must be maintained under the new regime.  In this context, I intend to develop protocols to govern arrangements between the HSE and the housing authorities in order to respond to emergency situations and also to address the specific needs of the more vulnerable members of our older community.</P>
        <P>Under the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme, my Department has recommended that local authorities should advertise for interested contractors who wish to have their names included on a panel of contractors available for the carrying out of works under the Scheme.  It is intended that such a panel will be an administrative mechanism to assist applicants in sourcing contractors.  This practice has been in place in many local authorities for several years and is working very effectively.  The issue of local authorities hiring contractors directly to carry out works for applicants who are not in a position to do so themselves will be examined further in the context of ongoing discussions with the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the new Housing Aid for Older People Scheme will successfully address the housing needs of older people by providing a speedy, more integrated and targeted response to their needs.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A Forum on Fluoridation was established to review the fluoridation of public water supplies in Ireland. The Report of the Forum, published in 2002, concluded that water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly. The Forum recommended that the fluoridation of piped public water supplies should continue as a public health measure.</P>
        <P>The effectiveness of water fluoridation in preventing dental decay continues to be endorsed by a comprehensive range of international bodies including the World Health Organization, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Public Health Service and the United States Surgeon General, the FDI World Dental Federation and the International Association for Dental Research.  In addition, these bodies are also satisfied that ingestion of fluoride at optimal levels does not pose a threat to human health.</P>
        <P>The Forum on Fluoridation recommended that an Expert Body be established. The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health was set up in 2004 to oversee the implementation of the recom<Col N="1973"/>mendations of the Forum; to advise the Minister and evaluate ongoing research &mdash; including new emerging issues &mdash; on all aspects of fluoride and its delivery methods as an established health technology and as required and report to the Minister on matters of concern at her request or on its own initiative. More details on the Expert Body are available on their website www.fluoridesandhealth.ie.</P>
        <P>Finally, the new Programme for Government contains a commitment to carry out a national study of total fluoride intake in the population and work on this study is underway.</P>

	<P>Action to deal with anti-social behaviour is primarily a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and legislation in this regard is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>Landlords are, however, responsible for enforcing the obligations that apply to their tenants under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  The Act prohibits anti-social behaviour in, or in the vicinity of, a dwelling to which the Act applies and allows a landlord to terminate any tenancy where the tenant is engaging in or allowing other occupiers of, or visitors to, the dwelling to engage in such behaviour, subject to a notice period of only 7 days in the case of serious anti-social behaviour or 28 days in the case of less serious but persistent behaviour. It also provides for a third party affected by anti-social behaviour to take a case to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) against a landlord who has failed to enforce tenant obligations. The Board can direct the landlord to ensure that tenants comply with their obligations and can enforce compliance through the Courts.</P>
        <P>The PRTB also has a function of reviewing the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and making recommendations for the amendment of the Act and any other related enactments, where this is considered necessary. My Department has not received any recommendation from the PRTB for amendment of the provisions relating to anti-social behaviour.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 528, 538 and 539 together.</P>
        <P>In law the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority. It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.</P>
        <P>The compilation of the Register and the carrying out of a Census are different processes with different statutory requirements. In addition, there are usually significant timing differences between the Census and the Register, with the Census being carried out once every five years and the Register being compiled on an annual basis. Therefore, care needs to be taken in making direct comparisons between these separate processes.</P>
        <P>In working to compile the Register for 2007/2008, which is currently in force, registration authorities undertook and completed the most extensive registration campaign in decades. On the basis of the work undertaken, registration authorities have achieved a significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register compared to previous years.</P>
        <P>My Department has advised authorities that the approach this year should be to maintain and build on the progress they have made to date. Looking ahead, the Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Electoral Commission. The Commission&rsquo;s responsibilities will include taking charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register.</P>

	<P>The River Boyne and River Blackwater candidate Special Area of Conservation (cSAC) (Site Code: 002299) was proposed for designation in accordance with the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997 on the basis of scientific information. The area in question contains habitats and species listed on Annexes I and II of the EU Habitats Directive.</P>
        <P>The landowner in question has submitted an objection to the inclusion of his lands within the SAC. My Department operates a two-stage appeal process. The first stage, an informal review carried out by scientific staff of my Department, deemed that some of the area under objection could be removed from the cSAC. The boundaries of the SAC have been amended accordingly. The remaining area was judged to be of significant scientific value and has been retained in the cSAC due to the presence of semi-improved grassland and other important habitats, particularly for bats.</P><Col N="1976"/>
        <P Just="Left">The landowner in question has exercised his right to appeal the inclusion of the land still remaining within the cSAC to the independent Appeals Advisory Board for a formal assessment based on a full scientific report.  The Board will, as soon as possible, make a recommendation to me, as Minister, on whether the land should remain within the cSAC based on the scientific merits of the case.</P>
        <P>In order to protect the integrity of nature conservation sites, areas proposed for designation and still under appeal (at informal or formal stage) are protected under Irish law.  The land is therefore retained within the maps to ensure that landowners and other public bodies are aware of the proposed designation.  In the event that the area does not meet the scientific criteria for designation, the maps will be adjusted accordingly.</P>

        <P>The provision of environmentally sound recovery outlets for these materials, such as fertiliser bags and used chemical containers, is being addressed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the context of the draft second National Hazardous Waste Management Plan. The Plan has been published in draft form by the Agency for public consultation which affords all stakeholders an opportunity to make observations as to its contents.

	<P>Ireland signed the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters on 25 June 1998.  Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level and, in that context, the European Union has adopted two Directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.  These deal with public access to environmental information (2003/4/EC) and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures (2003/35/EC).</P>

The remaining work will be finalised by the Departments concerned at the earliest possible date.</P>
        <P>When full transposition of Directive 2003/35/EC is completed, the instrument of ratification of the Aarhus Convention will be submitted to Government and laid before the D&aacute;il as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 372 of 17 October 2007.</P>
        <P>In February 2005, the Government announced a Fire Services Change Programme, 2005 to 2007, to implement key fire services and fire safety recommendations of the Farrell Grant Sparks Report, Review of Fire Safety and Fire Services in Ireland.  The priority at the time was not to pursue further institutional change but to use the available resources to bring about direct improvements in the key areas identified in the report.</P>
        <P>The change programme included four priority areas addressing the development of community fire safety programmes, the development of a risk based approach to safety management, the introduction of a competency-based approach to recruitment, retention and career progression in the fire service and the enhancement of health, safety and welfare programmes within the fire service.</P>
        <P>Work under the Change Programme was carried out by a dedicated Project Team, with a consultative structure in which all of the stakeholders participated.  A report on progress achieved over the two year period was published in June 2007 and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.environ.ie.  Options for the next phase of the change programme are being reviewed having regard to the Farrell Grant Sparks recommendations and the need to continue to bring about real and substantive change so that the fire service is in line with international standards.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 553 and 555 together.</P>
        <P>The Report of the Task Force on Sudden Cardiac Death was launched by my colleague the Minister for Health and Children in March 2006.  One of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations states that &ldquo;a tiered response system should prioritise the <Col N="1984"/>training and equipping of rapidly deployable uniformed responders such as full-time fire services in urban communities and retained fire services in rural communities&rdquo;.  The Department made a submission to the Task Force outlining the potential role of the fire service in the provision of Basic Life (BLS) and Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs).  The Department asked that the potential of the local authority fire services be given due consideration by the Task Force in its task of maximising access to such life saving equipment.  The implementation of the recommendations of the Report is a matter for the Department of Health and Children.  The Emergency Care Council (PHECC) under the Department of Health and Children is responsible for developing standards and guidelines for Emergency First Responder training.  It is a matter for individual fire authorities to determine the training needs of its fire service personnel.</P>
        <P>I am aware that nearly all fire authorities have invested in training their fire fighters to Emergency First Responder level.  Some authorities have, in addition, brought some of the first responders to cardiac first responder level, which means they are trained to use AEDs.  These authorities carry defibrillators on the fire appliances for the protection of their own staff and for use to assist the public at the scene of an incident at which the fire service is in attendance.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Part H of the Building Regulations deals with Drainage and Waste Water Disposal.  Requirement H1 (1) of the Regulations, which refers to foul drainage, states that &ldquo;A building shall be provided with such a drainage system as may be necessary for the hygienic and adequate disposal of foul water from the building&rdquo;.  The associated Technical Guidance Document TGD H gives guidance for non-complex drainage systems, including guidelines on the discharge capacity of foul drains. The minimum size of a drain serving three or more dwellings should be 150 mm and no drain should serve more than eight dwellings. The context of this guidance is traditional housing estates, where the limitation to eight dwellings is so as to ensure that a drain blockage does not affect too many dwellings.</P>
        <P>No specific guidance is given for apartment blocks but reference is made in TGD H to BS 8301, dealing with building drainage, as a source of guidance.

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>General legal authority to charge for water supplies derives from section 65A of the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878, inserted by section 7 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1962 (as amended). Additional legislation applying to Wicklow, including the Dublin Corporation Waterworks Act 1861 and the Bray Township Act 1866, obliges Dublin City Council to provide a supply of treated drinking water to Bray and Greystones, at little or no cost which is in breach of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the EU Water Framework Directive.</P>
        <P>This legislation is being repealed under the Water Services Act 2007, and replaced by a modern legislative code requiring water services authorities to charge for the full cost of providing water services to non-domestic users. It is understood that Dublin City Council intends to continue providing water supplies to Wicklow County Council, but at appropriate rates of charge phased in as transitional arrangements and ultimately reflecting the true cost of supply. My Department is also in contact with Wicklow County Council with a view to adjusting the annual subvention from the Local Government Fund to take account of the revised financial arrangements.</P>

	<P>In selecting schemes for inclusion in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009, account was taken of a number of factors, including: Compliance with relevant national and EU environmental, public health and drinking water quality statutory requirements and standards; Support  for the National Spatial Strategy; Environmental Protection Agency reports on drinking water, water quality and urban wastewater discharges; The provision of services for new housing through the Serviced Land Initiative and the need to address infrastructural deficits under the Rural Towns and Villages Initiative; Other priorities identified by local authorities in their regular Assessments of Water Services Capital Needs.</P>
        <P>Given the level of competing demand for the available funding, and the priorities identified for Longford County Council, I regret that it was not possible to include the Kenagh scheme in the current Programme.</P>

	<P>Sustainable Energy Ireland advise me that air heat exchangers / ventilation recovery systems provide secondary heating in that they rely on an existing primary source to provide the heat.  The key objective of the Greener Homes Scheme is to stimulate the market for domestic renewable heat technologies.  Exhaust heat pumps are not eligible for support under the Greener Homes Scheme.  In SEI&rsquo;s assessment they do not represent an entirely renewable technology since the primary heat source can also be fossil fuels (coal, oil or gas).</P>
