	<P>T&aacute; feabhas ag teacht ar do chuid Gaeilge, a Cheann Comhairle.  T&aacute; t&uacute; ag d&eacute;anamh go maith.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It would be remiss of me not to mention the fact that Anne Enright has won the Man Booker Prize for her novel, <i>The Gathering.</i> I am sure the House wishes to recognise this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recognise the pragmatism of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, in accepting yesterday evening the Fine Gael motion on mandatory breath testing where injuries occur in road accidents.  This is realism and good politics.  It is good for road users and it is about time it was done.  I thank the Minister.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd is pleased with his response.</P>
        <P>Every year 100,000 drivers take to the roads without insurance.  This is at least three times the rate in most European countries.  On average, 20 people are killed and approximately 2,000 injured &mdash; some seriously &mdash; by uninsured drivers every year.  This is scandalous.  Not only does this visit tragedy and trauma on the families and next of kin of those killed or injured, it also gives rise to a cost of &euro;60 million, that we know of, in claims by drivers who are insured and law abiding.  It is time to get tough with this serious matter.</P>
        <P>What does the Government intend to do about the rate of uninsured drivers on the roads?  Does the Taoiseach agree the time has come for those who use the roads without insurance to be made to pay the price?  Does he agree those who are apprehended driving uninsured should have their cars confiscated and sold and the proceeds used for victims&rsquo; compensation?</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, has announced that existing legislation will be amended to allow for compulsory roadside testing.  This is in line with his priorities declared earlier this year.  I am glad everyone agrees with that decision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report of the European Transport Safety Council and the Government action programme on road safety both refer to the issue of insurance, among others.  The dedicated Garda traffic corps is clamping down on this and every other abuse.  The corps places 30,000 checkpoints on the roads every month.  Measures have been introduced to reduce all road safety abuses.  Lack of insurance is one of these.  Priority has been given to the Garda traffic corps which has between 850 and 900 members, which number will increase to 1,250.  The corps is clamping down extremely hard on all abuses.  It confiscates the cars of non-insured drivers.  I do not think they are sold off before their owners have a chance to put a case in their defence, but they are confiscated.  This is necessary, as it is not acceptable to drive without insurance.  While the number of road accident fatalities is declining, statistics from insurance companies, the Department of Transport and independent agencies all show that the figures for injuries and deaths are enormous.  Apart from fatalities, road traffic injuries impose a cost on the health service and the insurance industry.  This issue was raised some years<?oasys _jy ?>ago when we tried to reduce insurance<?oasys _jy ?>premiums.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Almost 500,000 penalty point cases have been processed by the Garda computer system since the action of the traffic corps was stepped up.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to continue with this.  The number of road accident fatalities has fallen by more than 10% in recent years and by 25% in the past 12 months.  Members will be aware from the figures on road deaths released this week that Ireland is ranked 12th out of 29 countries and has a considerable way to go.  I accept that stopping those who take the chance of driving without insurance and seizing their cars is but one measure.  However, the main action, to answer Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question, is the consolidated effort being made by the dedicated traffic corps which is stopping almost 30,000 motorists a month and is closing in on people who are abusing the Road Traffic Acts, including through their failure to have insurance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Taoiseach if he would be prepared to send out a clear message to people driving on Irish roads that those caught <Col N="1483"/>driving without insurance will have their vehicle confiscated, sold and the proceeds used for victims&rsquo; compensation and so on.  The Taoiseach should send out a clear and tough message to this effect.  After all, law abiding drivers are paying &euro;60 million in respect of claims arising from uninsured drivers.  </P>
        <P>We welcome everybody to this country.  According to the Lonely Plant travel group, Ireland is the friendliest nation in the world with the exception of Fiji and Malawi.  However, 1,700 crashes on Irish roads last year involved cars registered in Poland and Lithuania.  Obviously, persons from those countries and others are welcome here when they contribute to our economy but we have standards that should apply to everybody.</P>
        <P>There is growing concern about the large number of drivers from outside the State who retain their domestic registration and renew their insurance policies in their home countries.  This, in turn, gives rise to all of the difficulties that ensue when a driver from outside the State is involved in a crash with an Irish driver.  This is a new issue in addition to the current loophole which allows foreign registered cars to be re-registered here for two years before any checks in respect of roadworthiness, NCT and so on are required.</P>
        <P>Another glaring problem, as pointed out yesterday evening by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, is that of the 400,000 penalty points cases this year, 108,000 of those points cannot be applied because the drivers do not hold Irish driving licences.  It is time a clear message was sent out given the carnage on our roads.  The regulations in respect of driving, registration and insurance are very clear.  We should have no qualms about saying that the regulations and rules apply to everybody, be they from Ireland or elsewhere.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that in future an Irish person travelling to another EU country, purchasing a car there and bringing it back to Ireland will be required as an Irish national to have the car undergo an NCT and roadworthiness test within six months.  The issue in respect of foreign registered cars not having to do this for two years is causing a problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Now that progress is being made in terms of mandatory breathalysing, will the Taoiseach speak to his Minister for Transport to ensure clear rules are set down in respect of driving, insurance and re-registration?  These rules should apply to everybody across the board.  People should know that if they are caught driving without insurance in this country, their car will be confiscated, sold and the proceeds used for victims&rsquo; compensation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said earlier, to the best of my knowledge confiscation of a car is one of the actions open to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is not the only action but the legalities of what the Deputy <Col N="1484"/>is suggesting would need to be examined.  A garda can confiscate a car where an individual has been found to be driving without insurance.  I agree with this, subject to the legalities involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Has it ever been done?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I have seen it happen a few times on the roads recently.  Garda&iacute; are confiscating cars for different reasons.  Obviously, non-nationals were involved in some instances.  As Deputy Kenny stated, quite a number of issues arise in respect of the plates being used and so on.</P>
        <P>A number of the issues raised, apart from insurance and the clampdown in that regard, are EU related.  However, the situation in respect of foreign drivers in this country is no different from that which pertains in respect of an Irish person driving on the Continent with an Irish registration plate.  I am told that efforts are being made at EU level to co-ordinate the rules regarding those issues.  The Deputy mentioned one of them, namely, testing within a particular period, and it would be sensible for this to happen.  An attempt is being made at EU level to harmonise regulations of penalty points in respect of people who drive cars in other jurisdictions.  We will have to await the outcome in this regard.</P>
        <P>People who drive in this country have the same rights and obligations as Irish citizens who drive on mainland Europe.  The point the Deputy is making is whether they should be subject to local laws, rules and so on.  There would have to be a European understanding in that regard.  I do not believe we could arbitrarily apply a regulation in that regard in this country.  The longer a person is allowed to retain a car in a jurisdiction without it undergoing mandatory testing and so on, the longer the system remains open to abuse.  One does not have to be an expert to note the high proportion of cheap cars being driven in this jurisdiction.  Many people are not worried whether these vehicles are confiscated or not, something of which the Garda is very conscious.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the meantime, Ireland has complied and continues to comply with the European Transport Safety Council report on EU safety.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, will shortly publish a road safety strategy through which we will continue to improve and enhance fairly tough regulations.  Some people may not be pleased with many of these regulations.  While all of them cannot be implemented within a fixed period, many of them will be introduced in the next few years.  We will continue to enhance our road safety.  The strategy, which is due to be published in approximately two weeks, is a comprehensive report which outlines the many actions that will be carried out, not overnight, but during a fixed period.  In the meantime, we will continue <Col N="1485"/>to support the dedicated transport corps which comprises more than 800 garda&iacute; who stop 30,000 drivers a month in respect of issues such as alcohol consumption, performance and so on.  These checks are improving our statistics on road safety and we must continue to enforce them.  That is the Government&rsquo;s intention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl11.2- ?><Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Deputy Kenny and the Taoiseach in congratulating Anne Enright on winning the Man Booker Prize and to express my delight that she has a family connection with D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</P>
        <P>From the beginning of this week, approximately 4,500 recovering heroin addicts, almost 3,000 of whom reside in Dublin, have had their lives thrown into chaos as a result of the withdrawal of the methadone dispensing service provided to them by pharmacists.  These people are, in the main, recovering heroin addicts who have been receiving methadone treatment in the community pharmacy arena.  Many of them have been getting their lives together, returning to work and so on.  The withdrawal of this service has thrown them back into the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement of drug treatment clinics which brings them back into the same type of environment and company which may have been responsible for their problems in the first instance.  Not alone is their health being exposed, but they are being exposed to the possibility of a return to heroin addiction.  Despite what is claimed, the decision of pharmacists to withdraw the methadone service appears to be directly connected with the dispute which has been taking place for some time between pharmacists and the Health Service Executive about the method of payment for the dispensing of drugs under the GMS scheme and, to some extent, under the drugs refund scheme.  As I understand it, the Health Service Executive has unilaterally decided to cut the margins pharmacists receive for the drugs they dispense under the GMS scheme and the drugs refund scheme.  Some pharmacists tell me that the extent of the cut, in respect of some drugs, means they are now required to dispense at either below cost or with a very low margin.  In the long term the consequences of this will be to put at risk the independent local pharmacy with which we are all familiar.  It will be of huge concern, in time to come, if people are given a prescription from their doctor but there is no local pharmacy, meaning they have to travel to the nearest big town or city for the prescription to be dispensed at one of the big pharmacy chains.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the heart of the dispute has been the refusal of the Health Service Executive to negotiate margins and the method of payment for drugs with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, apparently because the Health Service Executive interprets the Competition Act 2002 as prohibiting it from negotiating with the IPU because they are independent businesses and issues arise related to competition.  The rows about not negotiating with <Col N="1486"/>the IPU and about margins on drugs dispensed by pharmacists have been rumbling on for well over a year.  Does the Taoiseach agree that, whatever about the merits of the dispute, it is not right that some of the most vulnerable people in society are made a target and used in a dispute such as this to the extent that their needs and rights are seriously put at risk?  Does he agree there is a necessity to return to dispensing methadone in community pharmacies?  What can be done to bring that about as quickly as possible?  Can the Taoiseach explain how the dispute between the pharmacists and the HSE, which has been rumbling on for so long, has been allowed to come to this pass?  What will be done to facilitate discussions between the HSE and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union to settle the outstanding issues relating to the dispensing of methadone and the payment under the drugs scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three issues.  The first relates to methadone, the second relates to ongoing negotiations between the HSE and the pharmaceutical organisations about prices and the third relates to the legal position in the context of competition law.</P>
        <P>On the first issue, this is a dispute between pharmacists and the HSE over the price of drugs, which the former dispense and for which they are reimbursed.  The HSE has set a new price which, because of competition law, could not be negotiated.  This issue is separate from the level of fees paid to pharmacists under the community drugs schemes, which amounted to almost &euro;300 million last year.</P>
        <P>While disputes have to be resolved by negotiation, there is no justification whatever for bringing recovering drug addicts into a dispute, no matter whether it is called a commercial dispute or an industrial relations dispute.  The dispute has nothing to do with people who are doing their best to recover from an addiction problem.  The HSE has stated there is a significant clinical risk to clients who revert from a methadone maintenance programme to opiate use.  In light of this the action of 140 pharmacists to withdraw services from approximately 3,000 methadone patients is totally wrong and the same applies to threats to withdraw from dispensing drugs to medical card holders.  It should be noted that this is not an act of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and I ask those who are doing this to drug addicts to stop immediately.  The latter have nothing to do with the dispute in which the pharmacists are engaged and it is a very unfair way of fighting their cause.</P>
        <P>On the wider issue, a number of difficulties are involved in the discussions, which are ongoing.  The new price arrangements involve revised rates for community and hospital supply.  In the existing arrangements for community supply pharmacists enjoy a wholesale margin of 18%, which is being reduced to 8% from next January and to 7% from January 2009.  As regards hospital sup<Col N="1487"/>ply, the new interim margin of 5% will apply from 1 January 2008, with further discounts for efficient ordering of supply in the sector.  Savings of approximately &euro;100 million per annum are expected, almost all in the area of community supply, which will mean a reduced price base will apply for all medicines dispensed under the various GMS systems.</P>
        <P>The pharmacists have arguments and difficulties with this but we do not have time to go into that.  I accept the IPU has concerns on behalf of community pharmacists about the implications of the legal advice in respect of their right to negotiate fees within the State.  To address these concerns the Minister agreed to the establishment of a process of dialogue, which is chaired by Mr. Bill Shipsey SC, to explore the ways pharmacists&rsquo; concerns could be addressed, subject to the legal position.  The HSE and the departmental negotiating team met with them last week to discuss implementation issues arising from the new wholesale arrangements and both sides have agreed to meet again.  They met on 3 October and 11 October, under Mr. Shipsey&rsquo;s chairmanship, and have agreed to continue to engage.  Summaries of the HSE&rsquo;s position are in the public domain and an information note has been given to Deputies.  The discussions should continue.</P>
        <P>The view of the HSE, with which the Government agrees, is that there is considerable room for savings in the overall supply of drugs.  The drugs and medicine budget is going up astronomically every year.  The figure is enormous and we believe that, using price margins and economies of scale, savings can be achieved.  Wholesalers are also involved and have a role to play.  As with all industrial relations and supply issues, I could make many arguments if the House had time but the resolution must come from the negotiations.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The legal position can be explained by competition law.  Competition law has been examined by the Attorney General and, independently, the HSE and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union.  The legal position is based on the Competition Authority view that to deal directly with a large group is to effectively create a cartel, which goes against competition law.  The Competition Authority has also made that case in other areas.  The legal opinion of the way the Competition Act 2002 is drafted is unanimous and there is no dispute among legal representatives of the parties.  Some further examination is taking place but I do not know if anything can be done in that regard.  My advice at the moment is to the contrary.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach refers to negotiations and talks which have been initiated under the chairmanship of Bill Shipsey SC and we hope they succeed.  However, this problem has arisen because negotiations could not take place in the normal way.  It was decided that negotiations could not take place with the <Col N="1488"/>IPU because of the provisions of the Competition Act 2002.  When the Competition Bill was going through this House in 2002 I do not think any Member anticipated it would be interpreted in such a way as to prevent the negotiations between the HSE and the IPU, which have been required in this case for some time.  I do not understand why this has arisen only in the case of pharmacists.  Over the course of the past year the Bar Council and the Law Society have negotiated with the State on the levels of legal fees for the criminal legal aid board and the civil legal system and I think it resulted in double digit increases in some cases.  There have been negotiations between the HSE and the IMO in respect of general practitioners who are practising on their own.  There have been negotiations between the HSE and the dental association on behalf of dentists who are functioning on their own.  There have been negotiations between the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and veterinarians on the various schemes for animal testing.  How is it that the Competition Act which does not seem to have caused any problem in preventing negotiations between sole traders in other professions has suddenly given rise to this difficulty in the case of pharmacists alone?</P>
        <P>The legal advice is interesting.  Will the Taoiseach say who has given it?  Is it the advice given to the HSE or has the Attorney General expressed an opinion on the matter?  If the Competition Act is so rigid that it is preventing the sensible negotiations that need to take place between the HSE and the IPU, the Government should amend it in a way that would allow negotiations to take place.  If a State agency comes to a group of professionals or businesses and states it will cut fees or their margins by half, no matter what the merits of the case might be, they will at least want to talk about it and discuss the implications.  We now have a difficulty that recovering heroin addicts cannot get methadone &mdash; I appreciate that distinctions are being drawn &mdash; but the reason pharmacies are talking about closing down is that they have been flagging  a problem for the past year but they have not been able to get to the table to negotiate.  That needs to be resolved.  By all means, let the discussions chaired by Bill Shipsey go ahead but a method needs to be found, if necessary by changing the Competition Act, to allow the IPU to represent pharmacists in the normal way that business associations or professional bodies represent their members in their dealings with the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The dispensing of methadone does not come under the agreement, which is the subject of the dispute.  Whatever the merits of the dispute, the 3,000 methadone users should not be affected by it.  There are ongoing talks with the HSE.  The parties met on 3, 11 and 16 October under the auspices of Mr. Bill Shipsey SC.  I do not know whether they can resolve the issue.</P><Col N="1489"/>
        <P>The savings on the new wholesale margins are substantial.  In the next three or four years the estimated savings will be &euro;260 million on a drugs bill that is rising significantly year on year.  As the HSE sees it, in its examination of the issue &mdash; the Department of Health and Children and the Government agreed with it &mdash; this is not an enormous amount in what is a very lucrative business.  We can see what is happening.  Three or four years ago I was listening to the argument that pharmacies would be put out of business, but since the last dispute, a further 300 have opened and are, according to the figures I have seen, are doing very well.</P>
        <P>Let me explain the legal position.  Whatever about its unsatisfactory nature, when the HSE team sought to negotiate the new wholesale margins with the Pharmaceutical Distributors Federation, PDF, which represents full-time wholesalers, it refused to negotiate new margins for community pharmacists because it was its legal advice that it did not have to negotiate them.  The HSE also received advice that under section 4 of the Competition Act 2002, it was prevented from negotiating directly with undertakings or associations of undertakings.  This applies also to the representative body for pharmacists, the IPU.  Deputy Gilmore asked who gave the legal advice.  First, the Pharmaceutical Distributors Federation took legal advice.  The HSE then sought such advice, as did the Department of Health and Children, which advice concurred with that of the HSE.  The Office of the Attorney General and an independent senior counsel have endorsed this advice.  They all agree this is the position.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Thirty three staff serving in my Department have applied through the central applications facility to relocate under the decentralisation programme.  The breakdown by grade is: principal officer, one; assistant principal, five; higher executive officer, three; administrative officer, seven; executive officer, seven; staff officer, one; clerical officer, nine.  Fifteen former members of staff have been assigned to decentralised posts.</P>
        <P>Arrangements are in place to ensure the decentralisation of staff does not impact negatively on the quality of the services provided by the Department.  These arrangements include the phased redeployment of some of the remaining staff to the areas of the Department most affected by decentralisation and the provision of training and job profiles-work manuals for new staff, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that there are no proposals to decentralise my Department or any of the bodies under its aegis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that one year after the deadline for the relocation of 10,000 staff, less than 15% have moved?  The Government is 85% off its target.  No staff from the State agencies or those who work in ICT or professional and technical areas have relocated.  From a list of 90 locations, staff have transferred to 29.  Sites have not been identified in 24 locations.  Has the Taoiseach a view on the realism of the then Government which reached this decision as to the complexity of the issue and the need to have a proper plan?  Does he admit that there was no proper planning and that that is the reason the programme is so far off target?  No progress has been made in State agencies.  Does he believe there is a business case for the proposed moves and, if so, why has the Government made no proposal to staff serving in State agencies on the possibility of transferring to other posts within the public service, if they wish to stay in Dublin?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl11- ?><Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy appreciates that all of the questions have been tabled to my Department, but it is a matter for the Department of Finance to deal with the general position.  I understand site or building acquisitions have now been completed or significantly advanced in 38 locations and progress is continuing on the identification of suitable sites or properties in others.  Advance office accommodation has been secured or is in the process of being finalised in over 20 locations.  This year 1,500 posts have been allocated.  Therefore, the original aim of relocating 7,200 staff will not be met.  It was agreed that would be done by negotiation and, painful though it may be, a large part of this will have been achieved by the end of 2009.  The popularity of the move is evident from the figures in my Department.  Some 10,900 people have applied to <Col N="1491"/>the Central Applications Facility.  As sites become available and the deadline approaches more people want to move into position.  A total of 40% of those who want to move have moved into Departments that are decentralised.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>More than half of those are from outside Dublin.  That is not a move from Dublin out.  This involves people who are already outside Dublin moving to other non-Dublin locations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is about half of them.</P>

	<P>That was not the objective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The strategy was to move approximately 7,000 people.  A total of 11,000 people want to move and are on the list.  That includes people in other locations.  It was never a Dublin only strategy.  Thankfully, even though the Deputy and I are honoured to represent Dublin, it is not a Dublin only society.  Dublin is not the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should read what was announced in the Budget Statement in 2004.  The purpose was to move public servants from Dublin, it was not to move them around the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what it is doing, but a civil servant who works in Sligo and wants to move somewhere else should not be debarred from doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying that, but the way this was presented&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Then we agree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>My question was whether there has been a failure in planning.  The strategy was intended to move posts out of Dublin, to ease pressures on Dublin.  We have ended up with a programme that is only 15% implemented.  Half the people who are moving were not in Dublin and the Government still will not admit that there was a failure of planning and strategy framing in regard to this programme.  In the case of State agency not a single person is moving.  At some point a Minister must stand up and say this was a blunder and that if we are to do this sort of thing in future, we need to do it better.</P>

      </Speaker>

      <?oasys _cl11.2- ?><Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That was not the implication.  What I said was that any proper programme that goes to the Government in a Government memorandum should have a strategy behind it, a business case, that makes it stand up.  There was nothing of that kind.  That was abandoned.  This was a phoney decision under the cover of budget secrecy.  It was a failure of governance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The House must understand the rules of procedure.  The Taoiseach must be allowed to answer questions and Deputy Bruton must be allowed to ask questions.  We cannot have both going on at the same time.  Let us hear the Taoiseach without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>More than 40% of the 7,200 civil servant posts due to relocate under the programme are now filled by staff who are decentralising and are either in their new locations or are being skilled up for their new posts.  Over the next few years we will see the relocation of the 10,900 civil servants who have applied to relocate under the decentralisation programme.  The Central Applications Facility continues to receive new applications.  It is anticipated that this will continue.  A total of 50% of the applicants to the CAF are based in Dublin, that is, almost 5,500.  I have given the number of locations.  By the end of 2009 most of the people on the current list will be decentralised.</P>
        <P>In regard to the agencies, that is an issue the Deputy may take up with the Department of Finance.  None of the agencies under my Department is scheduled for decentralisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that it is unacceptable that Government, which introduced this programme and wants to implement it, has made no proposal to State agencies in regard to how people who opt to remain in Dublin can be redeployed within the public service?  There is no history of and no system for transferring from an agency to the public service or another agency.  Some 2,300 people have had decentralisation hanging over their heads for the past four years.  Virtually nobody has opted to move from Dublin in the case of the State agencies, yet the Government has no proposals to progress that aspect of decentralisation.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that it is not acceptable for Ministers, who are responsible for <Col N="1493"/>the implementation of this programme, to hide behind the decentralisation implementation group, to refuse to answer questions in regard to it, and instead point the finger repeatedly at an unaccountable implementation group?  I know the Ceann Comhairle feels equally concerned that these bodies should be accountable in a more realistic way.  This is a Government programme and it should not be hived off to an unaccountable agency with no Minister taking responsibility when things go wrong.  Does the Taoiseach accept that as head of the Government he must impose more ministerial responsibility in regard to this programme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Ministerial responsibility for the entire programme rests with the Minister for Finance.  The decentralisation implementation group is answerable to the Department of Finance.  It is not independent of the Department but works directly to it and the Department of Finance answers for it.</P>
        <P>On State agencies, the report of the implementation group continues to emphasise the central role of the board and the management of each agency in driving the process forward.  Every Minister should be involved in pressing that.  That is what they have been asked to do by the Minister for Finance.  The group expects that all agencies should, at a minimum, have initiated HR recruitment policies to support the programme &mdash; I understand that has been done &mdash; have begun to put phased timeframes in place and be actively securing advance or permanent accommodation solutions in the decentralised location.  A clear strategy is laid down, which is the policy of the Department of Finance, and every Department is obliged to follow that.</P>
        <P>At the group level there have been meetings with CEOs of State agencies to discuss with them their detailed implementation arrangements.  It is true that very few of the agencies want to move out of Dublin because in the two previous rounds of decentralisation there was no agreement on the transfer of staff between agencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Whose responsibility is it to make an offer on that?  Is it not the Taoiseach&rsquo;s responsibility?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The group refers to the fact that some of the unions representing State agency members have adopted a stance of opposition to Government policy from the start.  The group continues to highlight the importance of getting active discussions under way with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on a range of industrial relations issues impacting on the relocation.  The Department of Finance has written to ICTU and has had some discussions with it with a view to forming a small group to explore whether progress can be made on this issue.  ICTU has not yet replied but is examining the possibility of doing this.  The Department of Finance has suggested <Col N="1494"/>the introduction of an arrangement which would allow transferability of staff between agencies.  This has never happened since the foundation of the State.  It is considered by the unions as new and is not something most of the agency staff want.  The Government believes it should be possible to put together a scheme under which staff could transfer within agencies because, although the numbers are not as high as in the Civil Service, a substantial number of people working in the agencies want to move and they should be facilitated in doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach indicated that 33 staff in his Department had applied to decentralise and that ten have already been redeployed.</P>
        <P>What percentage of the staff in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department do these figures represent?  I agree fully with Deputy Bruton that the figures under review do not reflect the intent of the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, who indicated that the purpose of this measure was to see the relocation of 10,000 civil servants and State agency employees.  He also contextualised decentralisation in respect of city traffic relief, commuting and other matters pertaining to housing cost access in the city of Dublin.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, decentralisation is not simply about staff numbers.  Since the scheme&rsquo;s announcement and consequential relocations, has an assessment been made on the success of the relocation of departmental sections?  Have comparative studies been undertaken regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of respective redeployments of departmental sections to different locations as against the operation of such sections in the city of Dublin?  If such studies have not been undertaken within the short time involved, can the Taoiseach advise Members whether such an exercise has ever been undertaken for any of the previous tranches of decentralisation, of which there have been a considerable number?  If such an exercise has not been carried out in respect of the most recent move, will the Taoiseach indicate his intent in this regard?  It would be a highly important exercise on which to embark.</P>
        <P>As for the issue of State agencies, Members must recognise that SIPTU represents approximately 1,600 State agency employees who have made clear their position.  In reply to a question yesterday, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, indicated to me that the call by SIPTU for the abandonment of the relocation of State agencies was not in line with the Labour Court recommendations.  However, the Taoiseach will have noted the Labour Court has also struck down the proposed unfair method of decentralisation, namely, the coupling together of relocation and promotion prospects.  In this context and given SIPTU&rsquo;s representation of large numbers of employees of State agencies, what is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response to its proposal to abandon <Col N="1495"/>the project of relocating State agencies?  In particular, I seek a response in light of all the information now available, as well as the experience gained regarding State agencies since the announcement was first made in this Chamber on budget day some years ago by the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remember the first round of negotiations at the end of the 1980s.  I was involved in the arrangements within the Department of Finance for three years in respect of relocating large parts of the Central Statistics Office, Revenue and the then Department of Social Welfare.  At the time we encountered all the difficulties that have been experienced in this round, which is understandable because it brings change, movement and a different set-up.  However, the civil servants and the Departments involved would state the moves have worked extremely well.  Several analyses have been carried out by different bodies and groups in the intervening period and it has worked out very satisfactorily.  Currently, there are no difficulties in this regard.  The difficulties pertain to the set-up.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the advance groups that have already gone.  Some sections of the Department of Transport have already moved to Clonakilty, other sections have moved to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s constituency in County Cavan in advance mode and are working very well.  I refer to the Marine Institute and others.  Despite all the arguments that large numbers of staff would not move, 95% of Marine Institute staff have so done.  These moves work very well.</P>
        <P>As for the State agencies, of the 10,000 or 11,000 people on the central applications facility, CAF, list, only 1,000 come from the agencies.  In respect of the F&Aacute;S case, the Labour Court stated as part of its recommendations that it believed the stated policy of effecting decentralisation on a voluntary basis could best be achieved if individuals who were willing to relocate could be provided with realistic alternative options.  This is the reason the Department of Finance, through the decentralisation implementation group, is trying to negotiate an agreement with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that would allow for such a scheme to operate.  While only time will tell whether this will be successful, at least both sides have engaged in an examination of this.  Obviously I hope it will be successful as those who have been listed would then have an opportunity to move.  However, one should be conscious that this has never happened in previous rounds while it has worked successfully in the Civil Service.</P>
        <P>As previously noted, approximately 2,000 posts will have been moved by the end of this year.  In 2008 and 2009, several thousand more people will move, based on the number of locations in which building is taking place or offices have been purchased.  This gives approximately 7,000 people <Col N="1496"/>from the total of 10,900, not all of whom are from Dublin, as was noted earlier.  However, several thousand would move to those locations.  Advance accommodation has been secured in approximately 20 locations to enable early movers to move.  I understand that in such cases, no difficulties have arisen.  Revenue has encountered a few difficulties and I understand the Minister for Finance spoke on this issue yesterday.  Alternative numbers have been put up in respect of the proposed information and communications technology, ICT, move to Kildare.  Consequently, while some changes are taking place within some agencies, by and large the numbers will be achieved and with sensible negotiations on all sides, a position will be reached whereby most of those offices that were nominated in the first place will have moved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach did not respond regarding the figures pertaining to his Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add a further point.  What percentage do those figures represent in respect of the Department of the Taoiseach?  How does this compare with other Departments?  Is there a rush to get away from the Taoiseach?  The Taoiseach should respond in this regard.</P>
        <P>As for the State agencies, the difficulties are clear.  Some people within existing State agencies have, over their years of service, developed specific skills that are particular to the role of the State agency in which they work.  Such individuals are not multi-transferable and are not immediately moveable from one State agency to another because they cover such a variety of areas of address.  It is feared that people will be moved inappropriately, irrespective of their years of service and experience.  The Taoiseach should respond to another fear, namely, out of pride and unwillingness on his part and that of his colleagues to climb down on this issue in the face of such persistent opposition, he will attempt to cobble together opportunities to try to accommodate some aspects of the decentralisation proposals pertaining to State agencies.  The Taoiseach must address this issue and allay fears in this regard.  Ultimately, he will be obliged to make a balanced judgment as to what is in the overall national interest in terms of the State agency proposals.  If it is the case that on balance, it would not be feasible to proceed, the Taoiseach must be big enough to admit this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of agencies have moved.  While I have outlined the difficulties regarding the State agencies, several other agencies, such as the Marine Institute, moved in its entirety.  Only a small number of its staff did not move.  The Land Registry was in a notoriously <Col N="1497"/>difficult position because it had many difficulties in terms of work arrangements and delays.  However, when it decentralised to the constituency of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Martin Cullen, in Waterford, it proved to be a huge success.  There have been a number of other examples, including the move to Cork of 800 staff from the Central Statistics Office.  They have proved to be enormously successful, although admittedly there were many difficulties with the initial moving process.  However, these have settled down and it has been working effectively as part of the system.</P>
        <P>I have talked to union leaders about these issues when dealing with social partnership and so on.  Many of the agency staff think differently from public servants about decentralisation and they do not see it as something they want to do.  That is a fact of life.  We must try to accommodate these people.  In my Department, 33 staff have applied for relocation and 15 have already been decentralised.  This is a total of 48 people out of just over 200 staff &mdash; a sizeable number &mdash; who want to move to rural areas under the current CAF round.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I recall that when the then Minister for Finance, former Deputy McCreevy, announced the decentralisation scheme, he told us it was designed to reduce the Dublin mindset in the running of the country, ease traffic in Dublin, reduce house prices and bring prosperity and plenty to the 50 places to which public servants would be sent.  He said that 10,000 people would be moving to various places outside Dublin.  I understand from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply that one year after the deadline, only 1,000 people have actually moved out of Dublin.  The Taoiseach is now trying to redefine the whole purpose of the exercise.  The numbers of decentralised staff will now include anybody who is moving from one place to another around the country.  One thousand of these have already been included.</P>
        <P>The last time we heard a cost for this exercise, it was put at &euro;900 million.  At a time when we are short of money in many public service areas &mdash; there are problems with the health service and with schools, and there are not enough garda&iacute; on the streets in many areas &mdash; can the Taoiseach remind us why we are spending &euro;900 million on a decentralisation project under which only 1,000 of the 10,000 people who were supposed to move out of Dublin have done so?  What is the benefit <Col N="1498"/>to the taxpayer of this exercise?  In light of the experience of the past three or four years, what is the benefit of the scheme?</P>
        <P>Regarding the voluntary aspect of decentralisation, over the past three or four years every advertisement for a promotion competition in the public service has carried a note at the bottom stating that the successful applicant must be prepared to move to a decentralised location.  As I understand it, the Labour Court has now shot that down by stating that promotional opportunities cannot be linked to decentralisation.  What is the policy now in respect of the advertisement of promotion competitions?  Has the connection with decentralisation been removed?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach mentioned Clonakilty.  BIM, which is located in my constituency, is to be decentralised to that area.  Whenever I meet members of the BIM staff while doing my grocery shopping in the shopping centre, they ask me about this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>How often?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>They tell me they will not go.  I understand that a building has been bought in Clonakilty to accommodate them.  What am I to tell the members of the BIM staff when I meet them again?  Are they going to Clonakilty or not?  If they are not going, what will they be doing in Dublin?  These people are experts on fish.  They do not know anything about F&Aacute;S, education, schools or anything they may be assigned to in Dublin.  They only know about fish &mdash; they are marine biologists and other similar professionals.  If they do not go to Clonakilty, will the State employ other people who do know about fish to work in the office in Clonakilty?  What will we do about the people who already know about fish, but are to be left behind in D&uacute;n Laoghaire?</P>

It is good for the public service and it is good for individuals to return to their own areas.  It is also good for this city.  Obviously, there is a cost involved.  We have spent &euro;4.5 billion on schools and we are spending billions on other things.  Over a few years, which is a relatively short period in the life of the public service, we have moved many services around the country.  It is good that we are not seen to have a Dublin mindset.</P>
        <P>As I said before, with modern technology there is no reason services should not be moved to locations outside Dublin.  There is now a free telephone service whereby people in my constituency can ring the Department in Sligo with inquiries about their pensions.  In fact, to be frank, the service is far more efficient than when the offices were located in my constituency.  Technology has moved on.  We used to have enormous difficulties.  Now that the staff are in Sligo, they can be reached far more quickly and easily.  Apart from this, many in my constituency think that people are far nicer when they are outside Dublin.

	<P>I ask the Taoiseach to report on the progress of the decentralisation of F&aacute;ilte Ireland to Mallow and Bus &Eacute;ireann to Mitchelstown.  These two towns, which have been decimated by job losses, held high expectations of the decentralisation process and made many preparatory plans.  There has been no reporting on the decentralisation process as it pertains to these towns and we would like to know what exactly is going on.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>These are questions for the line Minister but, as I stated earlier, if the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the decentralisation implementation group can come to an understanding on the agencies issue, it will certainly help in these areas.</P>

	<P>On the State agencies, particularly the decentralisation of F&Aacute;S to Birr &mdash; I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle will probably tell me it is a matter for the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I probably will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought that too but I tabled two oral questions to the Minister for Finance yesterday, neither of which appeared on the Order Paper and both of which were transferred to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is why I am coming to the Taoiseach from whom I might get a direct answer.  In terms of the flexibility within the Civil Service, it is worrying to hear the Taoiseach tell us that four years after the announcement there is a small group trying to explore how decentralisation of the semi-State bodies will happen.  I would expect much more progress at this point and I ask him to give a specific answer in that regard.</P>
        <P>On two further brief issues, is there a backlog in the Department of the Taoiseach and other Departments, such as in the Minister, Deputy Cullen&rsquo;s Department, in processing applications and other matters where staff encounter difficulty because people have been transferred?</P>
        <P>It has been put to me by people involved in the proposed designation of a world heritage site in Clonmacnoise that one of the reasons for the lack of progress on this is that expertise in that regard has been transferred from the Department that was dealing with it to other Departments and that there is not significant expertise within the Department that should be dealing with the designation to progress this at the pace originally promised.  Will the Taoiseach deal with that as well?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1502"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of the individual case, but overall approximately 40% of the staff due for decentralisation have moved into their new positions.  Of course there is a transition period where people must move and be retrained in new Departments or in new sections of Departments that are decentralised, but I understand that has gone fairly well.</P>
        <P>The reason the group is trying to get an agreement between State agencies and ICTU relates to the Labour Court decision on the F&Aacute;S case that it is right an individual should have an opportunity to avail of a scheme by which he or she can move to another agency, as exists in the Civil Service.  The difficulty is there is no such scheme because in the previous two rounds of decentralisation in the 1990s agencies were not moved.  This is a chance to develop a new scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a timeframe?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If ICTU responds, it is likely to state that 1,000 of the 11,000 want to move.  Although I do not want to answer for ICTU, I think it would be reluctant to agree with anything that is compulsory.  It is clear from its submission in the Labour Court case that it is prepared at least to think about voluntary decentralisation for those who wish to go.  ICTU has stated that it will resist any attempt to move people on a compulsory basis.  That is ICTU&rsquo;s position, but at least it is looking at this matter.  It has not agreed yet to go into a process but if it does that, we can at least devise a scheme that would allow those who have put themselves on the CAF list to get out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>On the backlog in dealing with claims and the loss of expertise, does the decentralisation committee or the Minister for Finance need to put a scheme in place to ensure that people are retrained during the process of people being moved on.  For example, only two sites in the country have been chosen for designation as a world heritage site and this has enormous impact for the country from a tourism perspective.  It is wrong that a matter like that is delayed due to a lack of expertise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That happens all the time, for example, when an assistant principal is promoted to principal officer or an EO is promoted to HEO and moves to a different section of a Department.  Such moves are ever-present in Departments.  This involves 4,000 or 5,000 people over three or four years and that should not create an excuse.  It raises the old question of whether people want to embrace this and move.  There are people who do and there are some who are against it.  The fact is 11,000 civil servants, over half of whom are in Dublin, are anxious to move.</P>

On behalf of the Government, I extend my warmest congratulations to Archbishop Brady.  In honouring Archbishop Brady, Pope Benedict has acknowledged the transformation that has occurred in Northern Ireland.  The success of the peace process and the restoration of devolved administration has been, as the Holy Father has publicly acknowledged, a sign of hope for all those across the world who struggle for peace and reconciliation in the face of violence and civil strife.  I think everybody in this House will acknowledge that the archbishop has for many decades been to the fore in working across his community for peace in Northern Ireland.  This is a very special day for him and I acknowledge that.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I join the Taoiseach in congratulating Archbishop Se&aacute;n Brady who is to be elevated to the position of cardinal.  He is a man who has earned the respect of everyone and he will carry the duties of that post well.</P>
        <P>While I am on my feet, I recognise the achievement of our novelist, Ms Anne Enright, whose novel, which I have read, was kindly sent to us all.  I congratulate her on a tremendous achievement.  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle will take some credit for this because this book was published during his period as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and it represents the flowering of Irish talent.  No doubt the themes of blame and hurt within the family are ones that even political families sometimes must experience.</P>

I share, with the Taoiseach and Deputy Bruton, and I am sure all Members of the House, in the appreciation and respect for the work that Archbishop Brady has been doing, not only in his diocese but throughout the country, dealing with issues relating to Northern Ireland and with wider social issues which affect our society as a whole.  I wish him well in his new appointment.  It is a great honour for him personally and for the country.</P>

	<P>I, too, join with the Taoiseach in extending our congratulations to Archbishop Se&aacute;n Brady on his elevation to the College of Cardinals.  This is a very deserved recognition of Archbishop Brady&rsquo;s contribution on a number of levels.  I concur with the Taoiseach in particular on the very quiet but nevertheless committed way Archbishop Brady played an important and very helpful and encouraging role in the earliest days of the peace process.  I recall particularly having the opportunity to participate in an event outside of this island of which Archbishop Brady and his counterpart, the former moderator of the Presbyterian Church, were co-hosts.  It is important that his role, often unseen and unrecognised and rarely acknowledged, is recorded in the House today.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt this is a very important decision for the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland, for the members of that church throughout the island of Ireland, but it is also a particularly welcome announcement for the people of Archbishop Brady&rsquo;s native County Cavan in my constituency.  A native son of County Cavan, he is regarded with great pride and is held in high regard by the people of his native county.  Today&rsquo;s announcement will be welcomed very particularly in the Breffni county.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not propose to prevent the Government having a debate on this issue at this point.  However, it is worth remarking that this proposal arises from a budget overrun which occurred in a particular Department that was going to hurt people at the front line.  Measures are now introduced to vire money to prevent frontline services from being hurt, yet in other Departments that have a far more vital impact on people, namely, in health, the same effort is not made to deal with budget overruns to make sure people at the front line are not hurt and that money is vired from administration and other areas that can take the cut to protect people at the front line.  It is interesting that there is one solution in one area of Government and a different solution elsewhere.</P>

	<P>I welcome the fact that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has had the humility to admit his Department got the sums wrong and that it has to rejig the Estimates.  I would welcome the same humility on the part of the Minister for Health and Children in regard to what is happening in the Health Service Executive where clearly there is a mess in regard to the budget.  It is not possible to sort out that mess except at the cost of extreme suffering to people who are requesting services.</P>
        <P>If it is possible for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to rejig his budget so as to take funding from an unallocated area, the question arises, particularly in regard to health and the Health Service Executive, as to why it is not possible to shrink the administrative budget and rejig the money for patient care.  We know the sums were wrong and the Minister has been big enough to acknowledge that.  This would reduce the seriously distressing stories Members on both sides of this House are confronted with on a daily basis.</P>

When the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources announced the ending of the greener homes scheme on 4 September he stated there would be a Supplementary Estimate to provide for a new scheme.  We do not have a Supplementary Estimate today, what we have is what is known as a token Supplementary Estimate.  It is not new or additional money coming into the Department, it is a transfer of money from one essential service, which is now being denied money, to shore up a scheme the Government has allowed collapse.  I ask the Ceann Comhairle that we have accuracy in what Ministers state so that people are not fooled about what we are engaged in today.</P>

	<P>This Vote has been sought as a Supplementary Estimate by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  I am sure he will be able to justify the request on the floor of the House, but Members of the Opposition are at a significant disadvantage in that we do have and have not been provided with the detail of what is being sought and the purpose and intent of same.  Inquiries by my office this morning to a number of potential sources, including the Minister&rsquo;s office directly, have resulted in a zero response.  It might be described as budgetary confidentiality that applies to the detail of this, and we will not know what is involved until the Minister stands before us and outlines the detail of what he seeks.  That places members of the Opposition at a distinct disadvantage.  I urge the Minister and the <Col N="1508"/>Taoiseach to revisit this matter.  Presenting this Supplementary Estimate on the Order of Business and expecting us to make an informed judgment of the appropriateness or otherwise of what is sought is impossible.  We must wing it, literally, until the Minister takes the floor.  However, we are prepared to give him that chance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McManus raised this point last week or the previous week.  I said then I would check it but that it was necessary to bring forward a Supplementary Estimate.  What we are doing today is seeking leave to introduce the Supplementary Estimate &mdash; Vote 30.

	<P>Arising from our discussion on Leaders&rsquo; Questions, has the Government plans to introduce amending legislation to the Competition Act to allow for negotiations to take place between the State and professional bodies on the type of matters to which I referred?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach circulated a briefing note on the proposal to have a joint committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Two issues arise from that briefing note.  First, I note discussions are taking place between the Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly on the question of a proposed North-South parliamentary forum.  Is it intended this forum will be established before the joint committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement?  What will be the difference between the two?  What will the joint committee deal with that the North-South parliamentary forum will not?</P>
        <P>Second, in the briefing note, the Taoiseach states it is intended that the joint committee might invite Northern Ireland MPs on a cross-community basis to attend and contribute to its proceedings.  What discussions, if any, has the Taoiseach had with Northern Ireland MPs and what is their interest in participating in this committee?  Will he clarify whether the reference to Northern Ireland MPs is intended to include a reference to MLAs also or only to what the briefing note describes as members of the Westminster Parliament?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No Bill is listed on the competition issue.  Obviously, the legal advice will have to be considered but no legislation is listed at this stage.</P>
        <P>A number of points arise with regard to the joint committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  There have been many discussions in recent years.  There was an agreed position some years ago on a committee chaired by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on the format of the proposed committee.  Subsequently, there was a change of view so we had to revise those proposals.  The present committee is based on the revised proposals on which we had agreement with the parties in the House.</P>
        <P>We are only referring to MPs elected to Westminster, not MLAs.  That is the distinction.  I had an opportunity, with the Ceann Comhairle, to meet the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, who visited last week.  We discussed the North-South parliamentary forum, which would obviously include MLAs.  We hope to work to achieve that.  I hope we will have the parliamentary forum up and running in the new year but it will take some time.  While I cannot be <Col N="1510"/>sure how long it will take, the joint committee will be established before then.</P>
        <P>I have had consultations with the parties in the North.  Some parties will certainly take the opportunity to attend while others initially will not.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Will the Taoiseach expand on this issue?  I understood from the briefing note that the MPs would attend on a cross-community basis.  Which MPs are likely to attend and which are not?</P>
        <P>I do not understand why this is confined to Westminster MPs.  Why not give the opportunity to participate to MLAs?  Why is it confined to Westminster MPs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the agreement we reached in the discussions.  The view was that if we were to invite MLAs, we would have a very large committee.  The MPs will be invited on a cross-community basis but the idea is that we would not invite 50 or 60 MLAs into a committee of 15 to 20 Members.  That is not what the House wanted so membership is restricted to MPs.  However, the parliamentary forum will have so many members from the Oireachtas and so many from the Assembly.</P>

	<P>In light of the crisis faced by the pig industry, when will a Bill be introduced to amend food labelling to include country of origin?  Last week, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food promised to introduce legislation on the issue. </P>

In view of the disconnect between the Minister for Health and Children and the House &mdash; I believe she has not appeared in the Chamber since the session commenced &mdash; what urgency does the Government attach to country of origin labelling?

After the recent case in which the evidence of a little girl with Down&rsquo;s syndrome could not be taken in court because of a capacity issue, will the Government introduce the mental capacity Bill as a matter of urgency?

        <P>The provision of additional funding can be seen as recognition of SEI&rsquo;s success in rolling out key capital programmes.  SEI is a relatively new State body established in 2002.  It has taken several years to get its programmes up and running.  Now that it is ramping up, the capital budget required to fund these programmes must rise.  The budgetary allocation to SEI for its programmes in 2007 is being augmented to allow it to meet increased spending proposals on its successful programmes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">SEI&rsquo;s major energy conservation programmes have proven extremely popular.  Greener homes and houses of tomorrow account for most of the additional spending proposals.  On 3 September, I announced that the greener homes scheme had fulfilled its initial objectives of stimulating demand for renewable technologies in homes and of assisting the fledgling renewable heat industry.  The scheme surpassed its targets ahead of schedule.  Since its inception, more than 16,000 grants have been awarded under greener homes.  There has been a dramatic increase in renewable technology suppliers and a tenfold expansion in the number of renewable energy products available on the market.</P>
        <P>By August of this year, approved applications had reached the &euro;47 million five-year capital sanction for the scheme.  Rather than end the scheme, I launched a new phase with revised terms and conditions to consolidate the industry and help more householders achieve their desire to embrace renewable heat technologies.  Consequently, the grant levels are being reduced for some areas where it is clear that the market has reached a level of maturity to allow it to continue at a lower rate of support.  Other grant levels remain unchanged.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Greener homes has a budget of &euro;20 million in 2007, accounting for the majority of SEI&rsquo;s allocated capital budget of &euro;31 million.  The success of greener homes means that the 2007 allocation is not sufficient to pay all grant approved householders who have installed solar panels, heat pumps, wool pellet boilers and other supported technologies.  An additional &euro;9 million is needed in this calendar year to cover these grant approvals.  A further &euro;1 million is needed for the ReHeat scheme, which grant aids renewable heat technologies for schools, hospitals and community groups.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The house of tomorrow programme is another success story.  Last month, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, published for consultation draft new building regulations that will see new housing some 40% more energy efficient than housing built under current regulations.  Carbon emissions will be similarly <Col N="1519"/>reduced by 40%.  Our renewable heat obligations require all new buildings to have renewable heat components.</P>
        <P>These major steps forward in energy and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> performance standards have been made possible by the house of tomorrow programme.  Successor programmes will raise these performance standards even further to prepare the industry for a further planned revision of the building regulations in 2010, which will see energy performance standards some 60% better than at present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">House of tomorrow has achieved its objective by funding developers to build a national network of replicable model examples of more sustainable energy house building practices.  Developments funded under house of tomorrow can regularly be seen in the property supplements.  The high energy performance standards of these developments are seen as a strong marketing tool.  In this way, house of tomorrow has served as a catalyst of change in the building industry and consumer market and has delivered the persuasive evidence base needed to support the political decision to revise the building regulations making <?oasys _dc28- ?>mandatory the standards set by house of tomorrow.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P Just="Left">House of tomorrow has a budget allocation of some &euro;5 million in 2007.  However, the nature of the programme means that binding commitments were entered into by SEI as far back as 2004 when the developers first sought planning permission.  An additional allocation of &euro;4 million in 2007 is needed for SEI to meet its legally binding commitments under the programme.</P>
        <P>The low income housing programme was developed several years ago to help establish and implement a national plan of action to systematically address the problem of fuel poverty.  The warmer homes scheme is SEI&rsquo;s main implementing measure under the programme.  The warmer homes scheme aims to improve the energy efficiency and comfort conditions of homes occupied by low income households and to establish the systems and grow the capacity in Ireland to install such measures.  The scheme adopts a social employment delivery model in which regional community-based organisations acquire and apply the skills to carry out works, including attic and cavity wall insulation, draught proofing, fitting of boiler lagging jackets, energy efficient lighting and energy advice.  The low income housing programme has a budget allocation of &euro;1.6 million but an additional &euro;1 million is needed in 2007 if SEI is to meet its commitments under this programme.</P>
        <P>The other main additional demands for 2007 funding are the building energy rating project and the industries programme.  Under the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006, SEI is the issuing authority for building energy rating certificates.  This new responsibility for SEI in 2007 required the agency to develop and manage the administrative and information technology systems necessary to <Col N="1520"/>issue energy performance certificates for every new residential and commercial building and each existing building that is put up for sale or rent.  These systems have been designed by SEI to become self-financing by 2010 but significant start up costs are being incurred at present.  SEI has a small budget of &euro;500,000 in 2007 and will need an additional &euro;500,000.</P>
        <P>Finally, SEI&rsquo;s industries programme provides energy management advice services to businesses, including energy audits of commercial premises.  These advice services help businesses save approximately 20% on their energy costs and are a significant contributor to our efforts to reduce energy demand in the economy.  SEI branched out its business advice services in 2007 to include small and medium enterprises.  This is proving very successful to date but, because it is leading to increased costs for SEI, an additional &euro;500,000 is needed in 2007.</P>
        <P>I am releasing &euro;10 million from the information and communications technology programme.  This funding has been identified from an unspent allocation relating to the national broadband scheme.  While significant progress has been made to date on the procurement process for this scheme, no substantial expenditure will be incurred until some time after a service provider has been appointed.  This is expected to happen during the second quarter of 2008.  In addition, capital programmes such as metropolitan area networks are funded on a multi-annual basis which allows flexibility in terms of the rescheduling of payments.</P>
        <P>I am also releasing &euro;6.2 million from the energy research and technical development and innovation programme.  Energy research and innovation is a key component of the science, technology and innovation strategy, and the National Development Plan 2007-13.  This reflects the importance of the energy sector and the imperative for the economy and society to deliver sustainable, competitive and secure energy.  The national development plan provides an envelope of &euro;149 million for energy research and innovation to 2013.  Under the energy policy framework and the programme for Government, we are setting an ambitious and targeted agenda for energy research which will ensure this multi-annual funding is deployed to best effect.  The Irish Energy Research Council is preparing the energy research strategy for 2008 to 2013, which will be submitted to me by the end of this year.  The strategy will advise on the priority areas and technologies most appropriate to the national energy research effort in the short to medium term.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has already made a firm commitment to support the accelerated development of ocean energy, where Ireland has a natural advantage and needs to be ahead of the international development curve.  The Government has also decided to amend the remit of Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, to include a third <Col N="1521"/>research pillar in the area of sustainable energy and energy efficient technologies.  It is clear that we need to systematically build capacity in energy research and underpin energy and climate change policy with the requisite scientific endeavour.  My Department&rsquo;s Charles Parsons' energy research awards are already funding research projects over seven years from 2007 totalling &euro;20 million.  Discussions are under way between my Department, SFI and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to agree on the foundation&rsquo;s role and remit in energy research.  SFI will bring its proven success and expertise to the energy area.  I see SFI as having a pivotal role in the critical task of ramping up our national research capability in this sphere.  In that context, we are also discussing the transfer to the foundation of the Charles Parsons awards as a logical and sensible step.</P>
        <P>We are putting in place all the essential building blocks for energy research and innovation to expand from 2008.  The redeployment of the remaining 2007 funding to SEI programmes is a prudent use of resources and reflects the multi-annual flexibility of the overall energy research envelope.  I have outlined the details of the token Supplementary Estimate, the costs of which can be met from within my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  I hope Deputies will agree that the proposals are reasonable and I ask that the House approves this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise questions on this issue before we vote on it.  However, on the basis of what the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has said, I have real concerns about whether Fine Gael can support this Supplementary Estimate.  The proposals under discussion would provide an additional capital expenditure of &euro;16.2 million to Sustainable Energy Ireland under the heading of energy conservation in order to meet grant aid commitments which have already been agreed by the agency.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael is supportive of the greener homes initiative, the reheat scheme outlined by the Minister, the house of tomorrow programme and the warmer homes scheme.  These represent positive developments and deserve funding.  However, an issue arises in terms of how the funding will be provided.  This discussion should not be redirected towards accusations that Fine Gael or any other party has reservations about energy conservation or the merits of greener homes schemes.</P>
        <P>We need to clarify three issues with the Minister before we can support this Supplementary Estimate.  We want an explanation as to how Sustainable Energy Ireland was able to write cheques that it could not cash.  Why did SEI overspend to such a level during 2007?  We also need to clarify the source of the additional &euro;16.2 million.  Unfortunately, the Minister&rsquo;s contribution failed to set out the source of &euro;10 million of that allocation. <Col N="1522"/> He instead gave a general statement regarding the MANs programme and multi-annual funding.  I cannot accept that &euro;10 million can be taken from a programme without negative consequences.  The third and most important issue concerns an explanation on how the Minister can transfer money from a completely different budget area and not expect a negative impact on other capital investment programmes.</P>
        <P>With regard to SEI&rsquo;s overspending, the agency was given a total capital allocation of &euro;17.5 million in the original budget Estimate, which represented a 7% increase on 2006.  As a result of additional funding in the 2007 budget and a re-allocation of some energy capital within the Department, the capital figure in the revised Estimate increased to &euro;31 million.  The brief we received from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources states that despite the increase it was clear to the Department from the start of the year that SEI would be challenged on capital funding for 2007.  Therefore, even though I would like to have agreed with Deputy Burton when she commented during the Order of Business on the humility of the Minister to admit his Department got the figures wrong, the facts do not bear that out.  His Department tells me that it knew from the beginning of the year &mdash; to be fair to Deputy Eamon Ryan, he was not Minister at the time &mdash; that capital funding problems would arise for SEI when the budget was allocated.  The obvious issue that somebody in my position must raise is that, if it was known that SEI was not receiving sufficient money, either the plans for capital expenditure must be reduced or more money must be allocated at the start of the year.   One cannot allow a situation wherein the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, gives Sustainable Energy Ireland a wink and a nod at the start of the year while acknowledging that it is underfunded by 50%.  We are talking about giving &euro;16.2 million in addition to capital spending of &euro;31 million.</P>
        <P>Did the Government and the Department give SEI permission to spend money that it did not have or was SEI spending money based on the promise of this Supplementary Estimate?  If so, did the Minister and the Department know where the extra &euro;16 million would come from?  If they knew, why did they allocate money to other sections in the Department when they knew they would take it away at the end of the year?  This applies particularly to the &euro;10 million that I will refer to shortly.</P>
        <P>The &euro;31 million revised capital allocation is now exhausted.  The brief states: &ldquo;more money is needed to deliver on SEI&rsquo;s capital programmes if we are to avoid severe consequences&rdquo;.  What does this mean?  Reading between the lines it means the money has already been spent so there will be severe consequences if we cannot meet these obligations.  The projected shortfall is &euro;16.2 million and this is not a small amount of money &mdash; <Col N="1523"/>it is more than 50% of the total allocation given at the start of the year.</P>
        <P>The past two or three weeks in the D&aacute;il have seen so-called health cuts or more accurately a refusal to give the Health Service Executive an allocation of money to allow it to provide basic health services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the State&rsquo;s most basic responsibility of providing people with health care the Government has said refused an increased allocation of funds for the HSE, yet a greener homes scheme and other worthy schemes have gone way over budget and we are willing to take money from an information and communications technology budget, effectively from another Department, to bail out this scheme.  I have no problem with extra money being sourced from the Department of Finance or with money being found within the energy budget because this would mean the Minister is prioritising within the heading of energy conservation and putting money into the areas in which he feels it will be best spent and will give value.  I will talk about the &euro;6.2 million in this regard in a moment.  Without a clearer explanation than that offered I do not find it acceptable to take money allocated for the roll-out of broadband, which has had a poor record under this Government for the past five or six years, and put it into a totally unconnected area.</P>
        <P>We need clarification on where the money is to come from.  We have received a reasonable explanation from the Minister on the &euro;6.2 million, which is to come from energy research and technological development and innovation, RTDI, programmes, and I thank him for that.  It seems extraordinary that the original estimate for energy RTDI, after the budget, was approximately &euro;7 million, similar to the figure for 2006.  The pre-budget figure was &euro;14 million so, clearly, money has been transferred from energy RTDI research and development programmes to Sustainable Energy Ireland.  I do not have a problem with that because it means money is going to areas that are expanding and working well, like the greener homes scheme, because people are buying into them.  The greener homes scheme is a success story and the energy budget should be adjusted to reflect this.</P>
        <P>The other &euro;10 million is the area that causes me concern.  Last week during Question Time the Minister said that this is coming from a multi-annual programme in the telecommunications area, particularly from the MANS and other developments.  He said that the funds were not fixed on any one year which allows us flexibility in terms of payment to allow the transfer of funds.  The Minister is, more or less, saying the same today.  Are we expected to believe that one can take &euro;10 million that was presumably allocated for phase two of the roll-out of the metro<Col N="1524"/>politan area networks, MANs, programme and expect no consequences in terms of capital spending?  That programme was to put cable around 90 new towns that do not have sufficient broadband connectivity.  Without detailed answers as to whether there will be negative consequences for the MANs programme or the roll-out of broadband generally, we cannot support taking &euro;10 million from that fund and putting it into the energy budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two papers here, one of which is the Minister&rsquo;s speech this morning that outlines the need for this token Supplementary Estimate and the other is a press release from 4 September.  The two are either entirely contradictory or are about different things.  In his press release the Minister states that he is ending phase one of the scheme because money for the greener homes scheme has run out.  The phase described in the press release describes a slimmed down version of the greener homes scheme, phase two.  The Minister said: &ldquo;I will provide additional funding for this new phase via the Supplementary Estimates process when the D&aacute;il resumes&rdquo;.  However, the Minister&rsquo;s speech today suggests there is no money for phase two and, as far as I can see, the difference between these statements is bare-faced flim-flam.</P>
        <P>I want to give the Minister a chance to reply on this, and I am delighted there will be questions at the end, because he is a new Minister.  He is also a politician of considerable experience, however, and it seems that this represents money that has been brought together to pay for debts already accrued.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I may be mistaken in how I have added up the numbers but it appears this money is not for a new scheme but for outstanding debts that must be paid.  The Minister said in his press release that there would be a Supplementary Estimate but this is merely a token Supplementary Estimate.  There is a considerable difference because a real Supplementary Estimate sees additional funding for a Department to fund, in this case, an important environmental measure.</P>
        <P>The greener homes scheme ran out of money simply because of the incompetence of the Government &mdash; the initial allocation was too small and now it is time to catch up.  Unfortunately, the Government now proposes to remove vital funds from essential infrastructural development in telecommunications to shore up Sustainable Energy Ireland to allow it to deliver on its current commitments.  The Government is very good at forcing other people to stay within budget.  The Minister for Health and Children puts the squeeze on the HSE to stay within budget, a staffing freeze results and, despite her promises, patients pay the price.  However, when <Col N="1525"/>the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, needs a fig leaf to cover his failure to tackle a funding shortfall he is allowed raid an essential infrastructure programme with impunity.</P>
        <P>The briefing note we received pointed out that it would be proposed that &euro;10 million be diverted from the technology and communications budget and &euro;6.2 million from the energy research budget.  Both of these areas are essential.  In terms of Ireland&rsquo;s capability to keep up, they are essential economically, socially and environmentally.  However, both budgets are being raided to get the Minister out of a hole.  It is not as if the Government is not aware of the problem, just as the previous Government was aware of it.</P>
        <P>The overall budget sought by SEI was &euro;42.95 million for 2007.  At the time it was on a very small budget, which had been increased, partly by removing funding from other areas of the energy budget.  Since SEI looked for this funding coming into 2007, an important event, a general election, took place and all during the summer negotiations took place between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  Any reasonable person would expect, therefore, that a simple obvious environmental issue such as the shortfall for the greener homes scheme would have been addressed during those negotiations, but it was not.</P>
        <P>When I wrote my notes for this debate, I did not realise this change impacted on so many schemes, not just the greener homes scheme.  All the schemes have seen a shortfall.  A party going into Government should have dealt with the issue, but it did not.  Either through naivety or blind ambition on the part of the Green Party, nothing was done.  That is the reason we are debating the issue now.</P>
        <P>The new Minister presided over the collapse of the scheme which was to have lasted five years and then promised in his press release to introduce a penny-pinching version of the scheme.  He did not, of course, mention the fact he intended to raid the communications area to do this.  More importantly, he did not indicate that he was raiding the communications sector, not for the new scheme, but to pay for the old one.</P>
        <P>The Minister can advise me if I am wrong, but it is clear there is no money for ring-fencing of the new scheme.  This Supplementary Estimate is not for new projects, but to pay for projects to which we are already committed.  If I am wrong, will the Minister tell me how many of the 8,000 applicants who have not yet been given their money under the old scheme will get it under the new scheme.  In addition, how many people will get funding from this Supplementary Estimate under the new scheme?</P>
        <P>Yesterday I attended an IBEC conference on next generation networks addressed by the Minister.  It is hypocrisy on the part of the Minister to address that conference and call for significant investment for next generation broadband, and come into the House today and deplete the fund<Col N="1526"/>ing already allocated for telecommunications technology.  He seems to have developed a see no evil approach on the issue of this generation broadband roll-out, as apart from any future generation broadband.  He gives out the statistics, but there are still major shortcomings in terms of access and take-up of broadband.</P>
        <P>I got a message from an Eircom customer the other day who said it is an utter disgrace in this wonderful little country of ours, with its so-called booming economy, that every household in the country cannot receive broadband.  The customer had been speaking to Eircom, but was disappointed with the response.  One would expect that the company that provides the services would be able to come up with a better answer than, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it doesn&rsquo;t work&rdquo;.  This anecdote demonstrates there is still considerable frustration on the part of customers and we still have major blackspots.  The fact the Minister intends removing funding from that area of his responsibility raises questions about his overall approach to the management of his Department.  Despite the fact there has been some catch up, we are not performing well on broadband.  There is no room for complacency and definitely no room for money to be withdrawn.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The message at the conference yesterday was very clear.  We need sustained public and private investment and certainty on the issue.  People involved in the industry who are coping with technological and sometimes bewildering change want certainty on broadband.  It is not just about industry but also about education, health care and community development.  All of these areas are dependent on broadband and other forms of advancing communications technology.  We want certainty, but instead we are getting a change, with &euro;10 million to be removed from a particular budget overnight.  This money is not going for a new scheme, but to pay bills that have been run up in what seems a profligate manner, despite the fact it appears to be going to good causes.</P>
        <P>I have concerns about cutting back the energy research budget.  It may be painful for the Minister to hear this, but when speaking as a Member of the Opposition on the Estimates last year he expressed concern at the small scale of the budget allocation.  If we do not have energy research, we will not be able to meet the very ambitious commitments we have made both internationally and in the Government programme.  We need ongoing research in terms of renewables and energy.  We do not need this type of incompetence and I am extremely concerned about it.  We must ensure that bills are paid, but this is not the way to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the Supplementary Estimate.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Coveney, that the Minister is going the wrong way about trying to provide additional capital expenditure of &euro;16.2 million for Sustainable <Col N="1527"/>Energy Ireland.  What he proposes sets a dangerous precedent and is not a road we should take.</P>
        <P>I take particular issue with the reduction of &euro;10 million from the information and communications programme.  This will badly affect the roll-out of broadband throughout the country.  The &euro;6.2 million relating to the energy programme concerns an energy research programme and, therefore, it is in order for that funding to be passed to Sustainable Energy Ireland.  However, the transfer of &euro;10 million from the roll-out of broadband is a serious concern.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s introduction of the new greener homes scheme, the warmer homes scheme and the house of tomorrow programme, which are a great success.  The greener homes scheme provides assistance to homeowners who intend to purchase a new renewable energy heating system for either a new or existing home.  Throughout the years we have been too reliant on fossil fuels, which are a limited resource and cause emissions harmful to the environment.  These new schemes are the way forward.  I welcome the grant support available to homeowners to make their homes greener and will advertise this support to my constituents in Dublin North-East.</P>
        <P>On the issue of broadband, the Government has neglected rural Ireland by underfunding the broadband programme.  The Minister&rsquo;s programme in this regard is not properly thought out and will not solve the urban and rural digital divide.  Earlier this year the Government scrapped the rural broadband scheme.  The abandonment of the scheme shows the Minister&rsquo;s utter contempt for people living in rural Ireland.  The group broadband scheme, not unlike the group water scheme, meant towns were offered up to 50% of the cost of rolling out broadband capacity in their area.  Towns only qualified for broadband funding under this scheme if they identified 30 people interested in getting broadband in their homes and managed to find a service provider.  Otherwise, the Government would not provide the funding to help them get connected to a broadband network.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The failure of that scheme lies squarely at the feet of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor and the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Administration.  We must learn from that failure and ensure that rural areas are connected to broadband.  We saw from the previous scheme that only 7,200 subscribers signed up out of the potential 400,000.   We must re-examine the lessons to be learned from that scheme and ensure the Government drives demand by supplying a broadband infrastructure at an affordable cost, thus encouraging customers to sign up for that scheme.</P>
      
        <P>How does this Government expect people to decentralise from the city, particularly if they will not have access to the Internet when they move from the city?  The Government has wasted more <Col N="1528"/>than three years and more than &euro;5 million on this group broadband scheme.  A new scheme has been introduced and I hope lessons can be learned from that.</P>
        <P>The Minister has overall responsibility for ensuring we have a full national roll-out of adequate broadband infrastructure.  If the Government begins to show the same commitment and determination to the provision of broadband as one of his predecessors showed towards electronic voting, the country will have a state of the art broadband service serving both the domestic and commercial sectors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister go back to his Department and look to raise the additional &euro;10 million needed for Sustainable Energy Ireland through another channel?  Taking this money from the information and communications technology programme sets a bad precedent.  I ask the Minister to take the issue of broadband services in rural areas seriously and roll out broadband throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I want to be associated with the comments of Deputy Coveney in underlining our full support for the greener homes scheme, which we support.  I do not want this debate to be twisted to suggest we are not committed to that scheme.  We are disappointed by the Minister&rsquo;s emerging plans to slim down that scheme if not now, next year.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that the Minister is alone in the Chamber without any Cabinet Ministers or Deputies on the benches behind him.  In many ways that shows the interest of his Government colleagues in the importance of energy conservation.  If the Minister does not know it, I also point out that Fingal County Council was one of the first councils to introduce extensive and stringent building control measures to improve energy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I understand that Ministers will have to adjust their budgets.  The world does not work in 12 month accountancy periods and from time to time Ministers will have to make budgetary adjustments, which I accept.  However, I cannot accept plans to remove &euro;10 million from the provision for broadband.  It seems the Minister is not so much the Minister for energy and communications as the Heineken Minister, the Minister for green energy who, perhaps, is not that interested in communications.</P><Col N="1529"/>
        <P>The MANs were mentioned earlier.  The MANs are a disgrace.  I do not know how much the Minister has spent on the MANs.  I have been given different figures &mdash; &euro;65 million, &euro;90 million &mdash; but as far as I can understand approximately &euro;90 million has been spent on 65 towns with only two, three or four customers.  The amount of money that has been wasted on the MANs is a disgrace on the level of PPARS.</P>
        <P>We need proper leadership on broadband from the Government.  The MANs scheme is not working and because of that we are falling behind.  We are far behind other countries in terms of broadband services.  We even falsify our statistics by including mobile broadband with fixed broadband, which we should not do.  In fixed broadband, which is what matters, we are behind Slovakia and Hungary and because of that we are losing competitiveness and foreign direct investment and we will be behind the pack yet again when it comes to next generation networks.  The Minister does not appear to care about that or understand it.  The fact that he is prepared to take &euro;10 million off the budget concerns me and people in business and enterprise.  I am concerned that the Minister is contributing directly to our falling competitiveness and our fall-off in foreign direct investment.</P>
        <P>This is also another example of bad Government planning, financial unaccountability, overspending and, once again, the making of financial commitments by Government agencies which they then cannot fulfil.  We have to draw a line at some point and no longer tolerate agencies overspending or entertain Ministers who come in here looking for more money because they have not planned their budgets.</P>
        <P>I refer particularly to Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s comments about the Health Service Executive.  The Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, says the HSE must stay within its budget yet on the other wing of the Government a Minister is saying that agencies can overspend their budgets and that money can be taken off the provision for infrastructure.  In addition, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, says the one area he will not cut is infrastructure.  Three wings of the Government appear to be flying in different directions and as a result the people are being let down, the taxpayer is being ripped off and the country will lose out as a result.</P>
        <P>There is hypocrisy and a lack of direction from the Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to infrastructure.  The Green Party Ministers want to cut infrastructure to bail out overspending agencies and the Progressive Democrats want to make agencies stay within their budgets.  That is not a Government.  It is some sort of camel ragtag coalition that does not deserve to sit on the opposite side of the House.  The Minister is undermining broadband and infrastructure, which will cost us in the long term.  This is another example of Government overspending and mismanagement.</P><Col N="1530"/>
        <P>Given what I have heard today and from other speakers, it may be necessary for Fine Gael to take a stand on this issue.  We will not let the Minister paint us as being opposed to greener home schemes because we are not.  The Minister is the one who mismanaged the scheme, the one who had it slimmed down.  We are standing up for consistency in Government, proper planning and investment in infrastructure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this issue.  I congratulate the Minister opposite as this is the first occasion on which I have the opportunity to do so in an official capacity.  Long before the last general election I predicted that he would be in that position among the happy hunting ground of Fianna F&aacute;il.  He did not agree with me at the time but it has happened.</P>
        <P>I have every sympathy for the Minister who now finds himself in the position were he is the bearer of bad news.  The election came and went.  There was much hype beforehand about the economy being in safe hands, with plenty of money to spend on capital and current issues but now we come to the time for surgical intervention and the scalpel has come out, although not in the same manner it did after the 2002 general election.  It started off with a scalpel but a larger instrument is being used &mdash; the hatchet.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable the Minister has found it necessary to slash the budget for the greener homes scheme.  Almost all headings have been cut by between 40% and 50%, which is a cruel blow at a time when much time, energy, focus and interest was put on the reason to conserve energy, reduce dependency on fossil fuels and all that goes with it.  It is counter to what has been heretofore Fianna F&aacute;il Government policy, which was that it was totally committed to fuel efficiencies and reducing the dependence on imported fossil fuels.</P>
        <P>Long before Departments became immersed in this theory we were all involved in promoting the notion of heat conservation and efficiency in modern buildings and put it into effect at local level.  That is in contrast with the Government which has allowed a situation where foundations have been poured in the past 12 months for houses that will require future grant aid to comply with the regulations.  The problem that now unfolds, unfortunately, is one for the Minister.  Obviously, his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues in Government made him an offer he could not refuse and he was told to cut or else.  That is what he did and I am sorry he did that.</P>
        <P>The previous speakers raised the issue of broadband.  I would have hoped that area would have required a different attitude, a new appraisal and a departure from what had been tried previously and failed.  The Minister is probably saying that is what he is about to do but that is not the case because whether we like it or not, broadband availability here is appalling.  This is the <Col N="1531"/>result of one mistake after another in the Department.  I cannot understand how anyone can see merit in the reduction of funding in that area when this country is crying out for advances in this field.  We reached the bottom of the scale a long time ago and have failed miserably since to compete in Europe, where our business sector is suffering from a lack of competitiveness in the area because the responsible Department did not take the necessary measures on time.  At a time when the world economy is based on technology, when the e-world is central to business, it is appalling that we, who were at the leading edge 15 years ago in this area, are now floundering with the other back-markers.  It is a sad end to what once looked like a glorious future.</P>
        <P>The Acting Chairman is asking me to wind up.  I do not know if he is referring to fishing or to the winding up of the telecommunications industry in this country.  Far from a Revised Estimate, we are talking about a cut that the unfortunate Minister has been forced to carry out by his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues in government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>In the Minister&rsquo;s speech, one of the programmes mentioned includes advice to businesses, including energy audits of commercial premises.  These advice services help businesses save approximately 20% of their energy costs and are a significant contributor to our efforts to reduce energy demand in the economy.  I fully support such practices and Sustainable Energy Ireland should engage in more of such activity because there is a dual benefit: we save energy while becoming more efficient.  I asked a question yesterday on the tourism industry and how such advice can be expanded to assist hotels to save energy.  The reply stated that 50 Irish hotels are engaged in this practice.  If I was running a business and someone told me that if I follow a certain practice, I will save 20% of my energy costs, I would be happy to pay a fee for such advice.  In this Estimate however, the Minister seeks a further &euro;500,000 from now to the end of the year to fund a service that is helping business while helping energy conservation.  We seem to have gone mad in granting aid to people to help them to save money in their businesses.  By all means give them the service but sometimes we should ask people to contribute for this service.</P>
        <P>Likewise, we are going to provide another &euro;5 million to encourage developers to produce model houses to save energy.  The last people who need assistance are developers.  We have gone mad.  To do things that will help us all, particularly the person buying the house, we are paying grants to developers to develop a model of a house that will save the purchaser money.  The last people who need grant assistance from the State are developers.  These people have made an absolute fortune at the expense of first-time house buyers in particular.  We are on a merry-go-round, with a valuable organisation like Sus<Col N="1532"/>tainable Energy Ireland engaging in every grant we can think of instead of building an advice system to help people save money in their businesses, make Ireland more competitive and reduce emissions.</P>
        <P>I support the other speakers on what has been said about taking money from the introduction of a national broadband scheme.  It is a scandal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there an audit of the value for money of the metropolitan area network scheme under way at present which will present its results before the end of the year?  Is it appropriate in the absence of the results of that audit to cut funding by &euro;10 million?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister rowing back on phase two of the metropolitan area network scheme, where 90 towns have been promised metropolitan area networks?  How does that fit into the new broadband strategy that the Minister will unveil in 2008?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister give detailed figures to break down the &euro;10 million coming from the communications and information technology budget?  Does it all come from metropolitan area networks or is it money left over from group broadband schemes that have been abandoned?  We have a detailed breakdown of the money coming from the energy RTDI programmes but no breakdown of the &euro;10 million.  Is it a global figure for unspent money?  Why is it unspent considering our position in terms of broadband roll out?</P>
        <P>The budget allocation at the start of the year for the energy RTDI programme was &euro;7.1 million.  Now we are transferring &euro;6.2 million from that budget, leaving little or nothing for research and development in the energy area under the Minister&rsquo;s portfolio.  Is that correct?  If so, where is the Department getting its money for research and development in renewable energy for 2007?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not a row-back in any sense and there is no change in Government policy on metropolitan area networks.  We will continue to evolve and look at what we are doing in broadband because, as the Deputy should be aware, this area is changing rapidly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The first question was about the audit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will await the audit and then we will act on it.  This does not relate to the value for money audit.  We must continually audit what is happening with the metropolitan area networks and broadband because the volume of transactions on the networks is doubling every year.  The technologies that are coming in are changing completely.  There is an utterly different environment in broadband competitiveness than was the case a year ago.  We do not manage based on the budget a year ago, we look at what is evolving.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1533"/>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not appropriate to make expenditure decisions based on the audit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes but there is an ongoing audit.  We do not just wait for someone to audit the system, we keep in touch with what is happening and where the budget is going and we manage it.</P>
        <P>I made a political decision that in circumstances where there are difficulties, it makes sense to manage them internally at a time when other Departments might have their own difficulties.  I said I would not ask the Department of Finance to sort this out, that I would manage it internally.  That was easier because of two developments.</P>
        <P>First, in answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question as to the exact money involved, &euro;10 million was allocated for the national broadband scheme but it was not due to be spent this year because it has taken slightly longer than we thought to set it up.  There was also a knock-on effect on MANs and the budget was not exactly as it had been.  There was an increase in expenditure so we had to review that.  However, this was in no way a change of broadband policy.  It was an example of using our budget wisely because those programmes are multi-annual, where spending does not necessarily occur in one year and long-term investment decisions are involved.  The MANs is a long-term investment because, in the long run, fibre is the way this country will go.  There will not be an immediate effect but I was faced with an immediate issue relating to payments for schools to install a boiler system or to lower income housing schemes that could benefit from proper grant insulation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What about schools getting broadband?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We will continue to cover the house of tomorrow schemes and, at the same time, continue the national broadband scheme because the majority of the expenditure will occur in 2008 rather than 2007 and that allows us to prudently manage our affairs to meet budget lines.  </P>
        <P>Deputy Coveney asked why the situation was changing.  It is because we are dealing with the Irish public.  These were demand-led schemes for which we could not predict the exact amount.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is it like the drug budgeting scheme, which is also demand led?  The Minister for Health and Children has taken a totally different approach to the budget for that scheme, meaning there will be no Supplementary Estimate in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a crucial area of public policy.  Although Deputy Barrett does not believe in the schemes, I am not going to say Fine <Col N="1534"/>Gael, as a whole, does not.  Fine Gael dealt with the issue well enough but Deputy Barrett seems to doubt the benefits of the house of tomorrow scheme and others.  These schemes are beneficial because they turn our economy to a new energy future.  One of the reasons demand increased is that energy prices increased.  In spring this year, there was a significant increase in demand under the greener homes scheme and a higher percentage of applications were turned into grant commitments than previously. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the issue.  We have only seven minutes left.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am answering the Deputy&rsquo;s key question, which was on why I could not have predicted this a year ago.  One cannot predict demand exactly. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister predicted it.  His own Department predicted it and the Minister should not twist the truth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the reasons demand for other schemes increased is that the house of tomorrow schemes, a significant commitment, were multi-annual programmes but one is often dealing with builders.  The scheme does support the building industry and that may be something for which one could criticise it but construction accounts for one quarter of our economy.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Developers do not need grants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>They need laws, not grants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>To make the necessary reductions in energy use, we need the construction industry to change dramatically.  That is why we went into Government and fundamentally changed the building regulations.  It will not be easy to bring about change as it requires every single builder in this country to change the way they build.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is the research coming from?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It requires examples of best practice and that was achieved under the house of tomorrow scheme.  Fine Gael may not agree with that scheme and may disagree with turning the building industry towards a clean energy future but that is what we are doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have given the Minister the Fine Gael position.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1535"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Barrett disagrees.  Fine Gael should get its party line straight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I said regulation was required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy S&eacute;an Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is only a small amount of time.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said he had made choices but that is not the case.  The Minister had no choice but to pay the bills.  People had sent in bills and the Minister had to pay them.  It is not a matter of choice.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has egg on his face.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I have the highest regard for all Departments of the Civil Service, and I imagine the Minister&rsquo;s Department excels, but how did its financial management fail to keep pace with demand?  We cannot have demand-led schemes in all areas, whose need we have to meet whatever the circumstances, and that is what financial management and forecasting is all about.  Can the Minister explain how this went so badly wrong?</P>
        <P>I am sorry to keep going but the Minister will answer at length and I have only one bite at the issue.  Where is the funding the Minister promised for phase 2 of the greener homes scheme?  I have added up the figures and cannot find the answer.  A tiny portion remains unaccounted for but I assume that is not the amount to which the Minister refers because it would make no sense at all.  He said the money in the greener homes scheme was to pay people who have already installed.  That is not phase 1 but phase 2.</P>
        <P>One can gloss over these issues or one can explore them.  Money was allocated for the broadband programme to the tune of &euro;10 million, which is big bucks.  It was allocated for 2007 because broadband was an essential infrastructural requirement for modern Ireland.  Why did it not go ahead?  What went wrong so that this money can now be siphoned off to pay the bills run up by Sustainable Energy Ireland?  I imagine the Comptroller and Auditor General will also have an interest in this but I would like to know.</P>
        <P>The question I asked of the Minister is a political question, because it has nothing to do with managing the Department.  Why was this issue not dealt with during the negotiations for Government?  This is the bedrock of Green Party thinking and during those discussions it had all the resources of Departments, in particular the Department of Finance, to call on.  Any Opposition politician tracking this would have known a problem was emerging so why was it not dealt with in those negotiations so that we would not <Col N="1536"/>be where we are today, stealing from one area of the Department to put into another as an exercise in crisis management?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are various choices and Deputy McManus will have been faced with similar choices.  She could have stopped the scheme.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The bills have already been run up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Not in every case.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>An amount of &euro;1 million has been spent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many cases, such as the lower income housing scheme and the reheat scheme, which goes towards school and other community projects, where there was a choice as to whether to continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been many cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>For clarification, is the Minister saying that, in every area other than the one on which the sum of &euro;1 million was spent, he did not have a choice?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>No &mdash; there was a choice.  We could have kept the schemes going as they were and that, I understand, has been the Labour Party position up to this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Minister talking about?  He cannot even manage the scheme for which he has responsibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of my aims was to provide continuity.  One should not stop-start an industry by building up a supply chain and suddenly, overnight, drop it off a cliff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>So does the Minister oppose the cuts?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I chose to continue, having spent the first &euro;47 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister spent &euro;47 million?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not ask that question.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am answering the Deputy&rsquo;s question as to what choice there was.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I want Deputy Durkan and Deputy Varadkar to have an opportunity to ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I said there was no choice.  I asked why the financial management <Col N="1537"/>was so poor that the Minister ended up with no choice. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I had plenty of choice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>We have very little time so I ask the Minister to respond to the question that was originally asked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The choice was taken to manage the funding so that we could continue the greener home scheme, albeit, in certain cases, at a reduced level, which I believed was correct in view of the fact that technology had developed to a level where it could stand up on its own.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>How much funding is there for phase 2?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I want Deputies and Varadkar and Durkan to ask very short questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked an essential question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>We have two minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked a very essential question and I need an answer.  How much of the money in these Estimates is going to phase 2 of the greener homes scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>One cannot spend the money for these schemes on the day an application comes in.  There is an ongoing commitment and certain applications will come through next year relating to phase 1 while certain others will relate to phase 2.  One cannot separate the two &mdash; we are not buying sweets but major building projects and they take time.  It is a multi-annual programme which requires continuity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two simple questions which will take me 30 seconds.  I will get the <Col N="1538"/>answer in two words if the Minister obliges me.  First, in the briefing note from the Minister&rsquo;s Department, it states very clearly that, despite this increase, it was clear to the Department from the start of the year that SEI was going to be challenged on capital funding in 2007.  Does the Minister stand over that statement?</P>
        <P>My second question relates to MANs.  Does the Minister intend to effectively sell them to a post-Eircom entity and agree to higher technology prices as a result?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said he decided to carry out these minor economies from within his own Department.  Was that in response to a memo from the Department of Finance?  Did he contact that Department to indicate that he proposed to make certain reductions in his own budget?  Did he wait to hear the laughter coming from inside that Department at the suggestion from his own?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>SEI has done a fantastic job in managing the whole range of heating schemes.  There were and will continue to be demands on it, but we are learning.  It is providing a first class service for the public, which I decided to support by continuing the grant schemes established here.  We will continue to amend, extend and change as we see fit.  It is my job to manage the budget on the public&rsquo;s behalf in order to achieve reductions.  We will attempt to achieve social justice in any further schemes we might develop.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Who initiated the cuts?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We will also seek to reduce carbon emissions, which is the challenge facing us.  I am confident and happy that we have managed the matter particularly well and we will continue to manage it in a way that will deliver for SEI and the people. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 75 together.</P>
        <P>There are close to 130,000 people employed in the delivery of our public health and personal social services, the vast majority of whom provide direct service to patients and clients.  The current pause in recruitment must be viewed in this context.  It is a temporary measure put in place by the HSE to live within its budget.  It will be <Col N="1541"/>reviewed at the end of October and it is being monitored by the HSE on a week by week basis.</P>
        <P>The HSE must be able to manage within the resources made available to it by the Government and voted by the D&aacute;il.  It should not come as a surprise to anyone that managing the budget in the health sector means managing staff.  Staff costs make up almost 70% of the HSE&rsquo;s overall budget.  It is unreasonable to suggest that in a service of this scale and with an employee cohort of this size, every vacancy which arises must be filled immediately and, if not, dire consequences will result.  Living within budget and making the best use of the available resources is an essential task of any sound organisation.  Reforming our health system is not just about extra funding and extra posts, it is about ensuring that the extra money which has already been invested by the Government on behalf of the Irish people is being used wisely and efficiently.</P>
        <P>The gradeeight title was first introduced in 2000 as a result of an industrial relations agreement.  Staff would previously have held other titles such as hospital managers, disability service managers, accountants, industrial relations officers and IT personnel.  This explains why the numbers of posts categorised as grade eight was very low in 2000.  However, I share the concerns about the growth in posts at grade eightfrom 521 to 713 between late 2005 to June 2007.  As part of a new employment control framework introduced in December 2006, the HSE is now required to get my Department&rsquo;s approval for the filling of posts at grade eight or above.  Despite the controls that are in place now, the numbers are running ahead of expectations.  I am awaiting a report from the HSE on this.</P>
        <P>Many of the actions taken by the HSE to control its rate of spending in the last three months of this year have demonstrably no effect on frontline services.  Some of the claims made about alleged effects on services are without justification.  For example, the cancellation of foreign travel and the release of temporary summer holiday cover staff cannot mean a reduction of services.  Claims of this nature should be assessed in the context of the HSE&rsquo;s overall activity levels.  For each of the last three months of this year, there will be more than 100,000 patients treated as inpatients or on a day case basis in publicly-funded acute hospitals.  That will continue to be the case.</P>
        <P>However, the HSE recognises the importance of staying within annual budgets and staffing levels, as well as managing activity throughout the year so that planned annual service increases are achieved in an orderly manner over the whole year.  It is ultimately no service to patients if hospitals or any other cost centres overrun budgets and staffing levels in the early part of the year, causing a slowdown of activity in their own service or in any other service later on.  Any postponement of an operation or service arising is naturally very disappointing to individual patients and clients.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1542"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened to the Minister&rsquo;s response and it is nothing more than what we have heard before.  The reality for people comes from the effects of the cutbacks which the Minister promised on &ldquo;Newstalk&rdquo; would not happen.  When these cutbacks were exposed, she denied they would have any effect on patient care.  Both these claims have been found to be false.  People in Ennis have had their facilities cancelled so that they can be referred to a centre in Galway, but because of the cutbacks cancer services there have been reduced from five to three days.  The Minister cannot tell us that those people will not suffer.  Hours are being reduced in Beaumont Hospital, and in St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital beds have been occupied due to the detection of Legionnaire&rsquo;s disease in a nursing home, the consequence being that beds for elective surgery are occupied and surgery lists are being slashed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy got a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is about the home care packages for the elderly that have been taken away, about the stroke care in Merlin Park Regional Hospital that has been taken away and about the removal of 22 beds that were to be transferred to a community facility to free up beds in the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  Why will the Minister not take control or responsibility?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE will not answer Deputies.  When we ask questions we get facetious responses.  I asked a question on ambulance services and trolleys and I was given an answer which made absolutely no sense.  There is no transparency in the HSE and not even the Comptroller and Auditor General can get a response.  Where is the evidence of the increased productivity of this large number of bureaucrats in the HSE?  When will the Minister take responsibility for this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are quite a few questions to be answered.  When I was commenting on the freeze on recruitment at the conference of the Irish Nurses Organisation, it was in the context of an increase of 2,500 in the numbers employed by the HSE during the course of 2007.  There has not been a reduction in staff, but an increase.  One of the challenges facing us is to make sure that staff numbers are in line with approvals from my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>I also spoke specifically about some hospitals.  Where 40 nurses are taken on to cover holiday relief, when the holiday period is over there is no need to keep those nurses.  Why is it that in Sligo General Hospital there are 1.8 nurses per bed but only 1.3 nurses per bed in Waterford Regional Hospital?  We need to look at some of these wider issues.</P><Col N="1543"/>
        <P>In our health system, about 16% of the staff are in administrative roles, a figure which is at 18% in the NHS.  The HSE is currently carrying out an audit of management and administration, which I support.  I am not saying we have the right balance.  There is scope for a voluntary redundancy programme and I hope that can be discussed in the new health forum that will be established.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the cancellation of operations in the orthopaedic department at the hospital in Navan?  Up to 180 patients are being operated on per month in that hospital, but the Department has stated that a mere six operations have been cancelled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister must clarify that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is Priority Question time and it is restricted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a priority issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to the nominated spokespersons of each party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed that six patients were given appointments for the month of December.  I have also been informed that there has never been a month at that hospital when 200 procedures were carried out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I said 180 operations were being carried out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>They carried out 1,600 in the first nine months of the year so the Deputy should divide that.  It would be remarkable if the hospital carried out more operations in December than in any other month.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the hospital not shut for January and February?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is misleading the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Minister to answer the question.  The nominated spokesperson of the Fine Gael Party is the only Deputy allowed to speak during Priority Questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I want clarity, not untruths.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>When we get to other questions, every Deputy can pose a question.  These are the rules that you have laid down.  I would now like to call Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, who has also tabled a Priority Question.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1544"/>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>That is unfair.  Will the Minister please clarify whether she believes the information about the six patients?  This is very serious.  Is it true or not true?  Is this House not about truth?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have some respect for the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have respect for the Chair, but there should be respect for the truth as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy have some respect for the Chair?  When the Chair is speaking&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem with respect.  You and I both know it will not come up in later questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan to ask her question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister set up the HSE nearly three years ago to centralise the system so that bureaucracy could be reduced and more funding could be released for direct patient care.  What monitoring does the Minister carry out on the HSE?  The growth in senior management numbers is extraordinary, in spite of her explanation today.  What hands-on relationship does she have with the HSE to ensure that we do not spend scarce health money on bureaucrats when it should be spent on patients?  If she can give me a clear answer we might have some understanding of what is going on.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister think it makes sense that patients who are ready to go home are occupying specialised beds in the National Rehabilitation Hospital?  Patients who need to come in, such as a man who received serious head injuries in a farm accident, cannot do so because other people who are ready to go home are occupying beds.  Can the Minister comment on this crazy use of funding for specialised health services?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I received a copy of a letter sent to the Minister by 93 general practitioners in Sligo.  With regard to the HSE embargo, they say, &ldquo;To state that these moves will have no effect on patient care is dishonest and wrong and is insulting to the professionals involved&rdquo;.  Are these 93 doctors wrong when they say that patients are directly impacted upon by these cuts?  Will the Minister use her power to ensure that the HSE does not continue with this embargo, which is hurting patients?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, much analysis of our health system was done in the run-in to the reform programme.  The Prospectus, Brennan and other reports all made the central recommendation that the fragmentation of services was not delivering efficient health care.  That is a view I strongly share.  We would never have established 11 boards to administer <Col N="1545"/>health care in a population of 4.3 million.  We could not have introduced the cancer control programme if we had that kind of fragmentation.  </P>
        <P>The role of the HSE is clear.  It is responsible, with the chief executive officer as Accounting Officer, for the delivery of services.  The Minister remains responsible for policy and has overall responsibility for health.  I take an appropriate role.  I am not involved in operational issues.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely there are policy issues in how money is spent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I meet with the CEO and chairman of the HSE at least once, and sometimes twice, a month.  There is also a Cabinet sub-committee.  The CEO does not report to me but to the board of the HSE.  The chairman reports to me.</P>
        <P>The HSE is required to get prior approval from my Department and the Department of Finance before an employee is given grade eight status.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Must the Minister approve these posts?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, we must approve them.  That has been the procedure since December 2006.  Notwithstanding the need for that approval, the numbers seem to be ahead of expectation.  I have asked for an explanation of that from the HSE.</P>
        <P>We must be fair to those hospitals which are currently living within their budget.  Hospitals such as the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, notwithstanding the huge increase in births, the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick and Waterford Regional Hospital can live within their allocated budget.  We expect other hospitals to do so.  The ratio of nurses to patients in Sligo is 1.8 per bed while in Waterford it is 1.3 per bed.  Perhaps the general practitioners should look at some of these issues.</P>
        <P>Spending on health has increased by 370% in the past decade, which is seven times the rate of inflation.  The British Government is talking about a targeted increase in health spending of 4% above inflation.  Unless we live within budgets, the health system has the capacity to be unsustainable and to damage the economy.  We must all recognise that point.  This should not be incompatible with providing services.</P>
        <P>If patients are fit to leave the rehabilitation hospital and others need to go in there, it does not make sense for that not to happen.  The HSE has confirmed that homecare packages will be made available so that patients can return home from the National Rehabilitation Hospital and others can be admitted there.</P>

        <askee>Minister for <Col N="1546"/>Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>  the steps she has taken to ensure the continuation of services in the dispensing of methadone to people participating in drug treatment and rehabilitation programmes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed that a significant number of pharmacists have chosen to discontinue providing methadone services to patients.  This is the second time in recent years that pharmacists have targeted the methadone scheme in response to unrelated issues.  It is unfortunate that community pharmacists have once again chosen to target some of our most vulnerable patients &mdash; recovering drug users who are stable enough to be treated in the community setting &mdash; in this way.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Competition Authority is examining whether the action of pharmacists in withdrawing from dispensing methadone to patients may be in breach of competition law.  Currently, the pharmacists&rsquo; action is mainly in the Dublin area with threatened escalation countrywide later.  As of Monday, 15 October, some 140 pharmacists in the Dublin area have withdrawn from the methadone protocol scheme.  This action affects approximately 3,000 patients.</P>
        <P>There is a significant clinical risk of overdose to patients who revert from a methadone maintenance programme to opiate use.  In these circumstances, the HSE has developed a contingency plan to ensure continuity of service and to minimise any hardship to patients.  Since last Monday, the HSE has been implementing that plan.  The HSE has made alternative arrangements for the emergency dispensing of methadone to the patients involved in 13 centres.  The HSE&rsquo;s drug helpline is available on a seven day a week basis to provide information to clients in relation to the contingency arrangements.  The HSE has indicated that to date the contingency plan is operating satisfactorily.  The situation in the rest of the country is being monitored closely and arrangements are ready to be implemented in the event of an escalation of the action nationwide.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the work the HSE is doing to ensure continuity of care to patients in these very challenging circumstances.  I also appeal to the pharmacists who have withdrawn their service to reconsider their action in the light of their professional and ethical obligations.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Many people are seriously disadvantaged because of this dispute.  I do not condone the action of pharmacists in putting patients at risk although, like many Members, I recognise their frustration with the HSE.  The HSE has had ample opportunity to put its contingency plan in place and it is very poorly thought out.  There was no consultation with communities and the only information I have has been gleaned locally.</P>
        <P>Only one dispensing centre has been provided for all of Dublin North.  It is on the most northerly peninsula in the area and is very inaccessible.  Patients who have been off heroin for some time, are holding down jobs, have families and are making their contribution to society are being put at risk.  They are being corralled into small areas in Dublin North and other parts of the city and drug dealers are circling them like sharks.  People who have kicked the heroin habit need help and support.  I ask that the Irish Pharmaceutical Union withdraw its action, that the Minister instruct the HSE to defer its action and that an independent impact assessment take place to allow the dispute to be resolved.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister think it is wise for officials of the Competition Authority to be visiting community pharmacies in the company of garda&iacute;?  Does she agree that this action is likely to inflame the situation rather than help it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s statement that he does not condone the action of the pharmacists.  Most people would support that view.</P>
        <P>Methadone users are a very vulnerable group of patients and the HSE has had to put a contingency service in place very quickly.  The feedback I have received from a number of people has been positive.  The service is not as good as that provided by pharmacies, which are much more accessible, but the HSE has done its best, in the circumstances, to provide a facility.  I am not familiar with the details of all 13 centres but I will draw the attention of the HSE to the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns, particularly with regard to Dublin North.</P>
        <P>The Government does not have responsibility for the Competition Authority.  We are governed by European as well as Irish competition law.  This morning, I heard a reference to changing the Irish Competition Act.  When the HSE was negotiating a wholesale margin, the wholesalers produced legal advice that negotiation with the HSE contravened competition law.  It was the wholesalers who first brought our attention to the fact <Col N="1548"/>that negotiating with a group such as pharmacists &mdash; this will subsequently apply to dentists and other professions &mdash; is in breach of Irish and European competition law and amounts to cartel behaviour.  It is equally the case that people cannot act as a group to prevent a service in a market.  These are matters for the Competition Authority, not the HSE or me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Attorney General given his opinion on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We have received an opinion from counsel on behalf of the Attorney General on this matter.  The HSE has its own opinion, as do the pharmacists.  At my behest, some months ago Mr. Bill Shipsey, senior counsel, was asked to act as facilitator, which is allowed.  I understand a meeting was held last week and that another took place yesterday.  I hope that through this process we can reach agreement on some of the issues involved.  The key factor is money.  As a result of the new arrangements in respect of the wholesale margin and the new deal with the producers of medicines, we will save approximately &euro;660 million over four years.  We pay the middle range price in the European Union for drugs.  However, the Irish consumer pays the highest amount in Europe for medicines.  This is not acceptable.  We must reduce the escalating cost of drugs in the health care system &mdash; the figure currently stands at &euro;1.5 billion &mdash; by getting better value for money and, in particular, paying pharmacists a professional fee to dispense rather than a fee based on a 50% margin which everybody will accept is not appropriate.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>  the resources that have been and will be allocated for the implementation of the national cancer control programme; the immediate resources available to ensure continuity of care for patients affected by the ending of symptomatic breast services and surgical treatment in 13 hospitals in different parts of the country; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[24089/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Implementation of the national cancer control programme is a major priority for me and the Government.  I fully support the appointment by the Health Service Executive, HSE, of Professor Tom Keane as interim national cancer control director.  The delivery of cancer services on a programmatic basis will serve to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient outcome, irrespective of geography.  </P>
        <P>The recent decisions of the HSE to designate four managed cancer control networks and eight <Col N="1549"/>cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  A detailed transitional plan will be put in place to facilitate the progressive, gradual and carefully managed transfer of services during the next two years or so.  The HSE plans to have completed 50% of the transition of services to cancer centres by end 2008 and 80% to 90% by end 2009.</P>
        <P>To comply with the national quality assurance standards for symptomatic breast disease, the HSE has directed 13 hospitals with low case volumes to cease breast cancer services immediately.  The 13 hospitals concerned performed a combined total number of 55 breast cancer procedures in 2005.  A number of the hospitals had in practice already discontinued symptomatic breast services.  The National Hospitals Office has planned the redirection of this symptomatic caseload.  Further staged reductions in the number of hospitals providing breast cancer services will occur in the next two years in line with the development of quality assured capacity in the eight designated centres.</P>
        <P>Professor Keane and the HSE have emphasised the importance of mobilising existing resources and redirecting them to achieve the national cancer control programme objectives.  An additional &euro;20.5 million was allocated to the HSE this year for cancer control, an increase of 74% on the comparable 2006 investment and includes &euro;3.5 million to support the initial implementation of the national cancer control programme.  Further investment in cancer control will be based on the reform programme now being implemented by the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I did not hear the Minister mention the resources that will be available in the future, although she did speak about those that will be available this year.  The brave fight by Susie Long, who sadly passed away at the weekend, has shown how essential it is that there are adequate resources available in the public health service for cancer treatment services.  I want a commitment from the Minister that there will be adequate public resources to address the development of this programme.  What she said and what was contained in the press release following Professor Tom Keane&rsquo;s appointment appears to relate to a redirection of existing resources.  We know that the incidence of cancer is growing at a rate of 4% to 5% per annum.  Clearly, this will result in increased demand.  I am concerned that the Minister is again setting up something that will be at a distance from herself as Minister for Health and Children and that as such, we will not be able to raise questions with her in respect of accountability to the public for the provision of adequate resources to address this most important issue which affects every family in the country.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1550"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of standards is one for the Minister.  Even with the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, standards have to be signed off on by the Minister.  I appointed Professor Higgins who, if not the leading Irish expert in this field, is certainly at the top of the class in this regard.  His recommendations on standards were endorsed by the Government earlier this year and have now been implemented.  </P>
        <P>Two issues arise.  A great deal more money will be invested in cancer treatment services because as the Deputy said, many more people will suffer from cancer.  One in three of us will suffer from some form of invasive cancer during our lifetime.  This will be a big challenge for the health service.  In addition, we will need to redirect resources.  The provision of additional resources is not always the answer.  Professor Keane did a good job in Canada and is the ideal person &mdash; he was educated in Ireland &mdash; to oversee implementation of the programme, which I welcome.</P>
        <P>In the context of next year&rsquo;s budget for the health service, the existing level will be announced by the Minister for Finance tomorrow.  Other initiatives will be announced on budget day.  In that context, cancer services have a high priority, both in terms of screening, as the Deputy acknowledged, and on the service delivery side.</P>
        <P>The death of Susie Long was a dreadful tragedy.  Her situation should never have happened.  She went to a public hospital, totally funded by the taxpayer, and was told if she had health insurance, she could have had her procedure the following week.  Because she did not have insurance the procedure was not carried out until six months later.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not understand how co-locating public and private hospitals on the same site with different doctors will change it.  However, I do not have time to deal with that issue today.</P>
        <P>On the list of hospitals which have been told they must cease immediately the provision of cancer treatment services, will extra resources be made available to the so-called centres of excellence in this respect?  For example, a general surgeon who performs a small number of cancer related operations cannot be transferred to a centre of excellence.  Will the Minister clarify that the required resources will be made available and that those patients currently being treated in the smaller hospitals will have access to services?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1551"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy referred to general surgeons.  In 2005 one procedure was carried out at the Midlands Regional Hospital, Tullamore; two were carried out at St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital, Loughlinstown; two were carried out at Mercy University Hospital, Cork; two were carried out at St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, and three were carried out at Mallow General Hospital.  The number of procedures carried out at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Ennis was seven.  Portiuncula Hospital had the highest number, having carried out 17 procedures.  No procedures were carried out at the hospitals located in Naas, Roscommon, Cavan and Navan.  Clearly, as the volume of activity increases, resources will follow as far as possible.  University College Hospital Galway has a staff of 2,674.  The number has increased rapidly in recent years as a result not only of the availability of cancer treatment services but also cardiovascular and other specialties.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Improving the delivery of accident and emergency services continues to be a top priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive.  Our objectives are to further reduce the numbers waiting for admis<Col N="1552"/>sion, the time spent waiting for admission and the turnaround time for those who do not require admission.  The Health Service Executive continues to report a significant reduction in the number of patients awaiting admission as compared with the same period 12 months ago.  During the first nine months of 2007 the average number of patients awaiting admission each day was 91.  This compares with an average of 165 patients during the first nine months of 2006, representing an average reduction of 45%.  The initial target waiting time of 24 hours from decision to admit is now being met by the majority of hospitals and the HSE has introduced a revised target of 12 hours since the beginning of this month.  The ultimate objective is a total wait time target of six hours from the time a patient presents at the emergency department to the time he or she is either admitted to an acute bed or is treated and discharged home. </P>
        <P>Following publication of the emergency department task force report on 1 June,  the HSE has commenced a formal process of engagement with the Irish Association of Emergency Care Medicine.  The association has agreed to work with the HSE on a range of issues, including the standardisation of patient processes and pathways within emergency departments.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that the HSE&rsquo;s method of measuring waiting times in accident and emergency departments does not bear scrutiny?  The waiting period should commence from the time the patient arrives in the accident and emergency department.  However, the clock does not start until a decision has been made to admit the patient.  That is not the truth, because the time starts when the SHO or the registrar from the medical team comes downstairs to confirm the admission.  The consultant in the accident and emergency department has already made the decision and the waiting period should be measured from that time.  As the Minister admitted, the 12 hour target is not being met and I would like to know when it will.  Furthermore, what is the timeframe for meeting the six hour target?  Where is the acute medical unit for Beaumont Hospital which was supposed to speed up patient waiting times?  The unit in Navan hospital started today.  How late is that?  The number of patients on trolleys in the accident and emergency department in Galway has increased  because of the cutbacks.  The Minister mentioned Ennis and Galway but the medical board is convinced that with the cutbacks, there will be fewer beds and more patients on trolleys in accident and emergency departments and as a consequence, longer waiting times.  Does the Minister accept the closure of the orthopaedic unit in Navan, with a resultant loss in procedures, will cause more people with complications from long-<Col N="1553"/>term medication use to attend at the accident and emergency department?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national plan was introduced  because there was a national emergency.  Is there still a national emergency?  There are 100 more patients on trolleys this month than there were this time last year.  How does the Minister intend to address the problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I think I said the aim was to have patients treated within six hours from arrival time.  The period should be measured from the time a patient arrives rather than the time he or she is eventually seen by a doctor.  An issue in the negotiations on the consultant contract is having more consultant cover to ensure patients will be seen by key decision-makers quicker than is the case currently.  We must accept there have been significant improvements, but in addition to improvements at hospital level, we are trying to refocus on primary care &mdash; I know the Deputy is an expert in this area &mdash;  and community care.  However, one cannot switch it around overnight.  Too many end up at accident and emergency departments who need not be there if we had appropriate out-of-hours cover and, in particular, if general practitioners had access to diagnostics.  Many end up going through accident and emergency departments unnecessarily in order to access diagnostics.  The HSE is working around a number of these issues.  The 24-hour target was set about 18 months ago.  The 12-hour target is now being set and we hope to have a six-hour target, but I cannot say when that will happen.</P>
        <P>When the figure hit 500, I said the HSE had to deal with the matter as if it were a national emergency and focus totally on it.  I am happy to say it has.  By and large, each day 95% to 96% of patients who present do not have to endure a long wait on trolleys, but there are still too many who do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The key decision-maker in the accident and emergency department is the consultant.  Therefore, waiting for a member of the  medical team to come down from upstairs just does not wash.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>When will there be a realistic availability of diagnostics to general practitioners?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with the Deputy that the key decision-maker in the accident and emergency department is the consultant, but there are only 52 such consultants.  It is no fault of the consultant that we cannot provide cover for longer and until we recruit more consultants on a new contract.  The HSE procured some diagnostic services for general practitioners in Dublin last year at the Charter Medical Centre and perhaps others.  I want to see this project area expand <Col N="1554"/>in order that there will be no necessity to refer through accident and emergency departments or to the acute system for a general practitioner to access appropriate diagnostics.  I hope we will see more progress on the issue next year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive has advised my Department that the CT service at Louth County Hospital, Dundalk commenced in June 2007 on a phased basis.  The service is being provided in co-operation with staff from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  A CT specialist attends Louth County Hospital one day per week.  Last year over 1,400 patients from Louth County Hospital received CT scans at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.</P>
        <P>The HSE intends to introduce a full service at an early date.  My Department is advised that, when fully operational, the service will be provided on a daily basis from Monday to Friday and will have the capacity to carry out up to 2,200 scans per annum.  This will require the redeployment of a clinical specialist from Drogheda to Dundalk and the filling of the resulting vacancy.  The necessary radiography staffing is in place.  An after-hours service will continue to be provided in Drogheda.</P>

However, this was a political PR stunt which misled the people of County Louth and, more particularly, the people of Dundalk about this service.  I find it unacceptable that the Minister states a full service will be available &ldquo;at an early date&rdquo;.  That is not good enough.

	<P>It certainly was.  With all due respect, this is another insult not only to the people of Dundalk and County Louth but also the north east.  Clearly, it was a stunt in advance of the general election in which the Minister participated.  Had she taken any time to establish if the HSE were going to ensure the human resources would be in place to operate this facility?  Is she aware that it took until July before the service even opened for one day per week and that it then ground to a halt completely?  Is she conscious that the Taoiseach committed on the floor of the Chamber that this facility would be up and running from March?  From March until September and the announcement of the recent embargo on recruitment by the HSE the equipment remained virtually inoperable for all but one day per week.  What is the HSE&rsquo;s excuse, and what vigilance did the Department exercise, in regard to the scandalous situation in which high tech equipment lay largely idle?  What excuse does the HSE have for not recruiting staff to operate it?  What excuse does the Minister offer?  She need not trundle out the notion of an embargo on recruitment.  There was no embargo in place over those months.</P>

There is no embargo on recruiting staff for this scanner and I hope the HSE proceeds to do it as quickly as possible.  I could not and will not stand over a situation where public money is spent on the purchase of, in this case, a CT scanner and it is not fully operational.  It is not fair, not only to the citizens and patients of Drogheda and Louth, because it obviously places an extra burden on Drogheda, but it is also unfair to the taxpayers who have provided the funding for this scanner.</P>

	<P>Unlike Deputy Sherlock, the Minister does not owe me anything.  I have a similar question in regard to the county hospital in Nenagh.  There is a new CT scanner there which is not operational because there is no staff.  It is crazy in the context of waste in the health service.  What the Minister did for Nenagh hospital was to close 25 beds under the cutbacks and reduce it to a 75 bed unit.  It has operated comfortably with 95 to 100 beds over a number of years but the Minister, in her wisdom, has cut it back to 75 beds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is outside the scope of the question.  The Deputy should put a relevant question.</P>

	<P>The radiology services in Navan, which according to the Minister&rsquo;s figures dealt with 177 patients every month for the past nine months, will have less work now that the orthopaedic ward is closed.  Is it intended to move some of the staff to do work in other hospitals?  The regional network manager accepted that 180 patients could miss out on having their operations in December.  It is accepted that only six were booked in.  However, the consultants have confirmed they only book their patients in three or four weeks in advance.  That regional unit deals with many more than six patients so it is unfair to suggest that only six patients will be affected.  In regard to the services, is it intended to move some of the staff out of Navan during this month when operations are cancelled to work in the other unit, given that it is a regional unit?  In regard to the radiology services, pre-assessment works will probably not be carried out in respect of patients hoping to undergo procedures in January or February, so the delay in operations will be a lot longer than a month.  That should be admitted.</P>

        <Quest>  when she expects that the national cervical cancer screening programme will be fully implemented; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[24017/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Cancer Screening Service is planning to roll out the <Col N="1559"/>national cervical screening programme on a national basis in January 2008.  I have allocated additional revenue funding of &euro;5 million to the service this year for this purpose and an additional 30 posts have been approved.</P>
        <P>It is expected that approximately 240,000 women will be screened annually.  Women aged 25 to 44 years will be screened every three years.  Women aged 45 to 60 will be screened every five years.</P>
        <P>The service is planning to have cervical screening managed as a national call-recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call-recall, smear taking, laboratories, and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated national service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister when she expects the national cervical cancer screening programme to be fully rolled out.  The reason I am sceptical and asked that question is that the breast screening programme was to have been fully rolled out approximately two years ago and that has not yet happened.  Will the breast screening programme be fully rolled out by the end of this year as promised and is that timeframe in place?  Will the Minister give a full timescale in regard to the cervical cancer screening programme?  Could she also answer the question regarding laboratory facilities?  Already waiting times for the results of cervical screening are approximately six months in some areas.  Are there resources in the system to roll this out and to roll out quality control in terms of having the laboratories that are doing the tests accredited?  Perhaps the Minister will expand on these aspects and tell the House whether BreastCheck will be fully rolled out this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>BreastCheck has already been rolled out in the west.  It was rolled out before the summer in Roscommon and it is being rolled out in the south within the next three weeks, either at the end of this month or the first week in November.</P>
        <P>Cervical screening will not be done region by region; there will be a national roll-out.  The national cancer screening programme, which is not part of the HSE at the moment, is going to tender and submissions are being invited and it is intended to roll the programme out in January.  I understand it is going to tender in the next couple of days to invite interested parties to do the smears.  In regard to laboratory facilities, I am assured we have sufficient laboratory services.  I understand it is intended that results will be available within a matter of days, probably to the general practitioner.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1560"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This matter is close to my heart because in 1999 I was part of a team that negotiated the original pilot programme in the mid-west.  We were told it would be rolled out within a short period.  Why has this roll-out taken so long?  Being a new Deputy I want to be nice.  However, I must question the bona fides of a HSE that is currently outsourcing the laboratory requirement.  If it has been doing that during the year because it cannot keep up with the amount of work it is getting before it rolls out nationally, how serious was it in regard to rolling it out nationally?  The HSE&rsquo;s bona fides are highly questionable.</P>
        <P>Can the Minister explain the delay of eight or nine years?  Can she confirm that currently there is only one accredited laboratory in the country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are issues regarding accreditation of laboratories.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister&rsquo;s answer a &ldquo;yes&rdquo;?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not certain whether we have one or two laboratories but it is a very small number.  I will confirm that.  There may be a second one.  We have very few accredited laboratories.  Now that we are moving rapidly into the whole issue of standards and quality assurance it is clearly important, if we are to have national roll-outs, that the test results are accurate in so far as they can be.</P>
        <P>The national cancer screening programme is not part of the HSE at the moment.  The resources that are currently used on what are called opportunistic smears will be diverted to the screening programme.  Many clinicians have been looking for that for quite some time.  I will not speculate on why that did not happen to date.  Screening programmes are expensive.  They take time.  We must direct our services more into screening.  Screening for colorectal cancers will be next.  It is hoped that can be done as quickly as possible given that those are the three areas where we know screening works.  Relatively few people have a problem but it can be fatal for the few that do if it is not picked up early.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to learn the Minister is committed to rolling out this programme from the beginning of next year although a delay has arisen.  I have concerns regarding the quality of laboratories and the availability of laboratory time.  At present many smears taken must be outsourced.</P>
        <P>On a related question, what are the Minister&rsquo;s views on, and has she any plans to introduce, a vaccine programme against cervical cancer?  Such a programme would be aimed at younger people and much discussion has taken place in this regard.  Where stands the Minister?  Obviously this would involve a financial commitment.  I refer to the vaccine programme for cervical cancer.</P>

	<P>Is the Minister aware we are approaching the third anniversary of the publication of the expert group&rsquo;s report in December?  She must agree there has been far too little progress made in the subsequent period.  The issue of the outsourcing of smear tests has been raised and large numbers of smear tests are being sent abroad for testing.  Does the Minister agree such tests should be carried out in Ireland and that sending them to be checked overseas opens up a swathe of risks?  Only this year, definite examples of the problems that can arise as a result have surfaced.  What is the logic behind the closing of laboratories and hospitals in the face of real work that can be carried out effectively and proficiently within the laboratory system of the hospitals network?  What steps is the Minister taking to address the deficiency in laboratory opportunities in this State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Deputy Clune, such a vaccine would have to be done in conjunction with other matters &mdash; it is not an either or scenario.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I await clinical advice in this regard and issues arise regarding how much should be paid to those who will administer the vaccine.  In Ireland, as Deputy Reilly will be aware, we pay considerably more than is the case in other jurisdictions.  While many issues arise in this regard, any innovation in the market must be used for the benefit of patients.  This has always been a feature of the Irish health care system.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As for smears, a total of 35,000 smears were outsourced for reasons of speed.  It was taking far too long to obtain the results and there is no point in having smears without obtaining the results quickly because that defeats the purpose.  The outsourcing was to an accredited laboratory.  Clearly, the Health Service Executive is doing some work on the required number of hot and cold laboratories.  However, quality is the key issue, as well as ensuring that all laboratories are accredited and operate to a high standard, which is essential.</P>

	<P>In March 2005, my predecessor asked the Mental Health Commission to prepare a report on the circumstances surrounding the death of this person who died in the acute psychiatric unit of Cork University Hospital in October 2004.  The report of the inspector of mental health hospitals, who is independent, was received in my Department in November 2006 and does not recommend a further independent review of this case.  The unit is monitored on an ongoing basis and is subject to annual inspection by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Health Service Executive, which is responsible for the management and delivery of this service, has accepted the report&rsquo;s findings and has advised that the majority of the recommendations have been implemented.  Risk management has been addressed, the ward environment has been reviewed and the female nursing office was moved to facilitate better patient observation.  The ward layout has been assessed and a group has been established to consider the redesign of the unit.  This year an additional sum of &euro;125,000 was allocated to the south Lee area for multidisciplinary team enhancement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister of State to respond positively to the request of the family of the late Anne Carroll, who took her life on 17 October 2004 at Cork University Hospital, for a review of her death that is independent of State agencies.  She was admitted on 6 September and was on weekend discharge when she attempted to stab herself.  She was saved by her brother but while he sought help, she cut her wrists.  Does the Minister of State agree that on her return by her family to the hospital it was unacceptable that no bed was available and that, consequently, she became extremely distressed?  Her family expressed concern to the hospital staff regarding her safety.  Does the Minister of State agree it was unacceptable for the hospital not to have a high observation or special care unit?  Was the absence of specified intermediate levels of observation unacceptable?  Does he agree it was unacceptable that the alarm system was out of order on the day in question?  On its examination, no documentation regarding the death of Ms Carroll was found in the clinical file.</P>
        <P>For these reasons, the family is anxious that an independent inquiry should be held.  In a similar situation, the Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessor set up such an inquiry into the death of Anne O&rsquo;Rah<Col N="1563"/>illy, who died in unit 5B in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick.  A highly extensive and far-reaching report arose from the independent inquiry.  The Minister of State should consider doing something similar at the family&rsquo;s request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Neville that this is a sensitive case.  However, the Mental Health Commission is independent and there have been two reports on this tragic death.  The second was carried out at the behest of the HSE by Professor Ted Dinan from Cork University Hospital.  Moreover, all but two of the report&rsquo;s recommendations have been implemented by the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>When I asked the Minister for an independent inquiry last August, I was not told of this.  I was informed the matter had been referred to the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive for his consideration, to ascertain whether he should hold an independent inquiry into his organisation, which is completely unacceptable.  The Minister, not the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s chief executive officer, should make a decision on an independent examination of that organisation.  Moreover, the family wish to have an inquiry that is independent of all State agencies, as took place in the aforementioned precedent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>

        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>  the amount of the &euro;1.5 million in funding allocated for cardiovascular issues, including heart failure and sudden cardiac death, in the Health Service Executive national service plan 2007 that has been spent to date, with a breakdown of these payments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy&rsquo;s question acknowledges, these issues are a matter for the HSE and I have consulted it to provide a relevant reply to the Deputy.  I can confirm that the sum of &euro;1.5 million allocated to the HSE for these services in the current year was divided equally between the fields of sudden cardiac death and heart failure.</P>
        <P>As for the funding of &euro;750,000 for sudden cardiac death, it was agreed to prioritise the co-ordination and development of first response by employing one national and four regional co-ordinators within pre-hospital care and six pre-hospital resuscitation training officers.  The sum of &euro;520,000 was allocated to the National Hospitals Office for this purpose in the current year.</P>
        <P>Plans for the remaining sudden cardiac death funding include media campaigns and joint funding of a further module of the medical emergency responders integration and training, MERIT, programme with the pre-hospital emergency care council.  MERIT is a managed programme providing automated external defibrillators and relevant training to GP practices in most areas of the country.  Areas still to be funded are the former North Eastern, Midlands and Northern Area Health Board regions.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;750,000 was allocated for heart failure.  It was agreed to prioritise support of the chronic disease management pilot project at St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Kilkenny, and the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin.  Further spending was allocated to support heart failure community development projects in the Cavan-Monaghan and Louth-Meath areas.  New developments in heart failure services at Beaumont Hospital, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and Cork University Hospital are also being funded this year.  Funding of &euro;421,000 together with approval for the necessary whole-time equivalents were assigned for the implementation of these services in the current year.  The availability of this funding is subject to HSE financial restraints.  However, it is our policy to ensure these services are rolled out in all parts of the country.</P><Col N="1565"/>
        <P>In 2006, a commitment was given to support a three-year heart failure programme in conjunction with the Heartbeat Trust, which supports research and special services in the heart failure unit of St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital.  In 2007, the year-two costs of this programme were met from the targeted investment funding allocated for sudden cardiac death and heart failure, which were divided equally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I acknowledge that the old regional ambulance service in the Eastern Regional Health Authority was supportive of community first responder schemes that were set up in Wicklow.  There were around 30 groups and nearly 500 volunteers.  After the establishment of the HSE and the Task Force on Sudden Cardiac Death, however, the scheme nearly collapsed, and would have done so if it were not for the volunteering spirit of certain individuals and the community.  It is a fantastic scheme, but it has received no support over the last 18 months.</P>
        <P>A nice press release that came through my fax on 3 October gave the impression that the world and its mother were being moved to implement the recommendations of the task force, but it simply has not happened.  A total of 48 recommendations were supposed to have been implemented by the end of 2006, but I do not know whether any of them have been to date.  The press release mentioned that members of the SCD implementation steering group had met a number of community first responders&rsquo; groups.  I know the group in Wicklow has made numerous attempts to meet these officials.  I ask the Minister to ensure that they meet and assist these groups, because it will be impossible to re-establish them if they collapse.  The press release also mentioned that there was a template available for first responders&rsquo; groups, but I have not been able to obtain this.  I ask the Minister to contact the steering group and ask that it take a more proactive approach in dealing with the groups that have already been set up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the efforts of volunteers, on whom the success of this programme depends, from every part of the country.  The provision of defibrillators is a bottom-up approach.  Apart from the funding being provided by the HSE, there are many communities which are making major contributions towards the purchase of defibrillators.  Agencies such as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta have also made a contribution.  It is important to have the infrastructure, including defibrillators, in place but it is more important that we have first responders who can provide the service.</P>
        <P>Deputy Timmins mentioned the report of the Task Force on Sudden Cardiac Death, which was published in March of last year.  Of its 75 recommendations, as the Deputy pointed out, 48 were considered to require immediate implementation. <Col N="1566"/> Action has been taken on these 48 recommendations.  Currently, the Department and the HSE are in the early stages of developing proposals on how community groups may best be supported and the setting up of first responder schemes, including training and the acquisition of defibrillators.  As for the group mentioned by the Deputy in his own county, I will raise this issue with the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the Minister give a commitment that he will investigate the possibility of supporting these schemes?  They do not need money, as this is provided by the communities.  They just need training and administrative back-up whereby they can ring someone in the ambulance service if something goes wrong.  There are many groups waiting to be trained, including several in Wicklow and Kildare and one, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in Askamore in your beloved Wexford.  They have volunteers, but the training is not forthcoming.  Will the Minister consider having this training provided?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 100 front-line patients attending the cardiac rehabilitation unit at Ennis General Hospital but because of the health recruitment freeze and funding cuts that service is under threat.  I want a commitment from the Minister that the service will continue.  It is invaluable to patients and should not be threatened because of these cuts.  Can the Minister give a commitment that it will continue into the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Far be it from me to take over the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rsquo;s responsibility, but the question does not deal with this matter.  However, I will pursue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I will certainly pursue the matter.</P>
        <P>On a more general note, as the Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion, I am committed, together with my colleagues and particularly the Minister, Deputy Harney, to overseeing the development of a new cardiovascular health strategy which will build on the success of the Building Healthier Hearts strategy while taking into account the changed landscape of today&rsquo;s Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am glad Deputy Timmins mentioned the ambulance service.  Too many people ring the doctor or the hospital in an emergency, which is wrong and a waste of time.  If there is one message I want to make clear, it is that people should dial for the ambulance service.  I will pursue the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>This report was commissioned by the former Midland Health Board and was completed during the period of transition to the new Health Service Executive structure.  A multidisciplinary project team, including voluntary and statutory groups and clients and carers of people with an acquired brain injury, was established to examine the community-based health service needs of people with this condition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following receipt of the findings of the project team, a development officer was appointed to carry out a more detailed needs assessment and to formulate a development plan.  The development officer submitted her report in April 2005.  The HSE has since contracted the Peter Bradley Foundation to provide a service for people with acquired brain injury in the midland region and has set up a forum for information sharing with the chairperson of BR&Iacute;, the Acquired Brain Injury Advocacy Association.  The service includes access to a neurophysiologist, an occupational therapist and rehabilitative assistants.  This is in addition to the usual services available to people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>Discussions on the creation of a national strategy for the development of neurological rehabilitation services are taking place between my Department and the HSE.  The report in question will contribute to this process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  Could the Minister confirm the number of people who sustain head injuries annually throughout Ireland?  Is it true that it is between 10,000 and 11,000?  How many consultants in rehabilitation medicine are there in Ireland at present?  Does he agree that by UK standards we should have 17 consultants, while based on the numbers in the Netherlands we should have 74?  How many people are waiting to gain admission to the National Rehabilitation Hospital?  Is it true that at the start of 2007 there were 120 people waiting for admission?  Does the Minister accept that people were waiting between three and six months, and up to 18 months in some cases, for admission to the high-dependency unit?  What is his opinion on this, given the importance of early admission to hospital?  Can <Col N="1568"/>the Minister also tell us how many acute stroke units there are, and their locations?</P>
        <P>When will we see action as a result of the report mentioned in the question?  When will a national strategic policy on acquired brain injury be developed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked a number of questions.  I will do my best to answer as many of them as possible and come back to him on the others.  It is estimated that approximately 10,000 people are admitted to hospital with acquired brain injury every year.  Obviously, the causes can vary from road traffic accidents, physical assaults, brain tumours or infections of the brain matter, such as meningitis.</P>
        <P>At the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire there are currently 120 beds.  Plans are well afoot to build a new hospital on the same site which will have 240 beds.  The Department is looking at the overall requirement for rehabilitation beds nationwide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Minister of State accept that there is a long waiting list for beds in the national rehabilitation unit and that families are trying to cope at home with seriously injured or disabled loved ones?  Does he also accept that there is capacity in nursing homes, at least one of which has a brain injury unit, to take people from the national rehabilitation centre whose treatment phase is finished and who need a safe place in which to stay?  These places are not being taken up because of the cutbacks and, as a consequence, the patients to which I refer, one of whom is in Swords in my constituency, are suffering undue and needless hardship?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I would agree with Deputy Reilly that there is a long waiting list and that is the reason we are proceeding to build a new hospital.  Would the Deputy repeat the second part of his question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about the current availability in a private unit to which people may be referred from the national rehabilitation centre.  I understand that a contract was nearly signed for the transfer of 22 patients which would have freed up those beds for people badly in need of care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding is that the home care packages will be re-introduced to the National Rehabilitation Hospital over the next week to free up beds.  As the Deputy stated correctly, if the beds are occupied, people cannot be allocated to them.  It is important that those who are ready to be discharged from the National Rehabilitation Hospital are discharged as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we get clarity here?  The Minister of State is speaking of home care <Col N="1569"/>packages, I am speaking about nursing home care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I include packages for nursing homes as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>To what is Deputy Reilly referring?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Although the normal practice is for a Deputy to ask the Minister a question, the Minister is asking Deputy Reilly a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Could Deputy Reilly give me the details?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Could Deputy Reilly identify the detail?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I can do that later, certainly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wanted to ask about the home care packages because the Minister, Deputy Harney, in replying to one of my priority questions, indicated that there would be a restoration of home care packages.  In the case of people currently in the National Rehabilitation Hospital who are ready to go home, will facilities such as home care packages be put in place to ensure that such people can move out of beds in order to allow other patients in?</P>
        <P>Headway Ireland, which deals with patients with acquired brain injury, has identified a number of areas of support needed for those living with acquired brain injury who may be outside rehabilitation and who are back in the community.  What measures will be put in place to address those needs?  Has the Department ongoing contact with Headway Ireland to ensure that the needs of those people are addressed in their communities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I met with Headway Ireland and Rehab over the past couple of weeks and shortly I will meet with the Peter Bradley Foundation.  The service it provides is of a high standard and is badly needed.</P>
        <P>My understanding with the HSE is that over the next couple of days those home care packages and nursing home packages will be made available to start allowing people to leave the National Rehabilitation Hospital if they are fit to do so, and to allow for the admission of patients who badly need the service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>This needs to be done urgently because there are people for whom every day makes a difference in terms of their access to the National Rehabilitation Hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not intend to repeat everything that has been said.  However, the wife of a person from County Meath who <Col N="1570"/>needs to be admitted to the National Rehabilitation Hospital was on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; on RTE radio yesterday, and today there was another case in County Cavan, in the constituency I share with the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, in which a person was seeking admission to the hospital.  Serious cases are presenting every day of every week.  How can the Minister of State explain the withholding of home care packages, not putting in place essential stepdown facilities necessary to free up badly-needed beds, and the fact that people in many hospitals around this country are waiting to be transferred?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Would the Minister of State agree the facilities in this area in Ireland compared with those in continental Europe are utterly inadequate?  Would he agree, for instance, with the standards the Peter Bradley Foundation cites in its recent report, namely, that we should have 74 consultants in this area but we have only three?  Would he agree that the issue is getting people with acquired brain injury or stroke quickly into rehabilitation so they can receive the proper treatment on time and so that most of them can go home to live a normal life?  Does he agree that is not happening?  There are thousands of people in Ireland whom we are failing on this issue.  We are way behind the rest of Europe.  Could the Minister of State give us some indication or commitment that action will be taken in this important area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I would agree with Deputy Stanton that we are behind the rest of Europe.  I agree we need more consultants.  As soon as the consultant organisations have accepted the new contract, the recruitment of those consultants will start.</P>
        <P>On Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s question, the budget for the National Rehabilitation Hospital is approximately &euro;25 million.  I understand that there was an overspend of approximately &euro;850,000, which resulted in a blockage.  We are now taking steps to unblock the blockage.  I agree that we should not prevent patients who need to get into that facility from being admitted.  From that point of view&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State should not allow it to happen.  This morning there was a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.

        <P FLI="0" el="5">This motion provides that the committee be instructed to consider the Committee Stage amendments relating to the introduction of new sections to the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2007 that I will present shortly.  The amendments have already been made available to the House and I consider <Col N="1573"/>them to be highly important.  I will now outline the main features of my package of amendments.</P>
        <P>On the repeal of sections 9 and 10 of the Insurance Act 1936, representatives of the insurance industry have indicated some concerns that they have regarding these two provisions and how they are having a negative impact on the operation of international companies in Ireland.  For example, under section 9 a person returning to Ireland from outside the EU, who continues to contribute to a savings product structured as a life insurance policy which he had established in his former country of residence, is at risk of committing an offence.  Under section 10 there is a possible negative impact for international companies who wish to put together group-wide insurance policies such as professional indemnity insurance.  The Department, in consultation with the Financial Regulator, has reviewed the position and it has been agreed that the provisions have no relevance in the current business environment and should be repealed.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to table an amendment to insert a new section 19 in the Bill.  I have indicated on several occasions previously my intention to introduce a regulatory regime for non-deposit taking lenders.  Under the proposed changes, all non-deposit taking lenders engaged in retail lending will be brought within the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s authorisation and ongoing supervision regime by way of an amendment to Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997.  An authorisation from the Financial Regulator will be required for any firm whose business includes lending to the public, that is, to individuals and to small firms.  Home reversion providers, who provide funds in exchange for a future interest in property, will also be included in this regime.</P>
        <P>It was originally intended to address the regulation of this sector later this year in the contexts of the Third Money Laundering Directive and the draft Directive on Credit Agreements for Consumers, both of which would require some form of regulation or monitoring of all credit providers.  However, there have been growing concerns that because some firms are not subject to specific regulation, their lending activities fall outside the scope of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s consumer protection code.  As a result, borrowers from these firms, which include those in the sub-prime consumer credit and mortgage lending markets, do not benefit from the additional safeguards which that code provides.  I decided therefore to avail of the opportunity presented by this Bill to remedy this shortcoming as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997 provides a framework for the authorisation and supervision of regulated businesses such as bureaux de change and money transmitters.  The amendments will add home reversion and retail credit to these regulated activities.  It will also introduce some necessary additional powers for the Financial Regulator.  These additional powers are needed <Col N="1574"/>to take account of the fact that there is a wider consumer dimension to loans and mortgages than there is to money changing and transmission.</P>
        <P>The amendment I now introduce is a technical amendment, in line with a recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which will allow the disclosure, under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act, of confidential information obtained by a person while performing duties as a member of the board or a member of staff of Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI, or an adviser or a consultant to OSI.  Ordnance Survey Ireland is already subject to FOI &mdash; as a body listed in the First Schedule of the FOI Act 1997 by virtue of the FOI Act 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) Regulations 2000.</P>
        <P>It is also intended to introduce amendments to the Investor Compensation Act 1998.  This Act had a network of legal cross-references to the pre-MiFID regime, namely, the Stock Exchange Act 1995 and the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995.  With the repeal of the Stock Exchange Act and the Investment Intermediaries Act being disapplied to MiFID firms, it is necessary to &lsquo;re-wire&rsquo; the legal cross-references from the Investor Compensation Act to the new MiFID regime.  Some amendments are also required to take account of the transposition of the Insurance Mediation Directive in 2005 and to deal with some technical difficulties experienced by the Investor Compensation Company Limited, the ICCL, in administering the investor compensation scheme.</P>
        <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Act provides in section 18(2) for the payment of 1% of gross national product, GNP, annually from the Central Fund to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It is proposed to amend the definition of GNP in that Act for the sake of clarity to confirm that the statutory annual payment into the National Pensions Reserve Fund is 1% of the figure for GNP published in the budget book.  This is a technical amendment to avoid doubt.  It will have no effect on the amount of the annual contribution to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which will continue to be 1% of gross national product as estimated at the time of the budget.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the oversight and funding of Ordnance Survey Ireland is being transferred from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  This transfer was one of the key recommendations emanating from a value for money and policy review of the grant-in-aid to Ordnance Survey Ireland last autumn.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources already oversees the Geological Survey and, arising from its core functions, has the structures and expertise required to monitor the activities of commercial State-sponsored bodies.  All parties, including OSI, are amenable to the transfer.</P>
        <P>It is not feasible to effect the new arrangement by way of the usual transfer of functions order.  Because the OSI was statutorily established under the aegis of the Minister for Finance, the <Col N="1575"/>existing legislation does not provide for the usual statutory consents of the Minister for Finance in such matters as the level of annual grant-in-aid, the number and remuneration levels of staff, etc.  Accordingly, primary legislation is now being brought forward to effect this proposed transfer.</P>
        <P>This has been a necessarily brief overview of the additional policy proposals I shall bring forward by way of Committee Stage amendments.  I shall also introduce some minor technical amendments to the Bill as published and I would not expect that Deputies would have any major difficulties with them.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the additional amendments the Minister is taking the opportunity to add here.  It is important that non-deposit taking lenders would be subject to regulation.  There is no doubt problems exist in regard to such institutions, not least in terms of whether they look properly at the suitability of the clients to whom they are lending.  Will the Minister indicate the scale of regulation he envisages for these non-deposit taking lenders?</P>
        <P>Some non-deposit lenders are in the business of securitising loans and selling them on to others.  There has been a concern that this business may lead to something of a moral hazard in that lenders may take on debt where it does not really suit a particular individual but this is of little enough concern to such lenders once they can sell on the debt to someone else.  This has been at the core of the sub-prime lending problem and how it became contagious right across the system.</P>
        <P>When we get to Committee Stage it is important we ensure there is authorisation in terms of the fitness of persons to do the work, that they have proper liquidity and so on, but also that there are real tests about the suitability of the product when they are lending.  This is equally true of home reversion schemes where there can be over-selling of products to persons who perhaps do not really understand what they are getting involved in or the suitability of the products for their needs.  I hope the Minister will introduce a regulation that goes beyond simple authorisation but will also provide some obligations in terms of consumer protection, which is important.</P>
        <P>Regarding the changes to the Freedom of Information Act, I cannot recall the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to which the Minister referred.  I must have nodded off while that report was going through.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>My recollection of the committee&rsquo;s recommendations on freedom of information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is they were far more radical than some small change in regard to Ordnance Survey Ireland.  If memory serves me, issues arose in regard to the appeal fees, for instance, and other core issues going to the heart of the adequacy of freedom of information legislation and a desire by many to see some of the recent additions modified.  The aim was that, in effect, we should return to the original intention of the Freedom of Information Act when it was introduced.  I am sure the Minister will have the report to show me where we signed up to whatever prompted this amendment.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I do not have any problem with the change to the Investor Compensation Act, which is for the better.  However, again I return to the issue I raised with the Minister recently, namely, the deafening silence from him on the deposit protection scheme.  In the UK, initially 100% deposit protection was provided to depositors in Northern Rock and for depositors in all other institutions up to the date when the protection scheme was announced.  The level was set at &pound;35,000, which is more than double our level, and there is talk of raising the amount to &pound;100,000, which would be &euro;150,000.  Our rate would be only one seventh of that.  At a time of financial crisis when people are worried about the protection of their savings, the incentive to deposit with a UK regulated institution that has this level of protection which is not available in Irish institutions will be quite tempting.  If the hiatus continues for too long, as there is far greater protection for savers in Britain than in Ireland, one would expect to see some movement of savings, which could not be a good thing or be greeted with equanimity.  As I stated yesterday during Question Time, there is a need for the Minister to move ahead of what other European colleagues might think appropriate and perhaps to enter discussions with the British authorities, who are not part of the eurozone but whose protection schemes would have significant influence on depositors given that Irish depositors may deposit savings in many British institutions established here.</P>
        <P>I do not understand the Minister&rsquo;s reticence to move forward outside a collectively agreed EU process.  I understand the argument that the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the time perhaps over-reacted and offered protection at the taxpayers&rsquo; expense that was greater than might have been prudent, although he seems to be rowing back from that position.  It is important that Ireland in some way keeps an eye on this issue to ensure we establish a proper deposit protection scheme.</P><Col N="1577"/>
        <P>Given the Minister is taking the opportunity to tidy up issues, I am surprised no new thinking is coming forward with regard to credit unions, the deposit protection scheme of which remains subject to question.  I realise this is a political issue.  Credit unions have been run in a certain way and people want to preserve their ethos.  On Committee Stage I will be interested to hear of the Minister&rsquo;s progress in achieving some agreed structure which could offer transparency on savings protection.  Issues arise with regard to transparency which we need to sort out, given the current climate.</P>
        <P>I do not understand what is happening with regard to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  On the face of it, the Minister seems to be moving from a GDP to a GNP base.  However, as he also states that this will make no difference to the contribution, this cannot be the explanation because GDP is substantially higher than GNP.  The Minister might circulate a note to explain what is the change as it is not clear from the explanatory note offered, and there is nothing but the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that there will be no change.</P>
        <P>I was interested in the value for money review referred to by the Minister.  While the joint committee is not yet in place and I have not examined this review, I know it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention that value for money reviews will be laid before the committees.  May we have access to this value for money review so we can at least understand the context within which this recommendation is being made?  The value for money review tool is an important one but it has been underutilised by the Government.  When there is a report of this nature, I will be keen to have access to it, particularly if we are making decisions on the back of it that will apply for some time.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the general thrust of the amendments.  My colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, has touched on most issues, although I would like to have clarification as to what is being paid to the pension fund.</P>
        <P>The Minister is considering regulation of the sub-prime market, which is welcome.  However, the Minister&rsquo;s speech gives no sign that prudential measures are being introduced for this area.  My understanding is that this area might be regulated when the Minister returns to deal with the Central Bank Act 1997.  Nevertheless, it is important that a level of comfort is given to borrowers.</P>
        <P>The section being amended, which refers to resources, is not specific enough in terms of prudential measures.  While there is an argument that this is not as necessary for institutions which do not hold deposits, this does not stand up in light of the Northern Rock case.  When major difficulties arose in the sub-prime market in the US towards the end of July, this indirectly led to Northern Rock getting into trouble.  Northern Rock&rsquo;s business predominantly concerned deposits but it was also in the mortgage business <Col N="1578"/>and would go to the interbank market to borrow funds to lend on to mortgage holders.  However, when banks became wary due to the situation in the sub-prime market, this led to a crisis of confidence and money was no longer available on the interbank market for Northern Rock to borrow.  Hence, the bank got into trouble.  It is extremely important that there is prudential measures to ensure the financial base of the sub-prime market is strong, given the doubts with regard to the type of loans sub-prime institutions are making.</P>
        <P>When the Minister brought the Bill through the D&aacute;il on Second Stage in early October, he stated he was examining the deposit protection scheme and that it was being reviewed at European level.  The UK is taking its own strides in terms of introducing a higher level of mortgage protection.  We should follow suit and move ahead of Europe given that this is a very important issue.</P>
        <P>SI 20 is the main statutory instrument in this regard, although there is also an amended statutory instrument, SI 663.  Regulation 20 states that the Central Bank should introduce a code of conduct to allow the various investment houses throughout Ireland to know how to implement the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used but it should read &ldquo;must&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  The biggest worry in the industry is the lack of knowledge as to how it is supposed to implement the directive.  The Central Bank is relying on the European model but it is important that we would reconsider the Bill with a view to amending the statutory instrument, if that is in order, to make it an obligation for the Central Bank and Financial Regulator to produce a specific code of conduct for all investment houses.</P>
        <P>Section 123 of the original SI 60 deals with regulation of cross-border activities.  For an investment house that has no branch in Ireland, the Financial Regulator relies on the home country to provide assurances on issues of financial regulation.  However, if the investment house has a branch in Ireland, it must provide further requirements and is subject not only to the code of conduct but also to the money laundering regulations and it must provide details in respect of its investment compensation scheme.  That does not appear to be a requirement for an institution based in another country which does not have a branch in Ireland.  I am concerned a situation will arise where the Financial Regulator will have no inspection or supervisory role in dealing with investment houses trading in Ireland which might be doing significantly more business than a bank with a branch here.  It is an issue we must consider.  I understand the necessary powers may be available under Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997.  It is important that these powers are copperfastened, either through further amendment to the Bill or the introduction of regulations.  This would provide comfort to customers of such institutions.</P><Col N="1579"/>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to protect consumers and the changes I seek would provide additional consumer protection.  It is vital that the deposit protection limit is increased.  Customers of sub-prime lenders and companies which trade through the Internet and do not have branches here must be offered protection and assurance that the institution from which they are borrowing is sound.  We do not want a sub-prime lender creating panic in the interbank market or causing a recurrence of the problem experienced by Northern Rock.</P>
        <P>While, on balance, this is a good Bill, I ask the Minister to consider the issues I have raised.  I look forward to exploring them further on Committee Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>During the debate on Second Stage on 2 October I repeated a question I put to the Minister last year, namely, whether he proposed to introduce regulation of banks and financial institutions which do not take deposits but choose instead to concentrate on lending.  Last year, he vigorously defended his decision to exclude these institutions from the regulatory framework.  I welcome his change of heart on this matter following the crisis in the sub-prime market, the credit crunch and the collapse in the share price of Northern Rock.  Through the amendments tabled today, his decision to seek to extend the scope of the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s supervisory regime to the considerable number of financial institutions currently operating outside the regulatory framework is an important step forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Every time one turns on the television a golden blonde 60 or 70 year old man or woman, speaking in quiet tones, invites viewers to re-finance by borrowing from the equity of their homes.  Radio listeners are exhorted in the same way.  These advertisements offer to sell couples aged in their 50s, 60s or 70s who have paid off the mortgage on their family home a loan based on a percentage of the value of their home.  The technical term used by the Minister for this type of loan is a reversion product.  Most members of the public do not know what is meant when they hear the term &ldquo;home reversion loan&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>We should discuss the experiences of members of the public in this regard.  Given rising costs, medical bills, the chaos in the health service and other costs, many of those who hear nice people from a financial institution offering them a loan on the strength of the value of their home are tempted to use this facility to fund important costs.  Alternatively, they may be tempted to give their children a dowry to help them into the property market.</P>
        <P>The hidden side of this practice is that many of the financial products offered to older people are extraordinarily costly and extremely lucrative for the financial institutions selling them.  Those who buy them do not see the small print in these types <Col N="1580"/>of deals, although, to give them their due, many solicitors will advise families and couples that particular products are expensive and ask whether they know what they are getting themselves into.  Having decided to regulate this sector, as I repeatedly advocated in the committee on finance and the public service in the previous D&aacute;il, will the Minister now call a spade a spade?  Will the Financial Regulator also use soothing advertisements featuring mature people with lovely blonde hair to inform the public that the costs and conditionality attached to these types of loans can be very expensive and asking people to consult family, take advice and give the matter careful consideration before taking out such a loan?  This is an important question.  With the hiving off of agencies such as the Financial Services Regulator from full Oireachtas scrutiny, it is difficult for the Opposition and Government backbench Deputies to find out the position in this regard.</P>
        <P>Will all sub-prime lenders be covered by the legislation?  As has been noted, different types of sub-prime lenders operate in the Irish market.  Some of them are based outside the country but have banking or other operations here.  Their advertisements do not appear to be subject to any kind of code of practice or regulation.  On Second Stage, I asked the Minister whether he had discussed with the Governor of the Central Bank the issue of employees of sub-prime lenders going from door to door offering loans in local authority estates and areas where affordable housing has been sold.  People who have bought a local authority house or paid off the first four or five years of the loan for an affordable home will probably have seen the value of their properties rise.  The leaflets constantly pushed through letter-boxes are like those from fast food outlets selling pizza.  Sub-prime and other lenders offer easy, seductive financial products to people who want to borrow to maintain a certain lifestyle.</P>
        <P>The original mortgage taken out via a local authority on an affordable house could be &euro;180,000, whereas the property may be worth &euro;250,000.  Sub-prime lenders will step in to offer a fresh loans of perhaps &euro;220,000, with which borrowers can wrap up other borrowings such as a car loan or credit card debts and may even include the legal fees associated with the financing package.  The loan is offered at a premium rate of interest and the borrower must pay charges, particularly if he or she defaults, at the highest rates.  This problem should be nipped in the bud.</P>
        <P>As I have stated on other occasions, bankers act like the masters of the universe.  While they may tell us how everything should be, irresponsible lending will have consequences for the economy and the reputation of the lending and financial services industry which provides many of the well-paid jobs we wish to retain.  Is the Minister in discussions with the Governor of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator on the problem I <Col N="1581"/>describe?  As he is aware, borrowing for domestic credit here is enormous compared to most European countries.</P>
        <P>The legislation does not include provisions on financial institutions such as credit unions which have been sold financial derivatives, including CFDs, by financial firms, in particular, a number of stockbroking firms.  What is the position in this regard?</P>
        <P>Is the regulator keeping an eye on what credit unions and the Central Bank have been buying to ensure their purchases are taken into account if they are affected by the purchase of financial derivatives?  Credit unions are a significant boon to people who otherwise would not have access to credit.  A number of financial institutions, such as stockbrokers, make healthy profits through selling financial products for investment purposes to organisations like credit unions.  What is the regulatory situation in that regard?  Has the T&aacute;naiste spoken to the Central Bank, the Irish Stock Exchange or brokers, some of whom do a great deal of business with the Government?</P>
        <P>Last year, more than 50% of transactions on the Stock Exchange were in contracts for difference.  The T&aacute;naiste pulled back from putting 1% stamp duty on CFDs.  Two years ago, he stated that, at the request of the financial services industry and stockbroking firms in particular, there was a considerable boom in the sale of CFDs, essentially a form of casino gambling for people who want to gamble on shares rising or falling.  There is no regulation in this respect.  Many individuals have lost more than &euro;1 million through CFD-type gambling as a result of the change from a bear market to a bull market.  Has the T&aacute;naiste considered this matter since the previous debate on the Bill?</P>
        <P>All parties in the House want the financial services industry to grow and strengthen because it is a source of good quality graduate jobs.  Our ability to stay ahead of the curve is based on reputation and losing our reputation by allowing any of these schemes to operate here will produce incredible damage.  Some American firms in the IFSC have reduced the volume of their CFD activities.  In the previous debate, I quoted a leading banker at one of our largest banks as stating that the bank was no longer advising individuals to get involved in this area of gambling.  The T&aacute;naiste will recall how Mr. Nick Leeson was interviewed on a number of radio shows and television shows while fronting Paddy Power&rsquo;s spread betting.  What is the difference between spread betting with Paddy Power and betting on CFDs?  Contracts for difference conducted through the IFSC and brokers have the capacity to lose people significant amounts rapidly.</P>
        <P>What inquiries has the Department of Finance made into what has been occurring?  Some of the people playing these markets are high rollers.  They have no problems because they are the type of people who invest in tax breaks.  They have a great deal of cash because they do not seem to <Col N="1582"/>pay tax.  I am not worried about them, but about those who are drawn in by the lure of easy money via the home computer screen and who find that the small print reads they may lose as well as win.</P>
        <P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s amendments, but they do not go far enough.  On Committee Stage, perhaps we can draw out the type of regulatory environment being proposed.  Does the T&aacute;naiste propose to leave the additional regulation to the Financial Regulator or will his Department and the Central Bank offer guidance?  A political decision was made to leave the regulation of this area with the Department and the Central Bank because the latter is meant to look after the prudential aspect to ensure that banks are not forced to close down and that there are no runs on them.  Northern Rock, which operated in Ireland as an Internet bank effectively, was guaranteed by the Bank of England and the British Chancellor.</P>
        <P>I have asked the T&aacute;naiste a number of times about the situation in respect of compensation schemes for savers.  Has he had time to collect his thoughts on how he sees those schemes developing?  In the UK, the level of compensation offered is higher than here, where it is limited.  What will happen if there is a run on a bank?</P>
        <P>In the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s pre-budget outlook tomorrow, will he vary the definition of GNP or will it be the definition contained in the national development plan?  Are there implications for the outlook?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, part of an EU-wide regulation of financial services.  Undoubtedly, one of the great success stories of the past 20 years has been the IFSC.  Its success has been good for our economy and for the many people who work there daily.  The financial services industry is built on confidence, trust and reputation and it is important for us that it is regulated sufficiently.  A good reputation is the guarantee of future expansion and growth.  Recently, the reputation of the UK banking industry was put under the microscope.  Confidence in it was severely dented due to the Northern Rock case, which was spoken of by Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell and highlights the threat we could face without proper regulation.  We must learn from this case and move forward.</P>
        <P>We must enhance the depositors&rsquo; protection scheme for savers and depositors in financial institutions.  Our scheme is limited to 10% of deposits with an upper limit of &euro;20,000, which is out of sync with the UK and other European countries.  We must know how to be balanced in protecting depositors and ensure that banks are not encouraged to take inappropriate risks.  I welcome the EU&rsquo;s examination of our deposit protection scheme with a view to advising us on necessary changes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have significant concerns about sub-prime lending.  I know of sales people who knock on doors, primarily in local authority areas, and <Col N="1583"/>attempt to persuade people to roll up their loans and remortgage their homes for high levels of debt.  Preying on the vulnerable and getting them to take out loans is unacceptable.  There are cases of applicants lying on their application forms about their capacity to make repayments in order to secure financing.  It is estimated that the Irish sub-prime lending market is worth more than &euro;1 billion.  The Financial Regulator must take more control of this market to ensure the robustness of operations and that selling practices are proper.</P>
        <P>I am aware that provision is being made in the Bill to ensure people&rsquo;s rights are protected.  They need to know the full facts when they enter into sub-prime lending contracts.  A review is needed of the regulation of complex securities and rating agencies because the lack of transparency in this process and the uncertain valuation of securities is at the heart of the current credit crunch.</P>
        <P>Over the past number of years, many Irish people have been enticed at property exhibitions into buying second properties abroad by freeing up equity in their homes.  The question arises as to whether those selling properties are providing buyers with the consumer information they require.  These properties are sold with rent guarantees even though it is obvious that the wages in the countries concerned cannot support the promised rents.</P>
        <P>The challenges faced by the economy are more serious than the Government admits.  The Minister recently advised that the budget deficit will be &euro;1 billion, which is much larger than previously expected.  I hope we can be more prudent with our money while continuing to look after the neediest, such as those with medical cards and the thousands of homeless people throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Important lessons need to be learned from the recent developments in global financial markets.  The economy is slowing and we face economic challenges.  We need to ensure that warning signs are heeded in the future.  Therefore, while I welcome the Bill, I hope the Minister will take account of the issues I raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their contributions regarding the motion and the proposed amendments.  It is important that I bring forward legislation to regulate the sub-prime lending sector at the earliest opportunity.  However, it is not possible to legislate for every possible interaction between a customer and a financial institution.  Indeed, attempting to do so could stifle innovation and competition in the market to the detriment of consumers.  Instead, the Central Bank Acts and other Acts empower the Financial Regulator to prescribe codes of practice for regulated financial service providers.</P>
        <P>The consumer protection code sets out both general principles and detailed rules on the conduct of business by financial institutions.  The <Col N="1584"/>principles require that they act fairly, honestly and professionally in the best interest of customers.  Detailed rules cover matters such as advertising, identifying customer needs and providing information.  The Financial Regulator can investigate breaches of the code and impose sanctions under Part III of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The process of authorisation means that retail credit and home reversion firms will become regulated financial service providers for the purposes of the code.</P>
        <P>The Bill and its amendments can be discussed further on Committee Stage in recognition of the requirement to activate some of its provisions from 1 November to coincide with the coming into effect of the markets in financial instruments directive.</P>
        <P>I can arrange for Deputy Bruton to be provided with a copy of each of the reports to which the amendments concerning Ordnance Survey Ireland refer, namely, the report to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on disclosure under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act and the value-for-money and policy review of Ordnance Survey Ireland.</P>

	<P>I always knew Deputy Bruton was amused by important documentation.</P>
        <P>Regarding the issue raised by Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell on non-deposit taking lenders, it is important to point out that they do not hold deposits taken from the public.  The question of prudential regulation, therefore, does not arise in that respect.  We are regulating their dealings with their customers and, as I set out in my opening remarks, by introducing a new section 19 we are requiring them to be brought within the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s authorisation and ongoing supervisory regime through an amendment to Part V of the Central Bank Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste acknowledge my point in regard to the impact of the sub-prime market on the inter-bank market?  I accept they are not deposit holders but I am concerned given that a lack of confidence in the sub-prime market effectively led to a restriction on money supply through the inter-bank market to Northern Rock.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>A problem certainly arose in Britain in that respect but it was not an issue in Ireland.  In respect of the impact of the sub-prime market on global markets, it is important to note that the sub-prime market constitutes 15% of the US market but less than 1% here.</P>
        <P>From a practical point of view, it is important that home reversion products and activities such <Col N="1585"/>as lending on the basis of acquiring future equity are brought within the existing regulatory regime of authorisations, standards and codes that apply to all other financial service providers.  The Irish financial services industry enjoys a good reputation and the regulatory regime works.  It is important that we take the opportunity provided by this Bill to do what I was going to do in the context of the enactment of the third money laundering directive.  That is the purpose of the additional amendments which are not germane to the Bill and require the passing of this motion to come within the Bill&rsquo;s ambit.</P>
        <P>Regarding the question raised by Deputy Bruton on the National Pensions Reserve Fund and GNP definitions, the custom practised in the Department in respect of the annual contribution to the fund is to consider the GNP figure in the budget each year and to send an amount equivalent to 1% to the fund.  That will continue to be the practice after the enactment of this Bill, so the actual contribution to the National Pensions Reserve Fund will not change as a result of this reform.  We get the GDP figure from the CSO each year and derive a GNP figure in-house by using a methodology approved by the CSO.  The actual definition in the legislation as it stands is somewhat convoluted and obscure, so we are introducing this provision as a technical measure for the sake of legal clarity and simplification.  It will not change what actually happens each year.</P>
        <P>The concerns expressed by Deputy Burton regarding contracts for difference will be addressed with the introduction of regulations from 1 November under the markets in financial instruments regime because they are classified as financial instruments under Schedule 1, part 3, paragraph 9 of SI 60 of 2007.  Therefore, financial spread betting on, for example, specific shares, bonds or indices of shares will become a regulated activity from that date and firms providing these services will have to be authorised.  The enactment of this Bill provides us with the regulatory cover for those activities if we proceed as suggested.</P>

Irish investment services law is defined as measures specified or enacted by an Act or any other enactment.

	<P>I move amendment<?oasys _jy ?>No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, subsection (4)(<i>a</i>), line 8, after &ldquo;offence,&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;in particular any penalty provided by regulation 188 of the European Communities (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 60 of 2007),&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This area of the Bill provides for a &euro;10 million fine for failing to retain records and other offences, some of which could be quite minor.  The amendment seeks to clarify that all of these offences are summary offences under Regulation No. 188 of the 2007 regulations.  There is also an inconsistency in the wording of section 9(3), which mentions summary penalties under the regulation referred to in section 9.</P>
        <P>As we discussed previously regarding this Bill, a fine of &euro;10 million could be regarded as very small in the realm of financial services.  The Minister glossed over some facts when he said our reputation concerning the financial services centre is very good and I remind him that the Ormond investment vehicle went down for several billion euro due to the type of loan it had accumulated.  Were it not for German state banks, such as Sachsen, I am not sure what might have happened but the entire affair was questionable.</P>
        <P>Mr. Michael McDowell chaired the committee that brought in the report that led to the initiation of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  The report referred to regulation with a light hand and the issue here is the Minister&rsquo;s approach to regulation.  In terms of the kind of money deposited in the financial services centre the fines mentioned in the Bill are in one sense very small, however, for a small Irish operator they could be very large.  We have no indication of how the Minister is thinking in this regard.  I remind him that in recent years we saw the issue of reinsurance as it related to Swiss Re and that Ireland featured prominently in several <i>Wall Street Jour<Col N="1587"/>nal</i> stories on how regulation did not work in the financial services centre.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is the Minister&rsquo;s approach to regulation?  Does he speak to the Governor of the Central Bank or do his officials speak to representatives of the Central Bank?  Does the Minister or do his officials liaise with the Financial services regulator?  We are trying to compete in a globalised financial services market and we want long-term stability and employment and a good reputation, rather than hot money that comes and goes with spectacular crashes.  Can the Minister indicate what his thinking is in this regard?  He is normally given to expressing himself clearly but is very coy, almost shy, with regard to this topic and that is most out of character for him.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Can the T&aacute;naiste alleviate his shyness?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the amendment before us, the definition of Irish investment services law in section 3 already includes the specific regulations referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s proposed amendment so there is no need to refer to that part of the regulations, namely Regulation No. 188, which deals with summary offences.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel agrees with this analysis and we are, therefore, not in a position to support the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding the wider issues raised by the Deputy, section 5 provides that a person guilty of an offence under certain provisions of these regulations, such as operating without authorisation, is liable on conviction on indictment to a maximum penalty of &euro;10 million and-or imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten years.  I would regard such a penalty as a serious outcome for any person.</P>
        <P>It is considered in Regulation No. 7(1) that operating without authorisation, under the new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, MiFID, regime as set out in SI No. 60 of 2007, should be an indictable offence to have sufficient deterrent effect.  There are other proposed indictable offences in section 5.  Regulation No. 40(1) relates to failure to keep records for the minimum time period.  Regulation No. 109(6) relates to appointing a tithe agent who is not entered in a public register to be maintained by the bank.  Regulation No. 112(1) relates to failure to keep proper books and records.  Regulation No. 19 relates to providing false or misleading information in an application for investment firm authorisation.  Regulation No. 52 relates to providing false or misleading information in an application to operate as a regulated market.  Regulation No. 152(1) relates to advertising investment services and so on where not authorised.  Also covered as indictable offences are misappropriation by an investment firm, obstructing an authorised officer, failing to comply without reasonable excuse with the instruction of an auth<Col N="1588"/>orised officer, providing misleading information to an authorised officer where the person knows or ought to know that the information is false and misleading or wilfully or knowingly obstructing inquiries by the bank relating to acquiring transactions or knowingly or recklessly providing false and misleading information.</P>
        <P>Subsection 4 provides that the conviction on indictment provision does not affect any penalty already provided for by Irish investment services law in respect of a summary conviction for that offence.  The section is also without prejudice to the right to bring summary proceedings in respect of any offence.  Subsection 5 provides that the section comes into operation on 1 November 2007 in tandem with the introduction of the other MiFID obligations.</P>
        <P>Regarding the question of Ormond Quay, that bank was regulated by the German regulator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It was based here, though.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Special investment vehicles are not regulated anywhere.  Ireland has a good reputation for its financial services sector.  The Deputy mentioned the importance of providing long-term employment in top quality jobs and I am glad to say that as a result of creating the financial services centre, an innovation this party was maligned for at the time, there are more than 25,000 well-paid jobs in the area and Ireland has become a centre of international financial services of high reputation as a result.  Moreover, Ireland is a centre of financial services that meets all of its international obligations and requirements.</P>
        <P>The issue mentioned by the Deputy that arose around a subsidiary of a German bank that was dealt with by the parent bank is a matter for the German regulator.  This is the law and I do not feel that people should infer from this that we were somehow remiss.  It has never been suggested by anyone that we were remiss and it is important that it not be suggested in this House.</P>
        <P>These are the basic points I seek to make in response to the Deputy&rsquo;s contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 5(5) states that the section will come into operation on 1 November.  Will existing regulations be kept in operation until MiFID is transposed to other countries?  Some investment houses operate in Ireland without having a branch here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Why, in setting out the fines and penalties due for offences, was it decided to choose a flat rate maximum penalty rather than <i>ad valorem</i> or based on turnover or assets?  Some large financial institutions will find penalties of this nature easier to bear than others.  Is there a reason fines are not somehow related to the size of the operation?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1589"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to acts of dishonesty by individuals who interact with the regulatory regime through authorised officers and others.   The &euro;10 million fine and-or imprisonment of ten years and making it an indictable offence are of sufficient deterrent effect to ensure people comply with the regulations as we set them out.  On the situation in respect of those who do not comply with the MiFID directive on time, the pre-MiFID arrangements and legal provisions will apply, pending transposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if the Minister ever had the opportunity in his spare time to watch the film &ldquo;Wall Street&rdquo; or read the book <i>Bonfire of the Vanities.  </i>If he did, he would know that &euro;10 million is nothing to these people.  In an operation where losses are being piled up, as in the Ormond Quay investment vehicle, this is just a pittance.</P>
        <P>There is no evidence so far that the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority has taken action against anyone, other than it has suspended a number of operations which have seemed to operate outside of the regulations.  The Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, famously once said that she would prefer Ireland to be closer to Boston than Berlin.  I can only say that our Government and the financial services centre must be thanking God that Berlin came to the rescue in the case of Ormond Quay Funding whose exposure was over &euro;20 billion.</P>
        <P>The Minister may shake his head and be in denial, but we still do not know what happened.  In this situation, where we have a globalised market in securities and improper dealing or excessive risk taking has taken place, it is worth asking whether the Minister has made any inquiries.  Whether he likes it or not, that vehicle operated from this jurisdiction and went down here.  Just as with the reinsurance episode two and a half years previously, we have had a narrow escape.</P>
        <P>The issue remains.  In practice, in areas that have come to light for investigation by the Financial Services Regulator with regard to banks overcharging or mis-selling products, the cost of the financial investigations has far outweighed any penalties levied.  I am not aware that any penalties have been levied.  It is foolish not to provide a regime of penalties which is proportionate to the amounts of money involved because, while for some people &euro;10 million would be an enormous sum, for others it would not.  Many of these financial derivative products are based on risk, basically on playing poker and having the nerve to take the risk and live with it.  In that case, a fine of &euro;10 million for the kind of sums involved is only peanuts.</P>
        <P>I note the ultra-conservative approach the Minister has taken to regulation, which is to regulate as lightly as possible.  However, in a falling market where a credit crunch is developing and <Col N="1590"/>where we have financial products that people do not understand well &mdash; many in the financial markets do not understand them well &mdash; the risk of a collapse and the consequent damage to the general economy from it is enormous.  People heading out to buy a house will face higher interest rates and charges because of the credit crunch.  Although this issue does not seem to have much direct impact on routine financial service provision, it is something that drives up interest costs.  If banks are unwilling to lend on the inter-bank market, the effect will be felt within a couple of weeks by young couples trying to buy their first home.</P>
        <P>Much of the material in the Bill relates to financial services with which many ordinary people are not involved.  However, if they go wrong, there is significant impact on them and our economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Ormond Quay Funding was not regulated in this country and there was no liability, potential or otherwise, imposed on the Irish regulatory regime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister not concerned about the worldwide publicity on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned about people giving publicity to suggesting there was some problem for the Irish regulatory regime.  There was not.  Yesterday, I answered this question by way of a parliamentary question put by Deputy Costello and my response explained the factual situation on that matter.  The fact is that structured investment vehicles, SIVs, and conduits are not regulated.  However, as a result of recent market turbulence the EU, ECOFIN, the European Economic and Financial Centre, EEFC, central banks and experts in the area are examining what lessons can be learned for the future and how we can ensure we have regulation where required.  We are also trying to ensure we have functioning markets that are at the forefront of innovation and which will acquire business and ensure business is conducted.  Ireland has been able to achieve that.</P>
        <P>When and if an issue arises, this does not mean we should clamp down on everything on the basis of the Deputy&rsquo;s view that we had a near miss.  We did not have a near miss.  The financial framework of this country is strong and liquid if one listens to what the Central Bank governor has to say.  I am glad we have an influential governor who is held in high esteem by the industry generally, here, internationally and within the corridors of the ECB.</P>
        <P>It is not a question of being complacent, dismissive or conservative, but of facts.  The last thing we want is to have fictional information in the public domain suggesting we are at risk.  Of course, we are not immune from the turbulence which has taken place, but we are in a good posi<Col N="1591"/>tion.  If the Central Bank governor can state this, I should also be able to do so.</P>
        <P>On the question of the regulatory impacts for the future, these are being considered in the proper and appropriate manner by those committees answerable to ECOFIN, the Eurogroup and within the European Central Bank area.  When they have properly considered and taken into account all the issues and observed the subsidence of the turbulence and its long-term impact, lessons can be drawn therefrom.  I am not prepared to suddenly overturn the regulatory regime we have on the basis of what happened in the past number of weeks.  That would not be a responsible or sensible thing to do.  It would not be sensible to do it prior to the full collaborative effort by people far more expert than I, from other countries and markets, who share the Eurogroup area with us.  That is my position.  It is not about Berlin, Boston, Bangkok or anywhere else.  When a report is produced in mid-2008 by those looking at the area, that will be the time to draw conclusions.  I will take the advice of these people who are far more expert than I and on whose advice I rely.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>On the issue of fines, where there are breaches of Irish investment services law in interactions where people who want to get into the market provide the wrong information, those people will be subject to a fine of &euro;10 million and-or ten years in prison.  That seems to me a serious deterrent for anyone who wants to interact with the financial regulatory agencies here from providing wrong information.  Such breaches will not be tolerated and there is a heavy legal sanction in terms of both criminal law and a financial fine for the individual concerned.  If there are wider issues of fraud or if people are engaged in other such activities, I am sure there are other laws and sanctions that apply.  However, with regard to the scope of this Bill, we are talking about a fine of &euro;10 million and-or ten years in prison.  If those in the market do not keep records for the minimal time period, do not appoint a tied agent under the proper arrangements, do not keep proper books or if they provide false information or advertise their services where they are not authorised to do so, it is a matter for the courts to decide the seriousness of the offence and what should apply on finding them guilty.  Our advice on the comparative arrangements being made regarding the transposition of this directive is that we are in line with international practice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment<?oasys _jy ?>No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, line 13, after &ldquo;1942&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;(inserted by section 26 of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003)&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a drafting amendment to correct an inconsistency in drafting between this section and section 11.  Section 11 refers to a 1995 Act, as amended in 1998.  It is also inconsistent with the drafting of section 16, which also lists specific amendments.</P>
        <P>Regarding what the Minister said earlier, he still has not outlined his fundamental take on the matter.  He cannot have woken up a happy man when he saw the Ormond vehicle going under, having been bailed out to the tune of &euro;17 billion to &euro;27 billion, depending on which financial journalist he reads.  He cannot tell me he was delighted or did he just say: &ldquo;There we go again, what is a couple of billion among friends?&rdquo;  The Minister said it has had no impact on his thinking.  On the other hand, I am sure the Minister, Deputy Harney, will be surprised to hear that he is relying, probably sensibly, on the advice of people in the European Central Bank but what does that mean?</P>
        <P>Do we take a position where we examine what is happening?  We are all agreed that the financial services centre is an important source of jobs and in a globalised economy financial services will remain one of the biggest outlets for employment, particularly for graduates and post-graduates,.  Therefore, the way we regulate and the extent to which we know what is going on in the International Financial Services Centre is important in terms of our reputation.  The Minister&rsquo;s attitude is disappointing.  He is waiting for some wise group from Frankfurt to come forward with proposals but there is a general consensus that the development of complex financial products, which very few people can fully understand, is an area whereby if people take ridiculous risks we may all end up paying the price for that excessive risk taking and gambling by the people playing those markets.</P>
        <P>This is an important issue for us.  I presume people from our Central Bank visit the European Central Bank.  Do they go with some kind of remit from the Minister&rsquo;s Department?  Are they examining the issue?  Are they taking part in these discussions or do we just get a note from Frankfurt telling us what we are to do and the Minister will comply with it?  I am a little taken aback by the Minister&rsquo;s description that there are wiser people available in the European Central <Col N="1593"/>Bank to whom he will listen.  Are we not part of this process?  Do we not have a role to play in it?  Do the Minister&rsquo;s officials put forward points of view?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister should remember that the scene in the Ormond Hotel in &ldquo;Ulysses&rdquo; was the siren scene.  The Ceann Comhairle will know that from his previous stint as the Minister with responsibility for the arts.  We know that sirens enticed men onto the rocks where they perished.  That is the issue with the financial services market and the Ormond experience.  People should not be enticed into excessively risky situations which,<?oasys _jy ?>in turn, has a bearing on the rest of the<?oasys _jy ?>economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>For the sake of clarification, my understanding from the regulator is as the Minister describes, namely, that this was a company wholly regulated in Germany with certain minimum licensing requirements in Ireland.  Will the Minister set out clearly, in the case of companies like Ormond Quay which I understand was wholly owned by a German bank, the remit of the Irish regulator and the remit of the non-Irish regulator?  I understand that the Irish regulator was not given some information on which they failed to act, as a newspaper report suggested, and that they were fully co-operating with the Germans who had the primary role in regulation.  That would be worth clarifying because it is important that there is general confidence in the way we regulate.  </P>
        <P>Will the Minister clarify where the lines of responsibility fall in cases like this, the requirements in regard to an Irish regulator of a company like Ormond Quay and how they were fulfilled?  My understanding is that the problems were entirely the responsibility of the Germans to regulate but what was the Irish role?  It is important we know that because at least one newspaper article suggested there was something remiss in the way it was being overseen in Ireland.  It would be worthwhile for the Minister to set out clearly the lines of responsibility in an authoritative way as he is undoubtedly in a position to do.</P>
        <P>On section 6 and the application of fees, with which I have no problem in principle, in other parts of the financial services regulatory Bill, as far as I can recall, the setting of fees involved some type of consultation with an industry panel.  There was a loop where people at least saw that the fees were reasonable and related to something fair.  Is there a structure like that regarding the setting of fees?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We have moved far from the section at this stage but I have given a full reply to a parliamentary question on Ormond Quay which sets out the position and there is no point in adding to or retracting from it.  Ormond Quay was not a complex product.  They borrowed <Col N="1594"/>short and invested long and the short-term borrowing was straight up, as it were.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Were they regulated in Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The position is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Were they registered in Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a discussion on it, Deputy Burton, and, as the T&aacute;naiste has pointed off, we have moved on from the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to be clear that the Ormond Quay vehicle was an off balance sheet investment vehicle.  It was a conduit of Sachsen LB, which is a German savings bank.  That German savings bank, Sachsen LB, provided a guaranteed line of credit to Ormond Quay and some other conduits it had established in Dublin.  Ormond Quay called on that line of credit as the prevailing market conditions were such that it was unable to raise the short-term funding it required.  Sachsen LB was unable to meet its obligations to Ormond Quay and, as a result, liquidity arrangements were agreed with an association of German savings banks.  That Sachsen LB parent was subsequently bought by LBBW, another German savings bank, and as a German bank, Sachsen LB was regulated by the German financial regulator.  </P>
        <P>Those are the facts.  I have given a detailed answer to the question and there is no need for any confusion about it.  What concerns me is the continuing indication that we were remiss in some way or that we did something wrong.  I do not like to see any bank get into trouble but none of these conduits are regulated.  The lessons we learn from market turbulence is to examine all of these for the future and how they should or should not be brought within the regulatory remit, which will be done in a collaborative way within the European Union.  Thankfully, we have a financial services industry of high reputation, professionalism and liquidity that is well capitalised and very profitable.  Those are the facts.  One would have thought that should be the case anyway, given that we have been the best run economy in Europe for the past ten or 15 years.  When an economy is growing at 7% annually, one would have thought that banks make money.  They have made a great deal of money.  The enterprise economy we have built enabled such liquidity in the market.  As a result, we have seen unprecedented expansion and development.  That is the background &mdash; an economy with good economic fundamentals and a well regulated financial industry where those in authority know whose statutory responsibility it is to check on these matters.  What I am saying will send the right signals to the markets and those interested in the financial <Col N="1595"/>health of the country and its system of financial regulation</P>
        <P>As I have said in reply to parliamentary questions, the issue that arose in the other case had nothing to do with the regulatory regime here or its adequacy.  The other issue about turbulence as a result of the sub-prime market in the United States which has had effects is being considered by EU and Irish experts because we have a well developed financial services industry.  Those who advise us are held in high regard by those operating in the area internationally.  If there is an external shock, we must consider how we will deal with it.  We are not immune from such trends but we are in a much better position than others might be.</P>
        <P>The fact that someone else has a problem does not mean we have the same one.  There are effects but we are handling the situation well and must maintain confidence in the economy.  We should not let the idea spread that we somehow avoided a serious catastrophe.  I do not say that in an adversarial way; it is a true reflection of the situation.</P>
        <P>I keep in touch with the Governor of the Central Bank.  We spent a weekend in Lisbon discussing these issues, including the Northern Rock issue that Friday morning.  The general consensus was informed by the conclusion reached at that meeting, a consensus which is at variance with some of the assertions being made here.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I will call Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell and then Deputy Flanagan but we must consider this according to the sections.  Section 6 relates to fees payable under section 33(<i>k</i>) of the Central Bank Act 1942, while section 7 relates to amendments to that Act.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I take on board what the Minister has said but does it not point to a weakness in the regulatory environment across Europe that there was a case such as the Ormond Quay case?  Everyone wants a system in which we can be confident but we must also take account of situations that arise.  Clearly, in this case there was a lack of regulation, be it in Germany or elsewhere, but we must take it on board.  We are moving into a Europe-wide regulatory environment under MiFID.  We should take cognisance of this and be absolutely certain that the regulatory environments in other EU states are as good as our own.  We must prize the regulatory environment we have built over many years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>No one takes pleasure from any financial institution getting into difficulty.  Lessons will be learned from the turbulence by finding out what caused the problem and what practices were allowed.  We have already seen US Treasury Secretary Paulson commenting on what he felt were lax regulatory standards, the need to review the regime in the United States and how <Col N="1596"/>it operates in regional markets within the United States and a range of issues on which he is far more expert than me.  Obviously, adjustments are made and lessons learned.</P>
        <P>The first priority when there is turbulence is to provide for stability and restore confidence.  The inter-bank market dried up because of a lack of trust uncharacteristic of how banks operate where people started to look again at risk and ask if the loan books were as robust as was thought.  Of course, when they see a problem, people start to adjust to see if those with whom they are dealing are in as good health as they thought.  The cost of providing short-term or longer-term money goes up as a result of the reluctance of many to provide that level of liquidity given what has happened.  These matters must be adjusted and lessons learned but as we try to do this and improve the regulatory system, there will be a warning light before issues reach the stage where customer confidence is lost.</P>
        <P>In the interests of financial and market stability, a high priority will be given to any recommendations that derive from the collective and expert consideration being given to these matters, particularly given the complexity of the products available, the level of product innovation, the freeing of markets and the ability of capital to cross frontiers in a way that was unthinkable 15 years ago.  These factors bring with them attendant risks, as well as attendant benefits in terms of access to capital and the ability to fund enterprise and growth and create jobs and wealth.  That is the case in any capitalist society.</P>
        <P>I am not dismissive of these issues but we must maintain perspective and provide for a calm and sensible approach in order that people do not start to draw unjustified conclusions and cause further problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister has given us his view of the general financial crisis because this is the first opportunity we have had to hear him talk about it.  We started by praising his decision to introduce the late amendment to include certain products such as reversionary products in the legislation.  I repeatedly raised sub-prime lending with him a year ago and he said the same as he is saying now, that there was no need to do anything about it.  That can be seen in the record of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and the D&aacute;il.  The Minister did not see a compelling case for dealing with these issues.  I pointed out to him that every day people listening to the radio or watching television were being sold expensive financial products in a very hard sell.  The people in question can be vulnerable, not least because of the state of the health service.  They must borrow to fund private treatment because they cannot wait for the public system to provide a service.  The Minister may shake his head.</P>

	<P>That will keep him quiet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>They are buying products by remortgaging their homes for high prices.  Eighteen months after being initially asked about this matter, the Minister is now saying that some regulation is needed.  While that is to be welcomed, some of these products are excessively risky.  I hope all the wonderful people in the European Central Bank and beyond who are advising the Minister can come down to the level of ordinary people&rsquo;s experiences.  In the long run, there is no such thing as money for nothing when it comes to financial services.  In the end it is a question of balance.  People make money from financial services but long term they must provide a decent service at reasonable prices.  That is what this is about.  If they over-egg the pudding and take stupid risks on which they make short-term billions, we will be left holding the baby.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We are not necessarily left holding the baby.  These are commercial issues and, in many cases, the moral hazard must be considered in that context.  The assumption that the State automatically comes in to cover everyone else&rsquo;s mistakes is not necessarily the case, although I take the point that the overall impact on market stability will always have to be considered depending on the scale and scope of what we are talking about.  The other point is that the Governor of the Central Bank is one of the most grounded people I know.  He is a very down-to-earth man.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>He is a former Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance.  I have listened to others who hold similar views on this issue.  In the context of having a discussion on any of these issues, we need to preface our remarks not simply by empty flag-waving, but by stating that we have a good financial system that is well capitalised, liquid and profitable.  It has withstood <Col N="1598"/>the recent turbulence as well as if not better than most.  There is a professionalised regulatory authority which is active and expert in this area and which is held in high regard by its peers in other parts of the European Union.  In addition, the authority will make its contribution in a calm, sensible and authoritative way with a view to getting us through this difficulty as quickly as possible for everyone&rsquo;s sake.  It will restore confidence in the market, learning lessons, drawing conclusions and supporting whatever proactive efforts must be taken to ensure that such a risk or problem can be alleviated, mitigated or eliminated in future.  That is my basic point.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In the Bill as published, regulations 38(4) and 61(3) were included in the list in section 9 dealing with penalties for conviction on indictment of the Reinsurance Regulations 2006.  The severe nature of the penalties for indictable offences in the financial services industry are such that they should only be applied in circumstances where it is clear that the offence being committed is of a serious nature.  As that is not always the case concerning regulations 38(4) and 61(3), it was felt that a summary prosecution for the application of the administrative sanctions process would be more appropriate in such circumstances.  The Financial Regulator has no objections to such an amendment and is satisfied that the key offences for which there is a need to have an indictment provision option are captured in section 9.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Regulation 38(4) is for the failure of a special purpose reinsurance vehicle to comply with certain requirements.  Regulation 61(3) refers to the failure of a reinsurance undertaking to comply with the solvency <Col N="1599"/>rules made by the bank.  The Financial Regulator suggests they should be treated in that way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Minister comment on the problems a couple of years ago in the reinsurance market concerning the financial services sector?  We never got information from the Financial Regulator or from the Minister.  The problems that arose in Dublin concerning vehicles associated with a number of reinsurance companies were widely publicised, particularly in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>.  That newspaper is widely read by investors, including those investing in Ireland.  As regards reputational issues, will the Minister comment on whether his stance is influenced in any way by what happened in the financial services sector then?  We in opposition are unclear as to whether regulations were located here which affected these cases.  It is a bit like the Ormond Quay situation &mdash; it is not clear to what extent, if any, the Irish regulatory authorities, such as the Central Bank or other regulatory agencies, have capacity to make an impact on these affairs.  They had major financial implications for the reinsurance companies involved as well as having serious consequences for a number of senior executives associated with those companies, including people who were employed in Ireland.  Some of the operations here subsequently closed down.  All this happened behind closed doors, however, and it is difficult to have a debate here when we do not have the facts.  We are all trying to be positive but nobody ever thought Barings Bank would go under.  One day it did so because of weaknesses in financial structures and regulations allied to somebody taking excessive risks.  The history of financial markets shows that collapses occur when people take excessive risks and the whole deck of cards comes falling down.  Will the Minister comment on that?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Maybe it relates to the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We have already discussed section 9 and I have explained the background to all of this.  These are technical areas and from time to time we can all be at a disadvantage in some respects as regards these matters.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point.  The ambit and scope of this section indicates that this is the way to deal with these particular areas, as the Financial Regu<Col N="1600"/>lator has suggested.  We are prepared to follow the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s advice on this matter.  I am not vesting in this Bill a range of issues concerning the reinsurance industry generally.  This relates to convictions and how we proceed with seeking a conviction in respect of a range of non-compliance items raised by this directive, which is detailed and technical.  I am taking on board this recommendation by the Financial Regulator in respect of how one can proceed with this case.       </P>

        <P Just="Left">Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>What are the implications of what the Minister is trying to achieve by extending the Netting of Financial Contracts Act? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 10 is essentially a technical amendment to update the Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995 to provide for the extension of the protection afforded by that Act by expanding the range of financial contracts that may be encompassed.  The Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995 provides protection for netting or set-off arrangements between parties to contracts involving certain financial instruments in the event of an insolvency.  As financial markets continue to develop so too does the available range of products.  As the financial contracts that may be encompassed are restricted to those specified in the Act, and the existing ministerial regulations, the definition of financial contracts needs to be updated periodically.  This is a review of practice since the last Act to cover this area.  We believe we should broaden its scope to ensure that our law covers the way in which these products are provided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister must forgive my ignorance of this area but what is he talking about?  Is this protecting hedge funds? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It remains a definition of a financial contract by expanding the range of financial contracts that may be covered by the Netting of Financial Contracts Act.  I do not have a more detailed note on this but can get one for the Deputy on Report Stage. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>So it is a good thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reliably advised that it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does this include, for instance, financial derivative products such as contracts for difference as well as hedge funds? <Col N="1601"/> The Minister said that from 1 November some regulation will come in for contracts for difference.  These contracts constituted more than 50% of the business on the Stock Exchange here until it crashed.  Is it intended to extend the remit of the Act in respect of that type of financial product?</P>
        <P>We are all at a disadvantage because financial products are developing at such an extraordinary pace that it is difficult for most Deputies, particularly those on the Opposition benches, to follow the development of the markets.  It would be helpful to get a brief on the position here in respect of these products.  The International Financial Services Centre is attractive and we welcome the jobs it provides but we need ways and means for ordinary Deputies, not to mention ordinary Ministers, to keep abreast of what is happening.</P>
        <P>The flow of information to us is limited.  Neither the Central Bank nor the Financial Regulator provides an information service, apart from generalised consumer advice or tables about insurance costs and so on.  Maybe we all need information on these products.  Does the Act include contracts for difference and similar products?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The financial contracts now incorporated by way of updating our definitions under the Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995 are set out in the section.  That is only ten years old.  There has been significant innovation in this area such as interest rate contracts, which are one or more of single currency interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, and interest rate futures.  There is a range of financial contracts for which we need to update our definition to ensure the 1995 Act covers them.  Under the directive we are required to do that and we are doing so.</P>
        <P>I take the point that these are specialised technical financial instruments whose detail and scope would be known only by those who daily engage in this sort of work.  If the Deputy wishes I will try to get a more detailed brief of what these contracts do for Report Stage.  The section basically aims to update our definition under the 1995 Act to ensure we cover those areas.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister explain what he seeks to achieve in this section?  I understand this relates to Icarom, the former ICI, and removes a holding company.  Why does the need for this arise?  Is this the company that gave rise to the 2% levy on insurance policies, which appears to be still in place?  If we are making provision for winding up companies are we presenting insurance policy holders with the gift that they no longer need to pay a 2% levy?  Or am I being too optimistic about the Minister&rsquo;s largesse? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 12 is a technical amendment to secure Oireachtas approval for a simplification of the State ownership structure of Icarom plc, under administration, by removing the holding company Seal&uacute;chais &Aacute;rachais Teoranta, SAT, from the structure.  When the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, ICI, got into difficulties in March 1985 an administrator was appointed to place the company on a sound commercial and financial footing in order to separate the affairs of ICI from AIB.  The shareholding of AIB in ICI was transferred to a new holding company, SAT.</P>
        <P>In 1990 the High Court approved the sale of the direct insurance business of ICI.  Thereafter the rump of ICI became known as Icarom plc.  That is under the ownership of the Minister for Finance, through this holding company, SAT, and under the administration of the High Court.  The main role of Icarom plc is to run off ICI&rsquo;s pre-1985 liabilities, mainly in respect of its US risks.  The simplification of the ownership structure is being undertaken on the recommendation of the administrator and is to provide legal certainty in respect of Icarom&rsquo;s access to the federal court system in the US in respect of liability claims.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to get bogged down in something that may be off the main point, although maybe I could be forgiven for that.  Is it not the case that the 2% insurance levy came in under an Act that provided for the <Col N="1603"/>establishment of an insurance compensation fund and that vehicle was used to support this company?  This money, which was legally assigned to an insurance compensation fund, is now being used entirely for Exchequer purposes.  Where did the change occur such that something that was intended for a specific requirement was diverted into general Exchequer-raising revenue?  I am sure it was convenient for the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors to keep this going as a source of revenue but was there ever a conscious decision, debate and approval of this change?  This was introduced for a specific purpose.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="5" />
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did it take so long for this transfer to take place?  What are the assets of the company?  Why is it happening now?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the change is to allow for a rationalisation of the current structure under which the remaining business of ICI is administered.  The direct effect of the inclusion of this amendment would be to allow me to wind up the SAT holding company.  That acts as a holding company for another company called Icarom, which in turn administers the remaining insurance business of the former ICI.  The directors and shareholders of SAT and shareholders of Icarom are officials from the Department of Finance.  The proposal provides that the Minister can wind up SAT, and Icarom can then be reincorporated as a single member company.</P>
        <P>The most significant benefit arising from this change will relate to proof of state ownership.  The argument has been made that because Icarom is held through a holding company it is not entitled to be treated as an entity owned by a foreign state and thus entitled to have cases in which it is involved heard in American federal courts.  Despite the fact that appropriate proofs have been provided, such proofs have not always been accepted as sufficient.  The winding up of SAT and the reincorporation of Icarom as a single member company vested in the Minister for Finance will simplify the proofs required and eliminate this problem.</P>
        <P>Subsection (<i>a</i>) provides for the winding up of the SAT company and the transfer of the Icarom shares held by SAT to the Minister, and that any assets remaining after the wind up of SAT would be transferred to the Exchequer.  Subsection (<i>b</i>) requires SAT shareholders to provide their shares to the Minister when required by the Minister and provides that Icarom may be converted into a single member company with the Minister as sole member.</P>
        <P>With regard to the 2% levy that was used to fund the administration, I do not have a briefing on that aspect.  I will have to check whether it is relevant in respect of this issue and get back to the Deputy on Report Stage.</P>

I have already stated that I have been advised that amendments such as these are unnecessary.

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 13(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) will give the Financial Regulator a legal right, subject to EU confidentiality constraints, to disclose confidential information to the National Consumer Agency for the performance of the agency&rsquo;s functions as provided for in the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  Section 13(<i>c</i>) extends the deadline for submission of its annual budget by the Financial Regulator from the end of September to the end of October each year.  Given the complexity of the process for establishing the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s budget, it is felt that the Financial Regulator should be given a more extensive period for preparation.</P>
        <P>Section 13(<i>d</i>) extends the immunity from costs arising from the discharge of their duties to members of the Financial Services Ombudsman Council.  It will ensure that members of the council are not liable for damages arising from the discharge in good faith of their statutory duties.  The Financial Services Ombudsman was established as an independent body in its own right.  The existing provision may give the impression of an element of accountability to the Financial Regulator which was never intended.  Section 13(<i>e</i>) will clarify the Financial Services Ombudsman&rsquo;s independence.  Section 13(<i>f</i>) will reduce the number of required compulsory retirements from the board of the Financial Regulator by the number, if any, of voluntary resignations which may have occurred between the relevant anniversary dates so as to ensure continuity of <Col N="1605"/>membership and minimise any potential disruption to the official working of the Financial Regulator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no profound objection to these provisions.  I would like the Minister to clarify the point about the Financial Services Ombudsman not having to report when he decides not to investigate or to discontinue an investigation.  I understand the Minister&rsquo;s point that if he must give his reasons to the regulator, it reduces his independence to some extent.  Presumably he will still be under some general obligation to report to the regulator on cases in which he discontinues an investigation or decides not to investigate.  Will there be some public policy element from the Financial Services Ombudsman on the strategy?  There needs to be consistency about these decisions.  I presume that this reporting was seen as some advantage in the original draft.  Are we losing anything by going down this road on the consistency of regulation and the consistency of the treatment of complaints by individuals?</P>
        <P>The other parts of the section do not seem unreasonable.  The Minister is giving the Financial Regulator more time to produce reports, which I presume is for good reason.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true that they have a good relationship.  If an issue arose in the normal course of events that the ombudsman felt the regulator should know about, the ombudsman would inform him.  This section seeks to underpin his independence.  It is not a question that he be spoken to by the Financial Regulator.  It is part of the need to reinforce the independence of these ombudsmen from other people in the apparatus.  It is not that there is a problem out there, but we are trying to reconfirm what was intended originally, which is his statutory independence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Financial Services Ombudsman has provided a mechanism for people who have been badly treated by banks, financial institutions and insurance institutions to seek to have consumer issues redressed.  Is the Minister aware that the Financial Services Ombudsman has recently withdrawn from an investigation that he had undertaken on people transferring insurance products?  The suggestion is that the legislation has been deemed to be inadequate.  For people who shop around for insurance services, some insurance companies levy charges for changing service providers.  That <Col N="1606"/>constitutes an inhibition on people transferring services.</P>
        <P>If the Minister has had an opportunity in this section to consider the relationship between the ombudsman and the Financial Regulator, does this imply he has had, or his officials have had, an opportunity to undertake a review of how the Financial Services Ombudsman is operating?  A number of comments have appeared in the financial press reporting that he has undertaken investigations.  While he has been successful in getting redress and satisfaction for customers of financial and insurance institutions in some cases, in others he has suggested strongly that the legislation has been inadequate.  Has the Minister had an opportunity to be briefed on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I have read of another case, which I believe differs from that to which Deputy Burton refers, in which an individual finding was made to the effect that a financial institution had not treated an individual fairly and the same treatment was being meted out to thousands of others.  It was found that the Financial Services Ombudsman could not impose a requirement on that company that would relate to all 1,000 affected people.  Instead, he would be obliged to deal with each of the other 999 cases individually before they would get their refunds.  If this case as reported in the newspapers constitutes a defect in the legislation, Members should include something to correct it before passing this legislation.  A scenario in which a malpractice is unearthed but one is obliged to have hundreds of cases taken individually sounds like an extraordinary hole in the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot accommodate this suggestion at such short notice.  I have not yet received any correspondence from the Financial Services Ombudsman on this issue.  However, I also read the reports in question and it is clear a judicial review took place of a decision made by the ombudsman as to how wide an application a recommendation in respect of a specific incident he investigated would have.  Like the Deputy, I know no more of this issue than that.  I am sure the Financial Services Ombudsman will communicate formally with my Department if he has issues in this regard.  We will study the judgment, assess what is involved and ascertain the exact position.  However, I cannot make such a commitment at short notice based on the information available to me.  We must wait and see what the ombudsman has to say to me formally in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps someone should contact the Financial Services Ombudsman informally to ascertain whether it is a matter that is sufficiently simple &mdash; as it sounds to a lay person &mdash; to enable the Minister to accommodate it.  A Bill such as this, in which it could be included, may not come before the House for <Col N="1607"/>months.  Perhaps contact should be made to clarify the point at issue and whether Members should take this opportunity to deal with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>All actions are subject to judicial review, if necessary, by affected parties.  They go before the courts, which decide on what is the issue on the merit of the case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this issue still <i>sub judice</i>?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Many decisions go in favour of the ombudsman, while others may not.  In fairness, not many are challenged.  As Deputy Burton noted, he has been highly active and has been building a good reputation regarding the assiduousness with which he follows up cases on behalf of citizens.  I have much time for the gentleman personally.</P>
        <P>This issue must be looked into and checked carefully before one can state that I could simply make a telephone call to sort it out tomorrow.  The matter must be reflected on and the position must be ascertained.  However, I appreciate the Deputies&rsquo; point.  If this is an issue of major import from the ombudsman&rsquo;s perspective, I am sure the Department will be hearing from him.  However, I will try to find out what is the exact situation.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek clarity from the Minister.  Essentially this amendment extends the National Treasury Management Agency to become a form of bank to State bodies and Departments.  I have no problem in principle with the NTMA so doing as it can achieve economies in providing, for example, foreign exchange services.  However, does it raise a bigger issue if Members allow deposit-taking and lending facilities by the NTMA to bodies such as the HSE and so on?  It seems to be a significant step forward.  I presume the HSE has its own lines of credit, bridging finance and so on that it uses to manage its affairs.  Has the Government decided it would be better to see the NTMA become more of a bank that offers active services to public service bodies, rather than my understanding of its original purpose, which was simply to manage public debt and achieve economies in that area?</P>
        <P>I am aware of and welcome the development of other activities within the same group, such as the State Claims Agency and the National Pensions Reserve Fund, as economies of scale may be gained by having them managed under the same roof.  However, is this a significant new departure on which the NTMA is embarking?  What are the implications for wider public policy?  Perhaps this is a wide and far-seeing measure.  However, it seems strange for it to be slipped into this Bill as one amendment among 100 others.  It seems to be a significant initiative in respect of public policy on banking by public bodies.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy noted, sections 14(<i>a</i>) to 14(<i>c</i>) amend section 18 of the Act under which the National Treasury Management Agency provides a deposit-taking and lending facility known as the central treasury service to local authorities and non-commercial semi-State bodies, which are designated by the Minister for Finance with the approval of the relevant Minister.  The purpose of the central treasury service is to make competitive banking facilities available to public bodies.  This facility is being extended now to the Courts Service, certain third level colleges, the Railway Procurement Agency and the Housing Finance Agency.  Section 14(<i>d</i>) will allow the NTMA to engage in transactions of a normal banking nature in respect of its central treasury service activities.  This will, for example, allow the use of Internet rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk where fixed-rate loans are provided through the central treasury service.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P Just="Left">Section 14(<i>e</i>) is a technical and consequential amendment arising from the previous subsection which amends references to take account of the new subsections in section 22 of the National Treasury Management Agency Act 2000.  Section 14(<i>f</i>) inserts a new section 25A into the National <Col N="1610"/>Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.  This will allow the NTMA to provide foreign exchange services to Government Departments and to bodies which can avail of the NTMA&rsquo;s central treasury service, such as local authorities and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  Giving the NTMA this power could yield savings of between &euro;500,000 and &euro;700,000 for the Department of Foreign Affairs alone in respect of transfers of moneys to the overseas development aid programme and so on.  It builds on an existing facility provided by the NTMA for non-commercial State and semi-State bodies and local authorities which provides for more competitive banking facilities.  We wish to make it available to the Courts Service, where developments have been taking place recently, and to third-level colleges, the Railway Procurement Agency and the Housing Finance Agency.  We want to make sure we use the central treasury service to obtain the best possible banking services for these agencies in addition to the agencies being served already.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the T&aacute;naiste that the NTMA has been a successful public body.  Its operations have enabled us to obtain good value in managing the national debt and have brought the cost of servicing and managing the national debt down considerably.  I notice that in recent times the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which is one of the agencies under the umbrella of the NTMA, has taken a position on the matter of investing in equity funds, including some Irish funds.  What is the risk profile of the NTMA?</P>
        <P>I have no problem with extending the agency&rsquo;s powers to give it more general banking powers for specific State agencies, particularly when it concerns investment in infrastructure such as rail.  Is there a policy or are there guidelines from the Central Bank or, more probably, the Department of Finance, the parent Department, which deal with risk, particularly in the area of new financial products such as derivatives?  What is the position of the NTMA and of funds such as the NPRF from this point of view?  In general, I welcome the addition of section 14 and the extension of the powers of the agency, particularly in the matters of investment capacity and the ability to invest in key infrastructural areas such as the Railway Procurement Agency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The section deals with the fact that we are extending existing treasury services to these public bodies in addition to bodies that have already benefitted from them.  The question being raised now is a wider policy issue.  The NTMA has statutory independence under its own Acts and was removed from the aegis of the Department and given operational autonomy.  This was for a good reason and its <Col N="1611"/>record proves that this was the correct decision.  The NPRF is also independent in its investment strategy and it operates under the relevant Act.  It is not subject to amendment by me as Minister for Finance.  I believe that its independence is critical in terms of allowing it to maximise its returns on the funds it invests, which cannot be touched, statutorily, until 2025.</P>
        <P>The philosophy behind our dealings with the NTMA and the NPRF has been to respect their statutory independence and allow them to get on with the remit with which they were provided under statute.  It was a wise decision to avoid duplication within the Department of Finance of the effort made by these agencies.  Obviously, the NTMA reports to the Minister, has an annual reporting mechanism, and is answerable to the committees in terms of its operations.  However, I do not give operational guidelines on a regular basis to the NTMA or the NPRF.  They act under statute and derive their powers from that.  The record of the NTMA proves that its independence has been fundamental to its success.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister clarify the type of facilities the NTMA could provide, for example, to the HSE?  Could it give day-to-day revenue borrowings or capital?  What are the lengths of time and rates of interest involved?  This is currently a grey area.  What is the position in the context of the budget overruns being experienced by the HSE at the moment?  This should be clarified, as we are dealing with mainstream Government bodies such as the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is the potential for significant savings of public money if this can be developed into a shared service that yields returns.  Has the Minister considered the potential for better treasury management in individual bodies due to use of the NTMA?  If this generates savings, would it be reflected in terms of a reduction in the number of bureaucrats involved in treasury management and an increase in front-line staff, or is this left to the agency?  Is there a driving philosophy to utilise shared services to reduce bureaucracy and overheads in the management of these bodies?  One of the things that frustrated people, particularly when the HSE was set up, was the sense that bureaucracies were being built upon bureaucracies and that economies due to shared services could not be achieved because there was no reduction in the numbers involved in the HR departments, for example, of the individual health boards.  While this is clearly an interesting area in which economies may be achieved, I am anxious to ensure the economies are utilised at the front line and that duplication is reduced.  Perhaps there is still a treasury or foreign exchange management unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs that continues <Col N="1612"/>merrily as it always did even though it is now availing of the services of the NTMA.</P>
        <P>Given that this is a single body, is there a tendering process for business of this nature?  When bodies make use of the NTMA, is there an obligation for them to tender if the value of the work exceeds a certain amount, or is this simply a relationship that develops between bodies without an obligation to tender?  While the NTMA may genuinely offer economies, I would like to see an opportunity for others to tender.  The pressure to be competitive is always greater if there is an obligation to tender down the line.  I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s general comments on how initiatives such as this can affect front-line public services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give a detailed reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s points on Report Stage.  The point is to provide competitive banking services.  There are local authorities which bank outside the NTMA.  The State bodies that have already made use of these facilities have seen that it is a good way of providing these services.  Many of them find it more comfortable to deal with the NTMA, as the philosophy and ethos of the agency are consistent with their own.  Therefore, on the question of having a relationship with the NTMA and providing a competitive service, if the service it was providing was less competitive than where one was getting it already I presume one would not go there.  Given the complexity of public finances, however, having the NTMA in charge of these arrangements, where they are relevant to non-commercial State bodies, or indeed Departments or local authorities, would provide a far greater degree of comfort for those authorities than would be the case otherwise.  Perhaps it would be best to get the Deputy a more detailed note on the practicalities of this for Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same subject, I would feel relieved if the NTMA were taking charge of some of the treasury functions of the HSE.  Compared to what is happening at present, it might be for the better.  The Minister might let us have a note on the issue.</P>
        <P>Given the changes in the financial markets and the risk factors that are now much higher because of the turbulence in the markets, as the Minister acknowledged, is risk profiling done on how the NTMA deals with these issues or is that left entirely to the NTMA?  This is a technical and skilled area of banking and treasury management, but it is important to know what is the risk profiling.</P>
        <P>Another area under the NTMA&rsquo;s management which is also subject to specific legislation is the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA.  I recall, as I am sure Deputy Bruton probably does, that the NDFA and a number of its then key executives came in to the Committee on Fin<Col N="1613"/>ance and the Public Service and, if I recall correctly, the Committee of Public Accounts.  We heard an interesting presentation on its purchasing for the HSE and a number of visits it made to centres of excellence in cancer treatment technology, including linear accelerators, in the US and in a number of other locations.  As I understood their presentations, they had brought forward a plan to invest in linear accelerators for a number of centres of excellence for cancer treatment in Dublin and around the country.  However, subsequently I saw a good deal of material in the media suggesting that the HSE had a different viewpoint, which seemed to be broadly that it would be much better to purchase these linear accelerators by traditional direct procurement methods of direct State purchase, presumably through the HSE.</P>
        <P>Can the Minister offer any insight, if not now directly then maybe by way of a note, as to what exactly happened because in the presentations we heard in the Committee on Finance and the Public Service, and indeed in the Committee of Public Accounts, in the last D&aacute;il the strong suggestion from the NTMA following visits it had made to a number of centres of excellence in the US &mdash; there was a Powerpoint presentation on this &mdash; was that it had a model on the procurement of the latest top-of-the-range equipment but subsequently the HSE appeared to disagree with this approach.</P>
        <P>These were very significant investments by the State as part of the NDP in improving our technology in cancer treatment and I never really heard what happened.  Is it all part of some ongoing dispute on how these matters are financed or will some of these additional powers here give the NTMA more authority in decisions like this?  I would be grateful if the Minister elaborated on what this means in terms of the relationship between the HSE and the NTMA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>While a request for an update on the health capital programme would be best directed to the Minister for Health and Children, we passed legislation a couple of years ago at my initiative where the NDFA became the centre of excellence for PPP provision across Departments, and it is interesting that Deputy Burton is supportive of that PPP proposal.  At the end of the day the NDFA gives the financial advice and suggests ways and means by which these things can be done.  I do not know the position beyond that other than that obviously they have been looking at that in the area of health in the same way as they have been doing in housing, on the environment and in projects in other Departments.</P>
        <P>The decision to centralise a centre of excellence within the NDFA in terms of trying to promote PPP provision and ensuring that Departments did not have their own PPP units, which <Col N="1614"/>was the case, goes back to the shared service idea which Deputy Bruton mentioned in his contribution.  The benefit of that is clear for all to see.  It helps to take the matter from within Departments and to have people specialise in that particular area because of the complexity and the amount of work and detailed preparation that must go into ensuring that it is done in the appropriate fashion, meeting the public service benchmarks that are also set out as part of ensuring value for money in the application of PPPs.  I cannot say anything more than that on the issue.  Given the Deputy&rsquo;s interest in this area, it would be best to see if I can get a more detailed note for Report Stage and Deputies might be able to talk about it at that stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I would appreciate a note because the difficulty for people in opposition is that if one asks the Minister for Health and Children about anything, it is referred to the HSE, from which many months later some responses arrive.  Sometimes it would be easier to understand ancient calligraphy than to understand the responses of the HSE in any meaningful ordinary sense of the word.</P>
        <P>I have an open mind about PPPs.  PPPs are not an issue of ideology, they are an issue of cost, service provision, time taken etc.  I do not know whether Deputy Bruton recalls, but I attended several presentations and listened intently to the presentation of a significant plan to acquire major investments like linear accelerators for cancer treatment for several locations around the country, including at least two locations in Dublin and one in Limerick.  It then emerged through discussion in the media that the HSE was of a different point of view and, if I remember, the net point was that the powers that be in the HSE felt that traditional State procurement methods were cheaper.  Possibly that is correct, but the problem is that Deputies cannot get answers from the Minister for Health and Children or, indeed, the HSE.  Maybe the Government cannot get answers either because sometimes that is the way it seems to us on the Opposition benches.  I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us what happened the idea of providing top-of-the-range technology following studies in places like the Mayo Clinic in the US.  I am fully supportive of the acquisition of this technology, however, it then fell into the mists of time and subsequently the Minister for Health and Children stated the timelines for the provision of this technology would be much longer than had been indicated in the original NTMA presentations.  I would appreciate if the Minister would enlighten us.  It would be helpful to try to understand the ongoing mysteries of the Health Service Executive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I can enlighten the Deputy in the House in how it is expected these <Col N="1615"/>amendments will work in terms of enhancing or widening the numbers of bodies to which the central treasury service of the NTMA will apply in the future.  The opportunity cannot be used for me to reply to a parliamentary question.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 16 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>This section deals with changes in the ministerial pension legislation.  Currently a pension is payable if the former office holder applies for it within six months of becoming eligible for it, otherwise it is payable from the date of application.  This amendment will allow for payment of a ministerial pension to be backdated to a date not earlier than the date of entitlement.</P>
        <P>Did somebody forget to apply for a ministerial pension so as to warrant the introduction of this change to the legislation?  Does it relate to a specific individual?  All politicians are very bad at looking after their entitlements.  The matter is rather intriguing.  Does the amendment relate to a specific case and can the Minister perhaps enlighten us as to what gave rise to this amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>What is intriguing is that the requirement to apply within six months does not apply to any other public service pension.  If a person other than a Minister were to apply for a pension after the initial six month period, he or she would not be disbarred from receiving the pension back to the date of entitlement.  For some reason it was felt in previous legislation that we should be treated differently, but we should be treated the same as everybody else.  That requirement will no longer exist.  There was somebody who failed to apply in time.</P>

        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;or 40 per cent of the total gross loan book balance outstanding at that time in respect of all loans made by the credit union where written approval is received from the Bank,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Section 17 of the Bill as published amends section 35(2) of the Credit Union Act 1997 so as to allow a practical interpretation of the lending limits which apply to the making of loans.  For instance, prior to this reform a five-year loan continued to be counted as such even when the repayments term outstanding had fallen below five years.  The same applied to ten-year loans.  This change was already implemented at the request of the credit union movement by way of SI 193 of 2007.  The Attorney General has advised that the reform should be confirmed in primary legislation at the earliest opportunity and hence section 17 as published.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also propose to avail of the opportunity afforded by Committee Stage to make a further reform in regard to the lending limits of the credit union.  These two amendments to section 17 will extend the amount of long-term loans from 20% of the loan book for five-year loans to 40% for five-year loans and for ten-year loans from 10% to 15%.  These further reforms could not be included in the Bill as published as a report of the review group on long-term lending limits for credit unions had not been published at that time.  A further Committee Stage amendment, No. 21, will be necessary in order to formally revoke SI 193 of 2007 which will be redundant once this section is commenced.</P>

	<P>I welcome these amendments.  The credit union movement has been unique in offering loans to people at affordable rates.  They assist many people who would not normally be banking in the general run of things.</P>
        <P>When we are debating credit unions it is important to raise some of the other issues that arise.  The deposit protection scheme to which I referred earlier is one where continuing issues need to be resolved.  I get the impression it is a very slow bicycle race in terms of getting to a point where there is a savings protection scheme that has the confidence of the regulator, which is transparent and where we know there is certainty in regard to how it works.  We have been fortunate in that there have been no cases where the system has not been able to cope but we have been given warnings that we need a robust <Col N="1617"/>scheme.  The Minister needs to inject some urgency in getting to a conclusion.</P>
        <P>In recent years credit unions have been moving out of traditional financial vehicles, namely, granting loans to their members.  They are buying new financial instruments and we are now extending their remit to new loan vehicles, which is welcome.  The other side of that issue is whether credit unions have the management skills to deal with longer-term loans and having more loans of that nature on their balance sheet.  This will put new stresses and strains on the management of credit unions.  There has always been a debate between the voluntary ethos of the credit unions and the pressure from regulation to become more professional and have higher levels of management skill and supervisory levels.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the extension of credit limits announced by the Minister, has he or the Financial Regulator introduced any new reporting or supervisory requirements?  Questions have been asked at times about the ability of some credit unions to evaluate risks they take on.  It is important that as we make this welcome decision to allow credit unions greater freedom we do the other two things that are needed to underpin that, namely, make sure we are satisfied there is good management of these new responsibilities and opportunities and that savers within the credit union movement are well protected.  It would be good for their long-term future and the strength of the movement if we ensure all these measures move in harness together.  I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the direction of development for the credit union and whether he considers we are close to achieving a solid basis in the future on all these fronts which have been somewhat fraught in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister or the regulator of credit unions examined the types of investments credit unions have been making in the context of the turbulence in financial markets?  I do not know whether guidance has been given to credit unions or whether there is any oversight in regard to investments in financial derivatives by credit unions.  The regulations require that credit unions have to hold a very high level of investment on their balance sheets, which is fair enough.  Credit unions have lobbied to be allowed to lend more.  The increase in the loan capacity introduced by the Minister has been good but in regard to the investment side of their balance sheet, some broking firms have been heavily selling to credit unions with other institutions&rsquo; financial derivative products.  Has the Minister an insight into what the extent of this might be or has the regulator of the credit unions investigated the matter?</P>
        <P>There has been heavy advertising with regard to financial investment products in Ireland and, particularly in recent months, investments in <Col N="1618"/>international property developments, particularly in Europe and slightly further afield.  Very often, the entry point is &euro;5,000 or above.  Again, we do not want a regulatory structure that is too intense &mdash; we cannot save people from themselves.  However, there is a balance to be struck.</P>
        <P>In recent years, a number of investment vehicles where the base of the investment was overseas property have run into trouble.  For example, in recent months changes to Spanish planning laws have caused significant problems in the Spanish property market.  Are Irish people borrowing from their credit unions to invest in overseas properties?  While we do not want to over-regulate, people are now buying into overseas financial investments and the issue arises as to whether they are properly advised and what we can do to give them better advice.  At the end of the day, they are free agents and are entitled to borrow money to invest in overseas property.  However, we should advise them to exercise due caution with regard to such investments because the advertising of some of those investments is incredibly seductive &mdash; I am sure the odd Deputy feels like investing although, luckily, we are not paid enough to do that.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister given any thought to this area?  If the credit crunch and scaling down of the property market are set to continue, and interest rates stay higher than previously, some who have borrowed a lot of money from credit unions may find that the overseas property they have bought or committed to does not provide as a good a return as they expected when originally investing.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the section.  I have dealt with credit unions over many years and know a huge debt of gratitude is due to the credit union movement.  Before the advent of the Celtic tiger in the 1990s, many small businesses would have gone under but for credit unions.  Banks were not providing overdraft facilities and people had to go to the local credit union to get a draft to keep them going for the week or month.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding that debt of gratitude, I welcome that we are allowing credit unions to lend over longer periods and also that we are introducing controls at the same time.  However, I take on board the points made by Deputy Bruton, particularly with regard to the investments credit unions are making.  A wide range of products is available and, while credit unions obviously try to maximise returns for deposit holders and members, control mechanisms or other guidance should be put in place with regard to the type of investments credit unions should make.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree there is always a need to strike an appropriate balance between <Col N="1619"/>allowing the credit unions to expand the range of services as they would wish while at the same time ensuring members&rsquo; savings are not put at undue risk &mdash; that is the balance we are attempting to strike.  As progress was not being made on long-running issues, since I became Minister for Finance I have instigated a process of discussion and engagement.  This has brought us a long way down the road by building a consensus and building confidence in the system between credit unions, which vary in scale and size, the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Registrar of Credit Unions, and by understanding how the registrar, as an authorised officer, interfaces within the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s office.  We need to avoid misunderstandings and get on with the agenda, which is a manifestation of the success we are having in this respect.</P>
        <P>While respecting the ethos of credit unions, they have been given the funds that are under their care and management and it is necessary for them to be part of the regulatory regime in the interests of all, including the credit unions themselves.  At the same time, we will improve the range of services, the type of loans and the number of loans over a certain period that credit unions can provide, as I outlined in my previous contribution.</P>
        <P>On the investment side, the Registrar of Credit Unions took steps to limit the exposure of credit unions and the investment market by issuing a guidance note on investments in October 2006.  This guidance note sets out the framework within which credit unions should maintain their investments and it is subject to regular review by the registrar in consultation with the sector.</P>
        <P>The board of directors of each individual credit union is responsible for managing the funds and setting the investment policy of that credit union &mdash; this is the individual autonomy they exercise.  However, the registrar expects credit unions to comply with this guidance in order to avoid undue risk to members&rsquo; savings and will monitor credit unions&rsquo; investments against this guidance.</P>
        <P>The guidance note sets out a list of authorised investments for credit unions and within this list there are limits for each class of investment instrument in which credit unions can invest.  While they are not precluded from investing in non-capital guaranteed products under current legislation or guidance, and they can invest in equities, under the terms of the investment framework investment in equities, for example, is not to exceed 5% of the total of the credit union&rsquo;s investment portfolio.  My point is that guidance is available and action and monitoring is taking place with a view to providing the appropriate balance to which I referred.</P>
        <P>With regard to the savings protection scheme, ongoing discussions are making progress subject to the various legal advices.  While some of the <Col N="1620"/>issues are long-running and little progress was made in the past, I am confident we are set fair to address them in a way that meets the requirements of all involved, despite a background of past suspicion and lack of trust.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment<?oasys _jy ?>No. 17:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 18, line 7, to delete &ldquo;union, or&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;union, or 15 per cent of the total gross loan book balance outstanding at that time in respect of all loans made by the credit union where written approval is received from the Bank, or&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 17, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised the Minister has not commented on the savings protection scheme, which is topical.  During the week the Minister stated that, with his EU colleagues, he is examining the deposit protection scheme that applies to other financial institutions.  My understanding is that the credit union savings protection scheme does not even go as far as the deposit protection scheme we are proposing to improve.  The upper limit of 90% up to &euro;20,000 applies to savings generally whereas the upper limit in the credit unions savings protection scheme is &euro;12,700, again at 90%.</P>
        <P>There are reasonable grounds for concern that the system is not transparent &mdash; the note I read described it as discretionary, so there is an element of discretion as to whether or when the protection scheme kicks in.  It is not a satisfactory position for credit union members that uncertainty persists regarding the savings protection scheme available to them, even in terms of whether 90% of their savings up to a value of &euro;12,700 would be guaranteed in the event that a credit union were to get into difficulties.  We should try to ensure credit union savers are offered the same protection as other savers.  There should be no uncertainty as to the savings protection scheme&rsquo;s ability to deliver if a credit union were to encounter problems.</P>
        <P>I am aware that discussions have been held on this important issue and that the Minister is trying to coax various parties to arrive at a solution that would satisfy the regulator, the Irish League of Credit Unions, which manages the savings protection scheme, and the breakaway group of credit <Col N="1621"/>unions, which may be more progressive or larger than the ILCU.  While I understand that this creates difficulties and historical and other issues need to be managed, the Minister must signal to all parties that a prompt resolution to this problem is required, particularly given that the Oireachtas, in good faith, is proposing to give additional powers to credit unions to enable them to develop and expand.  In return, we want the credit unions to offer protection to their savers and members.  I ask the Minister to comment.  He has indicated that progress has been made on the issue.</P>
        <P>I have not had sight of the guidance note the Minister read.  Equities are clearly a risky product, particularly for those who have invested in financial equities or Irish financial stocks, and securitised instruments have become a source of significant concern.  Does the guidance note address other, perhaps even more risky vehicles in which credit unions might consider investing?  In light of the experience of recent months, is there a case for issuing a revised guidance note to ensure credit unions have the best information available to the Minister and his advisers on these types of vehicles?  It has transpired that these instruments and vehicles are not as they were described by the rating agencies.  I understand, for example, that Ormond Quay was rated AAA, a better rating than that given to AIB or any other Irish bank.  It might be worth considering issuing revised guidance to credit unions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of events on the financial markets in recent months, why is it not appropriate to ask the Financial Regulator to check that the credit unions have, where necessary, responded appropriately to any exposure they may have had to investments?  The credit unions have had an extraordinary inflow of funds, particularly from SSIAs.  Many of them, specifically those associated with public services such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Revenue Commissioners and so forth, are large, well-run institutions.  However, smaller, local credit unions in towns, districts and parishes may not have available to them the same level of financial expertise available to the larger public service credit unions.  It is important, therefore, that all credit unions have access to the best possible advice on prudential matters, particularly as they are required to have high reserves and levels of investments and these must find a home.</P>
        <P>Various brokers have been engaged in intensive efforts to sell some of their products to credit unions.  Savers in credit unions should be given savings protection equal to that available to savers in commercial banks.  It is time the Minister arranged a review of the deposit and savings protection schemes.  This would strengthen our financial services regime and reduce the risk of savers having a bad experience.</P><Col N="1622"/>
        <P>The credit unions provide a great service and it is important that they maintain their strong role in future.  However, some of the change and turbulence in financial markets may expose a small number of them to excessive risk.  I hope the regulator of credit unions is in a position to offer up-to-date advice to the various credit unions.  Updating the guidance note issued at this time last year and introducing stronger protection schemes for savers and depositors would be an appropriate start.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated, the guidance note was issued in October 2006 because the regulator is mindful of all these issues.  The note is subject to regular review and consultation with the credit unions.  Each individual credit union is answerable to its membership through its board.  Annual meetings are held, financial reports are examined and approved and properly run credit unions confirm that they are in compliance with all aspects of the guidance and have a good relationship with the regulator.  From time to time, the Financial Regulator discusses the position in the credit union sector with me and the subject is one of the items on the agenda when the chairman of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, Mr. Patterson, comes to see me.  I am engaged in a process with the credit unions which is delivering progress and addressing long-standing issues.</P>
        <P>Regarding the question of the savings protection scheme, the credit unions point out that the ethos and philosophy of solidarity, which extends from one union to another and one set of members to another, will always ensure savings are covered.  By the same token, the regulator is anxious to ensure full legal clarity is brought to bear in respect of the scheme and that an appropriate response would emerge in the event that it was triggered.  As one will often hear from representatives of the credit unions, this is not an issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not been an issue thus far. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It may not have been a problem but it has become an issue.  A common approach must be adopted to ensure all parties are satisfied.  This is an ever-changing financial environment.  The reason the guidance was issued by the registrar in the first instance was that credit unions need to find an outlet for loans for the savings lodged with them, while ensuring the investments entered into are sensible and not subject to undue risk.  It emerged from dialogue with the credit unions &mdash; we did not take a top-down approach &mdash; that they believed that since the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority a one-size-fits-all approach had been adopted which did not taken into account the diversity and difference in scale and <Col N="1623"/>scope of these autonomous organisations.  It is to deal with the sensitivity of these issues that a dialogue has been established.  My Department and I have been engaged in this process and progress is being made.  While I would like the process to reach a conclusion, the approach we have adopted is much better than all the other options.</P>
        <P>The amendments in this section have been proposed as a result of a review of long-term lending.  The Department listened to the views of the Credit Union Advisory Committee, which is statutorily required to advise me in these matters.  Dialogue conducted between the Department, the credit union representative bodies and the Financial Regulator through the Registrar of Credit Unions is providing us with structured responses which show goodwill and will secure buy-in and ownership of the solutions to the problems as well as providing an agenda for expansion.  I have always made the point that I will show form where I must to bring about a greater sense of confidence to the effect that we are on the same page while insisting that the prudential issues be addressed.  This is the understanding in respect of our progress and the agenda items being ticked off.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS.</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment<?oasys _jy ?>No. 18:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 18, after line 15, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">18.&mdash;(1) The Insurance Act 1936 is amended by repealing sections 9 and 10.</P>
        <P LI="2">(2) The European Communities (Non-Life Insurance) Regulations 1976 (S.I. 115 of 1976) are consequentially amended by revoking paragraph (5) of Regulation 4.</P>
        <P LI="2">(3) The European Communities (Life Assurance) Regulations 1984 (S.I. 57 of 1984) are consequentially amended by revoking paragraph (4) of Regulation 4.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As I explained in the course of the instruction to committee motion, the provisions we propose to amend have no relevance to the current business environment and should be repealed.  I trust Deputies can accept the amendment.  Section 9 of the 1936 Act makes it an offence for a person to effect an insurance contract with a company not in the possession of an insurance licence.  Section 10 of the Act deems certain foreign companies and persons to be carrying on insurance business in Ireland in specified circumstances.</P>
        <P>Insurance industry representatives have brought to our attention their concerns about these provisions and their negative impact on the <Col N="1624"/>operation of international companies in Ireland.  Some of the negative impacts highlighted by industry include where a person returning to Ireland from outside the EU, but continuing to contribute to a savings product structured as a life insurance policy outside the EU, would commit an offence under section 9 as it stands.</P>
        <P>There are difficulties for international companies that wish to, for example, put together groupwide insurance policies for professional indemnity insurance, which raises the risk of an offence being committed through the application of section 10.  Section 10 has the unintended result of hampering the issuance of certain securities and excluding Irish investors from investing in securities in Ireland backed by monocline insurers.  Statutory provisions of 70 years standing are precluding people from doing their business in the normal way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no objection to the amendment.  Is the T&aacute;naiste removing the requirement of an insurance licence or is he making changes to accommodate the described anomalies, such as the person returning who is unable to continue with a savings product?  I presume there is still a requirement that the insurance company must be licensed somewhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  We are repealing sections 9 and 10 of the 1936 Act, the rest of which remains intact.</P>

        <P LI="4">(3) A condition or requirement imposed, or a direction given, under this section is an appealable decision for the purposes of Part VIIA of the Central Bank Act 1942.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The primary purpose of the substituted amendment to section 19 is to enable the Financial Regulator to regulate and oversee the conduct of business by firms in the non-deposit-taking lending sector that lend to the general public and small businesses.  Home reversion providers who provide funds in exchange for a future interest in property will be included in the regulatory regime.  Customers of these firms, which include those in the subprime consumer credit and mortgage lending markets, will benefit from the additional safeguards that the regulator&rsquo;s consumer protection code provides in the same as if they dealt with a regulated financial service provider.</P>
        <P>Under the proposed changes, all non-deposit-taking lenders engaged in retail lending will be brought within the regulator&rsquo;s authorisation and ongoing supervision regime by way of an amendment to Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997.  Any firm with business including lending to the public, that is, individuals and small firms, will be required to obtain an authorisation from the regulator.  This regime will apply to providers of finance based on home reversion agreements, which is not a form of credit but is similar in effect and purpose to a lifetime mortgage.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that the definition of a &ldquo;retail credit firm&rdquo; in this part of the amendment has the potential to create overlapping regulatory requirements for social finance lenders in view of the proposed regulation of charitable organisations under the Charities Bill 2007.  I intend to examine how to address this issue in the context of that Bill.</P>
 </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the core of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s new elements and warrants study.  Regarding the issue of being engaged in retail lending, would hedge funds be regulated?  Generally, they would purchase financial instruments that would not be deemed retail.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1631"/>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s argument is that he is awaiting European legislation before regulating people who deal in securitised instruments of one sort or another that may be subject to questionable ratings.  Should people running hedge funds be authorised under some of the proposed elements, namely, probity, competence and adequate levels of experience and skill?  While the products might not be regulated or supervised and while we may be waiting for Europe and our colleagues to make a decision on regulating complex instruments, should we ensure people in the business of packaging or repackaging various instruments for resale or in the business of finding people to take them are supervised by some of these<?oasys _jy ?>elements?</P>
        <P>The regulation envisaged relates to probity, adequate skill levels among staff, the requirement to provide information and the conduct of business, but is there a prudential oversight?  As businesses will be under the credit control, their suitability must be tested, but how does the regulation in question compare to the regulation of a deposit-taking financial institution, what has been left out and why?  I would like to see the checklist of what will and will not apply so I might understand the reasoning behind the obligations imposed or not imposed on non-deposit institutions or required of banks.</P>
        <P>We should not revisit this matter in some years time.  As this Bill has been introduced as a resubmit to committee, there has not been an opportunity for the Opposition and certainly me to avail of external expertise in considering these issues.  I will take many of the provisions on faith and we are dealing with the Bill rapidly.  Will the Minister expand further on the form of regulation, what he believes is important and <i>vice versa</i>?</P>
        <P>It is natural that there are transitional arrangements, but has the T&aacute;naiste assessed how quickly the various new authorisation requirements can be rolled out under these arrangements?  Has planning been started to ensure there is no hiatus in respect of the institutions during the transitional period?  I am conscious of time.</P>

	<P>The amendment does not refer to farms, farmland or borrowing through non-regulated companies.  These are significant issues for many farming families.  Through inappropriate borrowing and vehicles, they can lose their farms.  The reversion provision mentions individual domestic homes, but not farms or farmlands.</P>
        <P>Some years ago, it emerged that a company called Chesterton Finance had a chequered history.  The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s note refers to individuals and small firms, but I do not know whether people engaged in agricultural trades and farming fall <Col N="1632"/>under that category.  It is important that farmers are protected by this legislation.</P>

        <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">To delete all the words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>

	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Connor might start a new Tallaght strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd in a moment.  I had an opportunity to speak last night, so I do not wish to repeat my contribution.  I thank the Opposition spokesperson for introducing this motion and I am always happy to applaud the efforts of Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd.  We have both survived an onslaught by Fine Gael candidates to return here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am sorry the Minister for Transport is not here because I would like to compliment him on his efforts.  I am glad the Opposition benches were full of praise for the Minister this morning.  Since the introduction in July 2006 of legislation to allow for the commencement of mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints, more than 30,000 drivers have been tested per month.  This, alongside a significant increase in high-visibility enforcement, has resulted in 90 fewer deaths on the roads <Col N="1634"/>to the end of July 2007 compared to the same period last year.</P>
        <P>According to a report recently published by the European Transport Safety Council, Ireland has improved its road safety standing in Europe.  We have climbed four places in the past year to become the 12th lowest for road deaths per million in population of the 29 countries surveyed.  The report also shows that road deaths in Ireland have decreased since 2001.</P>
        <P>I have been stopped on three occasions at alcohol testing checkpoints on the Tallaght bypass.  I was happy to co-operate, although on one occasion the garda manning the checkpoint was somewhat startled.  Possibly due to the sad life I lead, the test result revealed a zero level of alcohol on every occasion.</P>
        <P>The Minister has announced that existing legislation will be amended to allow for compulsory roadside alcohol testing of drivers involved in serious accidents.  This important development is a priority for the Government.  I took my time coming into town this morning so that I could spend some time in Tallaght village and Firhouse, where I spoke with constituents about this issue.  The reaction was very positive and people generally accepted the proposals.  However, certain difficulties may arise in respect of the measure.  Reference was made in the Minister&rsquo;s statement to testing when people are clearly injured.  I also ask for clarification on whether proper resources and services will be put in place to facilitate situations in which people are brought to a Garda station as a result of a refusal to be breathalysed on site.</P>
        <P>The issue of driver testing remains to be addressed.  Statistics have been proffered with regard to the difficulties we continue to face in that regard.  It is a long time since I passed my driving test.  I do not mind admitting that I failed it on my first attempt and I am not even sure if I passed on my second.  It is healthy to have a reasonable failure rate because passing the test should be difficult.  I am anxious, however, that all our major population centres have sufficient resources to ensure waiting times are kept under control.  Last night, I outlined the problems that arose in Tallaght in regard to accommodation and I ask the Minister to ensure these challenges are overcome.  I also noted that people in places such as Shankill were sent to Naas rather than Bray, where they wanted to go.</P>
        <P>I am within my time, so the Leas-Cheann Comhairle should not panic.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the initiative on the part of Fine Gael and, like the previous speaker, I am interested in finding out what will happen at 8.30 p.m.  I would like to think that consensus will be reached on all sides of the House on the spirit, if not the text, of the motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We can do a great deal in the area of road safety but we need to grasp the nettle.  Testing for alcohol at the scene of accidents represents a significant step forward.  I pay tribute to Susan Gray and Public Against Road Carnage on the work they have done to draw attention to the issue.  Some weeks ago at our get-together in County Wicklow, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, met Ann Fogarty.  The sad reality of the impact of deaths on the roads on families should make us realise the need to work together on reducing road fatalities.</P>
        <P>I hold views that may be unpopular, such as believing that speed limits should be examined and, in some cases, dramatically reduced.  Speed is one of the major killers on the roads, irrespective of the use of drugs or alcohol.  We should be moving towards zero tolerance of drink driving because even a small amount of alcohol changes our abilities and impairs judgment.  We should consider the vision zero strategy adopted in Sweden, which shows the way forward in terms of zero alcohol limits for drivers.</P>
        <P>The new road safety manual would be daunting to somebody with a doctorate, let alone ordinary punters trying to get their driving licences.  It is 260 pages in length and is difficult for those with a good knowledge of English to understand, never mind the tens of thousands of people who have come to our shores and are seeking driving licences.  Back in my day the manual was about 30 pages long and we should consider a plain language version to ensure there is an easier way to learn the basic rules of the road.</P>
        <P>We should also consider other areas.  Speed cameras are important but, rather than have them at a smattering of locations around the country, they should be privatised so the private sector can achieve the results we want, which is every driver obeying speed limits.  This is not rocket science and it has a huge role to play.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some weeks ago I was in a car with a friend of mine and it had a global positioning system, GPS, that could tell him when he broke the speed limit &mdash; not that he did.  It was invaluable to see how technology can remind drivers to drive safely.  In urban areas we must consider further reductions in speed limits so that children can use our roads safely.  One of the biggest inhibitors to parents allowing children to walk or cycle to school is the perception of a lack of road safety.  We should free up public spaces, roads and streets to a point that allows children to feel safe crossing residen<Col N="1636"/>tial streets.  We have curtailed children and limited them to back gardens in recent years and this is not a good way forward.  The road safety school in Clontarf was closed and that is a huge loss.  We must find better ways to integrate road safety with the curriculum at secondary level.</P>
        <P>To return to the thrust of the motion, mandatory testing of drivers involved in road accidents is the way forward and the Government&rsquo;s announcement today is welcome.  The time and effort Fine Gael put into this motion has undoubtedly assisted in getting the response from Government that, I think, will please Fine Gael.  This motion is timely.  The carnage on our roads has reduced in recent years but it is still utterly unacceptable and there will be harsh and unpopular choices to be made if the death toll is to be further reduced.  I am referring to the issues of speed cameras, speed limits and the lowering of blood alcohol levels that are necessary and vital to reduce the carnage on our roads.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate because it affects us all as road users, whether motorists, pedestrians, cyclists or people involved in road accidents.  It is incumbent on all of us to strive to introduce new and amending legislation regularly to address the issues that arise relating to road safety.  It is good to have a unanimous, cross-party approach on this rather than be seen to be divided on this important matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has improved its road safety standing in Europe according to a new report published by the European Transport Safety Council and has climbed four places in the past year to 12th of the 29 EU countries surveyed.  The report also shows that road deaths in Ireland have dropped by 11% since 2001.  It is a very positive report and shows that Ireland is making considerable progress in reducing road deaths.  The report tracked Ireland&rsquo;s progress up to 31 December 2006 and the downward trend in road deaths has continued in 2007.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing, the doubling of penalties for drink driving offences, the computerisation of penalty points, the introduction of penalty points for mobile phone offences and the establishment of the Road Safety Authority there has been a 25% drop in deaths, which translates into 100 lives saved on our roads.  There have been 19 fewer fatalities on our roads to date this year than to the same date in 2006.</P>
        <P>The report acknowledges that road users in Ireland have changed their behaviour on the roads and this translates to lives saved and injuries prevented.  Irish roads are safer and steadily improving.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are discussing the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing but I driver behaviour is key to this issue.  We must also consider public awareness campaigns because they are essential.  Publicity campaigns are aimed at young drivers and <Col N="1637"/>in Hospital, in my home county of Limerick, the transition year students at John the Baptist community school have been very involved in promoting a road safety initiative.  The students have named it the drive to stay alive road safety campaign and it could be replicated in every secondary school in the country.  These are the drivers of the future and statistics show that young male drivers are involved in most fatal accidents.  Public awareness campaigns promoted through schools and geared at those about to commence driving should be considered more.  This could be achieved through road safety officers who work in local authorities because they track accidents, locations and statistics and have the systems to do so.  We must bring local authorities into the debate in this regard.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the example in Limerick because it has merit.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s initiative to amend the legislation to allow for the compulsory roadside testing of drivers, subject to overriding medical circumstances.  There will be some debate around what constitutes overriding medical circumstances and the relevant authorities that deal with accidents will have to use their judgment.  More clarity is needed on this issue.  Will the debate then move on to testing for drugs?  This introduces new aspects to the debate because there is the issue of prescribed medicine and how it impacts on driver behaviour.</P>
        <P>I welcome this debate and the announcement of the amendment to legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the raising of this important issue but there seems to be differences in the contributions of those who wish to discuss politics and those who wish to engage in politics.  I was disappointed at the emphasis on U-turns in the opening contribution and the later call for a ministerial resignation that seemed entirely inappropriate to the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a positive suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The commitment made by the Taoiseach during the election campaign is being adopted and delivered but it is absolutely proper for a Government Minister to pause for consideration and proper deliberation regarding anything said during an election campaign, even by the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>When I took part in the general election in 2002 and entered the Oireachtas five years ago road safety was one of the major issues that needed to be tackled, given the horrific and unacceptable number of accidents.  The other major policy issue in the general area of road transport was the cost of motor insurance and, happily, according to a report in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> yesterday, there has been reduction of around 40% in the cost of insurance through the work of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB</P><Col N="1638"/>
        <P>We have made a more limited impact on road safety.  While it is good the number of deaths decreased by 10% between 2001 and 2006, much more should be done.  The Minister pointed out that death rates are down 25% for the first 12 months of mandatory testing.  There is no doubt the Garda Traffic Corps has been a success and is a noticeable presence.  I was mandatorily tested in Donegal in August on my way back from the McGill summer school to a hotel in Donegal town.  Although I am 60 years of age, this was the first time ever I was breathalysed.  I was not terribly good at it, but Members will be pleased to hear no alcohol level showed up.  This is an area where public representatives need to set a good example.</P>
        <P>Like others, I welcome mandatory testing in crash situations, despite the practical questions raised which must be worked out in legislation.  I noticed the Garda representative welcomed this provision this morning on the grounds that if it is established in principle, this makes the test much less invidious in such situations.  When discussing more draconian measures, we need to bring the public with us.  It was suggested earlier this evening that we should introduce a zero drink level.</P>
        <P>There would be public resistance to the privatisation of speed cameras.  I would resist it.  People need to feel a measure is in the public interest rather than having a monetary aspect to privatisation of speed cameras.  I have reservations about the privatisation of this process, although I accept this may happen.</P>
        <P>One simple measure could make a significant difference to road safety and the cost would be negligible, namely publication of lists of people, by county, who have been found and convicted of drink driving.  This policy works well with regard to Revenue offences and I am surprised it has not been extended to other areas.  Drink driving is a more serious offence than whether people have paid their TV licence.</P>
        <P>As soon as the technology is perfected, drug testing must be integrated into all mandatory testing.  Perhaps we should also make more use of the driving ban, because it is a significant deterrent to the many people who cannot afford to lose their licences because they would thereby lose their livelihoods.</P>
        <P>We had much discussion before the election on the social aspect of testing and social life in rural areas and the need to organise collective car transport and late night buses.  I am surprised by the resistance of people to going into a pub and drinking alcohol substitutes or minerals.  I was impressed a year or so ago when I visited a pub in the country after a new Fianna F&aacute;il chairman of the county council had been elected.  The pub was quite inaccessible without transport and I was impressed that at least half of the drinks being drunk were minerals.</P>

	<P>Road investment has an important part to play.  The segregation of traffic leads to fewer deaths and less frustration.  We have high volumes of traffic on what used to be high grade single carriageways and this is one reason sceptics were convinced of the need for the N8 upgrade.  I think particularly of the stretch between Cahir and Mitchelstown, where two or three years ago there was a horrific accident involving a woman and two children.  There has been a resistance campaign to the upgrade, on the grounds that the traffic volumes do not justify it.  Road safety considerations are also important rather than just traffic volumes.  Mention of Mitchelstown brings to mind the fatal accident that took place in the past couple of weeks on the single carriageway bypass on the west side of the town.</P>
        <P>The road safety campaign advertisements which aim to achieve a shock impact look effective to me.  At the same time, all our towns are full of boy racers who do not seem to keep to the speed limits, particularly late at night.</P>
        <P>Public transport is important when discussing road safety.  The risk of accident is far lower for those who travel on public transport, particularly for long journeys.  I was in Galway for a speaking engagement on Monday night.  If the western rail corridor had been completed, I would have travelled on it, but I was glad to see, as I was crossing the level crossing at Craughwell that machinery and crew were working on the project.  This morning I had cause for frustration when using public transport.  In order to attend the Forum on Europe at Dublin Castle, I drove to the Luas Sandyford car park, which has 600 spaces, but it was already full.  It is a serious problem that parking capacity is not available for those who want to use public transport.</P>
        <P>Fatigue is, undoubtedly, a problem.  We have been too slow in providing exits and service areas for motorways.  I wonder why there is such reluctance to provide these services and suspect it may be because some deals were done with towns along the way when they were bypassed so they would not resist the new roads if services were not provided.  It is clear more needs to be done, but I am glad we are making some progress.</P>

	<P>It is great to know that shaking a hand on a deal still stands.  I congratulate Susan Gray and all the members of PARC for ensuring this policy was announced by <Col N="1640"/>the Minister.  Fifteen months ago, Fine Gael announced a simple six-point plan, part of which involved the setting up of an investigation unit to investigate every accident location so people would understand on the conclusion of the investigation why their loved ones died.  It is good to know that if someone is killed or injured in an accident, we will now know whether it is drink related.  The Government has yet to tackle other issues.  I hope it does not take another 15 months for it to act on them.</P>
        <P>Do people realise that we have had six great months this year in terms of road deaths?  There was a massive campaign, which had the support of every party, to cut the number of road deaths.  We backed everything the Government has done in this regard.  Last year I found it frustrating that any measure we came up with was shot down, which is the reason I want to push forward one or two more.  There has been a 36% increase in road deaths in the past two months in comparison to last year.  In the past four months, 116 people were killed on our roads compared to 111 in the previous four months.  Those are Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na figures.  We must ask ourselves what has happened in the past four months.  Has the campaign gone dry or, as another speaker rightly said about the young boy racers who are being killed and who are more noticeable on our roads in the past two or three months in every parish &mdash; I see them in my parish &mdash; have we lost the fight or are we losing the momentum?  Susan Gray has performed a good job in ensuring that one aspect of this has taken place.</P>
        <P>I was not here yesterday because I had given a commitment to go to Donegal, as I did last year, to witness a show that was put on by the road safety working group in Donegal, which consisted of representatives of every aspect of road safety, the Road Safety Authority, AXA Insurance, Eamon Browne, a fantastic road safety officer in Donegal, and the members of the council from all parties.  Approximately 1,500 17 year old students and their teachers witnessed a live show on what has happened in Donegal and in every county.  A doctor spoke about what he had witnessed.  Representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the ambulance drivers outlined their experience of having to inform parents that their child was dead.  At the end of the show a mother who lost her daughter spoke and, finally, a young man who survived an accident caused by speed &mdash; there is a picture of him in today&rsquo;s newspaper &mdash; came out in a wheelchair and pleaded with the young people never to drink and drive, speed or get into a car with somebody without putting on their safety belt.  Three shows were put on for 1,500 students from throughout Donegal in a fantastic new leisure centre in Letterkenny, which I would love to see in every county in Ireland.  One by one those students walked out in silence when the show was over.</P>
        <P>I ask the Ministers opposite to ask the<?oasys _jy ?>Ministers for Transport  and Education and<?oasys _jy ?><Col N="1641"/>Science to get a copy of the video of that show and send it to every school, particularly so that 17 and 18 year old students will see it.  My motto on road safety is simple, educate and implement the law.  I was happy to hear previous speakers talk about education.  The one measure Fine Gael wants implemented, to follow on from what the Ministers said yesterday, is that our young people are shown how to drive their cars.  We must provide centres for that here, as they have in other areas.  It is fine for our students to get seven As and three Bs in their leaving or junior certificate examinations but what we must do is teach them to get from A to B safely.  The only way we will do that is to show our young people how to drive a car and then not to be afraid to implement the law.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that the show put on in Donegal is shown to every student in Ireland.  Fingal County Council, my county, Meath, and Mayo are the only four counties with a road safety officer.  It should be compulsory that every county has a road safety officer in the county council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; motion.  Road safety is of critical importance to everybody in this State.  I offer my sympathy to all families who have lost a loved one on our roads.  In my constituency in County Clare, the late William Ryan of Ennis sadly lost his life earlier this week and will be laid to rest tomorrow.</P>
        <P>This debate must bring about change.  I welcome the establishment of the Road Safety Authority, but the Government must provide the necessary funding and resources to tackle the daily horror of deaths on our roads.  It is through education in our schools that we can address this problem.  We must adopt a new approach to engage with young people in particular to improve safety on our roads.</P>
        <P>An Irish school of excellence has been set up in Ennis, County Clare, to address directly the issue of road safety.  This programme consists of 36 periods of classroom instruction and at least 12 driving lessons.  This new approach is being spearheaded by Mr. Kieran O&rsquo;Brien, a native of Clarecastle, County Clare.  Year one of the programme runs from September to the end of the school term and focuses on preparing students to take the driver theory test.  It also involves talks with the Road Safety Authority, the garda&iacute; and the insurance industry.  Year two has a more practical emphasis, with students taking between 15 and 18 driving tests and lessons.  Victims of road traffic accidents also contribute to the curriculum.  That hands-on approach to practical learning and the shared experience of victims of road traffic accidents is having a real impact on young drivers.  It is the way forward.  Twenty schools throughout Clare, Limerick and Galway partici<Col N="1642"/>pate in this programme but, unfortunately, the State does not recognise it.  It is not funded and it is not resourced.  I appeal to the Minister to seriously examine that initiative with a view to rolling it out in all schools.</P>
        <P>The conditions of our roads, secondary roads in particular, are a central factor in road traffic accidents.  I refer in particular to poor road surfaces, signage and drainage, bad road markings and bends, poor sight distances at junctions, limited traffic calming measures, the absence of hedge cutting and inappropriate speed limits.  Time and again these issues are raised at council level throughout the country and we are told that there are insufficient resources available.  That is the standard answer.  Local authorities need a clear direction from the Minister to carry out an audit of those accident black spots.  Areas must be identified and money allocated to address each individual case, electoral area by electoral area.</P>
        <P>We need a dramatic improvement in safety at our schools.  When a new school is built or refurbished, the planning requirements provide for proper set down and pick up facilities but what about existing schools?  I have raised here the necessity to provide set down and pick up areas at all schools in County Clare.  For example, Newmarket-on-Fergus and Doolin national schools are crying out for better parking facilities.  They have made applications to the Department of Education and Science and each time are turned down because of lack of funding, and they have been turned down on appeal.  This is a standard requirement that must be introduced.  People must be able to drop off their children in safety at their school.  A prototype of a set down and pick up facility should be designed for all schools.  I encourage the Minister to give serious consideration to that.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s change of heart on mandatory alcohol testing at accident sites.  I support the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd on this important motion, which I support, and welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.</P>
        <P>Research by the Road Safety Authority on alcohol related road fatalities in 2003 showed that many surviving drivers were untested.  The survey suggests that alcohol was a factor in at least 34% of fatal accidents.  Given that many drivers have not been tested, the true figure for serious road accidents could be significantly higher.  The testing currently carried out does not take into account drug abuse, which is an important factor that could add further to the statistics.  As one who has witnessed the pain and distress caused by the consequences of death and serious injury directly related to alcohol impaired driving, I understand the sense of frustration felt by those who campaigned for the introduction of compulsory alcohol testing for drivers involved in accidents.</P><Col N="1643"/>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s climb-down on this crucial issue is a welcome victory for families and campaigners who have lost loved ones to road deaths.  I pay tribute to the Public Against Road Carnage group and the family members involved in that group, including the Leonard and McSharry families in my constituency who have argued passionately for the introduction of this measure.  They have succeeded in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The absence of this safe driving enforcement measure meant that some people&rsquo;s decision to drink and drive was not tested.  The Taoiseach recognised the anger and distress this has caused when in April he made a written promise to introduce compulsory drink and drug testing for drivers involved in accidents causing injury.  From a Fine Gael perspective, it is a matter of some satisfaction that as result of our motion, the Government has decided to honour the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment to introduce this measure.  I say to the Minister for Transport that making a U-turn on a busy road is risky.  We have stopped the traffic, however, so the Minister can safely make his standard three point turn and join the traffic flow heading in the right direction.</P>
        <P>The deterrent effect of the legal guarantee of a compulsory alcohol test for those involved in accidents will go some way to reducing the carnage on our roads.  The results from this testing will help to ensure a measure of justice for those who lose loved ones as a result of the irresponsible behaviour of alcohol-impaired drivers.  I see no obstacle to the legal situation providing for compulsory drink and drug testing for drivers involved in accidents causing injury, especially if a death has occurred, while still permitting garda&iacute; a degree of discretion in the practical enforcement of the provision.  I cannot see any reason this change cannot be introduced before Christmas, the worst time of the year for alcohol-impaired driving.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Road safety and the reduction of death and serious injury on our roads are important and I call on the Minister for Transport to introduce legislation as quickly as possible.  This week it was said this may take six months but emergency legislation has been rushed in overnight in cases where there was a financial consequence for the Exchequer.  It is disappointing that the Minister has indicated it will take 24 weeks to introduce this essential legislation and that it will not give any discretion to the garda&iacute;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many inherent dangers on the roads.  The number of cars has doubled in the past decade but we are still significantly behind Britain and continental Europe in terms of car ownership.  With the doubling of the number of cars on the road, however, we have not doubled the level of personal responsibility.  People continue to drive without exercising a duty of care to others; if anything, the level of duty is lowering.  Road deaths <Col N="1644"/>are up 35% on this time last year.  The public must slow down, stop drinking and driving and, at some stage, appreciate that the number of people losing their lives on our roads is no longer acceptable.</P>
        <P>Drop-off points for schools receive little attention.  Speaking as the father of young children, the Department of Education and Science and local authorities are not putting enough resources into correctly designed and constructed drop-off points for children at almost every school I drive past.  Children must be dropped off and collected safely.  The Department must realise how important this is, although it also involves the Departments of Transport and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities.  No one wants to take charge; everyone wants to leave it to someone else.  Along with public and personal responsibility lies departmental responsibility.  At some stage, someone must grasp the nettle and introduce a formula for a standard set-down area that can be implemented countrywide.  Set-down areas are vital for the proper development of our educational facilities.</P>
        <P>The Government and the NRA must also accept responsibility for the development of the new main arteries.  I have advocated the construction of a new section of the N11.  The existing section between the Arklow and Bray bypasses is the most dangerous single carriageway in the State, it has become a killing zone.  Many lives have been lost there in recent years, one of the fatalities being an Oireachtas Member, Senator Michael Enright of the Labour Party.  A total of 78 people have been killed on the N11 in the past decade, with 23 killed on that small 15 km section.  In Transport 21, funds were allocated for these works but they have not been prioritised.  The Government must step forward and instruct the NRA that there is a compelling argument in favour of the works on that section of road to bring it up to an acceptable standard, either motorway or dual carriageway.  This decision will save the lives of many of the thousands of commuters from north Wexford and south Wicklow who use this dangerous road every day.</P>
        <P>Another question we must ask is why so many young male drivers are losing their lives on our roads between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. at weekends.  The statistics must be analysed to ensure the necessary measures are taken, no matter how harsh they are for young male drivers.  The slaughter cannot be allowed to continue in this demographic group.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s agreement to compulsory testing of individuals involved in accidents.  Unfortunately, drink driving will continue as long as any ambiguity exists.  We must remove this ambiguity and the only way to do so is to allow no alcohol at all.  The easiest and safest way to deal with drink driving is to disallow it completely.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1645"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Government U-turn on this matter.  Where it follows policies that will improve road safety, health or other areas, Fine Gael will support it.  It is interesting to note that the Minister for Transport spoke in June about Garda discretion in road<?oasys _jy ?>side testing and did not propose to alter the position.</P>
        <P>Road deaths have risen by 35% in the past two months, with 371 drink driving incidents between 1 and 7 October.  Fine Gael attempted to introduce compulsory alcohol testing in the Roads Bill 2007 but that was rejected by the Government.  Some of the arguments offered were that tests might cause a delay in treatment but that was never going to be the case.  Road deaths have been reduced in France by 10.9% and in Portugal by 42%.  This Government has talked tough for some time but it is not fulfilling its promises or taking action.</P>
        <P>North Dublin has seen its population increase by 22% with the number of cars and car usage rising accordingly.  Alcohol consumption at home has increased, with more people buying alcohol in off licences, supermarkets and garages.  We must drive home the message that alcohol and driving will not be tolerated in our society.  If a serious accident or incident occurs, there must be repercussions and prosecution in the event of the driver having consumed alcohol and being over the limit.  There can be no ambiguity in this regard, particularly when the consequences are increased numbers of fatalities on our roads.</P>
        <P>As a GP I have unfortunately seen the harsh reality of families robbed of loved ones due to alcohol-related road traffic accidents.  Why was the Government so reluctant to introduce this road safety measure?  Does it have anything to do with the shortage of garda&iacute; and the Government doubting the force&rsquo;s ability to enforce compulsory alcohol testing as a result of it not providing the necessary manpower?  Despite the huge increase in population in north Dublin, the number of garda&iacute; has not increased.</P>
        <P>Besides the human cost in terms of suffering as a result of road traffic accidents, countless millions are lost in compensation, insurance costs and the use of hospital resources.  Any measure that will reduce the number and seriousness of accidents is welcome.</P>
        <P>It was mentioned that it will take six months to introduce this legislation.  The only silver lining to that cloud is that it will afford the Minister the opportunity to introduce drug screening at the scene of accidents also.  There are strips available and it is unacceptable to say this is technically not possible.  I have personally used these kits in my work in an institution in north Dublin.  While such tests do not quantify the amount of drugs in one&rsquo;s system, they detect their presence.  That alone will render a driver&rsquo;s actions illegal.  The fear that one can be caught and will be detected is a major deterrent in the same way as the Christmas campaigns run by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na keep many <Col N="1646"/>people off the road who would otherwise drink and drive.  All that is required is the political will and the resources to achieve such an objective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the motion and compliment Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd on having tabled it.  A few years ago, this measure was proposed as a Fine Gael policy by Deputy McEntee.  It is not often that Mayo people compliment Meath people, but I am glad to do so on this occasion.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s acceptance, even at this late stage, of the need for compulsory breath testing for drivers involved in traffic accidents.  Most other European countries, along with our neighbours in Northern Ireland, already have such measures in place.  It should never have been argued that it was difficult to implement these tests because they might prevent medical attention from being administered to injured parties.  Compulsory breath testing should not interfere in any way with medical assistance and this can be easily accommodated in new legislation.  </P>
        <P>There is no doubt that such legislation will help to make our roads safer but we still have a long way to go to catch up with the improvements made in countries such as Portugal, where there has been a 42% reduction in road accidents, and France which has recorded a drop of 42.3%.  It is worrying that our August-September figures have shown a 35% increase on the same period last year.  Much more needs to be done if we are to avoid paying lip-service to road safety.</P>
        <P>As well as drink driving, speeding remains one of the major causes of death on our roads and in this context speed limits should be seriously re-examined.  On dual-carriageways the limit can be as low as 60 km/h or 80 km/h, while a 100 km/h limit may apply on narrow roads.  Common sense does not operate in this regard.  The enforcement of speed limits must be designed to prevent accidents rather than just collect fines.  There are few speed checks on narrow, winding secondary roads that can be death traps.</P>
        <P>Education plays a major part in reducing the carnage on our roads but that education should be resourced to a far better degree.  For instance, there is a pilot road safety module in transition year.  Teachers can teach such matters in theory but modules need to be resourced so that expert instructors can teach driving while engendering the right attitude among young drivers.  This needs to be done quickly.  The transition year module should be rolled out to every secondary school in the country.</P>
        <P>I congratulate those county councils which have appointed dedicated road safety officers.  In Mayo we are very aware of the dangers on our roads thanks to the work of an innovative road safety officer who has brought safety to the top of the agenda.  Every morning on local radio one can hear what he has done, including the day-lighted campaign whereby dipped headlights are left on during daylight hours.  That can reduce <Col N="1647"/>collisions by up to 20%.  Crashed cars are put on display in garage forecourts to remind drivers of the dangers involved.  The driving safety roadshows, to which Deputy McEntee referred, started in Mayo.  Earlier this year, the leaving certificate results contained a road safety message for students.</P>
        <P>Road design and signage are also important when it comes to promoting safety.  I have seen numerous side roads and secondary roads that have been resurfaced but while the roads may be improved, the hard shoulders are death traps.  Road signage must be clearly visible and motorists must heed such signs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleagues for sharing time and giving me an opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I welcome the motion tabled by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, which has necessitated a response from the Minister.  He has acknowledged our concerns to some degree.  However, I have difficulty with the fact that discretion is allowed to garda&iacute; in respect of testing drivers at the scene of an accident.  I respectfully suggest that garda&iacute; do not have the medical capacity to make a judgment as to whether of not those involved in road accidents should be tested.  I hope that situation will change.  </P>
        <P>Many simple and inexpensive items could be introduced if the various Departments and agencies concerned, including the National Roads Authority, were willing to do so.  While we have received some data on road accidents from the NRA, it has taken too long to obtain such data in certain cases.  For example, the NRA was requested, begged and implored for 12 years to change the alignment and speed limits on the N6 from Aughrim to Cappataggle.  However, the NRA only responded following the black cross campaign by families who had lost loved ones on that stretch of road.  The authority said repeatedly that it could not reduce the speed limit on that national primary route, although it eventually did reduce it to 50 km/h.</P>
        <P>The NRA also said it could not introduce warning signage because it might lead to difficulties in legal cases, but it eventually did so when forced into it.  The authority also said it could not provide a double white line for such a long stretch of national primary road, yet it eventually did so.  Many deaths could have been avoided but for the NRA&rsquo;s intransigence in responding to such local needs.  The irony is that the NRA bought land to bypass that stretch of road, but that purchase proved to be futile.  The authority spent &euro;250,000 compensating the farmers involved but the land was left idle and has now reverted to its owners.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is still not enforcing pub closing hours.  Most road accidents occur from Thursday night to Monday morning.  However, garda&iacute; are passing public houses in rural and urban areas knowing quite well that after-hours drinking is continuing on licensed <Col N="1648"/>premises.  There is an obligation on publicans to adhere to specified pub closing times, which should be enforced by garda&iacute;.  The Minister of State can smile if he wishes.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, I wish to thank Deputies for their constructive contributions to an interesting debate on the important subject of road safety and, in particular, roadside breath testing at the scene of collisions.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In recent years, Ireland has changed in many ways and we have certainly seen a welcome change in attitudes to drink driving.  A few years ago, the former Minister and Deputy, Michael Smith, had to endure abuse when he sought to change the rules on drink driving.  Thankfully, however, that climate has changed and people realise that far too many people are dying unnecessarily on our roads.  As a result, they are prepared to accept new and tougher laws.  With some small changes we could make a significant impact on the number of people dying on our roads.  The Minister&rsquo;s announcement is part of several measures the Government is taking.  I acknowledge the contribution of the Opposition to the debate and the proposals it has presented.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and I have listened with care to the views expressed by those who spoke in the House and I take this opportunity to respond briefly to some of those views.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>Several Deputies welcomed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the effect that the Department of Transport proposes to engage with the Office of the Attorney General to establish how the current legislation can be amended to achieve roadside testing of drivers involved in serious collisions subject to overriding medical circumstances.  This does not represent a U-turn.  The Minister merely seeks to strengthen legislation which has been in place since 2003.  The Road Traffic Act 2003 provides that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may require a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle to provide a preliminary breath specimen where the vehicle is involved in a road collision.  Although Garda discretion exists, the Department of Transport is aware that the Garda authorities have issued directions to the effect that it is expected that all drivers involved in serious road traffic collisions are <Col N="1649"/>breath tested subject to overriding medical circumstances.  Members have mentioned particular medical circumstances and it is important to clarify this point and that there is no uncertainty about those circumstances.</P>
        <P>In recent years, there have been calls for the introduction of mandatory roadside testing where a collision has taken place.  In light of this, the Minister proposes that his officials engage with the Office of the Attorney General to establish how the current legislation can be amended to achieve roadside testing of drivers involved in serious collisions subject to overriding medical circumstances.  Deputies O&rsquo;Dowd and &Oacute; Snodaigh have referred to the position in Northern Ireland.  The legal position here is the same as that in Northern Ireland and the UK.  There is a perception among many Deputies that the Garda need to form an opinion that an intoxicant has been consumed in advance of administering a roadside breath test at the scene of a collision.  This is not the case and has not been since 2003.</P>
        <P>There are four situations in which the Garda can administer a roadside breath test, where the member of the Garda forms an opinion that an intoxicant has been consumed, where a road traffic collision has taken place, where a road traffic offence has been committed and where a mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, checkpoint has been set up.  There is therefore no requirement to form an opinion that an intoxicant has been consumed where a collision has taken place.</P>
        <P>Several Deputies referred to the issue of drug driving.  It is illegal to drive while under the influence of drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of a vehicle.  The Road Traffic Acts provide that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may, where he or she is of the opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of that vehicle, require that person to go to a Garda station and further require that person to submit a blood test or to provide a urine sample.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety analyses blood and urine specimens received under the Road Traffic Acts for the presence of a drug or drugs.</P>
        <P>As the Minister for Transport stated last night, the Department of Transport will keep under review the development of technology internationally for roadside testing for drugs.  There is no reliable equipment available at present for that purpose.  When suitable technology becomes available, any measures applied to the roadside testing of drivers for alcohol will also be applied for drugs.</P>
        <P>Deputies McHugh, Deenihan and &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to the importance of road safety education for young people.  Members of the Seanad made this point when I was there earlier this <Col N="1650"/>evening.  The Road Safety Authority has been mandated with responsibility for road safety education and advertising and has developed a range of initiatives in this regard.  It recently revealed that men aged between 17 and 25 are seven times more likely to die on our roads than anyone else.  For every kilometre driven, a 17 year old male is eight times more likely than a middle-aged man to be involved in a crash.</P>
        <P>There is a consensus that young people can underestimate danger while driving and overestimate their driving ability and skill.  Novice drivers do not have the same level of automated driving skills, which take time to develop, as more experienced drivers.  The lifestyle, values, peer group pressure and personality of young drivers are recognised to enter into the car with them to a much greater extent than with older drivers.  This factor increases driving risk among young people.  Young people are accordingly the target of much road safety effort in Ireland and other countries.  That effort is directed at encouraging young people to consider their attitudes and behaviour and the consequences of their actions as road users, especially as drivers.</P>
        <P>The recent all-Ireland anti-speeding campaign entitled Mess is a typical example of this targeted road safety educational effort.  It is a hard-hitting graphic message that targets speeding and young people, with all the implications for a driver who speeds and the consequences of such behaviour.  The advertisement vividly outlines the consequences of speeding by young drivers and asks young drivers to consider the damaging repercussions to other people&rsquo;s lives that are a direct result of the inappropriate speed at which many young drivers choose to drive.  The new road safety strategy which the Minister intends to launch shortly includes a range of new initiatives aimed at educating young drivers.</P>
        <P>Deputy Deenihan referred to the need for more joined-up thinking on road safety policy.  That is why the Road Safety Authority was established.  The Road Safety Authority is a single agency with responsibility for a wide range of functions which have a bearing on road safety and is in a unique position to co-ordinate and advance the road safety agenda through delivery of road safety programmes, such as testing of drivers and vehicles, driver education and the promotion of awareness of road safety in general.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to investigation of, and lack of information on, road collisions.  The primary immediate investigative role in respect of road collisions is vested in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Priority in such an investigation must be given to the determination of the causes of road collisions and in particular whether a breach of the road traffic laws contributed to the occurrence.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the body empowered to make such a determination and to launch criminal proceedings against any person whom the Garda <Col N="1651"/>considers should be accused of the commission of an offence.  Garda reports on these investigations are forwarded to the National Roads Authority and subsequently to each local authority for the purpose of establishing road collision trends and causes generally, and to facilitate the carrying out of remedial works relating to road infrastructure where such action is deemed to be necessary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Road Safety Authority now has responsibility for road safety research and statistical collection.  This will result in a more integrated approach to road safety policy generally, with one agency responsible for road safety research, statistical data, advertising, education and recommendations regarding road safety policy.</P><P Just="Left">Deputy Deenihan raised the issue of safety cameras.  The Minister outlined the position with regard to safety cameras last night.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for the tendering process for the engagement of private sector interests in the operation of speed cameras.  The request for tender to deploy and privatise the operation of safety cameras was issued and six companies were short-listed as part of that process.  These are being examined with a view to selecting the contractor by the end of this month.  National roll-out of the safety cameras will commence early next year.</P>
        <P>Deputies Broughan and O&rsquo;Dowd referred to the fact that the new road safety strategy, which covers the period 2007 to 2012, has not yet been published.  The Road Safety Authority was responsible for developing the new road safety strategy for the period 2007 to 2012.  It went out to public consultation in October last year and received many suggestions and proposals.  It also engaged in direct consultation with key stakeholders in December 2006.</P>
        <P>The Minister understands that the authority received in excess of 500 submissions from these processes, which had to be considered prior to the finalisation of the new strategy.  Due to the volume of submissions, this consideration took some time to complete and unfortunately coincided with a complete review of the rules of the road, which was published in March this year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Several Deputies referred to the need to improve road signage.  The legislative framework for the provision of traffic signs is set out in section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended.  The Road Traffic (Signs) Regulations 1997-2005 prescribe traffic signs, which include upright signs, road markings, traffic lights and other devices that may be<b> </b>provided on roads by road authorities, to indicate the existence of a road regulation, to implement such a regulation or to indicate the existence of a provision in an enactment relating to road traffic.  The provision of all traffic signs on non-national roads, which include regulatory signs and road markings, warn<Col N="1652"/>ing and information signs, is the responsibility of individual road authorities and, in the case of national roads and motorways, the National Roads Authority.  The traffic signs manual sets out comprehensive directions given to road authorities by the Minister for Transport, pursuant to section 95(16) of the Road Traffic Act 1961, regarding the provision and use of traffic signs.  A copy of the manual is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The Department of Transport is currently pursuing a detailed review of the present traffic signs manual in association with the National Roads Authority to identify any additions or revisions necessary.  It is intended that the use of the revised manual by road authorities will ensure a high quality of signage in the State, through uniformity of practice and the creation of a consistent approach to signing generally.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to extend my sympathy to the family of Kate Moyles and to those who were injured following the events of 27 March this year.  We are all familiar with families who have lost loved ones as a result of traffic accidents and who must suffer the devastation that follows.  I attended the funeral of the late Kate Moyles and saw at first hand the devastation caused, not just to her family but to her many friends and the wider community.  It is always that much more sad when a young person dies.  She was so bubbly and full of life and had such a future ahead of her.  She really died unnecessarily in what were freak weather conditions.  Many colleagues in this House referred to it and it came home to us all this week following the inquest, when we saw her sister, mother and father clinging on to a picture of their departed friend.  I am sure life will never be the same again for them.</P>
        <P>We are very honoured to represent people in here and it is important that we say to the Moyles family and to others who have lost loved ones that their deaths will not be in vain and that we will pursue every avenue we can to try to make roads in Ireland that much safer.  It is too late for these families but it is important that we look ahead and plan properly.</P>
        <P>Driver behaviour, especially inappropriate speeds in foggy conditions, has been suggested as one of the main contributors to the events in which Kate Moyles lost her life.  Drivers must take responsibility for their behaviour on our roads.  Notwithstanding any maximum speed limit that may be in force on any particular public road, the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 provide a general obligation on drivers to ensure that a vehicle is not driven at a speed exceeding that which will enable a driver to bring it to a halt within the distance which the driver can see to be clear.  This includes the requirement that drivers should maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of them, so that <Col N="1653"/>they can pull up safely if the vehicle in front slows down or stops suddenly.</P>
        <P>Some people may be in a better position to judge what happened on 27 March, but I think the fog was so bad that even if there were signs on the bridges that morning, it would have been almost impossible to see them.  I am sure that lessons will be learned and let us hope we can put new measures in place to prevent another terrible tragedy.  Meanwhile, the NRA is actively considering the deployment of ITS technology, including variable message signage, on the national roads network with a view to rolling it out on a phased basis.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd referred to the problems associated with endorsing penalty points to the driving licence record of one in every four drivers.  The latest statistics to the end of September this year show that 469,117 drivers have received penalty points to end September 2007, with 86 drivers currently on 12 points resulting in six months disqualification.  A total of 120,372 drivers come within the category of &ldquo;No Driver Number&rdquo;.  This category of drivers was originally intended for non-national drivers, as penalty points do not carry to jurisdictions outside the State, but it also applies to persons who at the time of incurring the points did not have a valid licence.  However, whenever they renew or obtain a licence, the points are then assigned to their licence record.  It also applies to persons where the national vehicle and driver file cannot ascertain the driver number of the offender.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Transport is conscious that enforcing penalties for road traffic offences on foreign registered drivers raises many legal, organisational and procedural issues, which make it very difficult for any one State to enforce such penalties.  For that reason, the Department of Transport is pursuing this question at the European, British-Irish and North-South levels where mutual recognition and cross border enforcement possibilities are under consideration.</P>
        <P>Once again, on behalf of the Minister, I thank Deputies for their constructive contributions to this important debate.  There has always been a tendency, regardless of who has been in power, for the Government to pretend that it knows it all and to be reluctant to take on board suggestions that come from the Opposition.  I would like to think we will see a major change in that respect and that we will deal with proposals that come forward in a more mature fashion in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments that he is willing to take on new ideas.  I hope, in the first few months after the election, the Government will be much more relaxed about taking on our ideas.  We welcome the fact that this motion was taken responsibly and has been accepted.  I also welcome the Cabinet decision yesterday to do some of the <Col N="1654"/>things outlined in this motion.  However, I am a bit annoyed by some of the Minister&rsquo;s comments last night criticising Fine Gael&rsquo;s statistics.  Everybody uses statistics to win an argument.  We need to get away from fighting over figures.  Any life lost on our roads is one too many.  We have all been to funerals week after week of people who have lost their lives prematurely.  We must stop clapping ourselves on the back when road deaths are down to 250 or 350 and set real targets.  I have complained before about the target the chairman of the Road Safety Authority thinks is good enough.  Any death is one too many.  There is an imperative on the Government to do whatever has to be done to reduce the level of incidents and accidents on our roads.  I say incidents, because what we often call accidents are actually avoidable and are therefore incidents.</P>
        <P>Following the inquest during the week, I received a letter from a driving instructor in Navan raising a few issues with me.  The reports on the inquest dealt mainly with road signage and how we need to improve it.  We missed out on the fact that the main problem was tailgating.  My constituent made the point that this should be put into general driver education, with more advertisements on television about the issue.  The driving instructor also mentioned that the number of cars on the road is a major issue, and the lack of public transport is a big factor in putting more cars on the road.  It is also part of road safety to try to do more for public transport and that is in the brief of the Minister.  The instructor pointed out to me that his own daughter has to travel across back roads to college in Maynooth, because public transport does not facilitate her.  It costs more than &euro;200 per week to have and maintain a car, money which could be put into public transport if we do it right.</P>
        <P>Any person who drives on our country roads knows that a car will tailgate him if he is driving within the speed limit.  The letter stated that we should either remove speed restrictions or enforce them, but there is no point in having speed restrictions on our county roads if they are not enforced.  We see garda&iacute; on the main roads and on dual carriageways, but it is just as important that they are on the back roads.  Drivers must be afraid that the Garda could be anywhere.  They must believe they could get caught anywhere, but most drivers know that the chances of being caught on a back road at the moment are very slim.  They take advantage of that, which is a shame and which is dangerous.</P>
        <P>I want to mention a few junctions on our national routes in County Meath, such as Ross Cross, Tara na Ri, Martry, as well as the turn-offs into Kells, Carnaross and so on.  There are many junctions in Meath to allow people turn off the national routes and the secondary national routes.  Until we get our motorways and bypasses <Col N="1655"/>in place, we must have these junctions lit up properly so that there is better visibility.</P>
        <P>We are missing a chance in the area of education.  We do not really educate ourselves how to drive properly.  The driving test does not reflect a modern society and the time required to learn how to drive is not realistic.  A driving licence should be a privilege that must be earned, not a right.  Such education must begin in primary and secondary schools.  The entire issue of road safety for pedestrians and road users should be taught in primary schools while the acquisition of the skills needed to drive a car should be taught at secondary school.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a problem in that many people, young and old, believe themselves to be invincible.  Such an attitude to driving is wrong and they do not believe they will either experience or cause a crash.  However, when such people are asked whether they believe they will win the lottery, they reply in the affirmative.  They are fully convinced they have a chance to win the lottery and buy tickets every week.  However, they do not believe they will crash their cars.  Such an attitude is wrong and must be fixed through education and the teaching of the requisite driving skills.  Such education should not be limited to school because many people have acquired licences easily in the past and such individuals should be reassessed.  I do not suggest they should be retested because that would induce fear of failing the test.  Instead, such individuals should be reassessed with the aim of fixing the problems rather than catching them out, to make matters better and safer on the roads.</P>

	<P>It gives me great satisfaction to speak to this motion in the full knowledge that one of its main objectives has been achieved.  The Government has had a meeting of minds on the important issue of mandatory alcohol testing at accidents.  I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd.  The country badly needs him to replace a tired and jaded Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>In the spirit of generosity and victory, I will not refer to a Government climbdown or any words to that effect.  However, it is encouraging for Members and in particular for those people who have been bereaved and left without much-loved family members due to the rising road carnage, that this issue has been resolved.  Such people have been victims of a Government that does not enforce its own legislation or initiatives.  Most actions of the Government send out a message of lower priority regarding driver behaviour and the subsequent threat to road safety.  Consequently, can anyone be sur<Col N="1656"/>prised when some drivers pick up the signals and cause mayhem, injury and death on the roads?</P>
        <P>Before the election, as is well known, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, gave a commitment to introduce mandatory testing but was scuppered thereafter by the Minister.  However, with his record of finding strange excuses, the Taoiseach then blamed the delayed implementation on technology.  I believe this sounds familiar as those mad e-voting machines did not work either.  Perhaps the Taoiseach is technologically challenged.</P>
        <P>Before the Government&rsquo;s change of mind, I wondered what impact the motion before the House would have on its actions.  It has been forced to listen to Fine Gael&rsquo;s recommendations and into an embarrassing U-turn.  However, the bottom line is that Fianna F&aacute;il cannot be trusted to implement its election promises freely but must be held to account continually.</P>
        <P>Mandatory testing at accidents will mean that lives will be saved.  However, a continuation of general Government inaction will spell more deaths, carnage and grief to bereaved families.  It is irrefutable that in global terms, Ireland is far behind in the enforcement of drink-driving laws, particularly as mandatory testing is already the norm in Northern Ireland and throughout much of Europe.  Fatalities on Irish roads have dropped by only 10.9% since 2001, compared to falls of 42.3% and 42% in France and Portugal, respectively.  Previously, the latter had been the worst-performing country.  In the past two months, road deaths in Ireland have risen by 35% when compared to the same period last year.  Drink driving is out of control and the Garda reports an average of 350 incidents per week in the past few months.  As no road safety strategy is in place at present, it is essential for the Government to take decisive action on road deaths.  Nevertheless, many drink drivers who are involved in serious or fatal accidents will slip through the net because as yet, there is no requirement for compulsory tests at accident scenes.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael attempted to introduce compulsory alcohol testing via proposed amendments to the Roads Bill 2007.  However, those amendments were rejected by the Government.  Obviously, compulsory alcohol testing should not interfere with medical assistance but should be carried out as soon as medically feasible.  This is the present position in Northern Ireland, where the police have a greater rate of alcohol testing of drivers involved in road traffic accidents than do garda&iacute; in the South, who use their own discretion.</P>
        <P>Much of the problem in respect of safety on the roads can be laid at the door of the spendthrift Government.  Despite throwing away millions in one fiasco after another, it has failed to set a budget for road safety strategy, thus making it difficult if not impossible to measure the performance of enforcement measures taken under this <Col N="1657"/>strategy.  The Irish Insurance Federation has called for more resources to be put into road safety.  I agree fully with its contention that road safety must be given the political priority and resources it needs desperately before many more people lose their lives needlessly.</P>
        <P>The state of the roads is disgraceful and the lack of proper road infrastructure in some areas, as well as a lack of proper road maintenance and signage are some of the greatest contributory factors to our too-high level of road fatalities.  For example, the midlands was completely overlooked and neglected in Transport 21&rsquo;s proposals, given the omission of essential works on what are some of the most dangerous roads in Ireland.  I call on the Government to introduce the necessary legislation relating to mandatory testing within the promised three months in the interests of reversing Ireland&rsquo;s appalling record on road deaths.  This should be followed by making good on other promises in respect of a nationwide speed camera system and a revision of the driving test regime among other measures.  I appeal to the Minister to act rapidly in this regard.</P>

	<P>I call on Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd to conclude this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to comment on the Government&rsquo;s strategy and its impact on road safety.  The target in the Government&rsquo;s Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 was to reduce road deaths to no more than 300 per year by 2006.  However, it failed in that objective because sadly, 368 people died that year.  While that constitutes 368 more fatalities than were needed, it was also 68 greater than the Government&rsquo;s target.  The policy has failed and the Government&rsquo;s targets were not reached.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to respond to some of the points made last night by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  There are many uses of statistics and he made much of the fact there are far more cars on the road at present than was the case heretofore.  I consulted the EUROSTAT report on the number of cars in four countries between 1990 and 2000, namely, Luxembourg, Portugal, France and Ireland.  In those years, Luxembourg experienced an increase in car numbers of 63%.  However, it has reduced its road fatalities by 48% since 2001 and has a ratio of 559 cars per 1,000 people.  Portugal witnessed a massive increase of 135% in the number of cars, has reduced its road fatalities by 42% and has a ratio of 572 cars per 1,000 people.  While France experienced a smaller increase in car numbers of 26%, it has reduced its road fatality rate by 42%.</P>
        <P>With respect to the Road Safety Authority and other bodies, the critical issue is that while car numbers in Ireland have increased by a massive 99% during the period under review, our road deaths have only fallen by 11% between 2001 and <Col N="1658"/>2006.  Notwithstanding the efforts made, the excellence of the Road Safety Authority, the work of the Garda and everyone else, Ireland is <?oasys _dc28- ?>well behind and the job is not being done properly.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>I accept that Ireland lacks a national road safety strategy.  Although the process of producing such a strategy was ordered last October, it has not yet arrived in the House.</P>
        <P>I intend to deal quickly with a number of other issues.  The Ceann Comhairle will inform me when one minute remains to me.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the most effective measures adopted in Luxembourg was the on-the-spot removal of driving licences for the most serious drink driving offences.  Driving licences are taken from the person in question on the spot and Ireland should take that path.  While I have a number of other proposals, I will leave them for now and will discuss the proposed amendment to the motion.  Following discussions with the Minister, I understand he is prepared to make the final paragraph read as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann notes that the Department of Transport proposes to engage with the Office of the Attorney General to establish how the current legislation can be amended to achieve roadside testing of drivers involved in accidents subject to overriding medical circumstances.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If the Minister is happy to make that change, I am happy for this side of the House to accept the motion, as amended.  It means we will work together to bring forward what was the Fine Gael and PARC policy and is now the Minister&rsquo;s policy.</P>

      <sTitle>Audiology Services.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important subject on the Adjournment.  The matter I wish to raise concerns the provision of audiology services in the south-eastern region which includes Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Dungarvan, Clonmel and the whole south Tipperary area, which will be the focus of my few words.</P>
        <P>The south-eastern audiology service is supposed to be staffed by two qualified audiologists working full time.  One of these has been absent for a number of months due to training, which has resulted in a considerable reduction in clinic hours.  The audiologists provide an essential service in assessing the hearing needs of the people of the south-eastern region and providing them with hearing aid devices, if necessary.  In the Clonmel office there is a two and a half year waiting list.  Many have been waiting since 2005 to obtain an appointment to be assessed and will have to wait a further month to be fitted with any device deemed necessary.  I beg the Government to tell me how this is acceptable.  How can we ask elderly, vulnerable people, some of whom live alone and in fear for their personal safety, to wait two and a half years to obtain a hearing aid which would alleviate some of that fear?</P>
        <P>There are more than 300 on the waiting list in the Clonmel area.  Despite the fact that the audiologist is working hard to see ten people in a day, the list is not getting any shorter.  Due to the considerable work involved in following up on initial appointments &mdash; for example, when fittings are required &mdash; the waiting list is never fully tackled but remains at roughly the same length.  The European Consumer Health Index report which was issued recently indicated that Ireland had the worst waiting times in Europe.  The people of Tipperary are, sadly, examples of this shameful fact.  The waiting list for the equivalent service in Cork is three months, while in Tipperary it is two and a half years.  Surely, in the aftermath of the recent successful Positive Ageing Week, we owe it to the older people in our community who have worked so hard their whole lives to provide them with the services they deserve.  In the last budget, in the area of services for the elderly, funding was allocated to improve this service, but there has <Col N="1660"/>been no clear improvement for the people of south Tipperary.</P>
        <P>This does not affect only the older people in our community.  Younger people, including children, also desperately require this service in order that their auditory needs can be met.  What is the point in parents and teachers giving their all to educate young children when the children cannot be assessed to ensure their hearing is satisfactory?  Children in Tipperary who have problems hearing struggle in a near silent world, isolated, waiting for their names to move forward on the list which is now so long that staff must check whether a patient is still alive before offering an appointment.  I strongly advise the Minister to do something about this, as it affects the quality of life of so many.</P>

	<P>I will be taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, the Minister for Health and Children.  </P>
        <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to address the issue raised by Deputy Hayes.  As the House will be aware, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility in law to manage and deliver health and personal social services or to arrange for them to be delivered on its behalf.  This includes the delivery of audiology services and the prioritising and resourcing of the development of national community audiology services.</P>
        <P>I am happy to explain the situation in the area of audiology services, as well as to convey the information provided by the HSE on the specific question raised by the Deputy.  The national community audiology service provides free audiology services for all children, irrespective of parents&rsquo; means, and for adults who have eligibility.  For an adult to be eligible, he or she must be in possession of a current medical card.  A total of 4,822 clinics were held in 2006 and 39,432 patients were seen.</P>
        <P>The post of audiologist was advertised in May this year and interviews for the position were held in September.  As a result of the interview process, a person was offered the post.  Unfortunately, this person has declined the offer of the position.  The HSE intends to advertise the post again.  However, the HSE national management team has developed a financial break-even plan, aimed at remaining within its Vote for 2007, which includes a temporary pause in recruitment.  This was reviewed by the team on 1 October.  Based on this review, the HSE has decided that the financial situation is such that it is necessary and prudent to continue the overall pause in recruitment to the end of October.</P>
        <P>The HSE hopes to establish a national review of audiological services to explore the delivery of audiology services in the most appropriate setting.  Meanwhile, it has been working to achieve <Col N="1661"/>national standardisation of approaches to waiting lists and waiting times using a standardised template.  Data based on this revised template is due to be reported at end of the first quarter of 2008.</P>
        <P>A further imperative is to develop an integrated service at primary care level, involving audiologists, general practitioners, speech and language therapists, public health nurses and others, for those with hearing loss.  The HSE also envisages the development of fully integrated audiology services, involving acute hospitals and community services, which will be delivered in the most appropriate setting.  I will bring the issues the Deputy raised to the attention of the HSE.</P>

	<P>I would like to share time with Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch.  </P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Anyone who has reared children should not need a &ldquo;heads-up&rdquo; on this issue.  The NCIP community child care subvention scheme which was in place from 2000 to 2007 had a capital programme element but also provided a grant for every qualifying child.  There was some talk about this around two years ago, when the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, former Deputy Michael McDowell &mdash; I can never understand why the scheme was administered by that Department &mdash; decided to change the conditions under which people qualified.  There was such an uproar that those plans were dropped.</P>
        <P>From January 2008 we will have a new scheme which will be in place for two years until 2010 but it will be so narrow in its focus that it will ensure women and men &mdash; there are some single parents who are men &mdash; will need to rely on social welfare or will be forced to take their children out of child care.  One will have to be in receipt of social welfare or family income supplement before one will be able to get this grant for child care.  That leaves an entire group of people outside the remit of this scheme.  There will be those who can afford to pay, and the middle group of people who are just about surviving and whose children can receive child care with this subsidy.  On the other hand there will be children whose parents are in receipt of social welfare and, therefore, fall within the scheme.</P>
        <P>We all know that for children to grow up into worthwhile adult members of society there must be a combination of all of the sectors in society and they need to contact people in other strands of society.  We have seen child care schemes which have enabled women to participate in society by returning to education or even part-time work.</P><Col N="1662"/>
        <P>However, from January we will have a system whereby people who can afford to put their children into child care will continue to do so, while on the other side of the fence there will be people who will qualify because they are in receipt of social welfare.  That is not what child care is all about and it is most definitely not the intention of the child care community.  I appeal to the Minister to change his mind on this scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the points raised by my party colleague, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on the proposed restructuring of the child care service which will result in radical changes to the existing scheme.</P>
        <P>Independent examination of this issue shows that additional charges will be placed upon parents.  It also shows that the operational costs for community child care services will be recreated and will have to be recouped locally because of the additional costs arising from the restructured process.  This will also result in a reduction of services at local level and possibly lead to the closure of numerous community child care services across the country.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the new process will remove the social flexibility and mobility which are currently built into the service and which are a key aspect of it, namely, that children from different income groups can come together just as they do in the primary school sector.  In fact, if we applied the logic that the Minister is applying in the child care area to the primary school sector, we would see how bizarre that thinking is.  It will also make it impossible to maintain standards and will undermine years of work in developing standards in this area.</P>
        <P>The irony of all of this is that European funding and local effort have developed a good model of practice for child care in this country.  This has taken community child care out of the Dark Ages, yet the Minister is now proposing to make these child care services a victim of their own success by using these measurements against them.</P>
        <P>In effect, the Minister is proposing to create what is called &mdash; I use the terms that local community child care services propose &mdash; a ghettoisation of the service, driving out working parents on low incomes who will now be penalised by no longer being able to afford or to avail of child care in their local community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Kathleen Lynch for raising this matter.</P>
        <P>The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their child care costs are child benefit and the early child care supplement.  The latter payment, which is in recognition of the higher child care costs of pre-school children, is the responsibility of my office, and it alone amounts to expenditure of over &euro;400 million in a full year.  These payments are univer<Col N="1663"/>sal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of child care they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government child care policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.</P>
        <P>Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, EOCP, which was initiated by the Ceann Comhairle when he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and which was co-funded by the Irish taxpayer and by the European Union, targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme.  Community based not-for-profit child care providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to offer reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to remain accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</P>
        <P>Under the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010, NCIP, the successor programme to the EOCP, a new scheme to support community child care services with a focus on disadvantage will be introduced in January next and will continue to complement the universal supports in place for all parents.  The community child care subvention scheme, CCSS, has been allocated &euro;153 million over the next three years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme.  Under the new scheme, services will be grant aided according to the service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from them.  In turn, the subvention received by the services will be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputies will agree that the provision of additional targeted support for disadvantaged families is a necessary component of any equitable system for supporting families with the cost of child care.  Any such targeted approach must have a cut-off point and it was considered that the income limits for family income supplement were the most appropriate, given the scale of the scheme and its focus.  The Deputies may be aware that the current FIS limit for a family with three children under 18 stands at &euro;625 per week after tax, while the minimum wage currently stands at &euro;8.65 per hour, or &euro;346 for a 40 hour week, and the average industrial wage as of March this year amounted to &euro;615 per week.</P><Col N="1664"/>
        <P>It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community child care services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the value for money review of the EOCP, which consulted widely with stakeholders, including child care providers, before reaching its conclusions.  These enhancements include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided, as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported.  The ceiling for funding which existed under the previous scheme is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current level until July of next year.  My office has recently concluded a series of regional meetings with existing grant recipients to outline the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  These meetings have been useful, both in explaining how the scheme will work, and in allowing groups propose changes to how the scheme will be operated, a number of which have been taken on board already.</P>
        <P>It is important to restate that the more detailed and comprehensive data which will be generated by the new scheme between now and the end of December will be analysed by officials in my office.  If appropriate, any adjustments necessary to secure the best outcomes for child care services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered by the Government in early 2008 and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July of next year.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, groups can continue to receive funding at their current rate up to the end of June 2008.  To qualify for the continued funding, groups must submit the information required for the assessment of the impact of the new scheme by early November and I would appeal to them to do so, and ask other Members of the Oireachtas to do so.  It is important to emphasise that there are no changes between now and July of next year.</P>
        <P>It is worth repeating that this Government has built a formal child care structure from a low base.  Since 2000, we have created over 35,000 new child care places in the community and private sectors and supported over 26,000 more.  Under the EOCP, &euro;500 million has been allocated from 2000-2006, accounting for over 3,300 <Col N="1665"/>grants to a mixture of community and private providers.</P>
        <P>In real terms, this Government will have spent over &euro;1 billion of public money on the child care sector by 2010.  Given the fact that the new subvention scheme actually increases funding by 16% over the EOCP staffing scheme, I refute in the strongest possible terms the suggestion that the Government has suspended such support.  Nothing could be further from the truth and as I have said, any adjustments which might be considered necessary will be considered by the Government once the relevant data has been analysed.</P>

      <sTitle>Eating Disorders.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me speak on the important issue of eating disorders.  These disorders have become increasingly prevalent, especially among young people.  There is a need to provide funding and resources to deal with the problems experienced by individuals and their families who have to face the terrible trauma of anorexia, the more prevalent bulimia and binge eating.</P>
        <P>The 2006 report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change, estimated that 200,000 persons are affected by eating disorders in Ireland.  Each year, a total of 400 new cases emerge and, alarmingly and sadly, these result in approximately 80 deaths.  Eating disorders are more prevalent among females in the 15 to 40 years age group.  Approximately 4,000 people suffer from anorexia and 15,000 suffer from bulimia.  One in ten males suffer from anorexia and bulimia.  An estimated 7,000 adolescents currently live with bulimia or anorexia.  Approximately 500 of these will die of medical complications or suicide.</P>
        <P>Alarmingly and more tragically for these young people and their families, there are no designated public services in Ireland for the management of eating disorders in children or adolescents.  The Minister must ensure the provision of appropriate intervention, which is so important, because without the necessary supports, the parents of a young person who has an eating disorder have few options.  This is a frustrating situation which makes people angry.  Local GPs can do nothing as they have nowhere to which they can refer young people.  When a young person deteriorates to a serious extent, he or she is admitted to hospital through the accident and emergency department.  We do not want this to happen.</P>
        <P>In many cases, eating disorders are caused by low self-esteem and a lack of confidence.  Early intervention such as counselling is important, as having someone to talk to can help build up a young person&rsquo;s self-esteem and help prevent full-blown anorexia.  Child psychiatrists are non-existent, regardless of whether one is a public health <Col N="1666"/>patient or a member of the VHI.  Many parents are driven to distraction and have to bombard their GPs and accident and emergency units to get attention for their sons and daughters.</P>
        <P>Only three beds are designated in the public health service for persons with eating disorders but they are for patients aged over 18 years.  Two eight-bed units operate in the private sector, in St. John of God&rsquo;s Hospital and in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin.  The turnaround is very slow in this area as it takes a long time to reach recovery and the needs that exist are not being serviced.  What is required is a dedicated bed capacity with the establishment of multidisciplinary teams in each Health Service Executive area.</P>
        <P>Given that early intervention in this area is so important, we also need significant investment in child and adolescent mental health services.  The situation is becoming difficult and alarming.  Media reports appear every day about how eating disorders are affecting young people but media images also affect young people.  Thankfully, the Madrid fashion council would not accept size zero models but the UK continues to accept them.  I shudder to think what size they are.</P>
        <P>All these issues have an effect on young people who are bombarded with images by the media, through the Internet and international television.  This is a serious issue.  There is a sad deficit of public and private services to address the problem of eating disorders.  I am delighted the Minister of State with special responsibility for children, Deputy Smith, is present in the House to take on board what I have said and address this issue, but not in terms of A Vision for Change which would take too long to implement.  We need services to be provided as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Clune for raising this important matter and for the pertinent points she made.  I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Clune is aware, the report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change, was published in January 2006.  The report addressed all aspects of mental health services, including services for those with eating disorders.  A number of recommendations were made concerning mental health services for people with eating disorders.  These include support for health promotion initiatives that encourage greater community and family awareness of eating disorders, the further development of primary and community care services and the provision of full multidisciplinary teams in a national centre for eating disorders for complex cases that cannot be managed by local community mental health teams.  Responsibility for imple<Col N="1667"/>menting these recommendations rests with the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has established an implementation group to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations a reality.  The Government has accepted the report of the expert group as the basis for the future development of mental health services.  An additional &euro;26.2 million was allocated for the further development of mental health services in 2006 and a further &euro;25 million was provided in 2007, bringing the total allocation for 2007 to &euro;1 billion.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;7.95 million of the additional 2007 funding has been provided to significantly improve both community and hospital-based child and adolescent services and facilitate the provision of early intervention services.  The multidisciplinary nature of existing child and adolescent mental health teams will be enhanced, with eight new teams being developed in 2007.  The implementation of A Vision for Change requires the recruitment of 40 additional child and adolescent mental health teams.  It is envisaged that these will be provided on a phased basis over a five year period &mdash; 16 of which have already been funded.</P>
        <P>With regard to specific funding for eating disorders, &euro;750,000 of the additional funding in 2007 was allocated for the development of designated eating disorder services.  A total of &euro;500,000 has been allocated to enhance the service in the Elm Mount Unit, St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin, which will provide a national service to support local mental health services in addressing eating disorders.  The balance of &euro;250,000 has been allocated to the Health Service Executive, south area, to commence the development of an eating disorder service.  The Health Service Executive also works with the independent sector to provide specialist care on an inpatient or outpatient basis, which can result in referrals to specialised eating disorder services.</P>
        <P>An independent monitoring group was established early last year to monitor and assess progress on the implementation of A Vision for Change.  The group&rsquo;s first report was published in May 2007.  The report acknowledged that 2006 was a year of significant challenge and change for the mental health services.  However, in recognising that some positive developments had taken place, the report highlighted a number of issues which would require further attention.  These include a systematic approach to implementation of A Vision for Change and clarity in responsibility for implementation in the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>In acknowledging the need to provide a dedicated and co-ordinated response to A Vision for <Col N="1668"/>Change, the Health Service Executive appointed a full-time project manager to progress the prioritised implementation plan.  This plan, which will include a timed and prioritised set of short, medium and longer-term goals, is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>I assure Deputy Clune the Government is fully committed to the development of services for those suffering from eating disorders and to ensuring that services will continue to be improved and enhanced in the coming years.</P>

    <Sect LHead="Crime" RHead="Levels"> 
      <sTitle>Crime Levels.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak on this matter.  Currently, burglaries and break-ins have reached an unacceptable level in County Galway.  People in every town and village and in isolated areas have experienced houses being ransacked in one way or another by marauding thugs who operate in the dead of night.  That is the only way I can explain them.  Shops, supermarkets, pubs, garages, churches and houses have been affected.</P>
        <P>There appears to be no end in sight to this crime epidemic.  We always had a certain level of crime but in the past three or four months the criminals have gone into overdrive.  This current spate of crime is a mirror image of the dreadful attacks on the elderly a number of years ago in the west.  The Ceann Comhairle will remember the Government and the Garda had to introduce drastic measures to put an end to it.  This was known as Operation Shannon and employed garda&iacute; at checkpoints during the night at bridges crossing into the west.  A helicopter added a sense of urgency to the project.  The good news is that the Garda operation was successful.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>However, there are some major differences in what is happening currently.  As nobody has yet lost a life, this vandalism and thuggery does not attract the same national media attention.  However, serious damage is done to property and much income is lost.  There is fear among people that their houses and business will be burgled.  It is a psychological issue in that nobody knows who will be next.</P>

        <P>Nobody knows who is responsible for that behaviour, and that is the worst scenario.  However, a trend is emerging.  When the vandals strike they invariably use precise and accurate local knowledge.  Who is supplying the information?  Nobody knows that either, but I hope my raising this matter in the House today will improve the chance of these thugs being apprehended.  If so, it is vital the local mole, spy or parasite is deemed to be as culpable as the thugs themselves.  What is happening throughout County Galway could not be organised if extremely local knowledge was not available.  For example, when a family is away for a wedding, its <Col N="1669"/>house is targeted.  If a farmer sells cattle at a mart, a few days later his house is burgled.</P>
        <P>I do not have time to list all the examples but incredibly local knowledge is involved.  The situation is so bad that nothing short of a ring of steel by the Garda is warranted.  I ask for more garda&iacute;, more resources and more equipment so the Garda will be able to handle this scourge before it gets out of hand.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should ensure my comments are delivered directly to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The people of County Galway have a problem on their hands.  While I assume the situation is as bad in other areas, we are going through a storm at present and I want action to be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  I reply on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is unfortunately unable to be present.  I assure the Deputy that the Minister and I share his concern, and that of the public, with regard to raids and break-ins carried out in rural areas in County Galway in the recent past.</P>
        <P>Engagement with the rural community and rural policing is one of the priorities of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Senior Garda management continually monitors resources and policing initiatives to ensure the service being provided is continuously improving.  The Garda inspectorate, which was established under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act and is led by former Boston Police Commissioner, Ms Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole, recently submitted a report to the Minister which is a comprehensive examination of the current state of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and makes recommendations for the ongoing reform of the force.  The report and its recommendations on the service being provided will be taken on board.  Rural policing is continually being reviewed and developed and the enhanced liaison structures between Garda management and local authorities through the joint policing committees and community policing fora will be of enormous benefit to the policing of rural areas when these are fully up and running.</P>
        <P>The Minister is informed by the Garda authorities that detective inspectors have been appointed in each division with specific responsibility for the investigation of serious crime in rural areas.  The quality of criminal intelligence becoming available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is continually being improved</P>
        <P>To enhance rural policing a number of initiatives have been implemented in Garda divisions nationally.  Checkpoints are set up at strategic locations in rural villages to detect criminals travelling to commit crime outside the areas in which they live and to prevent the commission of crimes and offences.  Crime prevention officers are available to offer crime prevention and security advice to residential and business groups and regularly provide such advice through local media outlets, <Col N="1670"/>newspaper and radio broadcasts.  In addition, residents in rural areas are encouraged to establish and rejuvenate community alert schemes, assisted by members of local community policing units.</P>
        <P>Initiatives under Operation Anvil have been implemented in every Garda district in the country.  These incorporate special crime prevention and detection patrols in rural areas which have been identified as being particularly vulnerable to crime.  Such patrols include all available Garda resources, including uniform and plain clothes personnel, district detective and drug units, as well as divisional crime task forces and traffic corps personnel.  Patrol times are also varied to maximise coverage in such areas.</P>
        <P>An important partnership for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is its partnership with the community alert programme.  This is a community-based initiative in rural communities, set up in 1985 by Muintir na T&iacute;re in association with the Garda authorities.  There are currently 1,300 community alert groups nationwide dedicated to improving the quality of life of people in rural communities who are vulnerable, in particular the elderly.  The partnership between Muintir na T&iacute;re and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is formalised in a memorandum of understanding between both organisations for the development and operation of the programme.  In conjunction with Muintir na T&iacute;re, the Minister intends to launch the new community alert strategy for the period 2007 to 2011 on 26 October.  This new strategy will inform the implementation of community alert over the next five years.</P>
        <P>Community policing is a central feature of current Garda policing policy and members of community policing units are encouraged to engage with the local communities where they are assigned.  An internal Garda working group has been established to develop a comprehensive model of community policing.  This model is being informed by an extensive public consultation process.</P>
        <P>I would now like to address the particular matter raised by the Deputy.  The Minister is informed by the Garda authorities that a number of the burglaries referred to are occurring in rural areas of County Galway during the night.  Very often the occupants of the house are asleep and remain undisturbed.  In most cases the offenders take only items that they have access to from the floor to which they gained entry.  Frequently the houses targeted are two storey houses, with the ground floor being the only one searched.  On most occasions the injured parties only discover the break-in the following morning.</P>
        <P>Local Garda management, through increased patrolling, strategically located checkpoints and the targeting of criminals, are actively seeking to reduce this type of crime and disrupt the activity of criminals in the area concerned.  The visiting and checking of vulnerable premises during the course of patrols is also part of the crime prevention initiative.  In addition, individuals who are suspected of criminal activity are being targeted. <Col N="1671"/> Furthermore, local residents are being encouraged to establish and rejuvenate community alert schemes assisted by local garda&iacute;.  In the Galway west division, an inspector has been appointed to co-ordinate the community alert schemes with a view to reactivating schemes and the introduction of new schemes.  Local garda&iacute; and liaison garda&iacute; are also reviewing all neighbourhood watch schemes throughout the Galway west division with a view to reactivating dormant schemes and initiating new schemes.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil is implemented in each of the Garda districts in the western region.  Special <Col N="1672"/>crime prevention and detection operations have been implemented and are ongoing.  Rural areas in each of the divisions are included in operational orders taking cognisance of crime trends when implementing operations.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware of the concern which incidents like those referred to by the Deputy cause to the people directly affected and the wider community.  He is confident the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is using all resources available to ensure a proactive and co-ordinated approach to prevent such incidents occurring in the future.</P>

	<P>The National MRSA Reference Laboratory is operated by St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and is funded by the Health Services Executive (HSE).  It is a purpose-built facility that provides a range of national services which supports the overall HSE drive to tackle the problem of MRSA.  The current budget for the Laboratory is just over &euro;270,000.  Plans for an expansion of its operation have been submitted to and are under consideration by the HSE.</P>

	<P>The HSE has made significant progress in complying with the ICT governance requirements set out by the Department of Finance in September 2005. It has appointed a national Director of ICT to provide a central source of decision making in relation to ICT strategies, plans and projects. There is no longer delegation of ICT spending authority within the HSE. All ICT development and operational staff are now under the control of the ICT Director. Decisions about the engagement of ICT contractors and consultants are also matters for the Director.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive ICT strategy for the HSE should be completed by the end of the year. When the strategy has been approved by my Department and the Department of Finance, it will enable the HSE to meet the standards contained in the Department of Finance 16/97 process.  My Department will continue to work with the HSE and the Department of Finance to improve the governance arrangements applied to ICT within the HSE.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 108 together.</P>
        <P>The proportion of overall health spending on mental health is frequently used to make a point on the adequacy of funding.  However, it is not valid to make this comparison.  As the nature and scope of total health services change, funding ratios automatically change.  The 7.7% expenditure on mental health referred to by the Deputy only reflects expenditure on specialist mental health services.  This will amount to &euro;1 billion in 2007.  It is important to bear in mind that some 90% of public mental health services are provided at primary care level. The expenditure on these services is not captured in the figure of 7.7% referred to by the Deputy. This underlines the need for caution when drawing conclusions from percentages of total health expenditure.</P>
        <P>It is more meaningful to note that, since 1997, public expenditure on specialist mental health services has trebled.  The spending on other services at primary care level has also increased substantially.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 95 together.</P>
        <P>I do not accept that some pharmacists may not be able to continue to provide a service under the GMS and community drug schemes. Nor do I accept there is any basis for community pharmacists threatening to withdraw from these schemes.  The main wholesaler companies have recently confirmed to the HSE they will charge community pharmacists the same price for drugs and medicines under the GMS and community drugs schemes as pharmacists will be reimbursed by the HSE following the price reimbursement percentage adjustments announced recently by the HSE. <Col N="1676"/> All the evidence available to the joint HSE/Department of Health &amp; Children team dealing with this issue indicated that the State was paying a premium for this service and the new arrangements will save the HSE about &euro;100m in 2008.</P>
        <P>The impact of the new arrangements on the incomes of pharmacists will depend on the extent of the discounts which individual pharmacists were getting from wholesalers under the previous arrangements. I am advised that large urban pharmacies and chains typically got discounts of up to 12% whereas small and rural pharmacies got discounts of 2-3%.</P>
        <P>I have previously outlined in detail to this House the legal reasons why it is not possible for the HSE to negotiate with the IPU on fees, prices or margins for their members. A process of dialogue was established, chaired by Bill Shipsey SC, to explore ways in which concerns raised by the IPU about the implications of this legal advice might be addressed. At a meeting on 11 October, the IPU maintained that it has a fundamental right as a trade union to fully represent its members on all issues. It appears, therefore, that the Union does not accept the legal position under competition law regarding negotiation on fees. However, in an effort to address concerns on all sides, there is ongoing contact with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union under the auspices of Mr. Shipsey.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive has advised my Department that, based on current figures, the number of births at year-end is expected to be in the region of 68,000, an increase of nearly 11% over 2006.  The current recruitment pause is a temporary measure initiated by the HSE as part of a financial break-even plan.  It will be reviewed at the end of October 2007.  Notwithstanding this, it has been recognised that there are some critical or exceptional circumstances where appointment of staff may be necessary in frontline services.  Accordingly, a process has been put in place to evaluate, monitor and approve requests for derogation from the general recruitment pause.  A group has been established within the HSE which will meet weekly to consider such applications.  The relevant HSE Net<Col N="1677"/>work Manager may request a derogation where it is considered that a particular vacancy could have an adverse effect on services.</P>

	<P>Section 20 (1) (d) of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides for the making of regulations allowing the Health Service Executive (HSE) to impose a charge for the administration of Patient Private Property Accounts. These regulations came into effect on 11 September 2007.  The HSE has established a central unit in Tullamore Co. Offaly and the bulk of money held in Patient Private Property Accounts on behalf of patients will be invested via this Unit with the National Treasury Management Agency.</P>
        <P>The costs associated with the Central Unit are readily identifiable and cannot be considered integral to HSE care provision. The administration charge will be used to offset the costs of this Unit and the associated external audit fees.  The HSE has informed my Department that the costs of administering the Central Unit for 2007 will be approximately &euro;600,000. Based on the current amount of funds in these accounts the estimated annual charges yield would be approximately &euro;570,000.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I should explain at the outset that the chief nursing officer (CNO) in the Department of Health and Children has been in exist<Col N="1678"/>ence since 1998. The Report of the Commission on Nursing (1998) strongly supported and endorsed the appointment of a CNO. It recognised the need to strengthen the workforce planning and professional leadership functions in the Department and recommended the continued development of the post. It envisaged the new position would have a crucial role in strengthening the central planning and strategic development of nursing and midwifery. To date there have been two holders of the position.  The outgoing CNO completed her term of office on 30 September 2007, and the Public Appointments Service is currently recruiting a successor on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>It is my view that the appointment of a new chief nursing officer should proceed as speedily as possible. I do not believe that the salary (which is linked to the Principal Officer Higher Scale) is excessive given the role and responsibilities of this post. The Deputy will be aware that the Department is not involved in the provision of front-line services, and there is no link between this appointment and the corrective measures currently being taken by the HSE in order to remain within its budget. The post is funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote.</P>
        <P>There are many important developments currently taking place and in train in respect of nursing policy, e.g. the bedding down of the undergraduate nursing degree programmes, rolling out the nurse prescribing initiative, modernising the regulatory framework for the nursing profession and making it more accountable to the public, together with the general expansion of the role of nursing and midwifery in the delivery of enhanced patient services to the public.  The CNO provides professional advice to the Minister and the Department generally on nursing and midwifery related issues. It is vitally important that there is in position a chief nursing officer who can provide professional leadership to the profession at national level on nursing and midwifery related policy matters. The importance of filling this post is recognised by all stakeholders, including the main nursing unions, who fully support the appointment of a new chief nursing officer at this time.</P>

	<P>The co-location initiative is <Col N="1679"/>designed to ensure that private beds in public hospitals are freed up for the use of public patients by having co-located private hospitals built on public hospital sites.  In service terms, this means that the co-located facility will be required to treat all the private patients that are currently treated in the public hospital subject to limited exceptions, for example maternity, A&amp;E, radiation oncology or organ transplantation services. In these exceptional cases, the public hospital will continue to provide such services to private as well as public patients. </P>
        <P>Specifically in the case of A &amp; E, there will be one service on the hospital site and under the new consultants&rsquo; contract, no private patient fees will be chargeable to patients attending there.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 111 together.</P>
        <P>The most effective strategy for the prevention of cervical cancer requires decisions based on an assessment of the relative contributions of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination and cervical screening in reducing the burden of both existing and projected cervical pre-cancerous changes and cervical cancer.  Issues to be examined include the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the vaccine for different age groups and for differing levels of screening provision and uptake.</P>
        <P>As is being done in other jurisdictions, Ireland is now considering the potential role of HPV vaccination in addressing the problem of cervical cancer prevention.  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) has recently undertaken a scientific assessment of the public health value of HPV following a request from my Department.  NIAC and the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS), agreed that this work needed to be complemented by a study of the cost effectiveness of the vaccine in the current Irish context.  Accordingly, both organisations requested that the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertake this study.</P>
<P>One of the key functions of the Authority is the assessment of health technology, drugs and health promotion activities.  When I have received the policy advice from HIQA and NCSS I will make the necessary decisions that arise from the advice.</P>
        <P>A quality assured population based cervical screening programme aims to reduce cervical <Col N="1682"/>cancer in Ireland by approximately 80%.  The NCSS has confirmed that it will have such a programme in place from January next year.  A national cervical screening programme will still be required regardless of a decision on a HPV vaccination programme.</P>

        <P>&ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; &mdash; the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, was launched in January 2006.  It provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over a 7 to 10 year period.  &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; acknowledges gaps in the current provision of services for people with eating disorders and makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services.  Recommendations include support for health promotion initiatives that encourage greater community and family awareness of eating disorders,  the further development of primary and community care services and  the provision of a full multidisciplinary team in a National Centre for Eating Disorders for complex cases that cannot be managed by local child and adolescent community mental health teams.  Responsibility for the implementation of these recommendations rests with the HSE.</P>

	<P>The current recruitment pause is a temporary measure initiated as part of the HSE financial break-even plan and will be reviewed at the end of October 2007.  The HSE recognises that there are some critical or exceptional circumstances where appointment of staff may be necessary in frontline services.  Accordingly a process has been put in place to evaluate, monitor and approve requests for derogation from the general recruitment pause.  A group has been established which will meet weekly to consider such applications.</P>
        <P>I am aware that some physiotherapy, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy graduates have had some difficulty in obtaining employment in the public health service.  In this regard, my Department is continuing to chair a working group comprising representatives from the HSE, the therapy managers and IMPACT.  The Group has identified the contributing factors and has developed an action plan with a view to addressing these factors.  The group is now working through prioritised actions and continues to make progress on several key actions.</P>
        <P>Since the establishment of the HSE, the number of Medical and Dental personnel has increased by 13.02% (913).   The number of nursing personnel has increased by 4,296 (+12.52%) to 38, 609 (or by 2,848 and 8.3% when student nurses are factored out).  The number of Health and Social Care Professionals increased by 2,611 (+20.35%) to 15,441.  The Deputy may wish to note in particular the increases of 32% (Dieticians), 35% (Occupational Therapists), 24% (Physiotherapists) and 30% (Speech and Language Therapists).

	<P>It is my objective and that of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to see the earliest delivery of the Government&rsquo;s National Plan for Radiation Oncology.  The HSE will shortly appoint a National Director of Radiation Oncology to report to the National Cancer Control Director.</P>
        <P>My Department and the HSE have been working closely on the examination of procurement options in order to expedite the delivery of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology.  It has been agreed that the phase 1 facilities at St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont will be increased from four linear accelerators to eight (four at each site).  The HSE has confirmed that it will have in place radiation oncology capacity to meet the needs of the population by 2010.  After 2010 the HSE will continue to increase capacity to ensure that these needs continue to be met.  I am fully confident that this will be achieved through a combination of direct Exchequer provision, PPP and where appropriate, the use of the private sector.</P>
        <P>The HSE is currently finalising details in relation to the phasing and timelines of the Plan.  Developments to date include the procurement of additional capacity (2 linear accelerators) for St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Rathgar.  These linear accelerators will be commissioned in February and March 2008 and two replacement linear accelerators will be commissioned in August and September 2008.  The contract for the design consultants for the interim facilities in Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s has commenced.  The evaluation process for procurement of the supply contract is also underway and a technical subgroup is preparing the equipping specification for the phase 1 developments.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the findings of the Euro Health Consumer Index Report.  A small section of the report deals with waiting times for operations for public patients within the Irish public hospital system.  This is one indicator out of twenty-seven in the report and one of five used <Col N="1688"/>by the authors to reach their conclusions on the overall &ldquo;waiting time&rdquo; experience of Irish patients.</P>
        <P>The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) was set up in 2002 to reduce the length of time public patients wait for operations.  In the past five years, significant progress has been achieved in this area with waiting times for the most common procedures down from two to five years to the current two to five months.  According to the most recently published (July 2007) data from the Patient Treatment Register operated by the NTPF, waiting times for nineteen of the twenty most common adult procedures are four months or less.  For eleven of these procedures, waiting times are three months or less.</P>
        <P>The Euro Health Consumer Index Report focuses on four sample procedures out of thousands currently provided in the public hospital system and compares waiting times for these against a benchmark of three months.  According to the Patient Treatment Register, current waiting times for the four procedures within these specialties are: </P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Hip replacement &mdash; 3 months</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Knee replacement &mdash; 4 months</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />PTCA (angioplasty) &mdash; 2-3 months</P>

	<P>&rsquo;A Vision <Col N="1690"/>for Change&rsquo; &mdash; the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, was launched on 24th January 2006.  It provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over the next 7 to 10 years.</P>
        <P>In 2006, a sum of &euro;26.2 million was allocated for the development of mental health services in line with &rsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; and a further sum of &euro;25 million has been allocated in 2007 to continue this development.  A significant proportion of this year&rsquo;s funding  &mdash; &euro;7.95m &mdash; is for the development of child and adolescent psychiatric services.  It is anticipated that this funding will bring about significant improvements in community, hospital-based and early intervention services.  Existing multidisciplinary teams will be enhanced and new child and adolescent mental health teams developed.  The provision of additional teams will reduce waiting times for assessment and treatment.</P>
        <P>Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114, 126 and 131 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 &mdash; 2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), tar<Col N="1691"/>geted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit child care providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</P>
        <P>With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community child care services to provide affordable child care to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The (CCSS) has been allocated &euro;153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community child care services to provide reduced child care fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services will be required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P>
        <P>In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) will see a &euro;80 weekly subvention in respect of full day care (with pro-rata reductions in respect of shorter hour services).  Parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a &euro;30 weekly subvention in respect of full day care (with pro-rata reductions).  A further subvention of &euro;30 per week will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify under either of these categories will be charged the cost price for their child care service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have <Col N="1692"/>availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.</P>
        <P>It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community child care services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing child care services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which is due to be received from applicants in November.  If appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for child care services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>

	<P>My Department is strongly committed to implementing a range of measures aimed at tackling and reducing health inequalities. Social inclusion-relevant aspects of existing health strategies and plans feature in the new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, published in June 2006 and in Ireland&rsquo;s National Report on Strategies for Social Protection and Social Inclusion (NSSPI) 2006-2008, submitted to the EU in September 2006. The health commitments in both these documents are further developed in Ireland&rsquo;s new National Action Plan for Social Inclusion, Building an Inclusive Society (NAPinclusion) 2007-2016, published in February 2007.</P>
        <P>The NAP inclusion details a number of health commitments aimed at tackling and reducing health inequalities and improving the health status of the more vulnerable members of our society. For example, the NAPinclusion includes the following high level goal aimed at improving access to health services for those on low incomes: Develop 500 primary care teams by 2011 which will improve access to services in the community, with particular emphasis on meeting the needs of holders of medical cards (i.e. those on low incomes and those over 70 years of age). Other significant health commitments in the NAPinclusion 2007-2016 relevant to addressing health inequalities and improving health status include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Development of specific community and sectoral initiatives to encourage healthy eating and access to healthy food and physical activity among adults, with a particular emphasis on adults living in areas of disadvantage;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Monitoring inequalities in cancer risks, cancer occurrence, cancer services and cancer outcomes to maintain a policy focus on cancer inequalities;</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">Taking account of the strong body of evidence linking poverty and poor mental health, there will be two general adult community mental health teams per 100,000 of the population by 2013.</P>
        <P>With specific regard to the report&rsquo;s recommendation on awareness and access to medical and GP visit cards, the Programme for Government commits to the following:</P><Col N="1694"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Indexing the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Implementation of an annual publicity campaign and making applications easier so as to increase uptake amongst those who are eligible for Medical Cards and GP Visit Cards;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Doubling of the income limit eligibility of parents of children under 6 years of age, and trebling them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Allowing people with disabilities to work without losing key essential medical card cover after 3 years.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">My Department is at present considering the steps required to enable these commitments to be implemented. My Department is also examining the steps necessary to give effect to the Towards 2016 commitment to review the eligibility criteria for the assessment of medical cards in the context of medical, social and economic/financial need with a view to clarifying entitlement to a medical card.</P>

	<P>Significant developments have taken place to promote the philosophy of a joined up government approach to disability and mental health.</P>
        <P>The two Acts (Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and Disability Act 2005), provide the new framework within which specialist support services to children and adults with disabilities and mental health will be planned and delivered. The provisions of the EPSEN Act 2004 and the Disability Act 2005 are complementary and designed to cover the spectrum of needs for both adults and children.  This includes transition planning at various stages such as pre-school to primary, primary to second level and into adult services.  The NCSE and the HSE are the two key delivery organisations in both Acts and in order to oversee implementation of both Acts and as provided for in the Action Plan, a Cross Sectoral team has been established, with membership from my Depart<Col N="1695"/>ment, the Department of Education and Science, the HSE and the NCSE, to progress the work in these areas.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 143 together.</P>
        <P>These questions relate to the Directive on Food Supplements (2002/46/EC) which established harmonised rules for the sale and labelling of vitamins and minerals as dietary supplements and introduced a methodology under which maximum levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements will be set.  Article 5 of the Directive provides that the setting of such levels will be based on scientific risk assessment and data on vitamin and minerals intake from other foods while also taking account of what is considered an adequate vitamin and mineral intake for an average person.  The scientific risk assessment will take into account the upper safe levels as determined by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).  The legislative process in the setting of these levels will follow Standing Committee Procedure i.e. the agreement of Member States to a Commission proposal.</P>
        <P>The European Commission consulted widely and the Irish response was formulated following a public consultation which took place during August and September, 2006.  That response suggested that the Commission should proceed on a cautious basis, setting maximum limits for as many vitamins and minerals as possible based on <Col N="1696"/>scientific evidence.  This arises from concern at the possible and, as yet, unknown risks of excessive intake of certain vitamins and minerals from all sources over a period of time.  It was considered vital that the safety of the general population and the needs of particular subgroups such as pregnant women, children, older people and those on various specialist diets be taken into account in formulating the final position on this issue.</P>
        <P>Examples of known adverse effects associated with over-consumption of some commonly taken vitamins and/or minerals include&mdash;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reduction in iron absorption as a result of ingesting calcium;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer as a result of excessive iron intake;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />significant risk to unborn children of complications arising from vitamin A toxicity, where the mother ingests large doses of pre-formed vitamin A;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />higher cancer mortality rate amongst smokers who ingest large doses of beta-carotene (despite the belief that it may afford some protection against chronic diseases  &mdash; mainly cancer); and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />over-consumption of folic acid leading to masking of vitamin B12 deficiency-related anaemia in older people.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">In July of this year the Commission produced an Orientation Paper on the setting of those levels: the paper also addresses a similar provision of the Fortification Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 in regard to setting maximum levels of vitamins and minerals added to foods.   The first meeting of a Working Group of Member States experts to discuss that paper was held on 24 September last: discussions at the Working Group will inform a Commission Proposal for a Directive which must be published by January 2009.   My Department will take account of the views of Irish consumers and industry stakeholders, as well as the discussions of the Working Group, and these will influence the final position taken in future discussions on this issue.</P>
        <P>To date, EFSA, at the Commission&rsquo;s request, has given an opinion on upper levels for 16 nutrients and a further 19 nutrients have not yet had a level set &mdash; due to a lack of data based on oral intake dose-response studies.  However, other scientific bodies (in the UK and the US) have established levels for many of those remaining nutrients.  The Commission has proposed in the Orientation Paper that in the case of certain nutrients where studies have indicated evidence of no or low toxicity even at high level dosage, that it may be possible to waive the setting of maximum levels.  The Commission consider this a proportionate approach which is in line with the principle of better regulation.  The Commission <Col N="1697"/>has also proposed to refer to the figures from the US and UK bodies in the absence of EFSA figures in order to attempt setting the levels.</P>
        <P>My Department does not gather data on the extent of vitamin or mineral supplements usage.  In general, healthy people obtain adequate levels of nutrients by eating a variety of foods in moderation rather than by taking supplements.  In addition, in Ireland an increasing range of foods are fortified by manufacturers through the addition of vitamins and minerals. As almost any nutrient can be potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities over a long period, the absence of scientifically based maximum levels of vitamins or of minerals could lead to their inadvertent over-consumption.  There is also the possibility of interactions between dietary supplements and prescription drugs and among several dietary supplements taken at the same time which underlines the desirability of a cautious and science based approach.  Finally, the setting of maximum levels for vitamins and minerals should not, in itself, cause major cost or hardship.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, which was launched in January 2006, provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health services for a seven to ten year period.  The Government has accepted the Report as the basis for the future development of mental health services.  An independent Monitoring Group was established in March 2006, to monitor and assess progress by the Health Service Executive, government departments and other agencies in implementing the recommendations set out in the Report. The Monitoring Group&rsquo;s first annual report was published in May 2007.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the individual recommendations of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, is a matter primarily for the HSE.  In July 2006, the HSE established an implementation group to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; a reality.  In acknowledging the need to provide a dedicated and coordinated response to <Col N="1698"/>&ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, the HSE appointed a full time Project Manager to progress the prioritised implementation plan.  The HSE intend to publish an implementation plan shortly which is to include a timed and prioritised set of short, medium and longer term goals.</P>

        <Quest> the measures in place to ensure that Ireland is prepared for a possible pandemic of avian influenza; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24020/07]</QRef><Col N="1700"/>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it the question relates to a possible human flu pandemic.  For the sake of clarity, avian flu is primarily a disease of birds. To date, there have been a small number of human cases of infection with the avian flu (H5N1) virus in situations where there has been very close contact with infected birds.  There is no evidence of efficient human to human transmission.  I would like to draw a very clear distinction between avian flu and the possibility of a future human flu pandemic.  Experts advise that such a pandemic may arise from the avian flu (H5N1) virus, but this is by no means inevitable.  Nevertheless, the pandemic threat is real: while neither the timing nor the severity of the next pandemic can be predicted, experts advise it is a matter of when it arrives not if.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Health Service Executive published the National Pandemic Influenza Plan on 15th January 2007.  The purpose of the plan is to limit the effects of a potential pandemic and to inform the public about pandemic influenza, to explain what the Government and the health services are doing to prepare for a possible pandemic, and to give information on what members of the public need to do if there is a pandemic.</P>
        <P>Also published on 15th January was Pandemic Preparedness for Ireland: Advice of the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group.  This document outlines clinical guidance and provides public health advice to health professionals and others involved in pandemic influenza preparedness and response.  It was published as a draft consultation document.  The consultation period is now closed and the Expert Group is reviewing the guidance with reference to latest international developments.  The revised version will be published within the next few months.</P>
        <P>The National Pandemic Influenza Plan will be updated as required to reflect the most up to date advice of the Expert Group and international developments.  The health service response to pandemic influenza is based on eight core elements: communications strategy, telephone hotline, responsibilities of the public, surveillance, antiviral drugs, pandemic vaccine, reorganisation of health services, and essential supplies.  These elements are detailed in the plan.</P>
        <P>The development of a robust emergency plan based on the National Pandemic Influenza Plan is a priority for the Health Service Executive.  The HSE National Service Plan sets out key deliverables for the development of specific emergency plans for an influenza pandemic across all directorates and functions.  In particular these plans should address:&mdash;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />For the National Hospitals Office: bed capacity, ventilation capacity, role of private hospitals, ambulance transport requirements;</P><Col N="1701"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />For Primary, Community and Continuing Care: redeployment of staff to support care settings and supports;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />For Population Health: plans for surveillance, contact tracing, and management of cases.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">All directorates and functions across the HSE are required to address the issue of redeployment of staff to manage essential services and business continuity issues.  In addition, National Procurement will manage the purchase, storage and distribution of the National Stockpile of Medicines and Supplies.  Human Resources will manage the industrial relations agenda arising from the pandemic influenza plan.  ICT will design, scope and implement the information technology solutions required, for example around the telephone hotline.</P>
        <P>The National Pandemic Influenza Plan concentrates on the health response to pandemic influenza but also provides some advice on the planning which must take place across all sectors of society.  In this context, my Department established a Standing Inter-Departmental Committee in 2006 to provide advice on non-health areas of public policy or public services to ensure a coordinated cross -Government response. In February 2007, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment published a guidance document for businesses on preparing for a pandemic.</P>
        <P>The National Public Health Emergency Team is the forum for managing the interface between my Department and the HSE during the planning and response phases of a public health emergency.  The team is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  It met for the first time in October 2006 and meets on a quarterly basis or as required during the planning phase.  The National Public Health Emergency Team met last week.  Significant progress over the last year was noted, but it was also recognised that there is a need to continue work on pandemic planning over the next two to three years, with the focus on cross-Government response and detailed planning at the local level.</P>

Excluding the Long Stay Repayment Scheme the HSE non-capital or current expenditure outturn, in vote spending terms, for the period to end September is some &euro;284m ahead of profile. The Accounting Officer has informed me that he has put measures in place, the aim of which is to bring back spending to the approved level by year-end. The measures, including those relating to services, are aimed at bringing back activity to those levels/targets set in the HSE Service Plan for 2007. The progress of the measures will be received at the end of each month.</P>
        <P>Regarding the HSE capital spending, I have been informed by the Accounting Officer that, based on progress to date, the 2007 Capital programme funding will be fully utilised.  Having regard to the reported position, I do not intend to seek additional funding for the HSE by way of a supplementary estimate.</P>

	<P>Quality standards for sympto<Col N="1703"/>matic breast disease services have already been developed by a group established by the Minister and were subsequently endorsed by the Board of the Health Information and Quality Authority. The Authority will be monitoring compliance with these standards by the Health Services Executive. HIQA has also invited all public and private hospitals to participate in a self assessment exercise which will be conducted over the next few months.  I have called on hospitals in the independent sector to take steps to ensure that their breast cancer services comply with these standards and I have brought the standards to the attention of private healthcare insurers.  The HSE recently announced a major re-configuration of the delivery of cancer care in this country which will involve the provision of services from dedicated centres of excellence.</P>

	<P>MRSA is not a notifiable disease.  However, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the HSE collects data on MRSA.  The data is collected on the first episode of bloodstream infection of MRSA per patient per quarter.  This system shows that there were 445 cases in 2002, 480 cases in 2003, 553 cases in 2004, 592 cases in 2005 and 588 cases in 2006.

<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>Tackling Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) including MRSA is a priority for the government and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The HSE has established a National Infection Control Action Plan.  The Infection Control Steering Group is Chaired by Dr. Pat Doorley, National Director (Population Health) and is responsible for reducing infection levels in Ireland&rsquo;s health care facilities.  Over the next three to five years the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  These targets will be achieved through the development of national and local level action plans to reduce the potential for spread of infections between persons in healthcare settings, and in addition will focus on reducing antibiotic use in Ireland.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.</P>
        <P>The HSE have issued hygiene and infection control standards for all hospitals and have begun initiatives on reducing antibiotic consumption.  In addition, the HSE is currently appointing a number of new infection control nurses, surveillance scientists and antibiotic pharmacists.  These staff will strengthen specialist support for infection control and facilitate the development of the national surveillance system.</P>
        <P>Each hospital has been mandated to carry out hygiene audits at least annually.  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has completed its first Hygiene Services Assessment Scheme incorporating unannounced hospital hygiene inspections.  Its report is expected shortly.  HIQA is currently working with the HSE to produce national infection control standards.  When these are introduced they will have the status of approved standards under the Health Act 2007 and their implementation will be monitored by HIQA.</P>
        <P>I have instructed the HSE that designated private beds should be used where isolation facilities are required for patients who contract MRSA.  While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of infection and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.  The HSE has informed my Department that since the commencement of the scheme over 30,000 claims have been received and to date over 3,500 payments totalling over &euro;71.5m have issued while over 6,250 offers of repayment totalling over &euro;117m have been made. The HSE have also informed my Department that over 2,800 applications have been rejected up to 5 Oct 2007.</P>
        <P>The time taken to process each application varies depending on the complexity of the application and the availability of accurate records to calculate repayment. The scheme is progressing as speedily as possible and every effort is being made to complete repayments. The HSE has indicated that the delays in making repayments under the scheme have been due to legal and technical issues.  Firstly, over 14,000 estates who lodged claims to date had not extracted a grant of representation in respect of the estate of the deceased patient.  In these instances the person entitled to extract the grant of representation has to be identified before an application can be processed and to date over 6,800 certificates of entitlement permitting individuals to apply for a repayment have issued.</P>
        <P>Secondly, there has been a high incidence of claimants providing insufficient information and these claims have taken longer to process as the scheme administrator must be provided with certain information in order to ensure that the correct person and correct amount is repaid. Thirdly, it has been necessary for the scheme administrator to visit over 330 HSE facilities to scan records which form the basis for the calculation of repayments. The format in which this information is held varies widely between institutions and usually includes a mixture of paper files, handwritten files and computer files.</P>
        <P>Priority had been given to repaying living applicants as they were most immediately affected but repayments to estates have now commenced. A two year timeframe has been allotted to the Scheme and the HSE and the scheme administrator are confident that all claims submitted by the public, including those submitted by the relatives of deceased patients will be processed within that timeframe.</P>

	<P>The transfer of services from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to new facilities at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital is not due to take place for a number of years.  In the meantime, two additional linear accelerators will be commissioned at St. Luke&rsquo;s in early 2008 and two replacement linear accelerators will be commissioned later in 2008.  These will provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology.  No decisions have yet been taken in relation to the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke&rsquo;s.  However, I intend to ensure that these resources are utilised in the best interest of the health services.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 141 together.</P>
        <P>I have frequent meetings with the Chairman and Chief Executive of the HSE where financial management and service development are discussed. My Department also has ongoing contact with the HSE on a wide range of subjects.  There are close to 130,000 people employed in the delivery of our public health and personal social services the vast majority of whom provide direct service to patients and clients.  The current pause in recruitment must be viewed in this context.  It is a temporary measure put in place by the HSE to live within its budget. It will be reviewed at the end of October and it is being monitored by the HSE on a week by week basis. I have frequent meetings with the Chairman and Chief Executive of the HSE where financial management and service development are discussed. My Depart<Col N="1709"/>ment also has ongoing contact with the HSE on a wide range of subjects.</P>
        <P>The HSE must be able to manage within the resources made available to it by Government and voted by the D&aacute;il.  It should not come as a surprise to anyone that managing the budget in the health sector means managing staff. Staff costs make up almost 70% of the HSE&rsquo;s overall budget.   It is unreasonable to suggest that in a service of this scale, with an employee cohort of this size, that every vacancy which arises must be filled immediately, and, if it is not filled immediately, that dire consequences will result. Living within budget and making the best use of the available resources is an essential task of any sound organisation.   Reforming our health system is not just about extra funding and extra posts. It&rsquo;s about ensuring that the extra money which has already been invested by the Government on behalf of the Irish people is being used wisely and is being used efficiently.</P>
        <P>Many of the actions taken by the HSE to control its rate of spending in the last three months of this year have demonstrably no effect on front line services and some of the claims made about alleged effects on services are without justification.  For example, the cancellation of foreign travel and the release of temporary summer holiday cover staff cannot mean a reduction of services.  Claims of this nature should be assessed in the context of the HSE&rsquo;s overall activity levels. For each of the last three months of this year, there will be over 100,000 patients treated as in-patients or on a day case basis in publicly-funded acute hospitals.  That will continue to be the case.</P>
        <P>However, I would emphasise, and the HSE recognises, the importance of staying within annual budgets and staffing levels, and managing activity throughout the year, so that planned annual service increases are achieved in an orderly manner over the whole year.  It is ultimately no service to patients for hospitals or any other cost centres to over-run budgets and staffing levels in the early part of the year, causing a slowdown of activity in their own service or in any other service later on.  Any postponement of <Col N="1710"/>an operation or service arising is naturally very disappointing to individual patients and clients.</P>

        <asker>Deputy John Perry</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest> the amounts by which each hospital has overspent their budget as at end of September 2007; if she is still confident that the recruitment ban and cutbacks will not affect frontline services; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The latest reports available to me from the HSE, for the period to end August 2007 show that overall the National Hospital Office is some &euro;162m in excess of its period budget.  The table gives details of the spend of each hospital against its agreed budget. Those hospitals with the highest overspend include Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital, Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital Navan and Portlaoise General Hospital.  It is also worth noting the hospitals that are staying within, or very close to their budgets, e.g. the Regional in Dooradoyle, Limerick, Holles Street and Waterford Regional.  It is very clear that if every hospital performed as efficiently as the best we would achieve both better cost control and better services.</P>
        <P>Professor Drumm has informed his board that, through a combination of some additional funding and remedial measures, he is aiming for a break-even position in 2007. The statistics on hospital activity to end August indicate the overall the targets set in the Service Plan for the National Hospital Office in 2007 are some 2 &mdash; 5% up for In-patient Services, 4.1% for Day Cases and 7.5% for Out-patients. The measures are aimed at discretionary spending in the first instance, suspension of recruitment for a specified period and at bringing back activity to target or funded levels activity. The measures are subject to a continuous review by the HSE National Hospital Office.</P>
        <P>In the event that these measures are not sufficient to achieve a financial break-even, it may be necessary to implement additional measures, given the statutory responsibility of the Accounting Officer to contain spending to the level approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P><Col N="1709"/>

        <asker>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest> her views on widening the availability of medical cards in view of the return to the Exchequer of nearly &euro;23 million assigned to that budget for 2006, according to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24003/07]</QRef>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Expenditure on the General Medical Services Scheme is funded from the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s (HSE) revenue budget.   The final out-turn on Vote expenditure for the Health Service Executive, in 2006, shows a capital saving of &euro;114m of which &euro;42m was used to offset a revenue overspend across the HSE&rsquo;s activities as a whole and a further &euro;47m was used to offset a shortfall in Appropriations-in-Aid.   This left a balance of &euro;25m to be surrendered to the Exchequer.  The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Appropriation Account for 2006 shows an overall surrender of &euro;365m, &euro;25m capital and &euro;340m in respect of the Long Stay Repayment Scheme.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government commits to the following:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Indexing the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Doubling of the income limit eligibility of parents of children under 6 years of age, and trebling them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability;</P><Col N="1716"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Allowing people with disabilities to work without losing key essential medical card cover after 3 years;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Implementation of an annual publicity campaign and making applications easier so as to increase uptake amongst those who are eligible for Medical Cards and GP Visit Cards.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">My Department is at present considering the steps required to enable these commitments to be implemented. My Department is also examining the steps necessary to give effect to the <i>Towards 2016 </i>commitment to review the eligibility criteria for the assessment of medical cards in the context of medical, social and economic/financial need with a view to clarifying entitlement to a medical card.</P>

        <Quest> the steps she will take in consultation with the Health Service Executive to deal with the ongoing crisis with MRSA; her views on whether this is now not only a crisis issue for the elderly but also for younger patients going in for routine operations who leave the hospital with MRSA and have to deal with it in their own home, and that overcrowding and lack of beds is part of the difficulty in controlling this and other diseases where proper cleansing and disinfecting need to be carried out; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145, 182, 237 and 238 together.</P>
        <P>Tackling Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs), including MRSA is a priority for the government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).  I share the public concern in relation to MRSA.  The HSE has established a National Infection Control Action Plan.  The Infection Control Steering Group is Chaired by Dr. Pat Doorley, National Director (Population Health) and is responsible for reducing infection levels in Ireland&rsquo;s health care facilities.  Over the next three to five years the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%. Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  These targets will be achieved through the development of national and local level action plans to reduce the potential for spread of infections between persons in healthcare settings, and in addition will focus on reducing antibiotic use in Ireland.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.</P>
        <P>The HSE have issued hygiene and infection control standards for all hospitals and have begun initiatives on reducing antibiotic consumption.  In addition, the HSE is currently appointing a number of new infection control nurses, surveillance scientists and antibiotic pharmacists.  These staff will strengthen specialist support for infection control and facilitate the development of the national surveillance system.</P>
        <P>It is unrealistic to try to isolate the overall cost of combating HCAIs.  Reducing the incidence of these infections will not alone improve patient care but will also generate savings in the cost of service delivery.  Each hospital has been mandated to carry out hygiene audits at least annually.  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has completed its first Hygiene Services Assessment Scheme incorporating unannounced hospital hygiene inspections.  Its report is expected shortly.  HIQA is currently working with the HSE to produce national infection control standards.  When these are introduced they will have the status of approved standards under the Health Act 2007 and their implementation will be monitored by HIQA.</P>
        <P>A primary element of the fight against healthcare-associated infections involves chang<Col N="1718"/>ing practices and procedures and the way in which many health care staff go about their daily work.  Hygiene is a significant issue in our hospitals. It impacts hugely on inspection rates. Hand hygiene is the most important form of hygiene in this regard, but hygiene in general is important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Two national hygiene audits have taken place over recent years.  Great improvements were made between the first and second audits carried out in 2005 and 2006.  Almost every hospital had increased its overall score.  Only 2 hospitals received a &rsquo;poor&rsquo; score in 2006 compared with 26 in the first audit and the percentage of hospitals achieving a &lsquo;good&rsquo; score moved up from 9% in 2005 to 60% last year.  These audits most definitely represented a significant step forward in relation to improving hygiene in our hospitals.</P>
        <P>In addition the HSE has developed a media campaign which aims to educate patients, visitors and staff about the importance of hand hygiene in all areas of hospital activity.</P>
        <P>In relation to the issue of overcrowding in hospitals, focussed efforts under the Winter initiative scheme have achieved a reduction in the numbers of patients waiting for admission on trolleys in A&amp;E and a reduction in the time those patients spend waiting.  Admission lounges have been put in place in a number of hospitals to ensure that patients are treated with dignity while awaiting admission.  A number of new A&amp;E Departments commissioned in 2005/06 have provision for minor injury clinics, including Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Cork University Hospital, St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital which reduce the burden on busy A&amp;E departments.  In 2006, over 1,000 additional extended care places were provided through privately contracted arrangements.  In relation to 2007, the HSE has developed proposals to contract a further 450 beds in private nursing homes throughout the country.  There are also proposals for an additional 450 beds within the public system.  Additional home-care packages have been put in place to facilitate discharge from hospital to the patient&rsquo;s own home.</P>
        <P>I have instructed the HSE that designated private beds should be used where isolation facilities are required for patients who contract MRSA.  While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of infection and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>

        <Quest> the number of pathology laboratories here that hold recognised accreditation; if she has plans to introduce legislation to require accreditation; her views on concerns that laboratories in the US that are carrying out tests for patients here have different codes of <Col N="1719"/>practice; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Prior to the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) this year, accreditation was carried out by the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board.  This has now been taken over by HIQA.  The bulk of work on accreditation has been carried out in the acute hospital sector, for which an Acute Care Assessment Scheme was developed.  This scheme provides a quality and safety framework involving standards of excellence, self assessment and skills of trained peer review and service user surveyors and covers all aspects of each participating hospital &mdash; including laboratories within the hospital.  The scheme is voluntary. However currently over 95% of public acute hospitals have applied for accreditation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are a number of other accreditation schemes available for the private sector. There are also a number of agencies which provide accreditation for medical laboratories such as the Irish National Accreditation Board which accredits medical laboratories to ISO 15189, which is the internationally recognised standard of best practice in medical laboratories.  This, too, is a voluntary process.</P>
        <P>In January 2007, I established the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance to develop proposals for a health service wide system of governance based on corporate accountability for the quality and safety of all health services.  One of its terms of reference is to specifically examine and make recommendations in relation to a statutory system of licensing for public and private health care providers and services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to the use of US laboratories for carrying out testing, I understand from the Health Service Executive that the National Hospitals Office outsourced the backlog of cervical smears earlier this year.  The tests were conducted at fully accredited laboratories in Quest&rsquo;s Houston and Chicago.  All Quest&rsquo;s Diagnostics&rsquo; testing locations are subject to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) certification and maintain current CLIA licenses.  Quest Diagnostics&rsquo; main laboratories are accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and the above labs have CAP and CLIA approval.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Quest laboratories use the internationally accepted Bethesda methodology for reporting pap smears. This methodology is utilised world wide with the exception of Ireland and England which uses the British Society of Cytology standards.  As the Besthesda method is the dominant world wide, the EU requires that the British standards be fully translatable with Bethesda.</P>

	<P>As part of its management of A &amp; E services the HSE has been working to identify areas of best practice within networks, and to replicate these elsewhere in order to improve the delivery of A &amp; E services and acute hospital services generally for the benefit of patients. One of the best examples of this involves the development of Acute Medical Assessment Units in acute hospitals where patients who may not require admission, but do need investigation and treatment, can be referred directly to the Unit by general practitioners.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy&rsquo;s question, concerning arrangements between general practitioners and hospitals, relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The health service employs almost 130,000 personnel and this equates to 111,570 wholetime equivalents (WTEs) as at 30 June 2007, excluding home helps.  This employment level includes the Health Service Executive, Voluntary Hospitals and Voluntary providers of Service for People with a Disability.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Over the period since the establishment of the Health Service Executive, recorded health service employment has increased by 13% (12,847 WTEs).  Since the establishment of the HSE, the number of Medical &amp; Dental personnel has increased by 13.02% (913).  This includes an increase of 306 (+16.34%) in the number of Hospital Consultants.  The number of nursing personnel has increased by 4,296 (+12.52%) to 38,609 (or by 2,848 and 8.3% when student nurses are factored out).  The number of Health and Social Care Professionals increased by 2,611 (+20.35%) to 15,411.  I would draw the Deputy's attention, in particular, to increases of 32% (Dieticians), 35% (Occupational Therapists), 24% (Physiotherapists) and 30% (Speech &amp; Language Therapists).  The Clerical and Administrative staffing has remained stable at 16.4% of overall staffing and General Support Staffing has fallen from 13.95% to 11.87% of overall staffing.</P>
<?oasys _ic0- ?>
        <P>I am informed that the vast majority of Clerical and Administrative staff work in hospitals and community based services and perform key functions in relation to patients.  However, it is important to set the right balance between these posts and clinical posts.  In that regard, the HSE has commissioned an independent study to examine the number of management/admin staff and the proportion of such staff engaged in front line services.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 245 together.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to review the decision to locate the new National Paediatric Hospital on a site to be made available at the Mater Hospital, Dublin.  As the House is aware, a joint Health Service Executive/Department of Health and Children Task Group was established in February 2006 to advise on the optimum location for the development of a new National Paediatric Hospital.  The Task Group recommended that the new hospital be developed as an independent hospital on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital.  This recommendation was accepted by the Board of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Following the Government&rsquo;s decision to endorse the recommendation of the HSE Board, a joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Transition Group was established to advance the development of the national tertiary paediatric hospital on the Mater site.  A high level framework brief for the new hospital, developed for the Transition Group by Rawlinson Kelly &amp; Whittlestone Ltd (RKW), an established UK-based health care planning company, is virtually complete.  The brief will set out the preferred model of care, the core services to be delivered at the new hospital, and the additional range of services to be provided in an urgent/ambulatory care setting.</P>
        <P>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has been established.  The primary function of the Board is to plan, design, build, furnish and equip the new national paediatric hospital.  Since its establishment, the Board has had the opportunity to familiarise itself with the project and to prepare for the recruitment of a Chief Officer, and the implementation of the High Level Framework Brief.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Cost comparisons between the public and private hospital sectors are difficult to make.  For example, private hospital costs and prices include capital costs in the form of depreciation whereas in the public hospitals these are funded separately and are excluded from Casemix averages.  Also, public hospitals carry an additional cost in that they cater for training and education of medical and nursing personnel.</P>
        <P>Obtaining value for the Exchequer for funding allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is a key priority for the NTPF Board.  Over the years, the NTPF has built up checks and balances to ensure that its rates are competitive and suitable for the circumstances.  The checks and balances employed include comparing the price that the NTPF is offered by a private hospital to:&mdash;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Prices available to NTPF in other private hospitals.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Costs quoted in the latest available Casemix data.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Prices quoted by private insurers (for example,VHI).</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A projected price built up from the NTPF&rsquo;s knowledge of the likely constituent costs of a particular treatment (e.g. estimating likely fees, accommodation, tests, etc).</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Occasionally, international data on treatment prices.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Fund operates on an input-output basis.  That is, for a known resource the NTPF can quantify the volume of service provided and the costs of <Col N="1724"/>each patient episode is known.  Casemix, the mechanism used for costing in the public hospital system, provides the cost of treating patients with similar conditions rather than the cost of a particular procedure.</P>

	<P>In March 2000 the then Minister for Health and Children established the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction (CAHR). Its terms of reference were: &lsquo;To prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human repro<Col N="1725"/>duction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area.&rsquo;</P>
        <P>The CAHR was comprised largely of persons with expert knowledge spanning medical, scientific, social and legal domains. This expertise was a prerequisite to a precise examination of the issues concerned.  The Commission published its report in May 2005. Its report was the first step in determining a policy response to Assisted Human Reproduction (AHR) and it made 40 recommendations on AHR services in Ireland. The key recommendation of the Commission is that a regulatory body should be established by an Act of the Oireachtas to regulate AHR services in Ireland. The Commission proposed that this body be accountable to the Minister for Health and Children and that it would have regulatory and executive powers in relation to permitted AHR services.</P>
        <P>The Government decided to refer the report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children so that the Committee could consider and report in due course on its views of the recommendations of the Commission. The Committee was considered an appropriate forum in which to subject the report to structured democratic and political analysis and scrutiny.</P>

In relation to breast cancer specifically, the HSE plans to have completed 60% of the transition by end 2008 and 90% by end 2009.</P><Col N="1726"/>
        <P>In order to comply with the National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease, the HSE has directed thirteen hospitals with very low case volumes to cease breast cancer services immediately.  The thirteen hospitals concerned performed a combined total number of 55 breast cancer procedures in 2005.  A number of these hospitals had in practice already discontinued symptomatic breast services.  The National Hospitals Office has already planned the redirection of this symptomatic caseload.  Further staged reductions in the number of hospitals providing breast cancer services will occur over the next two years in line with the development of quality assured capacity in the eight designated centres.</P>

	<P>My Department considers that there should be an over-arching policy framework to set out the broad policy guidelines for development of policy on cardiovascular health, including stroke. The Cardiovascular Health Policy Group (CHPG), chaired by Professor Hannah McGee, has been appointed by Minister Harney to develop this framework. The CHPG had its inaugural meeting on 19th September and is due to complete its work by the end of April 2008.  In addition, a national audit of stroke services has recently been undertaken by the Irish Heart Foundation in association with the HSE with significant funding provided by my Department. A stroke strategy is currently being developed by the HSE. This is due to be finished by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>In the last two years the Health Service Executive (HSE), and the voluntary sector funded by the HSE, have undertaken specific actions in regard to service provision for people with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), such as the expansion of neurological services and the planned development of the rehabilitation capacity in the National Rehabilitation Hospital and Merlin Park Hospital.  The issue of ABI, and service planning and provision for people with ABI has been, and continues to be a matter for discussion and examination between my Department and the HSE.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Poverty proofing was introduced in 1998 on foot of a commitment in the first National Anti-Poverty Strategy.  It is defined as &ldquo;the process whereby Government policies and programmes are assessed at design, implementation and review stages in relation to their impact on poverty and on inequalities which are likely to lead to poverty, with a view to poverty reduction&rdquo;.  The Cabinet Handbook, published by my Department, includes a requirement that Memoranda for Government should indicate clearly, as appropriate, the impact of significant policy proposals for persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion.</P>
        <P>Following a review of the poverty proofing process, the Office for Social Inclusion produced a revised set of guidelines for what is now termed Poverty Impact Assessment.  This change of name is intended to underline that the emphasis in the process should be on outcomes and that poverty impact assessment should form an integral part of the policy making process.  The revised guidelines are designed to better assist policy makers across all levels of Government in evaluating policy proposals in terms of their potential impact on poverty. They include a number of new steps to make the process more useful and transparent and a requirement to monitor the impact of any policy change.</P>
        <P>Last year, the Office for Social Inclusion held an information meeting in my Department which provided an opportunity to introduce policy-makers to the new Guidelines and to seek feedback about their application.  The implications of policy proposals for poverty are routinely assessed in my Department, in accordance with Cabinet Handbook procedures, and the new Poverty Impact Assessment guidelines are helping to inform that process.   Departments, including my own Department, are working closely with the Office for Social Inclusion to further refine the new guidelines in the light of experience and application.</P>

	<P>The initial application for a Primary Medical Certificate under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax <Col N="1730"/>Concessions) Regulations 1994, is made to the Senior Medical Officer of the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area.  If the Primary Medical Certificate is refused, the person may appeal the refusal to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, National Rehabilitation Hospital, Rochestown Avenue, Dun Laoghaire, Co. Dublin.</P>
        <P>I understand the named person appealed the decision of the Senior Medical Officer not to grant a Primary Medical Certificate and the appeal was subsequently refused by the Medical Board of Appeal. If the named person wishes to apply again for a Primary Medical Certificate, the application to the Senior Medical Officer must be accompanied by a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner indicating that the practitioner has formed the opinion that the medical condition of the person concerned has materially disimproved since the previous application.  I would point out that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions.</P>

        <Quest> the progress made in his Department on the roll out of the poverty impact assessment to ensure that all policies are evaluated in terms of their potential impact on poverty and social inclusion; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24107/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the poverty proofing exercise was reviewed last year by the Office of Social Inclusion.  This led to an updating and re-titling of the process as Poverty Impact Assessment.  A Poverty Impact Assessment is required for significant policy or programme proposals.  One area where my Department has been to the forefront of progress in relation to poverty impact assessment is in the examination of the taxation measures contained in the annual Budget.</P>
        <P>The personal taxation measures and social welfare rate increases and other social welfare changes contained in the Budget are examined using the poverty impact assessment guidelines published by the Office for Social Inclusion.  The personal taxation and social welfare measures contained in each of the Budgets since Budget 2001 were examined using the national anti-poverty strategy guidelines which were the forerunner of the poverty impact assessment guidelines.  The results of these examinations are recorded in the Budget booklets for each of the years in question.</P>
        <P>The best practice guidance in relation to Value for Money and Policy Reviews, which was published by my Department in March 2007, highlights the importance of taking into account Poverty Impact Assessment as part of the evaluation criteria in reviews carried out under this initiative.</P>
        <P>Social Inclusion is an important horizontal theme in the Government&rsquo;s priorities.  The National Strategic Reference Framework approved by the Government in February 2007 <Col N="1740"/>and the Operational Programmes will as far as possible incorporate measures to ensure Social Inclusion and minimise the effects of Social Exclusion in the implementation of the Operational Programmes.  Interventions under the Human Capital Investment Operational Programme in particular will be designed to increase the participation and activation of groups outside the workforce including young people, early school leavers, people with disabilities, migrants, travellers and adults experiencing literacy problems.</P>
        <P>The implementation of poverty impact assessments for all policies covered by the National Development Plan is a matter for line Departments in the first instance.  Combating social exclusion is one of the key aims of the NDP with an entire Sectoral Priority devoted to it.  Some &euro;49.6bn will be invested under the Social Inclusion Priority over the 7 years of the Plan.  Departments will also be asked to indicate each year the impact of relevant Sub-Programme investment on promoting social inclusion.</P>

	<P>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and Vehicle Registration Tax (up to a certain limit) on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, as well as relief from excise on the fuel used in the car, up to a certain limit.  As the Deputy will be aware, there was an interdepartmental review of the Scheme.  However, given the scale and the scope of the scheme, any possible changes can only be made after careful consideration and with regard <Col N="1741"/>to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme and the available resources.  In this context, I consider any possible changes within the framework of the annual Budgetary process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the figure of 2,800 refers to the number of civil servants assigned to decentralising posts at end June 2007.  At end June my Department had assigned one hundred and thirty-one (131) staff to posts decentralising to Tullamore and Kildare.  Of these, thirteen (13) transferred with their posts from Dublin, nineteen (19) transferred on promotion and eighteen (18) were recruited.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) that at end June one hundred and sixty-six (166) people had been assigned to decentralising posts.  Of these, one hundred and forty-four (144) have chosen to transfer with their posts from Dublin, twenty-eight (28) have been promoted and twenty-five (25) are new recruits.  I am also informed by the Public Appointments Service and the Valuation Office that at end June 2007 seventeen (17) staff have been assigned to posts decentralising to Youghal, seven (7) and ten (10) respectively.  Of these seventeen (17), six (6) are transferring with their posts, three (3) are transferring on promotion and eight (8) are new recruits.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that at end June 2007 they had two hundred and eighty- two (282) staff assigned to decentralising posts.  This figure has now increased to two hundred and ninety-one (291) staff who have accepted decentralisation offers for Athy, Listowel, Newcastlewest,  Kilrush and Navan.  Thirty-five (35) officials are transferring with their posts from Dublin, none have been transferred on promotion and five (5) are new recruits.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 172 on 10th October 2007, which sets out the background to the operation of the arrangements in place for civil service general service staff who do not wish to decentralise with their existing or another department.  The primary mechanism for placing Civil Servants who are in posts which are due to decentralise but wish to remain in Dublin is by way of bilateral transfer.  As staff who have applied to decentralise continue to be transferred into decentralising organisations, the posts they vacate become available to those wishing to remain in Dublin.</P>
        <P>Arrangements are managed by the Public Appointments Service for general service grades where a bilateral transfer is not possible. The purpose is to match over time staff who wish to remain in Dublin with appropriate vacancies in Dublin posts as they arise.  The arrangements <Col N="1743"/>allow for prioritisation at certain times of staff in organisations who have an immediate need to be placed in Dublin posts due to the timing of the relocation of their current department or office.  It is intended that the arrangements will continue over the implementation of the Programme and the numbers requiring placement will vary in line with the different phasing arrangements for the decentralising organisations. My department is monitoring these arrangements in co-operation with Departments and the relevant unions to ensure that they are operating efficiently.</P>
        <P>A total of 70 posts have been circulated under these arrangements to date to staff who do not wish to decentralise. Staff have been assigned or nominated for assignment to over half of these and arrangements are in train to assign staff to the remaining posts over the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>The mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Investment Scheme was introduced in the Finance Act 2007.  It is a new pilot tax based scheme for tourism facilities in the mid-Shannon area.  The scheme is aimed at encouraging the development of new tourism infrastructure, or the refurbishment of existing tourism infrastructure, in that area.  Projects wishing to avail of relief must get approval in advance (for which an application must be made within 1 year of the commencement of the scheme) and also must get formal certification after completion.  The legislation provides for the appointment of a mid-Shannon Tourism Infrastructure Board which will be responsible for approving and certifying buildings and structures that qualify for relief under the Scheme.  I expect the guidelines and the relevant application forms to be finalised soon.</P>

	<P>As part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out of the current regime of incentives for supplementary pension provision with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area.  The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.</P><Col N="1745"/>
        <P>The review also drew on newly available 2006 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality.  Arising from the review, the following estimates of the <Col N="1746"/>cost of tax and other reliefs for private pension provision for 2006 have been made.  Further work will be necessary to provide similar estimates for 2005 and this is ongoing.  As similar data sources would not be available for previous years, it is not possible to provide costings on a similar basis for those years.  </P><Col N="1745"/>

	<P>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and Vehicle Registration Tax (up to a certain limit) on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, as well as relief from excise on the fuel used in the car, up to a certain limit.  The disability criteria for these concessions are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.  To get a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of these Regulations.</P><Col N="1746"/>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there was an interdepartmental review of the Scheme.  However, given the scale and the scope of the scheme, any possible changes can only be made after careful consideration and with regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme and the available resources.  In this context, I consider any possible changes within the framework of the annual Budgetary process.</P>

	<P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer is jointly assessed with her spouse for income tax purposes.  Her spouse is self-employed and therefore, as a chargeable person, is obliged to submit annual tax returns.  The taxpayer&rsquo;s spouse should submit a 2003 tax return to enable the issue of a notice of assessment for 2003 (in lieu of form P21).  Tax returns are outstanding for the years 2004 and 2005.  These have been previously requested from the taxpayer&rsquo;s spouse.  On receipt of the outstanding tax returns, notices of assessment for 2004 and 2005 (in lieu of forms P21) will issue to her spouse.  For the year 2006, a notice of assessment (in lieu of form P21) issued to the person&rsquo;s spouse on 13 July 2007.</P>

	<P>The figures  cited recently in the media as being on hospital waiting lists included patients waiting less than three months for their procedure.</P>
        <P>It has long been the practice, under several Governments, not to include patients waiting for hospital treatment for less than 3 months in published waiting list statistics.  For example, in 1997, about 32,000 patients were on such waiting lists for elective treatment.  The population was about 3.7 million.  The total number of acute hospital in-patient treatments was 796,000.  Now the population is 4.2 million, total acute hospital discharges are about 1.1 million, and the comparable number of people waiting for procedures is 21,403.  This counts some procedures that were not included in 1997.</P>
        <P>As a proportion of population and as a proportion of hospital discharges, the number of people waiting is down by approximately 40 and 50 per cent respectively.  Specifically, I have been advised by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) that, at the end of September, the number of adults waiting for more than 3 months was 19,083 and the number of children was 2,320; a total of  21,403.  For the most common procedures, adults and children tend to wait 2-5 months, compared with 2-5 years before the advent of the NTPF in 2002.</P>
        <P>The NTPF and the HSE will continue to address the issue of hospital waiting lists to seek to ensure that patients do not have to wait for unacceptably long periods to obtain the treatment that they require.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 185 and 187 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In June 2005, a number of concerns about<?oasys _jy ?>breast cancer services at Barrington&rsquo;s Hospital, Limerick were expressed over the phone to an official of my Department by a Consultant employed by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The majority of the concerns reflected the fact that the breast cancer service at Barringtons Hospital had a relatively low patient throughput and limited specialist staffing levels.  At that time, there were similar concerns in relation to the fragmentation of cancer services nationally, including breast cancer services, a matter that the Department was seeking to address in the context of the preparation of the National Cancer Control Strategy.  As part of this process, I established an Expert Group in June 2005, on the recommendation of my Department, to develop National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to Barringtons Hospital, my Department was not furnished with any documentary or other evidence in support of the concerns that had been expressed. It formed the view that there was insufficient evidence available to allow it to <Col N="1750"/>pursue these concerns directly with the hospital. This remained the situation up to August this year despite consultations with the HSE and further telephone contacts with the consultant.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In August of this year my Department received correspondence from the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) advising that it had obtained patient-specific information in relation to the adequacy of breast cancer services at Barringtons Hospital from the Consultant who had previously been in touch with my Department.  HIQA indicated that that information had been reviewed by two specialists in the field of symptomatic breast disease.  On the basis of these reviews, HIQA advised that it had formed a view that serious issues existed in relation to the management of current and future patients with symptomatic breast disease at the hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the light of this new information and the briefing I received, officials in my Department, at my request, immediately met with the Management of Barringtons Hospital and obtained agreement to the immediate suspension of all breast cancer work there.  This suspension remains in place.  In co-operation with the hospital, an expert group has been established to undertake a clinical review of the cases of women who attended the symptomatic breast disease services at the Hospital between September 2003 and August last.  The group expects to complete its work in November.</P>
        <P>I recently approved Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services which were developed by the Expert Group that I referred to earlier.  The aim of the Standards is to ensure that every woman in Ireland who develops breast cancer has an equal opportunity to be managed in a centre which is capable of delivering the best possible outcome.  My Department has contacted hospitals in the independent sector urging them to take steps to ensure that their breast cancer services comply with the Standards and has also brought the Standards to the attention of private health care insurance providers.</P>

	<P>The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment, which is in recognition of the higher childcare costs of pre-school children, is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone amounts to expenditure of over &euro;400m in a full year.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose and regardless of whether they live in urban or rural areas.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.</P>
        <P>Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 &mdash; 2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to a requirement, as a condition of funding, that services implement a tiered fee structure.  This was intended to ensure that the grant aid received by services was reflected in reduced fees being charged to disadvantaged parents with non-disadvantaged parents being charged the full cost for their childcare service.</P>
        <P>With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The (CCSS) has been allocated &euro;153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.</P><Col N="1753"/>
        <P>Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services will be required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.  As a self-declaration system, the OMC will validate the returns forwarded by community services and will not require them to engage in means testing of parents.</P>
        <P>In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) will see a &euro;80 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions in respect of shorter hour services).  Parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a &euro;30 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions).  A further subvention of &euro;30 per week will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify under either of these categories will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.</P>
        <P>It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  While it was difficult to ensure that all community services were implementing the required tiered fee structure, the more streamlined arrangements under the new scheme will help to ensure that this will no longer be the case.  The new scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, <Col N="1754"/>which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which will be generated under the new grant application process.  If appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>

	<P>There are no statutory powers available to my Department to address the issue of the cost of private dental treatment. Consequently, the fees charged by dental practitioners for treatment to their private patients is a matter between the practitioner and the patient.  Last month, I announced the research and development of a new National Oral Health Policy. This new oral health policy will be undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the HSE. The development of this new policy will allow a critical examination of the many challenges and issues currently facing the dental sector, including the issues of competition as raised by the Competition Authority in its recent report on the dental profession.</P>

Of course, in any instance where a critical or essential vacancy arises it may be filled through redeployment of existing staff by the Line Manager or re-assignment of responsibilities based on assessment of priority need.  Notwithstanding this, it has been recognised that there are some circumstances where appointment of staff may be necessary in frontline services.  Accordingly, a process has been put in place to evaluate, monitor and approve requests for derogation from the general recruitment pause.  A small group has been established including a representative of the National Hospitals Office, PCCC and other Directorates and this group will meet weekly to consider such applications.</P>

	<P>The National Cancer Control Strategy does not recommend the introduction of a population based screening programme for prostate cancer as there is currently insufficient evidence available.  This position is consistent with the Recommendations adopted by the European Union which advocate the introduction of cancer screening programmes which have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to professional expertise and priority setting for healthcare resources.  The EU proposals do not provide for specific recommendations in respect of screening for prostate cancer.  My Department and the National Cancer Screening Service will keep emerging international evidence under review including the results of randomised trials that are currently being conducted internationally.  </P>
        <P>Appropriate treatment for men diagnosed with prostate cancer is available at major hospitals throughout the country.  Any man who has concerns in relation to prostate cancer should contact his GP who will, where appropriate, refer him to the appropriate services in his area.</P>

	<P>There has been an increase in recent years in the numbers of children being diagnosed with autism in Ireland.  Similar increases have also been experienced in other European countries and in the USA.  What is not clear however, is whether the increase is due to a greater awareness or whether there is actually a true increase in the prevalence of autism.  It is however recognised that the epidemiology of Autistic Spectrum Disorder is undergoing rapid change due in whole or part to better ascertainment and re-clarification.</P>
        <P>The diagnosis is a clinical one i.e. it is based on a variety of observations rather than a defined laboratory investigation.  Hence the evolving concept of an &ldquo;autistic spectrum&rdquo; which stretches from those severely affected to those with only a mild disability.</P>
        <P>In December 2004, the Department of Health &amp; Children, through the Health Research Board, approved expenditure of &euro;5 million on autism research to help improve international understanding of the genetic causes of autism.  This &euro;5 million is the Irish contribution to a new major international research initiative called the Autism Genome Project which will receive a total investment of &euro;12 million from a variety of inter<Col N="1767"/>national organisations over the next three years.  The other co-funders in the international consortium include Autism Speaks (US), the British Medical Research Council (MRC), Genome Canada and Partners, Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), Southwest Autism Research and Resource Centre (SARRC), and the Hilibrand Foundation.  This unique combination of international, public and private partners funding a consortium of clinicians and scientists is a new and welcome departure in the field of autism research.</P>
        <P>The Health Research Board has informed my Department that this funding was awarded as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;2.8m: Professor Michael Gill, Department of Psychiatry, Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />&euro;2.2m: Professor Andrew Green, Director National Centre for Medical Genetics, Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin (affiliated to UCD).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This figure represents the largest tranche of funding to be awarded by any of the four funders within the international consortium.  The Irish researchers are at the forefront in unravelling the genetic determinants of autism and related disorders.  They are using novel state-of-the-art genetic sequencing technology to analyse DNA samples taken from autistic patients to identify candidate genetic markers for autism.  They will collaborate with their international colleagues to then link these genetic markers with clinical outcomes.  This unique international research effort will greatly improve not only our understanding of the causes of autism, but its diagnosis and treatment.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 225 and 226 together.</P>
        <P>There has been a significant increase in acute bed capacity in recent years.  The average number of in-patient beds and day places in public acute hospitals has increased by approximately 1,200 <Col N="1768"/>since 2001, the year of the publication of the Health Strategy.  The increase is continuing.  In the current year the Health Service Executive has indicated that it has commissioned over 100 additional beds and day places across the following hospitals &mdash; Galway, Tullamore, St. Vincent&rsquo;s, and Wexford.  This is part of the current National Development Plan which will provide an additional 458 public beds and day places overall.  We are also creating a further 1,000 public beds through the building by the private sector of private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals, thereby freeing up additional beds for public patients.  The provision of the 1,000 beds will result in no direct capital cost to the Exchequer as the capital costs will be met by the private sector.</P>
        <P>Improving the delivery of Accident and Emergency services continues to be a top priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive.  Our objectives are to further reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who not require admission.  The Health Service Executive continues to report a significant reduction in the number of patients awaiting admission as compared with the same period 12 months ago.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has undertaken a review of future acute bed capacity requirements.  This will enable it to plan for future needs based on evidence and international best practice.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may be aware that one of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; is the development of a national carer&rsquo;s strategy and this commitment is reiterated in the Programme for Government.  The strategy will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community.  While financial support for carers will clearly be a key issue in the strategy, other issues such as access to respite and other services, education, training and employment will also feature strongly.  Co-operation between relevant Government departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs has lead responsibility for the development of the carer&rsquo;s strategy and is currently considering how best to ensure all relevant departments and agencies can be involved in the strategy.

	<P>Since the beginning of 2005 I have introduced a number of significant changes to the manner in which the assessment for medical cards and GP visit cards is undertaken.  The assessment guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29%.  Applications are now considered on the basis of income net of tax and PRSI and allowance is made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work.  In June 2006, I agreed with the Health Service Executive (HSE) a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those used in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government commits to the following:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Indexing the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Implementation of an annual publicity campaign and making applications easier so as to increase uptake amongst those who are eligible for Medical Cards and GP Visit Cards;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Doubling of the income limit eligibility of parents of children under 6 years of age, and trebling them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability;</P><Col N="1772"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Allowing people with disabilities to work without losing key essential medical card cover after 3 years.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">My Department is at present considering the steps required to enable these commitments to be implemented.</P>
        <P>My Department is also examining the steps necessary to give effect to the Towards 2016 commitment to review the eligibility criteria for the assessment of medical cards in the context of medical, social and economic/financial need with a view to clarifying entitlement to a medical card.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these <Col N="1774"/>apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs.

	<P>As of 1 January 2008 no new nursing home subventions will be granted. On that date, the subvention scheme will be replaced by the new Nursing Home Support Scheme &mdash; A Fair Deal. People who are already in receipt of a subvention can either continue to receive their subvention or apply for support under the Fair Deal. All new applicants for nursing home support will apply under the Fair Deal. </P>
        <P>The current system of nursing home support is not predictable or sustainable. People who need care face different costs depending on whether they are in public or private nursing homes.  People in private nursing homes may qualify for a nursing home subvention but are otherwise required to meet the full costs of their care.  Subventions are means-tested and take a person&rsquo;s income and assets into account.  In particular, the means test imputes an income of 5% from housing assets, and effectively assumes people have a higher assessable income than they currently have.</P>
        <P>Therefore:- Many people who do get support &mdash; subvention payments &mdash; cannot afford to pay the balance of their costs. As a result, people are sometimes forced to sell or mortgage their homes to pay for their care, or must rely on contributions from their family or friends.  Many people do not receive any support from the State.</P>
        <P>The Fair Deal aims to remedy the above situation.  Under the new scheme, a person will make a contribution towards their care costs and the State will meet the full balance of cost in homes approved for the purpose.  This will ensure that long-term residential care is affordable for all who need it.  The means assessment for the scheme will work out how much the applicant can contribute to the cost of their care by taking into account their income and assets.</P>
        <P>The immediate contribution by the applicant towards the cost of their care will be based on 80% of their assessable income, i.e. Old Age Pension, private pensions, etc.  Depending on the amount of assessable income, there will also be a Deferred Contribution of up to 5% on the applicant&rsquo;s assets, such as their home. The contribution is deferred because it will not have to paid <Col N="1777"/>during the applicant&rsquo;s lifetime.  Of course, the person can choose to pay the contribution on assets at the time of receiving care if they so wish.</P>
        <P>Under A Fair Deal, anyone who is assessed as needing long-term nursing care can apply for support under the scheme. The scheme is voluntary. Every person will make a fair contribution to the cost of their care, based on their means.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, additional funding of &euro;75m for revenue purposes was provided to the Health Service Executive for Disability Services in the 2007 Budget.  This amount incorporates the 2007 element of the Government&rsquo;s multi-annual investment programme for the National Disability Strategy.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision to transfer St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital was taken by the Government in the context of its consideration of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology Services.  The decision is designed to ensure that radiation oncology, one element of cancer care, is integrated with all other aspects of care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  I am convinced that this model will provide better patient centred treatment with improved quality of service and outcome for patients.  </P>
        <P>The Board of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government&rsquo;s decision in this regard.  A transfer on similar lines took place last year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred to Belfast City Hospital, a major academic teaching hospital.  In progressing the transfer, I will build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke&rsquo;s.  I have ensured that experts at St. Luke&rsquo;s are centrally involved in the planning and delivery of the National Plan.</P>
        <P>The transfer of services from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital to new facilities at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital is not due to take place for a number of years.  In the meantime, two additional linear accelerators will be commissioned at St. Luke&rsquo;s in early 2008 and two replacement linear accelerators will be commissioned later in 2008.  These will provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the National Plan.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; was launched in  January 2006 and has been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of mental health services.  This policy envisions an active, flexible and community-based mental health service where the need for hospital admission will be greatly reduced.  It will require substantial funding, but there is considerable equity in buildings and lands within the current mental health system, which could be realised to fund this plan.  &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; recommends that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals and to re-invest the resources released by these closures in the mental health service.  </P>
        <P>The closure of mental hospitals and the reinvestment of the proceeds will take place on a phased basis.  Hospitals can only close when the clinical needs of the remaining patients have been addressed in more appropriate settings such as additional community residences, day hospitals and day centres together with a substantial increase in the number of well trained, fully staffed, community-based multidisciplinary Community Mental Health Teams as is recommended in a A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P>The identification of assets and the assessment of their value is the responsibility of the HSE National Director of Estates. While the funds which will be realised from the sale of psychiatric hospitals  will depend on prevailing market forces, I am confident that sufficient funds will be realised to provide the level of community care required.</P>

	<P>Intercountry adoption is regulated by the Adoption Acts 1952-1998. The Acts which are most relevant to intercountry adoption are the Adoption Act 1991 and the Adoption Act, 1998.  There are a number of statutory procedures regulating intercountry adoption. For example, for an intercountry adoption to be recognised in Ireland, all prospective adoptive parents habitually resident in Ireland, must be assessed by the HSE or a registered adoption society and obtain a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt. Countries of origin, through the State or its agents, will seek an assurance that prospective adoptive parents have been appropriately assessed and counselled before placing a child with them.</P>
        <P>Section 8 (1) of the Adoption Act, 1991 provides a health board shall carry out an assessment when requested  and as soon as practicable for people intending to adopt from abroad. While the assessment procedures are based on a model in which prospective adoptive parents have a self-selection role, the State has the ultimate responsibility in deciding whether they have the capacity to parent an adopted child.</P>
        <P>While the Adoption Board can overturn a negative recommendation from the HSE, it is obliged to pass on the assessment report as the provision in the 1991 Act states:</P>
<P LI="1" FLI="0">&ldquo; [the assessment report] shall be made available by the Board to the person or persons who <Col N="1782"/>are the subject of the declaration and to any person in the place where the adoption concerned is proposed to be effected having an interest in the matter.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to human resource management issues within the Health Service Executive which, under the Health Act 2004, is a matter in the first instance for the Executive.  Subject to overall parameters set by Government, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of  its Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.</P>
        <P>Legislation regarding Employment Permits/ Green Cards is a matter in the first instance for my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Residency is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In the case of non-EEA nationals, I am advised by the Health Service Executive that their tenure, in the main, is of a fixed term nature arising from the conditions attached to the employment permit of which they are in receipt.  I am also advised by the Executive that all immigrants currently employed in the health service enjoy the same terms and conditions of employment as their fellow colleagues who are similarly employed.</P>
        <P>The HSE through the National Projects Office in Manorhamilton has recruited professional staff from overseas to areas in which they are experiencing long term staffing shortages.  These mainly comprise Specialist Nurses, Midwifes, Specialist Senior Speech and Language and Occupational Therapists.   In the main, they are initially offered contracts of two years duration.  Again this is due to the conditions attached to the Green Card of which they are in receipt.  The Green Card Permit is an employment permit issued to the employee and allows his or her employment in the State by the named employer in the occupation specified on the permit.  It is issued in areas of designated skill shortage (and for salaries greater than &euro;60,000 and not contrary to the public interest) for an initial period of two years and thereafter normally can be renewed indefinitely.  It allows the employee to apply for immediate family re-<Col N="1783"/>unification and will normally allow a pathway to permanent residency after two years.</P>
        <P>Within the period of their employment these HSE personnel are welcome and entitled to apply for permanent positions within the HSE through the normal channels. These candidates, like all applicants, must meet the selection criteria laid down by the HSE in the particular recruitment competition; the conditions attached to their work permit or visa renewal is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and is separate from the recruitment process.</P>

I am advised by the Executive that all aspects of its recruitment and selection processes are based on the principle of assessing the skills, qualities and attributes of applicants against those which have been determined as required for effective performance of the job.  Selection is based on merit and successful candidates demonstrate their suitability for appointment to the post according to predetermined job-related selection criteria which are consistently applied throughout the recruitment process.</P>
        <P>All front-line staff, regardless of country of origin, recruited by the HSE must demonstrate at interview and in their written application a number of core competencies, one of which is communication which covers written, spoken and aural language.  In the case of nurses and midwifes from outside the EU, an English language competency must be demonstrated in the form the ILETs and TOEFL examinations, which are internationally recognised comprehensive <Col N="1784"/>English language tests.  This is a core part of their professional registration/licence to practice from An Bord Altranais (ABA).  This does not apply to Nurses and Midwifes from within the EU.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 263 and 264 together.</P>
        <P>The public information campaign One Small Step encourages drivers in the Greater Dublin Area to examine their car usage patterns and to think about using other ways of getting around, such as walking, cycling or public transport, whenever they can.   The campaign targets car drivers specifically.  The campaign promotes cycling and walking as one of the best ways of getting fresh air, regular exercise, saving money, saving journey time and benefiting the local and general environment.</P><Col N="1794"/>
        <P>It also emphasises safety and points to improved conditions for cyclists in Dublin City Centre since the Port Tunnel opened, with far fewer heavy vehicles in the city centre and extra sections of cycle lane and bus lane (which cyclists can use) on the north quays and, in general, improved the improved traffic environment in the city centre.</P>
        <P>My Department has also provided funding to the Dublin Transportation Office (DTO) who initiated the Safer Routes to School project in 2000, with 6 pilot schemes being implemented. The objectives of the Green Schools Initiative are to raise awareness of sustainable travel and transport, increase the number of children who walk and cycle, increase the number of families who &lsquo;park and stride&rsquo; or &lsquo;carpool&rsquo;, improve safety on the school run by promoting safe practices and awareness of hazards, reduce school-related congestion, and improve physical health and fitness.</P>
        <P>The programme was extended and currently has 29 schools with a combined student population of approximately 10,400 with 545 teachers.  Results from the initiative show that, of journeys to school, between March and June 2006, walking increased by 7% to 40%, and car use decreased by 8% to 46%, while, on the journey from school, walking increased by 4% from 37% to 41% and car use fell by 9%.  A further roll-out of the programme is being considered at present.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently in the process of commissioning research in relation to best practice which will assist in the development of a National Cycling Policy.  This will, in turn, feed into the Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan, which the Government is committed to publishing in the Spring of 2008.  That Plan will specifically address the issues relating to children travelling to and from school.</P>

	<P>The area referred to by Deputy is primarily served by bus-based public transport.  The deployment of buses is an operational matter for Dublin Bus but I understand that as part of the allocation of the 100 additional buses, Dublin Bus has put additional buses on Route 54A which services Harold&rsquo;s Cross and this has resulted in a 25% increase in frequency on the route. </P><Col N="1795"/>
        <P>In addition, Dublin Bus has also recently introduced new routes 74 and 74A from Ballycullen which provide an additional 14 morning peak buses through Terenure. These routes operate 7 days a week.  Terenure further benefited with significant increases in departures on Route 15 from Knocklyon also serving the area.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 includes funding for a feasibility study on the proposed Luas line from the city centre to Dundrum via Rathfarnham and Terenure.  It was announced, on 30 January last, that the RPA would commence work on the Rathfarnham feasibility study in April.   Preliminary work has commenced on this feasibility study and I understand from the RPA that the feasibility study will take a number of months to complete.</P>
        <P>While Transport 21 involves a very large commitment of financial resources, those resources are also finite.  It has therefore been necessary to prioritise the investments to be made over the ten-year period.  There is no financial provision in Transport 21 for the construction of a Luas line to serve the Terenure/Harold&rsquo;s Cross/ Rathfarnham areas.</P>

	<P>The State Airports Act, 2004 provides the framework for the establishment of Shannon and Cork as independent airports. Under the Act, both the Minister for Finance and I will have to be satisfied as to the state of operational and financial readiness of the three airports before any vesting of assets can take place.</P>
        <P>The actual timing of airport restructuring will continue to depend on the creation of the appropriate conditions that will ensure the financial sustainability of each State Airport. I would expect that these conditions would include presentation of forecasts of profitable operations and necessary capacity to finance investment at autonomous airports.  The airports will require coordinated strategies for the achievement of operational and financial readiness and the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) has a key role to play in finalizing the financial framework and coordinating business plans that would enable airport separation to take place. I will be considering the complex issues involved in the coming months.</P>

	<P>A media article on 13th June 2007 reported the possibility of Aer Lingus opening a new base at Belfast. Following a query to the Company by my Department on foot of that article, the Company, on 13th June, indicated that it was considering opening a new base at Belfast and that, if the proposal proceeded, there would be implications for Shannon. An official conveyed the concerns of the Department, from an aviation and regional development perspective, about the implications for Shannon and asked the Chief Executive to give full consideration to the ways in which a new base might be accommodated before arriving at a decision, which he agreed to do. The matter was not brought to my attention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Subsequently, an official of the Department contacted Aer Lingus on 27th July arising from a query to the Company on industrial relations matters. In the course of that conversation, it was confirmed that the Company&rsquo;s plans for a new base had solidified and that a formal announcement was to be made on 8th August.  It was also confirmed that opening the new Belfast base would involve the reallocation of Shannon Heathrow slots to Belfast from early 2008.  The official expressed concern about the impact of the loss of a Shannon-Heathrow service from an aviation and regional policy perspective, emphasised the importance of Aer Lingus commitment to Shannon and indicated that these matters would be raised with the Chief Executive of the company.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In an e-mail to my private office on 27th July the official stated &ldquo;The Company intends to announce the new Belfast base on 8 August. This will involve the reallocation of Shannon-Heathrow slots to Belfast from early 2008&rdquo; and referred to the concerns that he had raised. A meeting with the Chairman and Chief Executive was arranged for the earliest opportunity &mdash; 3rd August &mdash; to enable me to discuss these matters with the Company.   At the meeting with the Chairman and Chief Executive of Aer Lingus on 3rd August, I was informed of the decision to open a hub in Belfast and of the re-allocation of all the Shannon-Heathrow slots to a new Belfast Heathrow service.</P>
        <P>The decision by British Midland that it would not commence a Shannon Heathrow service was made public on 4th October and reported in the <Col N="1797"/>media the following day. I was made aware two days previously, on 2nd October, that the decision was likely to be negative. Prior to that I was kept informed, on an informal basis, of continuing dialogue between the Dublin Airport Authority and Shannon Airport Authority and British Midland. In the normal way of negotiations of this kind the views of progress alternated between optimism and pessimism before a final conclusion was reached.</P>

        <Quest> the reason the Government will not call for an extraordinary general meeting of Aer Lingus to reverse the decision by the management of Aer Lingus to end the Shannon to Heathrow service in view of the commitments given by the Government at the time of floatation that it was retaining the 25.4% stake in Aer Lingus for strategic reasons. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The legal advice available to the Government is that shareholders do not have the power to over-rule management decisions on business matters.  Even if the Government on its own or in conjunction with other shareholders called an EGM and voted for the restoration of the Shannon Heathrow service, the management of Aer Lingus would not be obliged to follow any such direction from its shareholders.  At the time of the IPO the State had two key objectives in retaining a strategic shareholding of 25.4%.  Firstly, this shareholding provides a major impediment to a hostile takeover. </P>
        <P>The second strategic advantage of a shareholding of over 25% is that it enables Government as a shareholder to block special resolutions.  Because of provisions specifically built in to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Aer Lingus at the time of the IPO this provides for the potential for the State to protect against the disposal of Heathrow slots.  The measures put in place at the time of the IPO do not apply to the re-allocation of slot pairs to new or existing bases.</P>

	<P>A US citizen, or a lawful permanent resident, can apply to sponsor a close family relative to enter the United States on an immigrant visa. Eligibility for citizenship is then normally based on legal residency and/or service in the U.S. military. In addition, employers in the US may, in certain circumstances, apply to sponsor non-US nationals for entry.  The undocumented, including the undocumented Irish, are not legally entitled to reside in the United States and are not, therefore, entitled to obtain US citizenship.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As US immigration law is complex, I would recommend that individuals seeking detailed advice should consult an immigration lawyer. Our Embassy in Washington or one of our Consulates in the United States can provide a list of suitable lawyers. Comprehensive information is also available on the United States Government&rsquo;s Citizenship and Immigration Services website www.uscis.gov.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, efforts to bring about comprehensive immigration reform, which would have addressed the status of our undocumented citizens in the United States, failed to get the necessary support in the US Congress earlier this year. Given the present very difficult and divided environment in Congress on immigration, it is now widely considered that such comprehensive legislation is unlikely to be back before Congress in a meaningful way in advance of the next US Presidential and Congressional Elections.</P>
        <P>The Government is determined to explore all possible alternative options, including bilateral arrangements. My recent visit to the United States provided me with the opportunity to discuss the situation with senior members of the Administration and with some of the key central players in Congress. While they emphasized the present extremely difficult environment for making progress on immigration reform in Congress, I was pleased that they were willing to work with us in exploring further possible ways for resolving the position of our undocumented citizens.  This work will now be pursued by the Ambassador and his staff in Washington and will be reviewed by my on an ongoing basis.</P>

        <Quest> if he has ascertained from all public service agencies involved in decentralisation the make-up of the 2,800 people who have taken up posts due to decentralise; the number of these who are transferring with their post from Dublin, who are transferring upon promotion and who are new recruits; and if he will set out the relevant data. </Quest>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign <Col N="1803"/>Affairs, which is Irish Aid&rsquo;s Headquarters, will decentralise to Limerick. This is scheduled to take place in early 2008 on completion and fit-out of the permanent premises in Henry Street. It will involve the relocation to Limerick of 124 posts. Good progress has been made and personnel have either been assigned to, or identified for, 100 posts or approximately 81% of the 124 posts scheduled to be decentralised.  An advance party involving 53 of these officers has already decentralised to interim office premises in Limerick.</P>
        <P>A total of 72 posts in the Directorate, including that of Director General, are filled by officers who have either decentralised to Limerick or signalled their intention to do so.  Fifteen of these officers were already serving within the Department at the time of the announcement of the decentralisation programme in December, 2003.  Another two were assigned to the Department by the Public Appointments Service and subsequently indicated their interest in decentralising. The remainder is made up of forty-two officers who have been recruited from other Departments via the Central Applications Facility for Limerick, ten who have been assigned from inter-departmental promotion panels and three newly-recruited officers.</P>
        <P>In addition, there are currently 13 officers serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, who have also expressed an interest in decentralising to Limerick, and fifteen officers from other Departments, mainly based in provincial locations, who have applied to decentralise through the Central Applications Facility.  These officers will be assigned to the Directorate on a phased basis closer to the time of the completion of the permanent premises.</P>

	<P>Following a review of the poverty proofing process, the Office for Social Inclusion produced a revised set of guidelines for what is now termed Poverty Impact Assessment.  The Office of Social Inclusion presented the new guidelines to officials of my Department and my Department and its agencies, including F&Aacute;S in particular, is following the guidelines in relation to the evaluation of the impact of policies on poverty and social inclusion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since the introduction of the roll-out of poverty impact assessments in 1999 there have been several developments with regard to proofing pro<Col N="1804"/>cesses in F&Aacute;S, including equality proofing, the integration of processes and localising procedures.  Equality, social inclusion and diversity has always been a priority for F&Aacute;S.  The organisation&rsquo;s most recent high-level commitment to ensuring equality for all its customers is articulated through Priority Goal 6 in &lsquo;Building on our Vision: Statement of Strategy 2006-2009&rsquo;: &ldquo;To promote the removal of barriers and help provide supports which ensure access to programmes, services and employment for individuals and groups experiencing exclusion, discrimination and labour market disadvantage.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Priority Goals give rise to a set of actions necessary for implementation, and a series of goal-specific Performance Management Indicators which will measure outcomes and effectiveness.  In the case of Priority Goal 6, these actions will result in the mainstreaming of equality measures throughout all parts of the organisation as a core element of the F&Aacute;S approach to doing business.  The fulfilment of Priority Goal 6 will serve to ensure that the approach to equality is coherent throughout the organisation, and is embedded at the core of all F&Aacute;S practice.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has implemented regional equality proofing activity plans across its Employment Services Division and the process of rolling out equality proofing in other F&Aacute;S operational divisions is underway.  F&Aacute;S is committed to this process through its Statement of Strategy 2006-2009.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is due to relocate to Arklow, Co. Wicklow.  The current NSAI implementation plan anticipates a target date of April 2009 as the completion date for its decentralisation programme; however, this is highly dependent on the resolution of matters at central level concerning the transfer of staff within the public service and other staffing related issues.  The accommodation requirements for the NSAI in Arklow are being addressed by the OPW but to date there has been no progress in identifying and securing suitable office accommodation in the Arklow area.</P>
        <P>Issues concerning the suitability of the accommodation occupied by NSAI in Glasnevin, which have been ongoing for some time, have given rise for an immediate requirement for suitable office accommodation to enable the Authority to provide its services in an efficient manner.  The <Col N="1805"/>Authority recently decided to proceed with the consideration of securing office facilities in the north Dublin area to accommodate the staff currently based in Glasnevin. Leasing agreements will provide for break clauses in accordance with normal business practice.  At this point the NSAI has initiated a building selection process with a view to occupation in early 2008.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding changes in the NSAI&rsquo;s existing office accommodation it continues to be part of the decentralisation programme and will continue to engage in preparations for relocation to Arklow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary agencies under the remit of my Department with responsibility for supports and initiatives for small and medium enterprises in Donegal are Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Donegal County Enterprise Board (CEB).  Enterprise Ireland provides funding and expertise to companies with ten or more employees in the indigenous manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors who wish to expand through increased export activity.  Through its network of 34 overseas offices, Enterprise Ireland assists client companies to create and implement successful strategies for market entry, development and growth.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2004 Enterprise Ireland approved over &euro;15m in support to its client companies in Co. Donegal and made payments of over &euro;7.5m.  In the same period, EI has also approved support of &euro;883,000 for Third <Col N="1806"/>Level/Industry Partnerships with Letterkenny Institute of Technology to encourage the adoption of new technologies by industry.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland initiatives in County Donegal to assist in job creation include;&mdash;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Enterprise Ireland supports the CEIM Enterprise Platform Programme, in partnership with Letterkenny Institute of Technology, the Institutes of Technology in Sligo and Border Action in providing a training programme for entrepreneurs wishing to set up their own businesses.  This programme is now going into its fourth year.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Enterprise Ireland, in partnership with Invest Northern Ireland and SEUPB commenced recruitment for the Transform Programme (a new cross-border enterprise incubation programme) in May 2007.  The programme was launched on 11th Sept 2007 with a total of 43 participants (9 from the North West Region).</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Enterprise Ireland approved support of &euro;650,000 in 2006 for the provision of enterprise space in Carndonagh and Donegal Town, as part of the Community Enterprise Centre scheme.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Enterprise Ireland approved &euro;2.54m in 2005 to extend The Business Development Centre at Letterkenny Institute of Technology to cater for increasing demand. The building is due to commence in 2008.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">During the years 2004 to 2006, a total of 1,156 full time jobs were created in Enterprise Ireland client companies in County Donegal, as against job losses of 980, leaving a net gain of 176 jobs.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s policy objectives for balanced regional development are reflected in the structure of its funding offer, whereby, funding for existing company expansion and start-up businesses is biased towards the regions.  The maximum grant level is higher than in Dublin and the Mid-East and a higher proportion of this funding is also non-repayable.</P>
        <P>Also, under the Innovation Voucher Scheme, which I announced in March of this year, companies with less than 50 employees can apply for a voucher worth &euro;5,000 and, if successful, the voucher can be exchanged for advice and expertise from accredited knowledge providers.  A number of Donegal companies have already availed of this scheme.</P>
        <P>As regards the Donegal County Enterprise Board, funded by my Department, its role is to provide support to micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  Through the provision of both financial and non-financial support the Board supports individuals, firms and community <Col N="1807"/>groups provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.  Financial support is available in the form of Capital Grants, Employment Grants and Feasibility Study grants.  From the Board&rsquo;s inception in 1993 to-date they have paid out over &euro;6.7m in grant assistance to over 300 clients, which has assisted in the creation of 1,385 jobs.</P>
        <P>In relation to non-financial support, Donegal CEB engages in a range of activities to stimulate enterprise and to support small businesses, including the following:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />provision of one-to-one business advice and guidance and one-to one Mentoring through the Boards Mentor panel;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />development and delivery of activities to highlight and promote enterprise in such as the annual Enterprising Donegal Week;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />provision of targeted training programmes such as Start Your Own Business, financial management, computerised accounts, IT for small business etc.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">In addition to its normal budgetary allocation, I have made additional funding available to Donegal CEB to develop and deliver two new initiatives i.e. a Business Information Service and a Lets Do Business Schools Programme.  The Business Information Service involves the provision of a comprehensive business information service to individuals and businesses in the County. The Lets Do Business Schools Programme seeks to develop a spirit of enterprise within national and secondary schools through active learning in a range of enterprise competitions, events and enterprise clubs.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that government funding support and initiatives for enterprises in County Donegal is, and will remain, a priority for the State development agencies under the auspices of my Department.</P>

        <P>A policy decision to move away from involvement in buildings was implemented by the Agency in the late 1990s.

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions. Shannon Development&rsquo;s remit includes the provision of property solutions to accommodate the FDI sector in the Mid West region.  IDA Ireland works closely with Shannon Development in the promotion and marketing of these tailored property solutions, throughout the Mid West, including the Askeaton business park. </P><Col N="1809"/>
        <P>The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the IDA.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.  Both IDA Ireland and Shannon Development are working closely concerning the provision of a strategic site for the Mid West region and are looking at a number of locations in this regard, including the Askeaton site.  This process is ongoing.  Shannon Development is also considering other development options for the Askeaton  land bank.</P>
        <P>The Askeaton site is been actively marketed through IDA&rsquo;s network of overseas offices as a solution for utility intensive projects, and not just biopharma.  The investment projects which IDA Ireland seeks to win are in more advanced higher value sophisticated activities, both manufacturing and services, often related to research activities, requiring high level skills, infrastructure and business services generating more high value products, services and jobs.  Ultimately decisions regarding where to locate a project, including what areas to visit are taken by investors based on the ability of the locations to support their business needs.</P>

In order to accommodate staff who wished to move earlier than the projected building completion date of late 2009, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, opened an advance office in Carlow on July 30th 2007.

	<P>I am fully aware of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to evaluate all policy proposals in terms of their potential impact on poverty.  Both the Sports Capital and Swimming Pools Programmes which have been in existence for some years and are operated by my Department have a strong social inclusion element.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the Sports Capital Programme, organisations that can prove they are located in any of the recognised disadvantaged areas of CL&Aacute;R, RAPID or in a Local Drugs Task Force Area are awarded extra points under one of the assessment criteria.  In addition, applicants from disadvantaged areas only have to provide evidence of 20% minimum local funding as against the 30% requirement for all other applicants.  Under the Swimming Pools Programme there is a 90% grant rate for new projects located in disadvantaged areas as opposed to 80% in other areas.</P>
        <P>A poverty proofing evaluation of the legislation to establish the National Sports Campus Development Authority was carried out prior to the legislation being brought into effect on 1st January, 2007.  The evaluation is integrated into the planning for the Campus.</P>
        <P>The National Economic and Social Forum have produced a report &ldquo;The Arts, Social Inclusion and Cultural Inclusion&rdquo;, presented to Government in February 2007. The report looked at how the arts contribute to cultural and social cohesion <Col N="1811"/>and how this could be enhanced further. The Government approved the report&rsquo;s proposal for the establishment of a high-level independently chaired Strategic Committee to consider its recommendations.  Progress on the establishment of this committee is being advanced within my Department.</P>

	<P>Poverty proofing was introduced in 1998 on foot of a commitment in the first National Anti-Poverty Strategy.   Since then it has been a requirement for significant policy proposals to indicate clearly the impact of the proposal on people in poverty or at risk of falling into poverty.</P>
        <P>Following a review of the poverty proofing process, the Office for Social Inclusion, which is based in my Department, produced a revised set of guidelines for what is now termed Poverty Impact Assessment.  This change of name is intended to underline that the emphasis in the process should be on the outcomes of policies, programmes and services and that poverty impact <Col N="1813"/>assessment should form an integral part of the policy making process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The revised guidelines are designed to better assist policy makers across all levels of Government in evaluating policy proposals in terms of their potential impact on poverty.  They include a number of new steps to ensure greater transparency in the process and a requirement to monitor the impact of any policy change.  The guidelines have been published on the website of the Office for Social Inclusion, at www.socialinclusion.ie, and have been presented to all Government Departments, which have responsibility for their implementation.</P>
        <P>Support for the work of the Office for Social Inclusion in developing effective poverty proofing mechanisms is a key commitment in the Programme for Government and the roll out of the revised guidelines is a priority in this regard.  The Office has commenced a pilot programme providing focused assistance to individual departments on implementation of the new guidelines. The experience gained from this process will aid the development over the coming months of training for officials in all government departments.  The Office is working with the Combat Poverty Agency on applying the new guidelines to local authorities.</P>
        <P>Within my Department, it is the practice for policies and programmes to be assessed for their impact on poverty.  The revised guidelines for poverty impact assessment are now being used for this purpose.  For example, poverty impact assessments have been carried out on Social Welfare Budget packages in recent years and on a number of policies reviewed as part of the Expenditure Review Initiative, including the proposals in the Government discussion paper on supporting lone parents and Phase II of the review of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>My objective, in line with the Programme for Government, is to ensure that the new guidelines will serve as an effective tool in ensuring that the priority of combating poverty and social exclusion is kept to the fore in policy making and implementation at all levels of Government.</P>

	<P>The living alone allowance is an additional payment of &euro;7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes.  The increase is intended <Col N="1814"/>as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone.</P>
        <P>The policy in relation to support for pensioners has been, for many years, to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension rather than supplements like the living alone increase. The objective is to use resources to improve the position of all pensioners to the fullest extent possible rather than focusing on particular groups.  This approach was continued in Budget 2007 with increases of up to &euro;16 and &euro;18 per week granted on personal rates.</P>

	<P>The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.</P>
        <P>In general, social welfare reforms, including those affecting the social insurance records of individuals, are not backdated but apply from a current date.

         <P Just="Left">The operation of the homemakers scheme is reviewed in the Green Paper on pensions. <Col N="1815"/>Decisions regarding pension provision for people who do not currently qualify for a social welfare pension will be made in the context of the framework for long-term pensions policy, which will be developed after the consultation process on the Green Paper has been completed around the middle of 2008.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn.  The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.  A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment (including family income supplement), or Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels. In 2007, it is estimated that over 170,000 children will benefit from the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme at an annual cost in excess of &euro;38 million.</P>
        <P>Apart from a number of exceptions, all household income is assessable as means under the BSCFA scheme in accordance with the normal assessment for Supplementary Welfare Allowance.  The exceptions to these rules are that any income received in the form of Family Income Supplement (FIS), Higher Level Education grants or the first &euro;120 earnings from employment of a rehabilitative nature is disregarded for the purposes of the BSCFA scheme.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the means test is to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.  I consider the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme to be an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain.  I am satisfied that recent improvements to the scheme, namely an increase in income limits and an increase in the rates of payment, provide a major boost to meeting the financial costs associated with return to school for those who most need assistance.</P>
        <P>Any further improvements to the scheme, or amendments to the qualifying criteria, would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of resources available to me for <Col N="1816"/>improvements in social welfare payments generally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Illness benefit is a social insurance payment for people who cannot work due to illness.  Continuing entitlement is subject to the beneficiary conforming to certain &ldquo;Rules of Behaviour&rdquo; set out in legislation. One of the rules of behaviour states that a person cannot work while receiving illness benefit.  However, in order to encourage claimants to take up employment or training opportunities, an exemption to this general rule states that the claimant may engage in employment or training which is part-time (i.e less than 20 hours per week) and of a rehabilitative or therapeutic nature.  The claimant must apply to my Department in advance of taking up such employment or training and a decision will be made on whether the employment meets the criteria of part-time and rehabilitative or therapeutic in nature. </P>
        <P>Disability allowance is a social assistance payment for people with a disability.  A person&rsquo;s disability must be expected to last for at least one year.  A person in receipt of disability allowance who engages in employment or training of a rehabilitative nature may avail of a disregard of the first &euro;120 per week of their income for the purpose of assessment of means for the disability allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>Prior to June 2006, once a person&rsquo;s earnings exceeded &euro;120 per week, payment of their disability allowance was withdrawn on a euro for euro basis i.e. for every euro earned above &euro;120, the disability allowance was withdrawn by one euro.  In order to improve the employment incentives for people of working age, a new withdrawal rate of disability allowance was introduced with effect from 1 June 2006.   This change means that, for earnings above &euro;120 and under &euro;350 per week, disability allowance is now withdrawn at 50 cents for every euro earned, rather than the previous euro for euro withdrawal.  In practice, this means that a single person can earn up to &euro;420 per week before their disability allowance fully ceases, compared to &euro;240 per week previously.</P>
        <P>In addition people in receipt of both illness benefit and disability allowance can access the back to education allowance scheme.  This is an educational opportunities scheme, the objective <Col N="1817"/>of which is to enhance the employability skills of vulnerable groups who are distant from the labour market.</P>
        <P>In July 2006, my Department launched its Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005, which is aimed at developing services that not only give people with disabilities financial security but also encourage maximum participation in society.  Over the period of the Plan my Department will seek to deliver support to people with disabilities which will reduce their risk of dependence. The approach will be to encourage them to meet their income needs largely from employment, as well as achieving other social outcomes, such as further education and developing life skills in a way that will ensure that their contributions to society, talents and aspirations are not  overlooked.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Furthermore under the social partnership agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; and the National Development Plan 2007-2013 my Department is committed to a programme of activation measures aimed at all people of working age, including people with disabilities.  The particular added value that will be provided by my Department is an active outcome-focused individual case management of all social welfare customers of working age who are not progressing into employment or accessing training or education opportunities.</P>
        <P>My Department is also commencing an interagency project, under the European Social Fund 2007-2013, to develop and test a comprehensive employment strategy based on individual case <Col N="1818"/>management of people on disability welfare payments that will have the capacity to increase their rate of employment.  The policy in relation to supporting employment incentives for people with disabilities will continue to be kept under review in my Department.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The development of policy within my Department is informed by consultation with a range of stakeholders as well as consideration of its impact on the physical, economic and social conditions of people living in rural areas, with particular emphasis on farm and fishing communities. In relation to the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013, my Depart<Col N="1824"/>ment consulted with a number of groups involved either directly or indirectly with poverty and social inclusion such as the Combat Poverty Agency, European Anti-Poverty Agency, the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed, Community Partnership Network, Irish Rural Link, Age Action Ireland and many other organisations who focused on the importance of poverty and social inclusion as part of their submissions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>A post-mortem diagnostic service, provided by my Department&rsquo;s Laboratory Service, has the capacity to respond rapidly to urgent disease outbreaks involving animal deaths.  This involves a comprehensive pathology-based diagnostic service and is available throughout the year to herd and flockowners, in consultation with their veterinary practitioners.  In all cases of unexpected on-farm death, immediate arrangements should be made by the herd or flockowner to have the carcase removed to the nearest Regional Veterinary Laboratory for post-mortem examination.</P>
        <P>While in many cases post-mortems are undertaken on animals that die on-farm, post-mortems are also carried out in circumstances such as those referred to by the Deputy.  Such latter cases generally involve the selection for slaughter of often healthy animals and the transfer of their carcases to one of the Department&rsquo;s laboratories.  Once arrangements have been made, through the farmer&rsquo;s private veterinary practitioner, to get the carcase to the laboratory, post-mortems are conducted without delay and there is no question of such post-mortems taking any longer than is absolutely necessary though, depending on the nature of the tests that it may be necessary to run, it may be some time before post-mortem results can be confirmed.</P>

	<P>The Sheep Industry Strategy Development Group, under the chairmanship of Mr. John Malone, issued its report in June 2006. The report contained a total of 37 recommendations as to how the future of the sheep sector could be secured going forward. I established an Implementation Group, also under the chairmanship of Mr. Malone, in July 2006, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report. That Group reported to me in April this year.</P>
        <P>The recommendations in the report relate to the development of the sector and refer to REPS in the context that sheep farmers are major beneficiaries of this scheme. The report does not set down conditions for applicants to REPS. I have however secured the European Commission&rsquo;s approval for a new supplementary measure in REPS 4 whose objective is to maintain and increase biodiversity on grassland by encouraging mixed grazing.  REPS farmers with the appropriate mix of sheep and cattle can qualify for additional payments of up to &euro;1,000 a year.  The <Col N="1826"/>conditions are not onerous and I hope that sheep farmers will give serious consideration to the advantages that this new measure offers them.</P>

	<P>Primary responsibility for all issues relating to wild deer rests with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  My Department does not have a role in the culling of wild deer or in relation to statistics on the deer population in Co. Wicklow.  Any queries in relation to the deer population or proposals to cull deer in Wicklow should be taken up directly with the NPWS.  I understand that the NWPS routinely issue licences, under a number of different categories, to shoot deer.  One particular licence category is available to a farmer who suspects that deer are spreading disease to his livestock herd. My Department supports such licence applications by farmers and examines relevant post-mortem samples for TB.</P>
        <P>Current research/epidemiological investigations indicate that the main source of TB infection in bovines is badgers and residual infection.  However where epidemiological investigations indicate that the source of TB infection in bovines may be wild deer, which is infrequent, staff from my Department liaise with personnel from the NWPS with a view to taking samples from any wild deer that may be culled in the area.  My Department has recently commenced a small preliminary exploration of strain types around a small number of TB infected farms in Wicklow in order to establish if there are any linkages between the TB strain in the deer and cattle population in the area.  The results of this project are not yet to hand.</P>

	<P>Poverty proofing was introduced in 1998 on foot of a commitment in the first National Anti-Poverty Strategy.  It is defined as &ldquo;the process whereby Government policies and programmes are assessed at design, implementation and review stages in relation to their impact on poverty and on inequalities which are likely to lead to poverty, with a view to poverty reduction&rdquo;. Since 1998 it has been a requirement for significant policy proposals to indicate clearly the impact of a proposal on persons in poverty or at risk of falling into poverty.</P>
        <P>Following a review of the poverty proofing process, the Office for Social Inclusion has produced a revised set of guidelines for what is now termed Poverty Impact Assessment. This change of name is intended to underline that the emphasis in the process should be on outcomes and that poverty impact assessment should form an integral part of the policy making process.  The revised guidelines are designed to better assist policy makers across all levels of Government in evaluating policy proposals in terms of their potential impact on poverty. They include a number of new steps to make the process more useful and transparent and a requirement to monitor the impact of any policy change.</P><Col N="1829"/>
        <P>The revised guidelines have been published on the website of the Office for Social Inclusion and have been presented to all Government Departments, including the Department of Education and Science, who have responsibility for their implementation. My Department&rsquo;s Social Inclusion Unit, which is responsible for developing and promoting a co-ordinated response within the Department to tackling educational disadvantage at all levels of the formal and non-formal education sectors, is continuing to liaise with the Office for Social Inclusion with regard to the roll out of the guidelines.</P>

	<P>In order to meet the language needs of students in our schools whose first language is not English or Irish, additional support is given to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of posts.  The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled. I indicated in January last that the limit of two teachers per school and the limit of two years&rsquo; support to an individual pupil which had applied up to then, will no longer apply. As a result, an individual school may be allocated up to six language support posts under the arrangements now in place.</P>
        <P>Schools with between 3 and 13 eligible pupils receive grant assistance towards the cost of employing part-time teachers. Schools with 3 to 8 such pupils receive a grant of over &euro;6,300, while schools with between 9 and 13 such pupils receive over &euro;9,500.  Schools with 14 or more such pupils are entitled to one or more language support teachers, the number of which has increased dramatically in recent years.  There are now almost 1,400 language support teachers in our primary schools.</P><Col N="1830"/>
        <P>In order to ensure that schools can accurately and objectively assess the language requirement of children, my Department will be sending to schools assessment materials which have been developed by Integrate Ireland Language and Training (IILT). The assessment materials will enable schools to ensure that the specific language requirements of children needing support are met in a targeted way. The IILT materials will also enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of the language proficiency of the child and his or her need for continued language support.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the views of the Irish Science Teachers&rsquo; Association in this matter.  Significant progress has been made in progressing a range of areas highlighted in the Report of the Task Force on the Physical Sciences.  A new science curriculum has been introduced at primary level supported by a resource grant in December 2004 of &euro;1000 per school plus &euro;10 per pupil.  A revised syllabus in Junior Certificate Science was introduced in 2003 and it was examined for the first time in June 2006. Revised syllabi in Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology have also been introduced and examined within the last five years. Work on the revision of <Col N="1833"/>the two remaining Leaving Certificate subjects &mdash; Agricultural Science and Physics and Chemistry (combined) &mdash; has also been advanced.</P>
        <P>The introduction of each of the revised syllabi has been supported by comprehensive in-service programmes for teachers.  Additional equipment grants have been provided to schools, and laboratories continue to be refurbished as part of the ongoing school building programme.  In that context, &euro;16 million was issued to schools in 2004 to support the implementation of the revised Junior Certificate Science syllabus.  Investment in the Programme of Research in Third Level Institutes (PRTLI) is continuing apace to enhance and promote world class standards in research, innovation and development.</P>
        <P>My Department does not allocate provision for laboratory technicians/assistants in second level schools.  The recommendation made by the Task Force Report in this area, in 2002 prices, was costed at &euro;18.8m annually.  The current cost of such provision is estimated at c.&euro;24.6m for science subjects only, but could exceed &euro;120m annually if applied to other practical subjects.  While I have made it clear that I am not yet convinced of the need for lab assistants and that I believe that their provision would lead to demands for similar assistance in other subjects with a strong practical component, the Government is committed under the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation to re-visit the issue.</P>
        <P>As you will be aware, the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006 to 2013 sets out a range of measures to further strengthen science teaching and learning and improve the uptake of senior cycle Physics and Chemistry.  These include ensuring that the project based hands-on investigative approach now in place at junior cycle is extended to senior cycle, that the appropriate type of assessment is used and that there is an emphasis on the inter-disciplinary nature of science in society.</P>
        <P>Other aspects of the Plan include reviewing the implementation of the primary science curriculum to ensure its effectiveness in stimulating interest and awareness in science at a very young age; strengthening teacher training in this area; reforming maths and Leaving Certificate Physics and Chemistry curricula; promotion of science initiatives in Transition Year; and  the provision of information and brochures on science opportunities and careers, linking effectively with school guidance services.</P>
        <P>Taken together, the comprehensive set of measures provided for in the SSTI will build on the improvements made in recent years and ensure even greater support for science education.</P>

These escorts are specifically engaged to cater for children with special educational needs whose care requirements are such as to necessitate continuous support.  My Department has no plans currently to provide funding for the provision of supervisors on all school buses.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that all dedicated school transport buses are now equipped with safety belts and pupils are required by law to wear these belts.  In addition, Bus &Eacute;ireann has issued a circular to parents of children travelling on school transport, inviting their co-operation, <Col N="1835"/>and that of their children, to help make the school transport journey as safe and comfortable as possible.   The circular emphasises the importance of safety, the consequences of misbehaviour and the disciplinary measures which may be necessary.</P>

	<P>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, including organising the holding of examinations and issuing the results of examinations.  The number of upgrades awarded in the Leaving Certificate must be looked at in context.  In the Leaving Certificate in 2007, there were 53926 candidates, of whom 3056 sat the Leaving Certificate Applied programme, 14080 sat the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme and the remainder sat the established Leaving Certificate.  Over 350,000 subjects were graded, and around 700,000 subject components were examined.  A total of 10,135 appeals were received, representing 2.9% of the overall subjects graded, and 2063 results, or 0.6% of the overall grades marked, were upgraded.  </P>
        <P>We can be proud that our Leaving Certificate operates to an extremely high level of fairness, quality and transparency.  Results are published and subject to a high degree of public scrutiny, marking schemes are made available and candidates can view their scripts to ensure that the marking schemes have been fairly applied.  This enables them to decide whether they should appeal their result, and is designed to ensure that any errors are addressed promptly.  The results issued in August are provisional pending the result of such appeals.</P>
        <P>When there is a change in grade as a result of an appeal, the Central Application Office is notified by the State Examinations Commission, and third level colleges are contacted as appropriate.  The colleges make every effort to ensure that students are accommodated where the revised result gives entitlement to admission to a course, <Col N="1836"/>or that, if this cannot be facilitated, the admission is deferred to the following year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Details of the activities of the Criminal Assets Bureau since its establishment in 1996 are contained in the Annual Reports of the Bureau which are submitted to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The most recently published report is for the year 2005.  These reports are quite comprehensive and include details of the number of cases commenced, money frozen and returned to the Exchequer under the Proceeds of Crime Acts, 1996 and 2005, and money collected under the Revenue and Social Welfare Acts.  Copies of the reports are available in the Oireachtas library.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the total amount which was returned to the Exchequer under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, for the period 1996 up to 16 October 2007 inclusive, is the sum of &euro;5,626,790.  This figure is deemed to be provisional pending the publication of the CAB Annual Reports for 2006 and 2007.  As the Deputy will be aware, monies or property frozen pursuant to Section 2 or 3 of the Act, remain frozen for a period of at least seven years <Col N="1841"/>unless all relevant parties consent to a Section 4A Order.  As the provisions relating to &lsquo;consent&rsquo; came into force in February 2005, only funds collected pursuant to the Act since 2003 could have been returned to the Exchequer since that time.</P>
        <P>The first applications for &ldquo;Disposal Orders&rdquo; under Section 4 of the Act, instigated at the end of the statutory seven year period, came before the Courts in 2004.  During that year the first two Section 4 applications were concluded and, following directions of the High Court, sums totalling &euro;275,875.43 were sent to the Minister of Finance for the benefit of Central Funds.  In 2005, Disposal Orders under Section 4 and Section 4A of Act realised a total of &euro;2,002,738.41.</P>
        <P>In addition to this, up to the end of 2006, almost &euro;108 million was recovered by the Bureau in respect of tax debts and forwarded to the Exchequer.  Again this figure is deemed to be provisional pending the publication of the CAB Annual Report for 2006 and this figure does not include those who have already been tax assessed and are currently being pursued through the Courts.</P><Col N="1842"/>
        <P>Furthermore, the total sums recovered and forwarded to the Exchequer (not including savings made) under the Social Welfare Vote, up to the end of 2006, as a consequence of investigations by the Criminal Assets Bureau is estimated to be approximately  &euro;1.12 million (this figure is deemed to be provisional pending the publication of the CAB Annual Reports for 2006).  The tables provide more detail in respect of the above data with regard to the years 1996-2005 inclusive (the year of the most recently published CAB Annual Report).  It should be noted that some of the figures quoted under Section 2 and 3 of the Proceeds of Crime Acts relate to real property, the value of which may have increased significantly since the making of the freezing order.</P>
        <P>All funds collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau are forwarded, either directly or through the Revenue Commissioners/Department of Social and Family Affairs, to the Central Exchequer Fund under the remit of the Department of Finance and are allocated accordingly as approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann through the normal Estimates process.</P><Col N="1841"/>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, poverty proofing was introduced in 1998 on foot of a commitment in the first National Anti-Poverty Strategy.  It was defined as &ldquo;the process whereby Government policies and programmes are assessed at design, implementation and review stages in relation to their impact on poverty and on inequalities which are likely to lead <Col N="1844"/>to poverty, with a view to poverty reduction&rdquo;. My Department , since 1998 has indicated in policy proposals brought before Government any potential impacts of a proposal on persons in poverty or at risk of falling into poverty.  </P>
        <P>Following a review of the poverty proofing process, the Office for Social Inclusion produced a revised set of guidelines for what is now termed Poverty Impact Assessment, underlying that the emphasis in the process should focus on outcomes and that poverty impact assessment should form an integral part of the policy making process.</P>
        <P>Policy proposals in my Department are assessed having regard to a number of factors, including quality regulation,   employment, poverty impact, industry costs, Gender Equality, and  Rural Communities. In particular, within my Department, policy proposals which have an impact on the most vulnerable sectors, including policies aimed at people with disabilities,  women, members of the travelling community, and immigrants and ethnic minorities are assessed in the context of the Poverty Impact Assessment process.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 336, 340, 348 and 357 together.</P>
        <P>I attach a high priority to the combating of anti-social behaviour. One of the priorities set for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2007 under section 20 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 is addressing anti-social behaviour and behaviour adversely affecting the quality of life of communities, with part<Col N="1845"/>icular emphasis on alcohol related behaviour. To this end An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are driving forward the establishment of interagency activities against anti-social behaviour, including the deployment of CCTV in urban areas. In addition, they are identifying local public order and anti-social behaviour hot spots and developing responsive actions and plans. In setting the policing priorities for 2008, I propose to make the area of public order one of these priorities.</P>
        <P>The Agreed Programme for Government contains a wide range of commitments to combat anti-social behaviour. One of these commitments is the creation of Anti-social Behaviour Action Teams in each local authority area. I have asked my Department, in consultation with the relevant agencies, to draw up proposals for taking forward this matter as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 337, 338, 347 and 358 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007. Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that up to 30 September, 2007, 264 behaviour warnings to <Col N="1846"/>adults and 80 behaviour warnings to children were issued.</P>
        <P>During the same period the Kerry Garda Division issued 14 behaviour warnings to adults and 1 behaviour warning to a child. The Tipperary Garda Division issued 5 behaviour warnings to adults and no behaviour warnings to children. The Limerick Garda Division issued 17 behaviour warnings to adults and 9 behaviour warnings to children. Figures are provisional, operational and liable to change.</P>

	<P>In determining whether to make a deportation order or grant temporary leave to remain in the State, I must have regard to the eleven factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might wish to note that, in addition to the eleven factors contained in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), I must, as stated earlier, also have regard for Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement before making a deportation order. This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources in evaluating the safety of making returns to  third countries.</P>
        <P>Each asylum application received from a citizen of the Democratic Republic  of Congo (DR Congo), whether male or female, is considered on the basis of the facts, individual circumstances and merits of the case presented and a final decision is reached following a comprehensive examination and investigation of these facts, merits and circumstances taking full account of the political and human rights conditions prevailing in DR Congo and the latest reports of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.</P><Col N="1847"/>
        <P>Since the commencement of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, my predecessors have signed a total of 118 deportation orders in respect of nationals of the DR Congo. In the past twelve months the Garda National Immigration Bureau has not enforced any deportation orders in respect of women and girls who are nationals of the DR Congo.</P>

	<P>Garda Youth Diversion Projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved (or further involved) in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, and promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects.  By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda/community relations.   </P>
        <P>The recent establishment of 12 new Garda Youth Diversion Projects brings the current total to 93 projects operating throughout the country. This represents significant progress towards fulfilling the pledge made by the Government to increase the number of Garda Youth Diversion Projects in Ireland to 100 by the end of this year. I am confident that this target is an attainable one.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner brings forward proposals to me for the establishment of new Garda Youth Diversion Projects following periodic assessment of applications received from community groups etc.  The locations for new Projects are selected on the basis of factors including an increase in the level of juvenile crime in the area and the number of young people referred to the Juvenile Diversion Programme.</P>
        <P>There are currently 10 Projects operating in Co. Cork, the most recent of these was established in Togher in September of this year. In total, funding in excess of &euro;700,000 has been allocated to projects operating in Co. Cork for 2007 to cover operating costs. I can confirm that an application to establish a Garda Youth Diversion Project in Carrigaline, Co. Cork has been received by the Commissioner&rsquo;s Office of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This application is currently being assessed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conjunction with my Department.</P>

	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee in each local authority administrative area. The purpose of these committees <Col N="1850"/>is to provide a forum where members of a local authority and the senior Garda officers responsible for the policing of that area, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area including the levels and patterns of anti-social behaviour such as the misuse of alcohol and drugs. There are currently 29 committees established as part of a pilot project, including in the Dublin City Council area. In addition, because of the extent of the Dublin City Council area, five subcommittees, corresponding to the five operational areas of the City Council, have been established.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I are examining what lessons can be learned from the operation of the pilot committees. As an initial step, we propose to hold a consultation seminar on the experiences gained in the operation of the pilot projects. The outcomes of the seminar will be an important input to the evaluation.  We intend to have committees up and running in all local authority areas as early as possible in 2008.</P>

	<P>As I informed the Deputy in my reply to Question Nos. 212 and 213 of Thursday, 28th June, 2007, my Department primarily funds perpetrator programmes and awareness raising campaigns. The budget for these activities has increased ten-fold over the past five years with &euro;2.185 million available to my Department for 2007.   Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, my Department has been allocated &euro;21m for the expansion of our supports to perpetrator programmes and awareness raising initiatives on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  </P>
        <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime was established by my Department to devise an appropriate framework for victims of crime and to disburse funding for victim support measures. Since 2005, the Commission has provided funding of close to &euro;2.4m to approximately 40 groups involved in the support of victims of crime, including organisations supporting victims of domestic violence.</P><Col N="1851"/>
        <P>These initiatives complement the Government&rsquo;s existing funding for the care of victims of domestic violence delivered through the health and social services sector and through relevant non-governmental organizations. Funding to front-line services is provided primarily by the Department of Health and Children through the Health Service Executive.  I understand that &euro;16.5 million is allocated to the sector in 2007, an increase of over 30% on 2006 levels.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as part of Student/Probationer training all members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receive instruction in the investigation of incidents relating to domestic violence.  Student/Probationer instruction covers domestic violence in two study areas, namely Social and Psychological Studies and Legal &amp; Policing Studies.</P>
        <P>Additional training is also provided as part of the Continuous Professional Development programmes and a dedicated training programme is in place for those selected for Detective Branch. Continuous Professional Development incorporated Domestic Violence on the 1997 Core Programme for all members of Garda and Sergeant rank after the Domestic Violence Act came into force in 1996.   Furthermore, a policy document was issued to all members.</P>
        <P>The Core Continuous Professional Development Programme for 2006 contained a module on Sexual Crime, developed in consultation with the Rape Crisis Counselling Network and covered some areas pertinent to domestic violence. The situation is kept under constant review by the Continuous Professional Development Unit.

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that the present position regarding waiting times at the Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s law centres is that legal services are being provided to all eligible persons within a maximum period of four months.  The table shows the length of time the person longest on the waiting list has waited for legal services in addition to the number of people on the waiting list at each of the specified law centres. </P>
        <P>The Board does not specifically retain information in relation to the number of people seeking barring orders.   However, the Deputy should note that the Board continues to provide a priority service to certain categories of cases that have been identified as requiring an immediate or near immediate service.  The types of cases which are regarded as priority include domestic violence, (including barring orders), child abduction, child care and cases involving statutory time limits. In essence, this means that anyone applying for legal aid, who comes within one of the above categories, would not be put on a waiting list, but would be dealt with immediately.</P>

	<P>The conditions of service for a prison officer appointed prior to 1st April, 2004 provide that a person with 30 years of actual service in the Prison Service may retire at any time after age 50 but, regardless of length of service, retirement is usually compulsory at the age of 60.  The only exceptions are where an officer&rsquo;s retention is clearly in the interests of the Service or where they fulfil the criteria as defined by the Department of Finance in relation to hardship cases.  I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that the case of the officer referred to by the Deputy has been considered and he has been found not to be eligible for retention.</P>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to yesterday&rsquo;s reply to parliamentary questions 24435 /07 and 24449/07 in relation to my Department&rsquo;s Decentralisation Programme. Very significant progress has been made and by the end of this year, close to five hundred posts, from twelve agencies under the aegis of my Department, will have transferred to seven provincial locations. This represents 50% of the total numbers involved.</P>
        <P>All of the posts scheduled to move from my Department&rsquo;s agencies are civil service posts. They are sourced directly from the Central Applications Facility and the question, therefore, of recruitment to these posts does not generally arise. The number of promotions has been limited to twenty-three and I can also confirm that thirty officers have transferred in their existing posts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Overgrazing of livestock in the Nephin Beg area has given rise to environmental problems, particularly loss of vegetation and soil erosion in commonages. In this regard, damage to the habitat of the Red Grouse in the Owenduff/Nephin Beg Complex Special Protection Area (SPA) in County Mayo has been the subject of a continuing infringement case, under the Birds Directive, taken against Ireland by the European Commission in the European Court of Justice. A Commission Reasoned Opinion of 18 October 2006 states that the Irish authorities must implement measures and demonstrate improvements in this area and in other commonages.</P>
        <P>My Department, in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Commission, has been working with farming interests to resolve the issue of appropriate commonage management, which is made complex by the multiple shareholdings involved.  This will be achieved through the amendment of existing REPS plans, or the preparation of an agri-environmental farm plan through a special National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) scheme.  General principles applicable to these amended plans have been agreed with farming interests and are as follows: All active farmers who wish to continue to farm within the SPA must be in an approved agri-environmental plan.  Full destocking as provided for in the commonage plans will be delivered.  There will be a closed period in commonages (and adjacent unfenced privately owned SPA) for five months (1 November to 31 December and 14 February to 13 May) during which there will be no stock allowed go to the hills.  Farm planners have been issued with guidelines on appropriate stocking regimes based on the condition of the commonages to which farmers wish to return stock.</P>
        <P>Compensation is payable in the NPWS scheme for destocked sheep and offwintered sheep.  Where the existing REPS plan does not provide for this destocking, NPWS will also pay &euro;2000 per annum to each farmer.  The purpose of these initiatives is to ensure that ecological recovery takes place in damaged commonages in the area.  The number of sheep that are allowed return to the commonage is based on the best available scientific advice, and will vary according to individual and local circumstances in each commonage, as well as the number of shares that a farmer holds in the commonage. In some cases it may be restricted to 25 sheep but in other cases it may be considerably greater.  Farmers will be given a summer allocation of stock to the hill for seven months, which may be increased if returned for a period shorter than seven months.</P><Col N="1857"/>
        <P>It is important that the destocking measures negotiated locally and summarised above be implemented. I am hopeful that the infringement proceedings taken by the European Commission can be resolved on the basis of real progress in securing recovery of damaged habitats.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation remains broadly similar to that of 10 October when the Deputy raised this matter. Air quality assessment is the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and air quality management is a matter for local authorities informed by air quality measurement data.  The EPA&rsquo;s Air Quality in Ireland 2006, published on 10 October 2007, contains details of the monitoring and assessment of national air quality, and incorporates data from all air quality monitoring stations operated by the EPA and local authorities, including monitors in Co. Kildare.  Air quality was good throughout the country in 2006 and complied with the air quality standards in force for all pollutants. The <Col N="1858"/>report is available on the EPA&rsquo;s website www.epa.ie. </P>
        <P>Where the indicative level for any pollutant is exceeded, the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 require the local authority concerned, following notification by the Agency, to develop a long-term air quality management plan to ensure compliance with the thresholds for the relevant pollutant or pollutants, including those arising from traffic. As the monitoring in 2006 indicated that air quality in Ireland is good and complied with the air quality standards in force for all pollutants, I understand that the EPA required no local authority to develop a long-term air quality management plan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Poverty proofing was introduced in 1998 on foot of a commitment in the first National Anti-Poverty Strategy.  It is defined as &lsquo;the process whereby Government policies and programmes are assessed at design, implementation and review <Col N="1866"/>stages in relation to their impact on poverty and on inequalities which are likely to lead to poverty, with a view to poverty reduction&rsquo;.  Since 1998 it has been a requirement for significant policy proposals to indicate clearly the impact of a proposal on persons in poverty or at risk of falling into poverty.</P>
        <P>Following a review of the poverty proofing process, the Office for Social Inclusion has produced a revised set of guidelines for what is now termed Poverty Impact Assessment and these guidelines were presented to my Department in 2006.</P>
        <P>The following is the position regarding the implementation of Poverty Impact Assessments in my Department: the Centre for Housing Research has been engaged by my Department to carry out a Poverty Impact Assessment on the revised Government Strategy on Homelessness, <Col N="1867"/>which is currently being prepared. Two consultation events in relation to this Poverty Impact Assessment took place earlier this year with relevant stakeholders; a Poverty Impact Assessment will be carried out later this year in respect of the new private rented accommodation standards regulations;</P>
        <P>A Poverty Impact Assessment on the review of Part L of the Building Regulations, dealing with energy efficiency of new homes, will be carried out before the end of the year.  Poverty Impact Assessments will continue to be used as an effective tool in ensuring that the priority of combating poverty and social exclusion is kept to the fore in policy making by my Department.</P>

        <P>Article 85(2) of the Housing Regulations 1980 prescribes the form of the transfer order for the purchase of the fee simple in local authority houses originally sold to tenants by way of leasehold.   I will review the form of such transfer orders as part of a broader package of reforms to the tenant purchase scheme that is being examined in the context of the Social Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is cur<Col N="1868"/>rently being drafted in the Office of the Attorney General.</P>

	<P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, through its role as chair of the National Steering Committee on Violence against Women, has overall responsibility for issues relating to violence against women.  In relation to accommodation, capital funding is available through my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme to voluntary housing bodies providing accommodation to meet special needs, including accommodation for victims of domestic violence. A separate figure is not available for expenditure on accommodation for victims of domestic violence or for the number of such centres in each local authority area.</P>
        <P>My Department recoups to the local authorities 90% of their current expenditure on accommodation related costs arising in respect of homeless persons including, where appropriate, victims of domestic violence. The remaining 10% is provided from the revenue resources of the local authorities.  Proposals for additional accommodation for victims of domestic violence, including refuges and transitional accommodation, are, in the first instance, matters for the relevant local authority.</P>

	<P>In February 2005, the Government announced a Fire Services Change Programme, 2005 to 2007, to implement key fire services and fire safety recommendations of the Farrell Grant Sparks Report, Review of Fire Safety and Fire Services in Ireland.  The priority at the time was not to pursue further institutional change but to use the available resources to bring about direct improvements in the key areas identified in the report.</P>
        <P>The change programme included four  priority areas addressing the development of community fire safety programmes, the development of a risk based approach to safety management, the introduction of a competency-based approach to recruitment, retention and career progression in the fire service and the enhancement of health, safety and welfare programmes within the fire service.</P>
        <P>Work under the Change Programme was carried out by a dedicated Project Team, with a consultative structure in which all of the stakeholders participated. A report on progress <Col N="1870"/>achieved over the two year period was published in June 2007 and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.environ.ie. The Minister is reviewing the options for the next phase of the change programme having regard to the Farrell Grant Sparks recommendations and the need to continue to bring about real and substantive change so that the fire service is in line with international standards.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The issues of adult entertainment and the regulation of associated venues require consideration because of the recent growth of this sector.  Given the relevance of a number of different statutory codes to this matter, it is not clear that planning regulation alone can adequately support a local control regime with regard to these activities, and the interaction of these various codes needs to be examined to ensure we take the best possible approach.  </P>
        <P>To that end, early this year my Department established a task force to examine the regulatory context around the siting and location of adult entertainment venues.  The task force met in July and its next meeting is due to take place before the end of October 2007.  When the task force completes its work before the end of the year, we will have a clearer picture of the issues involved, their interaction and the possible way forward. It is my intention to bring forward proposals early in the new year.</P>
        <P>In advance of any new proposals, local authorities should use the powers currently available to them under the planning code, such as the development plan process, to ensure that new late night entertainment venues are not inappropriately located, for example in quiet residential areas.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 376 and 377 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Environmental Protection Agency Acts 1992 and 2003, activities that have potential for significant environmental pollution are regulated by means of integrated licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control licensing is a function of the EPA and I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to performance in particular circumstances by the Agency of a function assigned to it.  It is a matter for the Agency to ensure that appropriate <Col N="1872"/>arrangements are in place for compliance monitoring in respect of relevant activities, and to take enforcement action, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>In accordance with its statutory functions, the Agency is also responsible for general monitoring of the quality of the environment and it may investigate the causes and circumstances surrounding any incident of environmental pollution.  A Protocol for the Investigative Approach to Serious Animal/Human Health Problems was prepared by the Agency, in collaboration with other agencies including the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Teagasc and the then Health Boards to investigate environmental/ human health/animal health problems.  That Protocol outlines the procedures to be adopted by the relevant agencies.  A copy of the Protocol is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of a fire service, including equipment, is a statutory function of the individual fire authorities and the Department has no direct role in this matter.  The Department supports the local fire authorities through the setting of general policy, the provision of capital funding, the issue of guidance to fire authorities in relation to fire prevention, training support and operational matters and other such initiatives.</P>
        <P>Over the past 25 years, almost &euro;240 million has been provided to local fire authorities under the fire services capital programme for the provision of new and refurbished fire stations and the purchase of fire appliances and other equipment.  At this stage, over two-thirds of fire stations, including almost all of the busiest stations, have been replaced, we have a modern fleet of front-line fire appliances, and we have a modern emergency response communications system.  In the current year almost &euro;21million has been allocated to the Fire Services capital programme.  This will be used further to modernise and update the resources available to the fire authorities.  In addition, since 2001, the Department has provided &euro;5.2 billion in general purpose grants to assist the local authorities in carrying out their statutory functions, including the provision of fire services.</P>

        <Quest> the number of applications received in his Department for each county, under the provision of alternative energy in the home scheme; and his reason for the reduction in grant aid under this scheme. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The objective of the Greener Homes scheme is to stimulate consumer investment in renewable heating solutions and to develop the market for renewable technologies and fuels, thereby reducing CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions in the domestic sector.  Since the scheme was launched there has been an exponential increase in renewable technology suppliers and a ten-fold expansion in the number of renewable energy products available on the market.  This clearly demonstrates the very significant level of market development since the scheme was first launched.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the scheme achieved all of its objectives speedily and effectively.  Consequently, the grant levels are being reduced for some technologies where it is clear that the market has reached a level of maturity to allow it to continue at a lower rate of support.  Other grant levels remain unchanged.  The objective in Greener Homes Phase II is to consolidate the market, underpinning it with quality standards and training and providing for a long-term future that is not grant-dependent.  The aim is to ensure that the market for these products, services and fuels continues to develop strongly, allowing suppliers <Col N="1877"/>and installers to consolidate their market offerings ahead of an unsubsidised market.</P>
        <P>The new building regulations announced recently by my colleague, John Gormley T.D., Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, will mandate the use of renewable heating systems in all new buildings which should provide a further boost to the development of these technologies.  In Phase I of the Greener Homes which ran from April 2006 to August 2007 a total of 19,576 applications were received of which 16,831 grants were approved.  It is too early into Phase II to give a breakdown by county of applications.  The table shows a breakdown of approved applications by county for Phase I.</P>

        <AskConj><b> </b>asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the environmental condition of the old Tynagh Mine site in Loughrea, County Galway; if his Department will take responsibility for a rehabilitation plan in co-operation with the owners of the site in view of the fact that the EPA described it as an environmental time bomb; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24289/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Tynagh mine was worked under a State Mining Lease from 1965 to 1982.  In 1983 the Lease expired and the site was rehabilitated in accordance with the Lease conditions.  My Department has now no right to pursue the former mine operators to carry out any additional rehabilitation works.  According to the records of my Department the mine site was sold in 1984 and is currently in use for a variety of activities, including a galvanising company.</P>
        <P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) carried out an investigation in 2002 and 2003 reporting to a liaison group set up by Galway County Council, which is responsible for enforcing environmental legislation there.  The group also included representatives of my Department, the Western Health Board, the local Veterinary Office, the OPW and local residents.  The key <Col N="1879"/>findings of the report were that elevated metal concentrations were confined to the mine site and its immediate vicinity, that surface water quality in the areas was satisfactory and that the concentrations of heavy metals were unlikely to give rise to toxicity problems in livestock.</P>
        <P>The EPA, in conjunction with the Geological Survey of Ireland, is carrying out a national inventory of inactive and abandoned mine sites, one of which is Tynagh.  This inventory is being carried out in part to comply with Directive 2006/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the Management of Waste from Extractive Industries and amending Directive 2004/35/EC.  This is a two-year project with work ongoing and is due for completion in the first half of 2008.  Data from a number of sites has been collected and is currently being assessed.</P>
        <P>In advance of the final report the EPA wrote to Galway County Council highlighting some preliminary results.  It is a matter for Galway County Council to take action, if it sees fit, as the responsible authority, on the specific points raised by the EPA.  Until the inventory is complete it would be premature to make any judgments on any requirement for wider action on this or any other site.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation Programme it is planned that the Marine functions of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will relocate to Clonakilty with the remaining functions moving to Cavan.  A total of 170 civil servants have committed to decentralise to these locations under the Programme.  110 of these are Dublin based and included in the total figure are 14 staff who have committed to decentralise on promotion and 23 new recruits.</P>
        <P>The Decentralisation Programme included the relocation of Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), involving 42 Dublin based posts, to Dundalk.  SEI plans to have an advance party of staff based in Dundalk ahead of the permanent move.  Two SEI personnel have taken up decentralised posts in Dundalk and the target is to have a further 10 to 13 staff in decentralised posts relocated from Dublin by end 2007.  Of these additional staff, 3-5 are expected to be new recruits.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA), the Decentralisation Programme initially provided for the relocation, from Dublin to Clonakilty, of four Sea Fishery Officer posts and one Seafood Control Manager post of the then Seafood Control Division of the Department from Dublin to Clonakilty.  The subsequent establishment of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority overtook the plans in place for decentralisation.  Under the relevant legislation all technical staff of the former Seafood Control Division were designated for transfer to the SFPA along with the voluntary secondment of administrative staff for a limited period of time.</P>
        <P>In effect the establishment of SFPA superseded the plan initially in place to decentralise Seafood Control Division as part of the Departmental divisions going to Clonakilty.  As regards the Central Fisheries Board no staff have to date taken up a post in the decentralised location, two staff have taken up posts, which are due to decentralise.  There are no staff appointed on promotion or recruitment to decentralising posts.  There are no staff members of an Bord Iascaigh Mhara relocated thus far, nor are there any staff recruited or promoted for decentralised posts.</P>
