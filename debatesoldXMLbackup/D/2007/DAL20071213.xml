	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice under Standing Order 32.  Deputy James Bannon is not present to state his matter.  Obviously, it is very urgent.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 7, Supplementary Estimates for Public Services [Votes 25, 26, 27, 31, 32, 35, 37 and 40] (back from committee); No. 7<i>a</i>, motion re establishment of joint committee on economic regulatory affairs; No. 7<i>b</i>, motion re appointment of Members to committee; and No. 3, Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Bill 2007 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>
        <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 7, 7<i>a</i> and 7<i>b</i> shall be decided without debate and in the case of No. 7 shall be moved together and shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one proposal to put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 7, 7<i>a</i> and 7<i>b</i> without debate agreed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not agree to this.  There was a debate in the committee on the Health Estimate and information was not forthcoming as to the detail of what was being proposed.  Our spokesman and members of the committee were frustrated with the information available to them and feel there is a need for further debate this morning so that issue can be properly scrutinised by the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>On No. 7<i>a</i>, motion re establishment of joint committee on economic regulatory affairs, we are not happy with the terms of reference.  We reluc<Col N="274"/>tantly agreed to a review of the terms of reference within a year.  However, I was surprised to read that the Taoiseach is setting up a parallel expert group to do the same task as he is proposing for this committee and that was not brought to the attention of those drafting the terms of reference.  There are unresolved issues in the way this is being handled, but the issue on which we have the greatest concern is the handling of the Health Estimate where there is &euro;250 million involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>We also oppose the taking of this Estimate.  The Minister needs to be aware that it appears there is gross mismanagement in the funding of the health service and that questions raised legitimately by the Labour Party, and by Fine Gael, have simply not been answered by the Minister.  For example, &euro;9 million allocated to the southern health board was not spent and the Minister could not tell us why.  That is unacceptable.  There is a requirement for accountability on how the taxpayers&rsquo; money is being spent.  It is a matter of great concern.</P>
        <P>The hidden sting in last week&rsquo;s budget, which was never in the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance&rsquo;s Budget Statement, was a range of charges that the unfortunate patient must bear.  In only one area where the charges were increased, for example, access to an accident and emergency department now costs 333% more than it did ten years ago.  That is the legacy of Fianna F&aacute;il Government of the past ten years.</P>
        <P>We must get answers as to what is happening in terms of the funding of the health service, where the charges are increasing and the services are being cut back.  We have no got those answers and we oppose the taking of this Estimate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Some issues were raised on the Supplementary Estimates in the Select Committee on Health and Children and I understand the Minister has undertaken to put forward that information during the course of the day.  The real issue here is the question of the taking of Supplementary Estimates at the end of the financial year.</P>
        <P>On the Health Estimate, we are seeking the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to a technical Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000 in respect of Vote 40 for the Health Service Executive for the year ending 31 December 2007.  The additional costs arising under certain subheads can be met from savings arising from other subheads on the Vote and what is being sought here is not further moneys, but a technical Supplementary Estimate.  Obviously, the debate about health expenditures within those Estimate provisions is a matter that goes on all the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not go on all the time.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="275"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but today we are talking about whether further moneys were being voted in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
        <P>The second point I would make relates to matters raised by Deputy Bruton.  There is a programme commitment about revising and seeing how we can improve the economic regulatory environment generally.  That does not take away from the work of any parliamentary committee. <Col N="276"/> These are matters that are dealt with.  Departments proceed with their agendas and in many cases the parliamentary committees augment some of that scrutiny and examination.  One does not take away from the other.  I do not see the problem.</P>

      </Vote>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Taoiseach will sign the Lisbon treaty this morning <Col N="276"/>and I wish him well.  When will the Government make a decision on the timing of the referendum on the EU treaty?  There is no doubt that winning this referendum will not be a pushover.  It is <Col N="277"/>important that the Government and other parties who support this referendum have sufficient notice and time to prepare a strong campaign.</P>
        <P>I read in the newspapers today that contrary to the impression given by the Taoiseach yesterday, it is open to the Government to introduce an exemption for schools on water charges.  Now that we have obtained clarification from the European Commission Environment Directorate-General, will the Government introduce such an exemption for schools?  Although it seems to be the intention of Government &mdash; to read from the manifesto &mdash; the results are not materialising on the ground, where bills are arriving at schools.</P>
        <P>Although we passed legislation under the Health Acts to ensure proper inspection of institutions, particularly those in which vulnerable children are cared for, I read in the newspapers this week that there are no inspections in the case of homes providing care for children with serious intellectual disabilities.  This is an indictment of Government&rsquo;s failure to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy referring to legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be secondary legislation to introduce the necessary orders to have inspections in place.  This is a matter of serious urgency and the consequences of continued delay undermine confidence in an area in which confidence and standards are crucial.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the Deputy in saying that the referendum proposal will require a full effort from everybody in the House who supports our membership of the EU and its development to make sure that the issue at stake is the one that dominates the campaign.  It is clear that the reform treaty being signed this morning is in many respects a modernisation of the institutional arrangements, which is necessary for the enlarged Union.  Bearing in mind the importance of our continued membership of the Union and our positive disposition towards the Union and its achievements, I hope we will be able to conduct the debate in a positive spirit for the benefit of all citizens.  In the globalised world in which we live, we need to work with our partners in developing domestic policies and dealing with global challenges such as the environment.  The European Union is a leader in all of these areas and we need to be part of that and of the policy formulation that emanates from it in the coming years.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet will consider the timing of the referendum early in the new year.  The Taoiseach has indicated that the referendum will take place during the course of next year.  All parties can take it that they can make their respective preparations and institute cross-party efforts to put forward a positive view of the question being put to the people.  I agree that it is important to avoid complacency.</P><Col N="278"/>
        <P>In the matter of an exemption from water charges for schools, I am not <i>au fait</i> with the details of this issue.  A question to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government may produce a more accurate response in terms of the information provided by the Environment Directorate-General.  I am not aware of the specifics.</P>
        <P>I agree profoundly with the Deputy that the recent reports of abuse in an institution for children with intellectual disabilities are appalling.  The abuse, which took place over a period of more than 30 years from 1965 to 1998 must be condemned outright.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Devins, has indicated that as a matter of priority he will work with HIQA, the newly established quality authority, to apply standards for and monitoring of health facilities throughout the country and implement basic service level agreements with providers.  There is also the question of the introduction of rudimentary inspections such as spot-checks.  We will do whatever is required to instil confidence in the public that this issue will be dealt with progressively and in a way that is consistent with the mandate given to HIQA.  I share with other Members of the House the outrage at the appalling treatment of those children who were in care and the serious abuse of trust that took place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, this House is required to pass a resolution appointing a former Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  When this arose six years ago there was agreement in the House and former Member and Minister Liam Kavanagh was appointed to the commission.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Yesterday, during Question Time, I asked the Taoiseach whether the Government planned to change the membership of the Standards in Public Office Commission.  He told me that it was a matter for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, who would introduce proposals.  Subsequently, I wrote to the T&aacute;naiste asking him whether there would be consultation on the appointment, as occurred in 2001.  He replied to me by telephone, for which I thank him.  I accept his bona fides.  He informed me that a decision had been made to replace former Member Liam Kavanagh with the former Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, Michael Smith.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise a number of the matters arising from this decision with the T&aacute;naiste.  First, I object in the strongest terms to the misleading reply I received from the Taoiseach yesterday morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>He must have forgotten.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Second, I object strongly to the fact that there has been no consultation on this matter.  I want to make it clear that, <Col N="279"/>when the resolution required to appoint former Deputy Michael Smith as a member of the commission is brought before the House, the Labour Party will oppose it in these circumstances.  I say this with some regret because it is a matter on which there should be agreement in the House.  It is wrong of the Government to seek to appoint one of its own to the Standards in Public Office Commission without consulting the Opposition parties and to have proceeded with the making of the appointment before a resolution was brought before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Strictly speaking, the resolution is required to be debated in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>My consideration of this matter is not a reflection on any outgoing member of the commission.  The tenure of office is six years and the former Member, Mr. Liam Kavanagh, who was also a former Minister for the Environment, gave that service.  There is a discretion to consider the appointment once the tenure is finished.  I would not have been aware of the consultations in 2001, but I will accept Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s statement that they occurred.  If so, fine, but there is no suggestion that the discretion of the Minister for Finance is tempered in that way.  Rather, it was a question of my not being aware.  I thank the Deputy for accepting my bona fides in that regard.</P>
        <P>Given developments and the requirements placed on Members through the Standards in Public Office Act, etc., a more recent former Member would be appropriate.  No one would quibble with the suitability of former Deputy Michael Smith for such an appointment given his record in the House and the esteem in which he was held by Deputies present and past, as would have been the case with the former incumbent.  The statutory requirement is for a former Member who is not also a Member of the European Parliament.  I do not accept the contention that a former member of a Government party is less qualified than a former member of another party.  There is no logic in that position.  A number of former Members would be eminently suitable for such a position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The letter I received from Deputy Gilmore at 3.15 p.m. was brought to my attention within one hour and I spoke with him about it by telephone as a matter of courtesy, as no discourtesy was intended.  I took it upon myself to telephone Deputy Kenny as the leader of the main Opposition party to explain the situation to him.  He accepted my comments in a conversation similar to the one between Deputy Gilmore and me.</P>
        <P>As required by the Ethics in Public Office Act, a resolution seeking approval for the appointments &mdash; the other appointment being that of the chairman, Justice Matthew Smith &mdash; for a period of six years will be moved in both Houses of the <Col N="280"/>Oireachtas next week.  Assuming the passage of the resolutions, the Government will advise the President to appoint the chairperson and the Government will appoint Mr. Smith as an ordinary member.  While I understand Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s disappointment following his statements and my conversations with him yesterday and this morning, I ask that he reflect on whether the resolution should be contested.  Mr. Smith is eminently suitable for the position and should be appointed.  I was not aware of a prior consultation process.  The position having gone to a non-party person previously, it would not be remiss of me to suggest that a former member of a Government party would get it this time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot debate the issue now, but Deputy Gilmore can make a brief comment.  There will be an opportunity to discuss the resolution next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it intended to move the resolution next week?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not about Deputy Michael Smith&rsquo;s personal suitability or otherwise for appointment.  Actually, he is former Deputy Michael Smith.  He was a recent Member of the House and I still refer to him as &ldquo;Deputy Smith&rdquo;.  I have the height of regard for him and I do not want to make an issue of him, but a number of elements are the wrong way around.  First, the Act requires that the appointment be made following the resolution of the House, but the Government has decided who to appoint, which should not be the case.  Once agreement has been secured on the resolution, the appointment is made.</P>
        <P>Second, a number of issues reflect on the matters discussed previously rather than on the individual.  Is it appropriate that someone who was recently a Member, let alone a Minister, should be appointed to this position?  Liam Kavanagh was a number of years out of the House.  Third, while it is not a matter of individuals, it is not appropriate for the Government to seek to take the position for one of its own given everything that is occurring.  The matter should have been discussed with Opposition parties in advance.  In the same spirit, I suggest that the T&aacute;naiste should reflect on whether the resolution should be introduced by the Government in circumstances where my party is manifestly unhappy with the way in which the matter has been handled.  If the resolution is introduced and an appointment will be made without agreement, we will have no option but to oppose the resolution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not privy to the conversation between the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of Fine Gael, but we accept his good faith.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore that we must apply the regulatory standards to this appointment.  We must be careful, as it would be regrettable were the House to divide, but Deputy Gilmore feels strongly on this issue for good reason.  The T&aacute;naiste might take time to reflect on how to deal with the matter because dividing the House on an issue of this nature would be a bad way to start work.  Some time and consultation would be worthwhile.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.  Were I aware of a previous procedure &mdash; there was no evidence of such in the file, but if it took place, it took place &mdash; I would have put the position I am now putting to the House, namely, that Mr. Smith be recommended for appointment.  While Deputy Gilmore stated unequivocally that he was making a bona fide political point, which I accept, the former Deputy, Mr. Smith, is eminently capable of doing that job conscientiously and properly, as have former Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>We have an excellent candidate in the former Deputy, Paul McGrath.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject the suggestion that there is not a former member of my party who could do this job equally as well as his predecessors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the import of what is being said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Stick to the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and it is an unfair reflection because former Deputy, Mr. Smith, is either suitable or he is not and from what I hear this morning he is eminently suitable.  It remains with the incumbent Minister for Finance to make the appointment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it does not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a resolution of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>To be correct, it is for the Minister for Finance to recommend him for appointment.  I have asked the former Deputy, Mr. Smith, if he will be available to take up the position if the resolution is passed and he is available to take up the appointment.  I intend putting that resolution to the House and I do not believe it will be necessary to divide the House.  Deputy Gilmore may wish to raise a political point, which is a matter for him and his party to make, but <Col N="282"/>having explained the position frankly and openly, I do not believe it requires the House to divide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope there will be a debate.</P>
        <P>Regarding standards in public office etc., and perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle can direct me in this regard, how do we ensure that commitments given by the opposite side of the House are met?  Two days ago I asked the Taoiseach about a briefing on the Supplementary Estimate in health.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>At the Joint Committee on Health and Children yesterday, the Minister promised to give me all the information this morning.  That is the reason we divided on that issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there an issue you want to raise that is appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>

	<P>On the Health Information and Quality Authority legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the amendment Bill.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste, and I hope it will be third time lucky, when we will get the Ann O&rsquo;Doherty report, which is an integral part of the reviews being carried out along with the other HIQA report on Galway.  It was promised by the Taoiseach and by the Minister on 6 and 7 November and it is now the second week in December.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the publication of that report promised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand it was promised and that the Minister made it clear that some legal issues have arisen regarding its publication in respect of certain parties involved.  That is my rec<Col N="283"/>ollection of it.  That being the case, they have to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that <i>sine die</i>?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  They will be dealt with.  There are parties who have certain rights in respect of this matter as well.  I am not aware of the detail but these legal issues cannot be ignored, as the Deputy knows well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer once again to the programme for Government commitment to amend the planning laws to ensure that school sites and schools are delivered in a timely fashion where large new housing developments have been built.  I asked this question on a previous Order of Business and was informed that the matter would be dealt with in the designated land (housing development) Bill, the heads of which had been agreed by Cabinet.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm if the matter is dealt with in that Bill?  If the heads have been agreed by Cabinet, will they be published and when will the Bill come before the House?</P>
        <P>On a non-partisan point, I am aware an announcement will be made today that the first two VEC national schools will be established by September, both of which will be in my constituency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call the T&aacute;naiste on the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the designated land (housing development) Bill, the heads of which have been approved, is due for publication in early 2008.  I suggest that tabling a parliamentary question on the specific detail he is inquiring about would be the best way for the Deputy to proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the Government&rsquo;s published list of proposed legislation there are two sections.  The first, section B, concerns ten Bills in respect of which heads have been agreed and texts are being drafted.  Section C concerns Bills in respect of which heads have yet to be approved by the Government.  In both cases publication is expected in 2008, as it is for the remaining 50 or 60 Bills.  Given the expected rate of delivery of this Government, when will these Bills be published and brought before the House?  Does the T&aacute;naiste have any idea of the number that have been approved by Government?  I presume some of them have been approved.  Will the parliamentary draftsman be working over Christmas to try to get them ready for the Government nod of approval when the time comes?  It is important&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We just had a question about that.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I said I wanted to raise three issues.  On the issue of the EirGrid legislation, two weeks ago the T&aacute;naiste told this House that the problems in the Cavan, Monaghan and Meath areas were being headlined by Fine Gael.  I advise the T&aacute;naiste that one of his party&rsquo;s <Col N="285"/>councillors was on radio encouraging people to discuss the issue.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>When can we have a debate on EirGrid in the D&aacute;il?  When will the decision be made as to whether the cable will be laid above or below ground?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to call other Deputies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Issues to be debated in the House are a matter for the Whips at any time and we try to get agreement on that.  These are strategic infrastructures that are required.  Deputies talk about the need for improving competitiveness, energy costs and so on and, consistent with dealing with public issues of concern, we wish to proceed with that as soon as possible.  I am aware, however, that this issue has raised concerns and it is important that accurate and responsible information is available at all times to ensure we do not inflame a situation beyond a rational debate on these questions.</P>
        <P>The student support Bill is due in January.  On the health information Bill, work has only commenced on the drafting of a discussion document in preparation for a regular impact analysis and public consultation on the proposals.  I do not believe that is imminent and as was said in earlier contributions, there are other issues that will take a slightly higher priority.</P>

	<P>According to the programme for Government a Green Paper on local government was to come before the House this week.  A commitment was given that within six months of the Government coming to power that Green Paper would be before us.  In that regard, a commitment was also given by the Taoiseach that a commission on the boundaries for local elections would be established.  Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate if that commission has been established and, if not, when it will be established and when that report will come before the House to inform us on what will happen with regard to the local elections, which are just over a year away?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Plans are afoot to set up a commission to examine local authority boundaries in the context of the subsequent work done at national level by the constituency commission.  While it takes away somewhat from being able to come forward with a Green Paper on local authority reform within the period set out in the programme for Government, it is expected the Minister will be able to introduce some proposals in that regard in the first half of next year.</P>

        <P>The 1929 Act that the Bill proposes to amend is a fine example of the many targeted initiatives in the early years of the State to foster and promote the every day use of the Irish language.  The electoral success of Sinn F&eacute;in in 1918 produced a generation of politicians who had been active in Conradh na Gaeilge and were passionate about the national language.  This commitment to the language was evident in the titles chosen when a separate Parliament was established by Sinn F&eacute;in MPs.  The new Parliament was to be called D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the head of Government was to be the Pr&iacute;omh Aire and the Cabinet, the Aireacht.  When Sinn F&eacute;in broke up in the aftermath of the Treaty, the new parties which emerged in succeeding decades almost all adopted Irish names &mdash; Cumann na nGaedhael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Clann na Poblachta and Clann na Tamhain.  The exception was the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rsquo;s party which was formed before any of these.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The policy of successive Governments was to make Irish the official spoken language.  This was a high and noble idea but somewhat impractical.  Politicians such as Eamon de Valera and Ernest Blythe were strong Irish language enthusiasts.  Many such persons believed an Irish-speaking country could be achieved within a generation.  To facilitate this and illustrate its commitment, the State imposed Irish language requirements on service providers, most notably the Civil Service, teachers and the legal profession.  The aim was <Col N="298"/>to make the Civil Service, education and the law bilingual initially and all-Irish speaking eventually.  Irish was to become the national language and thus demonstrate its superiority over the English language.</P>
        <P>The policy of achieving an Irish-speaking Ireland was unworkable and never more than a pious aspiration.  The consequence of a rather fundamentalist approach, as evidenced during the years by the Department of Education and Science, was counterproductive and damaging to the language.  So much emphasis was placed on making Irish the spoken language of the country that a certain resentment was created.  This resentment against the language was manifest among the majority who had no interest in speaking the language full-time but who might have been interested in accepting Irish as a secondary language in their own lives.</P>
        <P>When forced into an all or nothing approach to Irish, many chose nothing, never speaking a word of Irish once they had left school.  While &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in under Presidents Hyde, O&rsquo;Kelly, de Valera and &Oacute; Dalaigh became a mini-Gaeltacht, as did some Departments, all around them English was spoken, with the number of native speakers and gaeltachta&iacute; collapsing on a progressive basis.  Presidents felt it necessary to recite their declaration of office in Irish, even if they had not a word of the language.  When Ms Mary Robinson became President, a civil servant was aghast when she said she would sign her name as she always did, in English.</P>
        <P>Recent Governments have realised that the idea of creating an Irish-speaking Ireland is a mirage that will never happen.  Instead, they have focused on achievable goals and more practicable initiatives with the objective of keeping the language alive and ensuring Irish language speakers are supported rather than discriminated against.  They abandoned plans to force Ireland to become an Irish-speaking country in favour of a policy of bilingualism.  Irish would be encouraged, not forced, on people, and services would be provided in a way that treated Irish speakers and English speakers equally.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach summed up the change of policy in 2006 when he stated: &ldquo;The aim of 20th century Government policies was to reinstate Irish as the main language spoken by the people, but the Government now plans to focus firmly on the practical development of a bilingual society where as many people as possible use both Irish and English with equal ease.&rdquo;  The Official Languages Bill, enacted in 2003, replaced the concept of the superiority of Irish over English with the equality of Irish and English.  Services were to be equally available in both languages and Acts of the Oireachtas were to be published simultaneously in both languages.  Correspondence from Government agencies and Departments was to be in the language in which the original correspondence was written.  State documents were to be available in Irish and English.</P><Col N="299"/>
        <P>The provisions of the Act mean that State agencies must have a core number of Irish language speakers available to provide services through the medium of Irish.  The Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Bill flows from this.  Irish is a mandatory requirement for all lawyers.  Having passed their examinations, however, many lawyers never used the language again and were unable to deal with court cases where the Irish language was used.  This was all too typical of the somewhat naive policy of trying to make the country Irish-speaking. <b> </b>For many, the requirement to be proficient in Irish did not open the door to the greater use of the language but simply represented a hurdle to be crossed once and then forgotten.  That was the attitude of many of those taking the examinations for the King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society.  My own experience some years ago of sitting the Irish examinations to qualify as a practising member of the Law Society confirmed this.  The standard was low and the examinations had a low failure rate.  For many, the Irish language requirement was regarded simply as a nuisance and burden.  It did not facilitate proficiency in the language because once the exam was passed, there was nothing further in terms of courses or stimulants to ensure the language was used.</P>
        <P>The proposal in the Bill makes sense and meets modern requirements.  Instead of producing lawyers who, in theory, can speak Irish but, in practice, have long since forgotten how, it aims to ensure there will be a group of genuine Irish speakers available for court work. <b> </b>Irish language proficiency thus becomes a choice that lawyers can opt into rather than a requirement that is forced upon them.  The Bill does not represent a threat to the Irish language but rather an opportunity to develop and enhance the language within the legal system.</P>
        <P>By setting realistic goals, there is a realistic chance of ensuring the language will survive and that Irish language services will be available to Irish language speakers.  Forcing everyone to learn a language that few would need and use diluted the quality of Irish available in the legal profession and worked against the language.  This proposed new approach allows those who wish to do so to pursue an advanced course and thus give Irish language users in court the service they deserve.  It will mean a higher standard of Irish in the legal profession.  Is it better that we have a profession where everyone knows a little but few remember enough to do the job through the language or a group of highly trained experts in the language, available by way of a panel in both arms of the profession, to provide the best service for Irish language speakers?  It is important that both the King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society offer more than just courses.  They must also devise standards of proficiency and offer examinations.  Those who reach a certain level by passing those examinations should be placed on a panel of per<Col N="300"/>sons proficient to offer legal expertise through the medium of Irish.</P>
        <P>Special provision must be made in Gaeltacht areas.  The Bill should include a requirement that persons applying for State jobs in Gaeltacht areas, including the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency, parts of Deputy O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s constituency in west Waterford and parts of Deputy Ring&rsquo;s constituency, must be proficient in Irish.  District Court judges, State solicitors and other employees of full-time law centres must demonstrate a working knowledge of the language before being appointed.  Legal services should be provided in Irish in Gaeltacht areas and those engaged in the administration of justice should not have to rely on interpreters.  I will return to this issue on Committee Stage.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>A report by the Competition Authority some years ago stated the Irish language represented a barrier to entry to the professions.  It recommended a change such as that proposed in the Bill.  An eminent academic and historian, Dr. Art Cosgrove, was successful in recent years in completing the examinations for the Bar but refused to take the Irish examination.  It was not that he did not have proficiency in Irish but he felt it was a barrier to entry and that he should not be required to engage in such an exam in order to practise at the Bar.  He did not take it and never practised because he was not allowed to do so.  He has now issued High Court proceedings, although I have no doubt this Bill will be passed before proceedings are reached.  Perhaps the High Court case had a bearing on the speed with which this legislation was brought before the House and there may be no need for the High Court to deliver a judgment on the matter when the Bill is passed.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State indicated, it is important we consider the practical manifestation of the mandatory requirement for the Irish language.  In effect, it is little more than lip-service towards the language and does not have a great bearing on the daily work of the legal profession.  A survey was published by the free legal advice centres some years ago when a number of the centres offered legal services through the native tongue.  The survey, from 2005, showed that in a total of 1,250 cases, only five representations required Irish.  That indicates there is no significant need outside Gaeltacht areas for a level of Irish proficiency among those within the legal profession and that compulsory Irish is not the way forward.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has long championed choice in Irish.  We believe the language would be stronger if it was advocated through choice rather than compulsion.  When people choose to learn the language, they are, in effect, making a positive commitment to it rather than if they were mandated to do it.  Forcing everyone to learn Irish only creates resentment and damages the language.  Supporting the right of those who wish to avail of services <Col N="301"/>in the language, those who wish to learn the language and communities to speak Irish if they so wish will make the language stronger.</P>
        <P>Eighty years of decline in the number of Gaeltacht areas shows the old policies did not work and that a method involving choice would be better and would work.  The Bill will ensure a high quality service in Irish for those requiring and wanting it.  It will turn Irish from being something of a burden or a nuisance for lawyers into a positive additional skill.  It will be an extra diploma or certificate on a CV for young lawyers entering the labour force and allow some to specialise in providing a legal service for Irish speakers who are entitled to and deserve such a service.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael supports the Bill and will revert to a detailed analysis on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make a very short contribution.  While I am pleased to see the Bill before the D&aacute;il, I am amazed we do not have more important Bills to regulate the legal profession when we see what is happening.  I would have preferred to see legislation to regulate barristers and solicitors, in particular.  The days of self-regulation should be over.  Regulation is badly wanted when we see what is happening with a small percentage of solicitors.  It is time for action on the matter, as there is a need to protect people.  As that is not the way it is, we must deal with the legislation before us.</P>
        <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, on outlining the Fine Gael position, with which I am pleased.  We had a number of meetings with various groups about the matter.  They were not completely happy with the proposals and would like to see a few amendments to the Bill to ensure protection in a number of matters, on one of which my colleague spoke, the provision of court services in Gaeltacht areas.  There is a problem in some Gaeltacht areas in that judges cannot speak the Irish language.  Such judges should not be appointed.  If we are to promote Gaeltacht areas and expect people to speak Irish in them, the State must provide services for them.  One such service would be providing a judge who is able to speak Irish.  It is wrong if that is not the case, as in the Gaeltacht areas with which I am familiar a certain percentage cannot speak English.  Such persons can conduct business through Irish but believe they are being let down and that their rights are being violated, as they are not allowed use the native language in doing business through the courts.  Some believe certain judges would take it that the people speaking Irish were seeking to delay the courts.  Therefore, the language affects the manner in which they are treated in court.  I hope this matter can be resolved.</P>
        <P>There are some excellent courses in Irish for the legal profession such as the one in UCC to enable solicitors and barristers to be trained and receive a qualification in Irish.  Some graduates go on to become interpreters in the State and <Col N="302"/>elsewhere in Europe.  If people make the effort, they should be rewarded.  A provision should be inserted on Committee Stage, whereby if people want to join the legal profession through Irish, they should be rewarded.  There should be an appropriate exam.  This would be particularly appropriate if there was going to be an appointment as a State solicitor or judge in a Gaeltacht area.  There should be a list of persons who have undertaken an appropriate exam through Irish who could be seen as candidates to become a judge or State solicitor in Gaeltacht areas.  As Deputy Flanagan stated, if people want to use Irish in the courts, there should be a strong panel of individuals able to speak Irish.  The same number of judges should be in place who can deal with court procedures through the medium of Irish.  That would be good for the language but must be included in legislation.</P>
        <P>We should compliment those running the excellent course in UCC, but when graduates come to the King&rsquo;s Inns or the Law Society, there is no further course or examination in Irish to deal with.  A provision should be included in legislation to make it possible for people to practise through Irish, should they choose to do so.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Shea mooted a Bill at an earlier stage and the Government has now brought forward its own proposals.  I am sure many elements of the Bill will have to be dealt with on Committee Stage.  A number of people believe what is happening is wrong, as Irish is meant to be our native language.  Deputy Flanagan, a solicitor, has admitted that the standard expected in the examination was not the highest.  Nevertheless, it debarred certain persons who were not able to manage the Irish language but wanted to be solicitors.  They were probably badly affected by this.  Deputy Flanagan has spoken about the man who has qualified as a barrister who has not completed the Irish exam.  He is going to the High Court, which has helped to push on the Bill.  Those promoting the Irish language believe that if the proposed amendments can be dealt with on Committee Stage and the individuals who want to practise through the medium of Irish can be protected and rewarded, they will not have a problem in with the Bill.  I have a problem with the hypocrisy regarding the Irish language.  There is an Irish exam, although it really only makes a mockery of the Irish language.  We can insert a provision in order that those who want to join the legal profession through the medium of Irish can pass an exam in Irish and be rewarded at a later stage.  At least that they could be considered for State Solicitor or as judges in the Gaeltacht area and that will be a good day for the Irish language.</P>
        <P>I hope the Government will introduce the necessary legislation.  Approximately one year ago I spoke here about an ombudsman for the legal profession.  However, suddenly the Bill was withdrawn.  If that Bill had been processed at least we would have had an ombudsman in place by now who could have addressed some of the <Col N="303"/>current issues.  While the Law Society is dealing with those issues, it is not able to cope and it is not dealing with the people who should be dealt with.  I hope we will see the necessary legislation as quickly as this legislation came in.  I hope that by early in the new year we will see a legal ombudsman Bill to regulate the legal profession so that it will not need to regulate itself.  No professional organisation should regulate itself.  There should independent regulation of all such bodies.</P>
        <P>People are not happy that the Irish examination is being moved.  However, as Deputy Charles Flanagan has mentioned, if the amendments these people have proposed can be adopted on Committee Stage, they will accept it.</P>

Foils&iacute;odh Bille de chuid an Lucht Oibre &mdash; an Bille Lucht Cleachta Dl&iacute; (C&aacute;il&iacute;ocht) (Leas&uacute;) 2007 &mdash; i m&iacute; Me&aacute;n Fh&oacute;mhair seo caite.

        <P>I was amazed at what the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, said on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, about the Labour Party Bill.  He said that it does not provide a proper alternative and is short on detail.  I reject that assertion.  The Government&rsquo;s Bill is vague and sloppily drafted.  I find it extraordinary that the Minister considers the provisions of the Labour Party Bill are in conflict with the Government&rsquo;s policy on the promotion of Irish.  What policy?  Last December, we had the publication of the long-promised statement on the Irish language, which promised, as had been promised before, a 20-year strategy for the Irish language.  Last week, I managed to extract an undertaking from the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, that the 20-year strategy would definitely be available by the end of 2008.  What exactly was this statement?  It was a collection of clich&eacute;s, a list of legislation and a list of Irish language organisations and contacts.  Somebody should let us all in on the secret of what is the Government&rsquo;s policy for the promotion of the Irish language.  I am certainly not aware of any such policy.</P>
        <P>In the Competition Authority report, Competition in Professional Services, Solicitors and Barristers, published in December 2006, the issue of the Irish competency requirement of solicitors <Col N="304"/>and barristers was addressed.  The recommendation of the Competition Authority was that the existing basic Irish competency requirement should be abolished and replaced by a voluntary system of high level Irish language training.  In the details of the recommendation the report stated: &ldquo;The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should introduce legislation to repeal sections 3 and 4 of the Legal Practitioners Qualifications Act 1929 by June 2008.&rdquo;  The report further stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Law Society and the Honourable Society of King&rsquo;s Inns should publish criteria for a voluntary system whereby solicitors and barristers who wish to represent clients in Irish or who have a particular interest in Irish could be trained and examined to a high and consistent standard.  Institutions other than the Law Society and King&rsquo;s Inns should be permitted to provide such courses and examinations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It was recommended that this be actioned by December 2007.  I note that the Bill does not refer to other institutions providing the courses mentioned in the legislation.</P>
        <P>On 25 October, the D&aacute;il ordered the Legal Practitioners (Qualifications) (Amendment) Bill 2007 be printed.  I had introduced this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party.  The purpose of the Bill as laid out in the explanatory memorandum is &ldquo;to remove the compulsory Irish examination for Legal Practitioners and replace it with a voluntary system of recognising competency in the Irish language as recommended by the Competition Authority Report, Competition in Professional Services, Solicitors and Barristers (December 2006)&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>On 28 November 2007, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform presented the Bill now before the House, the purpose of which as laid out in the explanatory memorandum is to promote the better use of the Irish language by legal practitioners and the provision of legal services through Irish.  For that purpose, the Bill provides that the Honourable Society of the King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society shall establish courses of study in the Irish language and provide registers, which will be made available to the public, showing details of those practitioners who are able to provide legal services through the Irish language.</P>
        <P>The Government Bill is significantly inferior to the Labour Party Bill for a number of reasons.  It is an attempt to be all things to all men.  The Competition Authority report is not mentioned and the competition issue is not alluded to.  The existing legislation is the Legal Practitioners (Qualifications) Act 1929.  Section 3 of this Act provides that a person cannot be admitted by the Chief Justice to practise as a barrister-at-law in Irish courts unless he or she has previously satisfied the Chief Justice that he or she possesses a competent knowledge of the Irish language, while section 4 of the Act provides that no person can become a solicitor unless he or she has passed an <Col N="305"/>examination designed to show that he or she has a competent knowledge of the Irish language.</P>
        <P>The Competition Authority described the effect of these restraints as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Irish Examinations constitute a barrier for non-Irish speaking persons who have obtained their law degree in Ireland and wish to become a solicitor or barrister.  Such persons have increased education costs, as they must take pre-examination Irish courses.  This may even reduce the number of qualifying lawyers in Ireland [I believe that is the case].  Lawyers who have qualified in other jurisdictions do not have to take this examination.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Competition Authority describes the rationale offered by the restraint as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">Irish citizens have a constitutional right to be represented in Irish in legal proceedings.  Irish is also a recognised language of the European Union.  The objective of the Irish examination is to ensure that Irish solicitors and barristers can represent clients in Irish.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In their submissions to the Competition Authority, both the Law Society and King&rsquo;s Inns addressed the issue of the restraint.  This extract from the Competition Authority report summarises their positions:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Law Society agrees with the proposal that legislation be amended to abolish the Irish language competency requirement and favoured the establishment of a voluntary system.</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;This is a better means of ensuring that Irish-speaking clients can be effectively represented through the Irish language and the Society would be pleased to be involved in the introduction of such a voluntary system and would urge the State to assist in its establishment.&rdquo;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">King&rsquo;s Inns notes that it currently offers an optional course in Advanced advocacy and Legal Drafting through the medium of the Irish language and is open to the idea of a course to replace the existing Irish competency requirement.</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;King&rsquo;s Inns considers the development of such a course is important in order to have available legal practitioners who are qualified to conduct cases in Irish.  It is willing to consider the further development of such courses and the granting of a qualification to those who reach an agreed standard.&rdquo;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">King&rsquo;s Inns has informed the Competition Authority that it has made proposals to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform proposing a basic Irish course for all trainees and an advanced course for those who wish to undertake it, leading to a recognised qualification.</P><Col N="306"/>
        <P FLI="0">The analysis of the Competition Authority was as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">While the objective of ensuring that those who wish can be represented through the medium of Irish is valid, it cannot be achieved unless the Irish examination is of a sufficiently high standard to ensure that those who pass it are competent to conduct litigation in Irish.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">It is not necessary to require all lawyers to be proficient in Irish in order to ensure that those who wish to avail of their constitutional right to be represented in Irish can do so.  The objective would be better achieved by a system that encouraged, but did not compel, students to attain a level of competency in Irish sufficient for full legal practice.  This competency could be tested by examination, and those holding the ensuing qualification could hold themselves out as practitioners willing and able to practise in Irish and English.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Competition Authority has outlined a solution.</P>
        <P LI="1">In its Preliminary Report, the Competition Authority proposed that the Irish language competency requirement be abolished and replaced by a voluntary system for lawyers who wish to represent their clients in Irish.  Following consideration of the submissions received in response to the Preliminary Report, the Authority reiterates its earlier recommendation.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Such a voluntary system would encourage those who wish to do so to achieve a significant level of competency in Irish.  Those who have achieved this level of competency, which would be verified by an examination, could advertise themselves as being qualified and willing to provide legal services through the medium of the Irish language.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">This would ensure that, instead of the current situation where nominally all legal practitioners are competent in Irish but few are actually able, or willing, to provide legal services through Irish, there would be a pool of legal practitioners who have the ability to provide full legal services through Irish to those clients who wish to receive them.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Labour Party decided to address this issue.  There is no doubt that the existing system is faulty.  No one could argue that a large percentage of the lawyers in Ireland are capable of properly representing their clients in Irish.  When one considers that only 68% of lawyers who responded to the question in the 2006 Census of Population answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the question, &ldquo;Can you speak Irish?&rdquo;&rsquo;, it gives some measure of how successful the implementation of the 1929 Act has been.  It should be borne in mind that lawyers answering the census question were subjective in their replies and that no level of competency is stated relative to any subjective measure.</P><Col N="307"/>
        <P>The Labour Party, instead of negatively attacking the Government for what it was not doing, came up with its own Bill as a responsible Opposition party.  The Bill was designed to promote excellence in the Irish language rather than seeking to set basic minimum standards.  Our Bill would serve to enhance the status of the Irish language in the legal system. The Bill would also enable those who had been refused recognition previously, as a result of failing or not taking the Irish language test, to re-apply and be readmitted without taking the test.</P>
        <P>There are many capable barristers and solicitors with fluent Irish, many of them Irish language enthusiasts, and litigants have never experienced any problem in securing legal representation if they wish to pursue legal action through the medium of Irish.  I presented our Bill as meeting the needs of an inclusive, pluralist Ireland and also meeting the needs of a modern and competitive legal system.  The Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Bill 2007 is a fudge.  It is very vague.  It does not, for example, have any provision stopping an examination in relation to the proposed course on Irish language terminology and the understanding of legal texts in the Irish language for all students undertaking the barrister-at-law course other than a statutory examination.  A similar type course is proposed to be held by the Law Society.  Both courses are also to enable practitioners to identify the nature of the service being sought and, where appropriate, to facilitate a referral to a practitioner competent to provide a service through Irish.</P>
        <P>This rationale for these courses beggars belief.  Surely the Minister is not seriously suggesting that without the courses lawyers would be unable to identify the nature of the service being sought and make a referral to a practitioner competent to provide a service through Irish.  Bringing this ludicrous explanation to an extreme, surely the Irish language registers to be established and maintained by the King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society of those who have passed the proposed advanced courses in the practise of law through Irish and to be available to the public will be of assistance to clients wishing to bring their cases before the courts through Irish.  How the results of such possible examinations by the King&rsquo;s Inns and by the Law Society might be used must give cause for concern.</P>
        <P>The legislation talks of all students undertaking the course in legal terminology.  This is vague. What does &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; mean in regard to fulfilling the statutory requirement in regard to being deemed to have attended the course?  How many lectures must be attended?  Must students attend the whole lecture in each instance to qualify as attending?  Who will police the statutory requirement?  Must the lectures be conducted solely through Irish?  These are issues which need to be clarified in the legislation so that this is not open to subjective interpretation of legislation <Col N="308"/>which would allow the Irish language&rsquo;s legal terminology courses to be used in an oppressive way.</P>
        <P>There is a further piece of sloppy drafting in section 1(2) where it is provided: &ldquo;The Council [of King&rsquo;s Inns] shall have regard to Government policy on bilingualism.&rdquo;  Government policy is only that until it becomes law.  I referred already to Government policy and I do not intend to return to that issue.  Surely this section should refer to public policy.  Government policy may change with the coming into power of a new Governments, but public policy remains public policy until it is changed by the Oireachtas.  Clarity here will be absolutely necessary.  Only last night I heard of someone who qualified as a lawyer 40 years ago here but who does not have the Irish language competency.  The Labour Party Bill would have allowed him to practise.  Under the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill, such people do not appear to be covered at all, as the Bill provides for all students undertaking the barrister-at-law degree but in regard to the Law Society it refers to enabling practitioners.  I ask the Minister in his reply to clarify the apparent different approach in regard to the proposed Irish legal terminology courses to be provided by the King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society.</P>
        <P>It is clear that Fianna F&aacute;il cannot bring itself to desist from the fundamentalist addiction to compulsion as regards the Irish language whatever the context or however inappropriate is compulsion in that context.  This is the mind set which maintains that compulsion always comes before the Irish language in the order of things.  This flawed perception has led the Minister to this legislative fudge but like all such fudges, trying to please everybody often pleases nobody.  The right action is to remove the compulsion and by all means have both courses, but only for those who want to do them.  This is best both for the law and for the Irish language.  The 1929 Act established a system which has been in place for nearly 80 years but however well-intentioned were its parliamentary advocates, essentially the Act has failed.</P>
        <P>In preparation for this debate I looked up the meaning of the word &ldquo;attend&rdquo; in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> as its meaning needs to be well clarified in the legislation.  It is described as, &ldquo;to present oneself for the purpose of taking some part in the proceedings at a meeting for business, worship, instruction, entertainment&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Why move from a pointless compulsory test to an even more pointless compulsory course?  If only the physical presence of students is required, pity the instructor who has to face the sullen ranks of the bored, the uninterested, the uncaring and the jokers, who have no reason to learn.  Such a scheme only serves to confirm the view that some advocates of compulsory Irish are more in favour of compulsion than of Irish.  If people profess to love the Irish language why do they wish to alienate the majority of students by forcing <Col N="309"/>them to present at a course which they and their instructors know to be pointless?</P>
        <P>It is long since time to move on, not least in these rapidly changing times in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Power.</P>
        <P>I was interested in the points made by Deputy O&rsquo;Shea and I will return to them presently.</P>
        <P>This Bill is to allow for the provision of services in a bilingual State in which there are two constitutional languages which are the two official languages.  We should not lose sight of the fact that if we have a State with two official languages and if the various arms of the State, including the courts, are to operate in those two languages, it is reasonable to make provision that there will be people competent to provide services in either of the official languages.  It is taken as given that anybody practising within the State would have to be competent in one of those official languages at least to be effective.  For instance, a monoglot French or German speaker, no matter what knowledge they had of Irish law, would not be perceived as being competent to operate within the Irish courts system.  However, it is also taken as given that the majority of people who seek to practise at the Irish Bar, or who operate as solicitors within this jurisdiction, would have knowledge of the English language.  What is not equally obvious is that there is also a need to ensure that there are people competent to conduct court cases in the first official language and who will be readily available to the public.  The nub of the issue is to provide for that service.</P>
        <P>I have held an opinion for many years &mdash; people in the Irish language movement disagree with me on this point &mdash; that shadow rather than substance should be done away with.  I have no major difficulty in saying that the current examination in ordinary Irish, which to my knowledge, served no purpose and was of such a low standard that it did not mean anything in terms of competency should be done away with.  This is what is being proposed in this Bill.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, if I as an Irish speaker wish to do my business with a solicitor or if my case requires a barrister, I should be able to access a list of accredited practitioners who are genuinely competent to conduct business through the Irish language and this is what the Bill sets out to provide.  The first challenge is to ensure that those who pass the examination at the end of that voluntary course are competent to do business through the Irish language.</P>
        <P>It must be ensured that anybody on that register is of sufficient standard as in the similar system applied in the accreditation of translators by Foras na Gaeilge.  The register is meaningless, just as the current register which shows every qualified barrister and solicitor as being qualified in Irish is completely meaningless, unless the standard is high enough to deliver on the reality.</P><Col N="310"/>
        <P>As Deputy O&rsquo;Shea said, a large number of solicitors are competent to do business through the Irish language.  Some of them acquired the language through the education system while others had Irish as their home language.  I know solicitors and barristers with whom I never speak English.  It is reasonable that those people and others qualified like them, would be on a register and easily accessible to the public.  Many other things could then flow from this arrangement.  For example, the courts service could in the future decide as part of its language plan to ensure that people with this level of competency would be appointed as District Court justices in areas which include Gaeltacht areas.</P>
        <P>For the first time there would be an objective measure at a reasonable standard by which one could make that judgment and be fair, independent and objective.  As the situation currently stands if one wishes to appoint a District Court justice with a competency in Irish there is no ready and objective measure as to whether the person has Irish to satisfy the requirement.</P>
        <P>The accreditation issue is very important as is the idea of having a high standard of Irish and having a real measure of that standard.  It is important to do away with an examination that from all the reports both from the King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society does not test the competency to do anything in Irish.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Shea raised the issue as to why one would have to sit a course in legal terminology and he also referred to students being bored.  When I was studying science years ago in UCD, a requirement for doing an honours degree in science was to study some French or German and learn enough of those languages to be able to read scientific texts.  That may not be very important in the modern world but that is the way it was.  Nobody ever said it was compulsory to know German or French to become a scientist in UCD.  The standard was not very high but it was a mandatory requirement and one could not get the degree without it.</P>
        <P>Terminology is a valid issue.  Solicitors in particular are people of first instance.  In other words, a solicitor in one practice can send a document in Irish to another solicitor with a heading &ldquo;Urghaire C&uacute;irte&rdquo;, or better still, &ldquo;Urghaire Ard-Ch&uacute;irte&rdquo;.  It would be fairly basic legal and customer service that one would immediately know that an urghaire is an injunction and the Ard-Ch&uacute;irt is the High Court, and that one had better get somebody fast to read the document and find out what the hell was going on and who was coming at one on behalf of one&rsquo;s client.</P>
        <P>It is a reasonable premise for a legal practitioner to have a knowledge of basic legal terminology in Irish, especially in the case of solicitors because that is where notification goes in the first instance.  Barristers are slightly different because I understand solicitors usually choose barristers.  It is appropriate that part of the course of becoming a solicitor in the State would involve <Col N="311"/>learning basic terminology in Irish so that documentation would trigger certain warnings, or a solicitor would be aware that a certain document was simply a notice of information.  It is important that solicitors would be able to get the gist of what the correspondence concerned before looking for somebody to translate it.  It will not be necessary for a solicitor to deal with a case in Irish.  One will not have to solve the problem but be capable of knowing the gravity of the issue confronting one.  A solicitor has no choice over the official language in which a document will arrive at his or her office.</P>
        <P>I do not buy the argument about compulsion in the manner outlined by Deputy O&rsquo;Shea.  I have been clear about this.  I see no point in a compulsory exam that is meaningless and provides no practical end.  However, I see merit in saying that an intrinsic part of a course within this State provides for many different things.  As far as I know, if one does a course in law, it includes mandatory areas of study such as financial law, corporate law, tort etc.  My colleague opposite, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, would know more about what one has to study.  There are parts of the course one might never use in a day-to-day family practice.  Likewise, if one specialises in an area of corporate law, one might never use the information about family courts.  People learn many different things on university courses and in other third level institutions that are mandatory parts of courses even though they may never have recourse to this information in their working lives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is reasonable that a course in basic terminology in the Irish language would be mandatory because it would serve a useful purpose.  A knowledge of basic legal terminology would be more pertinent than Jim&iacute;n Mh&aacute;ire Thaidhg or Peig Sayers bhocht.  What has been examined by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and what has been discussed with my Department is what would serve our purpose within the construction of this State as a bilingual one in which people have two official languages, the first official language being Irish and the second official language being English, and what would provide the maximum service to the public.  It is as simple as that.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Shea has raised many technical issues.  No doubt there will be a comprehensive and detailed Committee Stage on this Bill and my colleague Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will listen to all the suggestions made.  If there are drafting flaws in the Bill they will be addressed.  All Ministers are open to improving legislation by clarifying issues that are brought to their attention.  Let us trash out any problems on Committee Stage and examine the fine print.  It is easy to make mistakes in drafting legislation, which is complex at the best of times.  I cannot give a judgment as I am not a barrister or solicitor but <Col N="312"/>if issues arise in terms of the transition period or any other matter, they can be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for sharing time. </P>
        <P>The context of this debate, as we all know, is the constitutional right to have one&rsquo;s case dealt with and to obtain legal advice through Irish.  At all times the debate should be about how we enable citizens, clients and solicitors, to vindicate that right.  While I commend Deputy O&rsquo;Shea for his interest and the manner in which he has promoted this matter, I suggest to him that compulsion is not the way to do it.  Competency is the issue.  The ability of solicitors to discharge their obligations to their clients and allow citizens to vindicate their right in a competent way should be the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>That was provided for in the Labour Party&rsquo;s Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that we share a common objective, but how do we go about achieving it?  As we all know, the existing legislative framework fails citizens dismally in that respect in that it places the obligation on the Chief Justice to make the judgment call as to who is competent to discharge their functions in court.  That is wholly unsatisfactory.  Effectively, what we had for many years was a fiction where thousands of solicitors were admitted to the roll seemingly competent to discharge their functions as Gaeilge in such a way as to allow people to vindicate their rights.  Obviously, that did not work.  We must recognise the failings of the current framework and see how best we can solve the problem.  The framework set out in the Bill which provides for a smaller number but with enhanced <Col N="314"/>capability is the way to proceed in this respect.  That is why I say the issue is competency, not compulsion.  It is about vindicating one&rsquo;s constitutional rights rather than whether it should be compulsory to have Irish.  It is inconsistent to have a constitutional right and not to provide for an element of compulsion.  The logical conclusion is that, ultimately, possibly many years down the line, there will be few, if any, who will be competent to discharge their functions.  Therefore, there must be a provision to safeguards the rights of citizens.</P>
        <P>While there are many points I would like to make on the Bill, I highlight one matter on which I agree with Deputy O&rsquo;Shea and the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  It is vital that information on access to persons who are competent in this area is openly accessible.  There should be a provision in the Bill, whereby the societies involved, whether it be the King&rsquo;s Inns or the Law Society, would have an obligation to promote the list and make it readily accessible to members of the public.</P>
        <P>I will make one final point.  I have not gone through the Bill in detail, but I wonder what oversight or audit there would be of the relevant institutions to ensure they are discharging their obligations under the Bill.  I do not know whether this would amount to a statutory duty or merely a requirement on societies to provide such courses, but who would state they are run to a satisfactory standard?</P>
        <P>Those are the issues we should be discussing.  No doubt we will have plenty of opportunities to discuss them on Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Bill 2007.  This is an important Bill as it allows us to discuss the broader issues of our native language, the legal profession, competen<Col N="319"/>cies, and the new changing Ireland with its many new languages and cultures.  Respect for difference and diversity should be at the core of our discussions, but we also need to ensure that the Irish language and culture are protected and respected at all costs.  There is no time for fudging on this issue.  In the debate today I intend to focus on the legislation and the current Irish language requirements for barristers and solicitors.</P>
        <P>Before we go into a detailed breakdown of the Bill, it is important to deal with the background.  The Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Bill 2007 repeals and replaces the existing statutory provisions of Irish language competence for barristers and solicitors.  The Bill promotes better use of the Irish language by legal practitioners and the provision of legal services through Irish.  I welcome this as it is a positive and constructive development.  The Bill requires that King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society have regard to Government policy on bilingualism and take reasonable steps to ensure that an adequate number of barristers and solicitors are able to practice the law through the Irish language.  The Bill also provides that these institutions should hold courses on Irish legal terminology and the understanding of legal texts in the Irish language to enable practitioners to identify the nature of the service being sought and, where appropriate, to facilitate a referral to a practitioner competent to provide the service through Irish.  This is an important measure.</P>
        <P>We spoke earlier about the development of the Irish language.  It is important that we ensure that the opportunity is provided for people to learn the language in the community.  There are some excellent examples of good practice around the country, in places such as Galway, Donegal and Kerry, which are making a massive contribution both to the Irish language and to the development of the tourism industry.  I have visited Donegal a number of times and I found it interesting to see people from different countries learning the Irish language.  I was amazed at what I saw at Oideas Gael in Glencolmcille.  I commend the people directly involved in this, including Liam &Oacute; Cuinneag&aacute;in, who are doing much valuable work for the development of the language.</P>
        <P>Both King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society will also establish an advanced course on the practice of law through the Irish language as an optional subject in their professional training courses.  These advanced courses will open doors to those who are not students but wish to obtain a competence enabling them to practise law through Irish.  We must support people who want to ensure that Irish citizens and Irish language speakers are respected and their rights are protected.  Examinations in the practice of law through Irish will be held at least once a year and only those persons who have undertaken the advanced course will be permitted to sit these exams.  The names and contact details of the barristers and solicitors who <Col N="320"/>pass the examinations will be entered on to a register published by King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society.  Both bodies will be required to submit a report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on an annual basis on the operation of the new arrangements.  This is important in terms of ensuring accountability and transparency.</P>
        <P>The current Irish language requirements for barristers under the Legal Practitioners (Qualification) Act 1929 are as follows: &ldquo;No person shall be admitted by the Chief Justice to practise as a barrister-at-law in [Irish courts] unless he satisfies the Chief Justice, by such evidence as the Chief Justice shall prescribe, that he possesses a competent knowledge of the Irish language&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Competent knowledge&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;such a degree of oral and written proficiency in the use of the language as is sufficient to enable a legal practitioner efficiently to receive instructions, to advise clients, to examine witnesses and to follow proceedings in the Irish language&rdquo;.  This is the basis of a complaint I receive regularly from constituents who are Irish language speakers.  They need to be confident that they can meet legal people who can advise them in their native language.  The obligation to ensure proficiency in Irish in the case of any barrister who wishes to be called to the Bar lies with the Chief Justice, but there is no requirement to include Irish as an optional or obligatory subject in the King&rsquo;s Inns barrister-at-law degree course.  Any tuition or record of proficiency required is given outside the degree course and arranged so that the Chief Justice can fulfil his or her statutory function.</P>
        <P>The 1929 Act applied to solicitors until 1954 when new arrangements were introduced in the Solicitors Act.  To qualify for admission as a solicitor, the Law Society requires students under the 1954 Act to undertake two examinations in Irish.  The first examination applies to persons seeking apprenticeships and the second applies to persons wishing to be admitted as solicitors.  The important purpose of the second examination is to ensure that the persons who pass it have competent knowledge of the Irish language, that is, such a degree of oral and written proficiency in the use of the language as to enable a solicitor efficiently to receive instructions, advise clients, examine witnesses and follow proceedings in the Irish language.  It is the same competency test used in the 1929 Act for barristers.  It is important that we understand these issues in respect of this debate.</P>
        <P>People have concerns and a number of organisations have raised issues.  Many Deputies have received the two amendments submitted by Conradh na Gaeilge.  The first amendment is to clarify whether the proposed terminology course will be accompanied by an examination.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">If no examination accompanies the subject, it shall command neither respect nor attention in the context of other subjects which shall <Col N="321"/>require study and which it shall be necessary to pass.  Furthermore, there is no provision in the Bill as it stands for persons who have passed the other examinations in King&rsquo;s Inns or the Law Society, but who have not as yet complied with the statutory Irish language requirement.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The second amendment relates to the provisions in respect of courts in the Gaeltacht.  As should be the case, I have listened closely to friends and colleagues living in Gaeltacht areas.  The amendment states:</P>
        <P LI="1">At present, for the most part, English is the language of the courts in the Gaeltacht, which impacts negatively on the use of Irish in general there.  Judges sitting in districts and on circuits containing Gaeltacht areas are usually not competent in Irish.  At the same time, judges competent in Irish are in other districts and circuits.  Gaeltacht cases are conducted at locations in the Gaeltacht or through English in the Gaeltacht itself, except in south Connemara.  This situation does not accord with Government policy in relation to the fostering of Irish as the community language in the Gaeltacht.  Much better that the Gaeltacht be an administrative unit administered through Irish by people interested in doing so.  The District Courts are being restructured at present, in any event.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I support Conradh na Gaeilge in its concerns because we must accept that people who need a service delivered through Irish deserve such as a right.  If we are discussing the protection of rights, this is an essential element.  Everyone should consider the second amendment carefully because it is a sensible option.  We must ensure that people who want to deal with court cases through Irish have their rights protected.  This matter is an important part of the debate.</P>
        <P>A number of constituents have contacted me with their concerns regarding the legislation&rsquo;s interpretation of, for example, sections 1(3)(<i>a</i>) and 1(3)(<i>b</i>) for students on the current degree course and in general.  They are required to pay for and sit a statutory Irish language course run by King&rsquo;s Inns before they sit Irish exams.  If they sit the course and not the exam, do they fall within section 1(3)(<i>a</i>)?  What would occur if they did not do the exam or course after the Bill has been passed?  The Bill does not make that clear.  Does it mean that, despite paying &euro;12,500, sitting approximately 20 exams, attending in excess of 200 lectures and completing the countless hours of work already required, they will not be entitled to the degree of barrister-at-law?  Does it mean that, despite being otherwise fully qualified and competent in the practice of law having completed the degree, they will not be entitled to be called to the Bar?  My constituents deserve to be listened to in the broader debate.  Sections 1(3)(<i>a</i>) and 1(3)(<i>b</i>) as drafted are unclear to some and add further complication for those trying to qualify into the profession.  I would ask that this <Col N="322"/>unnecessary barrier be examined by the insertion of section 2 of the Labour Party&rsquo;s legal qualifications Bill, an interesting submission.</P>
        <P>I am not 100% certain regarding the details of the issues, but I encourage people to listen to all of the concerns I have raised in today&rsquo;s debate.  It is important to have them dealt with in a positive and constructive manner.  I want to protect the integrity of the legal profession and to ensure the maximum support for Irish speakers.  Due to certain cases, the legal profession has taken a hammering in recent weeks, but it is important that its members understand the questions of respect and trust involved in this issue.  The majority provide an excellent service and get on with their lives, but we need strict regulations and supervisory authorities to ensure that trust between clients and solicitors or barristers is not damaged.  Constituents, particularly brokers and those involved in the mortgage industry, have approached me with significant concerns about what is occurring in this sector of society.  After the problems, it is important that the legal profession gets its act together to win back the public&rsquo;s trust.  One cannot demand trust and expect people to give it.  It must be earned.</P>
        <P>As we are discussing the protection of people&rsquo;s rights, it is important to respect the rights of people with disabilities.  In the past 24 hours, the Galway abuse report was published.  Initiated seven years ago, it examined the standards in residential centres where young people with intellectual disabilities were abused, which was unacceptable because their rights must be protected.  I raise this matter because there has been silence from many quarters.  Considerable abuse took place in institutions, but the rights of the young children and adults with intellectual disabilities in question were not protected.  It is important to speak out on this issue because the silence in recent days is sad.</P>
        <P>I encourage people to consider raising national standards and the introduction of inspections of residential centres and community homes for children and adults with intellectual disabilities.  I want to ensure the protection of the almost 400 children with disabilities in residential units and that what occurred in Galway will never recur.  It was a horrific nightmare.  It is difficult enough for the families of children and adults with intellectual disabilities to deal with the major issue itself, but we must speak out and action must be taken when cases of abuse show how vulnerable those young people are.  I raise this matter in the context of the legal profession because it is important in today&rsquo;s debate on barristers and solicitors.  I referred to civic responsibility and trust of the legal profession.</P>
        <P>The Bill is to facilitate and promote the Irish language in our legal system.  I am convinced that the Bill&rsquo;s provisions will lead to significant improvements in the teaching of Irish by King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society.  I am hopeful that the Bill will better ensure that an adequate number <Col N="323"/>of solicitors and barristers are available to provide legal services in Irish to any clients who require them.  Supply and demand is the key issue we must address.  If a different section of society demands barristers and solicitors who can use the language, we must be able to deal with it.  This is the responsibility of all Members of the Oireachtas because we must ensure that the rights of people who want to speak Irish as their first language everyday are protected.  They have a right to have their cases held in Irish, particularly in Gaeltacht areas where it is unacceptable that judges are not proficient in Irish and cannot deal with the cases locally.  We must deal with that to ensure an adequate number of solicitors and barristers is available.</P>
        <P>This is important legislation.  The purpose of the Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Bill is about promoting better use of the Irish language by legal practitioners and the provision of legal services through Irish.  It is important that we deal with this issue and follow it up in a positive and constructive manner.</P>
        <P>I welcome the idea of having an advanced course on the practise of law through the Irish language as an optional subject in professional training courses.  That advanced course will be open to those who are not students but who wish to obtain a competence to enable them practise law through Irish.  I am delighted there are people who want to get directly involved in these courses because they are important, particularly for those who have an interest in the issue and who want to serve their country in that way.  That is important in respect of the legislation before the House.</P>
        <P>We talk about people&rsquo;s rights in respect of the legal profession.  There is a shift in society, and in this regard I commend the human rights lawyers, against those who raise human rights issues.  It is important we are vigilant in terms of our legal standards, protecting human rights and justice issues generally because we must ensure all our citizens are protected and treated with respect.  I link that to this debate because the Bill deals with legal practitioners.  As I said earlier, we cannot allow particular people involved in the legal field to either rip off people or not respect other cultures and languages.</P>
        <P>That leads me to the broader debate, which is important also.  We have many foreign nationals living here and all the languages that involves is another area we should explore.  If we are talking about respecting diversity and celebrating difference, we must respect that difference and if a person&rsquo;s first language is Irish or another language, we should explore that also.</P>
        <P>I am aware there are people in minority communities in the State who have an interest in developing these services, including people from Poland, Nigeria, Latin America, Spain and Italy.  They would be effective in advising those people and they should be supported.  We should think <Col N="324"/>outside the box in developing these services.  We are debating the Irish language in the legal profession but we must be more creative when it comes to respecting minority religions in our own country.  That is the way forward for a country such as ours.  We must accept that we are a rapidly changing country.  There has been a massive change even in the past nine or ten years but we must also manage that and be positive about it.  If people break the law we should treat them the same way as we would treat others and let them suffer the full rigours of the law.  Equally, we must ensure that people&rsquo;s rights are respected, particularly the rights of those from minority communities.</P>
        <P>I raise these issues because there are many people doing valuable work in this area.  Those of us not directly involved with the Irish language or Conradh na Gaeilge but who have many friends and colleagues in this area are aware of the magnificent work they do in developing the language.  I commend them and take this opportunity to welcome the valuable work they do.</P>
        <P>Our language and our culture is a key resource, both for us as a nation and also internationally.  People come to Ireland because they want to see what Ireland is like.  They do not come here and expect to see somewhere like Lanzarote.  They come here for our language, our culture, our new way of life, the rain, our love of beautiful scenery in Kerry, Cork and particularly the very scenic spots in Dublin North Central, Clontarf and around the bay.  I hope that bay will be protected for the next 20 years in the interests of tourism.</P>
        <P>On the legislation, it is important that those in the legal profession listen to the people who are demanding their rights as citizens of this State.  As legislators, we must ensure that we listen and respect the people who want to avail of the services of the courts and justice system through Irish.  Solicitors and barristers should be able to advise people through Irish if that is their choice.  It is about respecting choice.  There is massive potential also with all the gaelscoilleanna being developed in Dublin and urban areas throughout the country.  There is a future in that area for the professions involved.</P>
        <P>I welcome some of the positive contributions to the debate.  I hope some of the ideas I put forward will be accepted and I look forward to future debate.</P>

        <P>Is &eacute; an rud at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh i mBille na nDl&iacute;-Chleacht&oacute;ir&iacute; (An Ghaeilge) 2007, n&aacute; go bhfuiltear ag tarraingt siar ar an riail a bh&iacute; ann i leith na Gaeilge &oacute;n bhliain 1929, Acht Lucht Chleachtuithe Dl&iacute; (C&aacute;il&iacute;ocht) 1929.

Bh&iacute; an Ghaeilge i gceartl&aacute;r gach polasa&iacute; a leagadh s&iacute;os ar mhaithe leis an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>
        <P>T&aacute;im mar Bhall den Teach seo le tamall fada, le ceathr&uacute; c&eacute;id, agus le linn an ama sin t&aacute; an chuid is m&oacute; de na hAchtanna a tugadh isteach ag leagan n&oacute; ag cur deireadh leis na polasaithe a leagadh s&iacute;os.  Mar shampla, roinnt blianta &oacute; shoin tugadh isteach polasa&iacute; nach mbeadh s&eacute; riachtanach go mbeadh Gaeilge ag duine le dul isteach sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s.  Go dt&iacute; sin, bh&iacute; s&eacute; riachtanach go mbeadh cumas agus eolas ar an Ghaeilge ag duine.  Cuireadh deireadh leis an riail agus d&uacute;radh linn go mbeadh an Ghaeilge le f&aacute;il go forleathan ag &eacute;inne a raibh fonn air n&oacute; uirthi a ngn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge leis an St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s, ach n&iacute; mar sin a tharla.</P>

Ar&uacute; anuraidh bh&iacute; m&eacute; sa Teach agus pl&eacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ar cheann de na polasaithe a bh&iacute; i bh&eacute;im os na fichid&iacute;, is &eacute; sin, go mbeadh ar ghach duine a raibh post l&aacute;n-aimseartha buan aige n&oacute; aici i gCol&aacute;iste na hOllscoile, Gaillimh, an Ghaeilge agus scr&uacute;d&uacute; Gaeilge a bheith acu.

T&aacute; deireadh le sin freisin.  D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfainn dul ar aghaidh, bliain i ndiaidh bliana agus Bille i ndiaidh Bhille le feice&aacute;il go bhfuil na polasaithe seo a leagadh s&iacute;os sna fichid&iacute; agus sna tr&iacute;ochaid&iacute; ar mhaithe le taca&iacute;ocht, cuidi&uacute; agus misneach a thabhairt do lucht na Gaeilge ag imeacht ceann i ndiaidh an chinn eile.</P>
        <P Just="Left">N&iacute; f&eacute;idir linn an locht a chur ar an Eoraip.  Is muid f&eacute;in at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh.  Teasta&iacute;onn seo uainn f&eacute;in.

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to debate this important Bill and I will speak in English, if that is okay.</P>
        <P>I went through the Law Society&rsquo;s two Irish examinations, one of which was preliminary and the other advanced.  In both, I wrote a half-page essay on my summer&rsquo;s holidays and translated a half-page from <i>Fiche Bliain ag F&aacute;s</i>, one of ten passages repeatedly used in the examinations.  The Law Society&rsquo;s Irish examination has been a mockery of the language and its use within the legal system.  It bears no relationship to the pro<Col N="328"/>vision of legal services or defending or prosecuting cases in court.</P>
        <P>We may argue that Irish is now a language of the EU but it has been the first and official language of the State in the Constitution.  It is time action was taken in several spheres, particularly for legal practitioners.  This Bill will have a practical effect in improving the lot of the Irish language and help those who wish to get legal advice through the medium of Irish.</P>
        <P>There has been some debate about the merits of the similar Bill from the Labour Party.  There have been many representations on both Bills.  I have raised some of my concerns about the drafting of the Bill with the Minister.  As Deputy McGinley said, there will be much to be discussed on Committee Stage.  I will be glad to examine the amendments offered by Conradh na Gaeilge.</P>
        <P>There is much pressure on us to rush this Bill through but it would be wrong to rush it, and I do not believe it will happen before the King&rsquo;s Inns examinations in January.  Drafting issues arise, and I cannot see how there can be statutory requirements on people to have regard to Government policy when people really should have regard to the provisions of the Constitution, which makes Irish the first and official language of the State.  The difference between the Government Bill and the Labour Party Bill is that the Government Bill promotes the Irish language and seeks to ensure it is available in courts, solicitors&rsquo; offices and barristers&rsquo; chambers.  The Labour Party gives people the option of studying Irish but does not impose any obligations on the Law Society or the King&rsquo;s Inns to ensure that legal services can be provided in Irish.</P>
        <P>Deputy McGinley&rsquo;s point about standards is important, especially when we consider what has passed as an Irish exam.  The King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society should expect a high standard of practitioners who offer their services through Gaeilge.  I am not aware of any facilities for the translation of terminology.  These should be available.  That so many documents are now translated into Irish is a great help and store of knowledge for anyone wishing to practise in Irish.</P>
        <P>Many barristers and solicitors are competent in Irish whereas other barristers may be more competent in the Queen&rsquo;s English.  People say that this is an arcane requirement but the Government and other parties are keen to promote the language.  It is a matter of pride for the State to have its own language to invest in it and provide a legislative framework within which it can progress.</P>
        <P>I wish to digress somewhat because I have been appointed to the board of management of Gaelscoil an Bhrad&aacute;n Feasa.  Several solicitors are involved with it and we seek to promote the Irish language in our communities in East Meath which the school will serve as well as some south of Drogheda.  Unfortunately, however, there is no planning permission for the Gaelscoil to place temporary accommodation on the site provided. <Col N="329"/> An Bord Plean&aacute;la has postponed the decision but I will write asking it to speed that up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is this in the interests of educating the barristers and solicitors of the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>This is very relevant. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  It is important to promote the language at all levels of society.  Several Members have mentioned the Gaelscoileanna because in non-Gaeltacht areas they are the future of the language.  In my constituency there is also Baile Ghib, a small Gaeltacht community where several people are committed to the language.  They do not have much choice among the solicitors in the county if they want their business transacted in Irish.  As long as proper standards are maintained and the Law Society and the King&rsquo;s Inns take the language seriously the Bill will help people like those in Baile Ghib.  </P>
        <P>It is about time the King&rsquo;s Inns changed its name because this is an independent republic with a president and a parliamentary democracy.  This may be a matter for Government if the King&rsquo;s Inns has a charter for its name.  The name is old-fashioned and not suitable to a modern republic.</P>
        <P>I support the thrust of the Bill but think that we need to discuss its individual provisions on Committee Stage.  Meanwhile, I will make some suggestions on this to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrickFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
	<P>It is nice to follow Deputy Byrne who is well-qualified to speak on this issue because of his background in the legal profession. </P>
        <P>The Bill requires that the King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society shall have regard to Government policy on bilingualism.  These new arrangements will involve a significant improvement in the teaching of Irish by King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society and a much more effective way of achieving the Government&rsquo;s Irish language objectives.  This Bill will provide for a significantly higher standard of proficiency in Irish in the legal profession than is delivered under existing statutory provisions, thereby ensuring that all persons wishing to exercise their constitutional right to use Irish in proceedings before the courts can do so.</P>
        <P>The Bill requires the King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society to take reasonable steps to ensure that an adequate number of barristers and solicitors are able to practise the law through the Irish language and that they hold courses on Irish legal terminology and the understanding of legal texts in the Irish language to enable practitioners to identify the nature of the service being sought and, where appropriate, to facilitate a referral to a practitioner competent to provide a service through Irish.  The King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society will also establish advanced courses on the practice of law through the Irish language as optional subjects in their professional training <Col N="330"/>courses.  This advanced course would be open to others who are not students but who wish to obtain competence enabling them to practice law through Irish.</P>
        <P>Examinations in the practice of law through Irish will be held at least once a year and only those persons who have undertaken the advanced course will be permitted to sit the examinations.  There will be an Irish language register of those solicitors who have chosen to undertake the additional new advanced course, passed a new examination in the practice of law through Irish and have been recognised as a solicitor competent to advise clients, prepare documents and conduct court proceedings in Irish.  There will also be a register of competent barristers who have taken the new advanced course, in the practice of law through Irish, and are able to provide their services in Irish.  Both bodies will be required to submit annual reports to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the operation of the new arrangements.</P>
        <P>Commenting on the publication of the Bill, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said that &ldquo;for many years, the passing of the tests specified in either the 1929 or 1954 Solicitors Acts did not signify an ability to carry out business through Irish&rdquo;.  A member of the public will be able to consult any solicitor and barrister who has undertaken the new courses in legal terminology and the understanding of legal texts in the Irish language.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The two exams in place were in the Irish language generally and courses to prepare for exams were a private matter for the trainee solicitor.  In future the solicitor with the basic level of competence in legal terminology in Irish will be able to recognise the type of services required and to refer his or her client to a solicitor registered as competent to provide legal services in Irish.  The reality was that for many years, the passing of the tests specified in either the 1929 or 1954 Solicitors Acts did not signify an ability to carry out business through Irish.  With the proposed changes in education and qualification, a number of practitioners will now be available who will be competent to conduct business in the courts through Irish.  The keeping of a register of such qualified practitioners will facilitate ease of access by the practitioners and public alike to services through Irish, thus assisting implementation in practice of the provisions of the Official Languages Act 2003.</P>
      
        <P>The Government published its statement on the Irish language in December 2006.  The statement provides for the development of a 20 year strategy for the Irish language based on the objectives set out in it.  It is intended that the Government&rsquo;s policy statement will be the foundation for practical action for supporting and promoting the Irish language, based on a modern approach and an integrated strategy.</P><Col N="331"/>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy is to increase awareness and use of the Irish language as a community language on a phased basis.  Its specific aim is to ensure that as many of our citizens as possible are bilingual in Irish and English.  The intention is not to displace the English language but to strengthen the Irish language.  In many European countries, it is normal that people are bilingual and the vision for Ireland is similar, with both English and Irish being widely used on a daily basis throughout the country.</P>
        <P>During the course of 2007, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has engaged in a public procurement process regarding the appointment of consultants to advise in respect of the strategy.  This process is nearing completion and it is expected that consultants will be appointed by the end of the year.  It is envisaged that the strategy will be completed by December 2008.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember that much has been achieved with regard to the Irish language and in Gaeltacht areas in recent years.  The Official Languages Act 2003 was passed by this Government to ensure Irish speakers are not compelled to abandon use of the language when availing of public services.  Irish is now one of the official working languages of the EU and the number of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta supported jobs increased again in 2006.</P>
        <P>A fund of &euro;1 million was set up to support specialised third level courses through Irish and according to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht affairs the number of students involved in such courses in 2006 was the largest ever.</P>
        <P>Mn&aacute; t&iacute; provide accommodation for Irish language students in the Gaeltacht and the grant for them was increased greatly.  Tax relief was given on the income they receive for providing this accommodation and for the first time a larger grant was provided for students with disabilities.</P>

Caithfidh an Oireachtas iarracht n&iacute;os m&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh chun an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn an teanga a labhairt i bhfad n&iacute;os minic&iacute; sa Teach seo n&aacute; mar a dh&eacute;anaimid faoi l&aacute;thair.  Tugaim taca&iacute;ocht don Bhille seo, a chinnteoidh go n-&uacute;s&aacute;idfidh dl&iacute;od&oacute;ir&iacute; agus breithimh ar fud na t&iacute;re an Ghaeilge i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute;, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r sa Ghaeltacht.  It is important that we support the Bill not only because of its implications for the use of the Irish language but also in view of a recent court case where a translation from English into Irish was queried and tested.  In that instance, the interpretation of the translation by f&iacute;or gaelg&oacute;ir&iacute; was successful and the case was withdrawn.  There must be confidence in the courts process in terms of the use of Irish and associated translation services.  It is important that judges, solicitors and others in the legal profession have no concerns in this regard.</P>
        <P>We should not allow a situation such as that to develop again.  When one reads the details, i nGaeilge agus i mB&eacute;arla, den toradh a bh&iacute; ar an gc&aacute;s &uacute;d, it is a cause for concern that a case might be lost merely on the basis of one person&rsquo;s interpretation.  There must be certainty about the proficiency of those working through the medium of Irish in the courts system.  In counties Donegal, Kerry, Waterford and Meath, significant numbers may wish to deal with the courts through Irish.  Most do so not because translation of transcripts might lead to confusion in terms of the interpretation or application of the law but because Irish is their spoken language.  It is important that every facility is made available within the legal profession and through the education system to ensure court services can be delivered proficiently through the Irish language.</P>
        <P>Many of us argue repeatedly that we should make greater use of Irish in the House.  The <Col N="334"/>services available to Members, if only we would avail of them, are first class in terms of assistance with terminology and so on.  We would all have to put our hand on heart and say that unless we are cleachtaithe sa Ghaeilge, n&iacute; bheimid in ann &iacute; a labhairt go fl&uacute;irseach sa Teach seo n&oacute; sa Seanad.  It is important that every encouragement is given to modifying the rigidity of Irish language training at both primary and secondary level.  Far greater emphasis should be placed on the spoken word.  I am delighted the Minister for Education and Science has made some progress by allowing a greater proportion of marks in both junior and leaving certificate Irish for the oral component.  There should be less emphasis on the strict presentation of the written word and the complicated grammar that most of us can recall learning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent years there has been support at European level for the idea that ours should be a spoken, living language.  Gaelscoileanna have played an enormous part in improving the accessibility of the language.  Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and TG4 have done tremendous work.  It is to be expected that both would facilitate the reportage of court proceedings through Irish.  If there was a noted presence of Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and TG4, as well as <i>Foinse</i>, <i>L&aacute; Nua </i>agus mar sin de, and they reported court cases more extensively, as they are done in local and national papers, it would be made more obvious to the courts that it is important we have greater emphasis on and certainty of Irish usage.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that despite our language being recognised as an official language of the EU, we do not have translators.  It has been quite clearly stated there is a crisis in that regard in Brussels.  That must be rectified if we are serious about the matter.  If complaints can be made on that level and despite the fight taken on to get the language recognised as an official language in Europe, we must respond by making available personnel and support resources.</P>
        <P>The legislation we are talking about today will not have a major cost, either within the Department of Education and Science or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but if we are serious about the language we must be seen to have a supportive and balanced response where needed.  I welcome the provisions of the Bill and hope the courses made available will be successful.</P>
        <P>We must overcome a problem regarding lawyers trained outside Ireland, such as those from Britain.  It will be difficult for such people to gain proficiency in the Irish language but there should be a support mechanism for them to avoid positions where any part of the court procedures would take place tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.</P>
        <P>There should be standardised interpretation and translation of all phrases and terminology of the court system.  On reading such a guide, one could wonder how there has been so much variation.  I hope this Bill will eliminate such issues from any future court proceedings, and a court <Col N="335"/>case will never again be thrown out because of variation in interpretation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to make a brief contribution on this important Bill, the Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Bill 2007.  I am sensitive to a group of young people in the Gallery who are still attending school and very much involved in learning Irish.  I absolutely enjoyed Irish at school but as I have aged, my Irish vocabulary has become rusty.  I have tried to correct this recently, as other colleagues have, by going to the Irish language classes here.  We are speaking about legal practitioners being encouraged so it would be good if the others were also encouraged.  I would promote that idea as I am as rusty as anybody.  It is important we make an effort in that regard.</P>
        <P>I was impressed by Deputy Thomas Byrne speaking from a legal background.  He pointed out that a good time to start with the Irish language is at a very young age, and he spoke about efforts in his constituency.  I could talk about efforts in Dublin South-West and Tallaght, and in particular the Irish schools there.  These include Scoil Santain, where my son Niall attended and Scoil Chaitl&iacute;n Maude, which are doing a tremendous job.  Not only are they teaching the language but they are helping the cultural revolution that is required in these modern times.  Col&aacute;iste de h&Iacute;de, the second level Irish school in Tymon north, is also promoting that idea.  I agree with the point, made by several speakers along with Deputy Byrne that we should not give up the fight to the Irish language message across.  I admit I am not a practitioner, unfortunately, but I want to prove commitment to the language.  In the context of this Bill it is a relevant point to make.</P>
        <P>I listened to the debate earlier, including fine contributions by colleagues, including Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea.  He did not agree with everything said on the Government benches.  It is also beneficial that the public sees us dealing with this type of business, which could be seen as somewhat routine.  It is right for us to take it very seriously.</P>
        <P>I hope when the media covers the topic it will not be buried.  I will watch &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; tonight, as I often do, and I hope this debate will get the level of attention I believe is necessary.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, would appreciate the point.  I do not mean to speak on Tallaght much, but my local parish priest, Fr. Frank Herron, is from Donegal.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the Bill replaces existing statutory provisions for Irish language competence for barristers and solicitors and promotes, as has been noted by several speakers, the provision of legal services through Irish, as well as better use of the Irish language by legal practitioners.  We know that under present arrangements there is no obligation for either the King&rsquo;s Inns or the Law Society to provide compulsory or <Col N="336"/>optional courses in the Irish language for students undertaking either the barrister at law degree course or the professional practice course in the Law Society.</P>
        <P>Deputy Thomas Byrne made the point that perhaps it is time, almost 100 years after we have gained independence, that the question of some of these phrases and names be considered.  There may be traditionalists in the community who do not want this to happen but the Deputy made a fair point.</P>
        <P>The Legal Practitioners (Qualification) Act 1929 provides that no person may be admitted by the Chief Justice to practise as a barrister at law in Irish courts unless he or she satisfies the Chief Justice by such evidence as the Chief Justice shall prescribe, that he or she possesses a competent knowledge of the Irish language.  Competent knowledge is defined as such a degree of oral and written proficiency in the use of the language as is sufficient to enable a legal practitioner effectively receive instructions, advise clients or examine witnesses and follow proceedings in the Irish language.</P>
        <P>The obligation to ensure proficiency in Irish in the case of any barrister who wishes to be called to the Bar lies with the Chief Justice but there is no requirement to include Irish as either an optional or obligatory subject to the King&rsquo;s Inns barrister at law degree course.  Any tuition or record of proficiency required is given outside the degree course by King&rsquo;s Inns and arranged so that the Chief Justice can fulfil his or her statutory function.</P>
        <P>The 1929 Act applied to solicitors until 1954, when new arrangements were introduced in the Solicitors Act of that year.  To qualify for admission as a solicitor, the Act required that the Law Society compel students to undertake two examinations in the Irish language.  The first examination applies to persons seeking an apprenticeship and the second applies to those who wish to be admitted as solicitors.  The purpose of the second examination is to prove that persons who pass it have a competent knowledge of Irish.  That is to say such a degree of oral and written proficiency in the use of the language as is sufficient to enable a solicitor to receive instructions efficiently and to advise clients, to examine witnesses and to follow proceedings in the Irish language.  That is the same test as used in the 1929 Act for barristers.</P>
        <P>I also share the view expressed by other colleagues about the new Ireland in which we find ourselves with the international community in our State.  In my parish, the local school, St. Mark&rsquo;s, in my estate in Springfield has 1,000 pupils, 500 of whom come from 55 different states.  Deputy Burke and others made the point that different challenges will come in the future.  The Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made that point strongly in his contribution.  There will be challenges in the future where we are encouraging young people from Ireland but of international <Col N="337"/>origin regarding these provisions.  It will be interesting to see how that develops in time.  The Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, was right to make that point and I am glad that somebody of his stature did so.  I expect it will give the Government and future governments food for thought.  I wish them well in that regard because it will be a particularly difficult nettle to grasp if that is what it is.</P>
        <P>The Bill requires King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society to have regard to Government policy on bilingualism and to take reasonable steps to ensure that an adequate number of barristers and solicitors are able to practise the law through the Irish language.  The Bill requires King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society to provide for courses of study and the establishment of registers by them recording details of practitioners who are able to provide legal services in Irish.  This week I had intended to contact various solicitors&rsquo; practices in my constituency to gauge their response to the Bill.  However, because of other business, I found myself, as others do as we approach Christmas, snowed under.  However, I intend to seek out all the solicitors in my constituency, all of whom I know, to ascertain how they feel about this provision.  I intend to research what level of use of the Irish language is present in all those practices.  I suspect it is not just in my constituency that the levels are low.  I know in the Minister of State&rsquo;s county of Donegal there would be no problem in finding a solicitor able to deal as Gaeilge.  However, I suspect in many other areas, including Waterford and certainly around the Dublin region, there may be challenges and gaps in that regard.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society hold courses on Irish language terminology and the understanding of legal texts in the Irish language to enable practitioners to identify the nature of the service being sought and, where appropriate, to facilitate a referral to a practitioner competent to provide the service through Irish.  All King&rsquo;s Inns students and the Law Society trainees will be required to complete these courses, which I welcome.  King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society will also establish an advanced course on the practice of law through the Irish language as an optional subject in their professional training courses.  This advanced course would be open to others who are not students but who wish to obtain a competence enabling them to practise law through the Irish language.</P>
        <P>Examinations in the practice of law through Irish will be held at least once a year and only those persons who have undertaken the advanced course will be permitted to sit all those examinations.  The name and contact details of barristers and solicitors who pass the examinations will be entered on registers established and published by King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society.  Both bodies will be required to submit an annual report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the operation of the new arrangements.  In mentioning the Minister, I am sorry he is not here. <Col N="338"/> Like other colleagues, I was sorry to hear of his bereavement and I offer my condolences to his family.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements will involve a significant improvement in the teaching of Irish by King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society, and will represent a much more effective way of achieving the Government&rsquo;s Irish language objectives.  The Bill will provide for a level of proficiency in Irish in the legal profession of a significantly higher standard than is being delivered under existing statutory provisions.  It is hoped that all persons wishing to avail of their constitutional right to use Irish in proceedings before the courts can of course do so, which will have considerable support across the House.  For many years the passing of the test as specified in the 1929 Act or the 1954 Act did not signify an ability to carry out business through the Irish language.  It is clear that the objectives of the existing statutory requirements are not being met.  Not all solicitors and barristers are capable of conducting the full range of legal business through the Irish language.</P>
        <P>Even those of us who admit to rustiness in the use of the Irish language understand the need for this legislation, which deserves good debate.  I have listened to most of today&rsquo;s speeches and there is clearly considerable agreement across the House.  It is good to hear that that agreement will be put into force.  The Minister should note that many will feel that the Bill should pass as quickly as possible.  In this case it will be referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, under the chairmanship of Deputy Peter Power.  I know colleagues will take the opportunity to go through the different sections of the Bill line by line, which will be good.  I hope that process will be expedited and we will get the opportunity of passing it into law as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will know that there will be a job to be done by many people, starting with the legal profession, to promote the provisions of this Bill.  We need to get the message across that people can and will have the opportunity to conduct their business through Irish.  It is important for that to be seen as a voluntary exercise.  I recently heard young people saying that they are not happy to have it forced down their throats.  It should be given as an option.  It is right that we should have an understanding of our language as we approach 100 years after independence.</P>
        <P>This would be true in urban areas.  People who want to do their business through the Irish language should not be seen as unusual, which is sometimes the case.  Even when we get correspondence on different cases as Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, that may be the reaction.  However, it should be the most natural thing in the world for people, if they are competent to do so, to conduct all business through Irish.  The Bill not only deals with the Irish language needs of the legal profession, but also sends out a positive message generally, which <Col N="339"/>I know the Minister of State, more than most of us, would strongly support.  I am very happy to support the Bill, which I commend to the House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;Adequate&rdquo; is effusive praise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The tragic events in recent weeks have once again demonstrated the dangers associated with drug misuse in a stark and public way.  The problem is a complex and difficult one for which there is no quick fix or easy solution.  The changing nature of drug use, specifically the emergence of cocaine and polydrug use in recent years, presents significant challenges for everyone involved in trying to tackle the problem.  We will continue to facilitate and support agreed international responses to the issue while pursuing our own goals through<?oasys _jy ?>the policy framework of the national drugs strategy.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the considerable contribution made by my constituency colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, while he was a Minister of State through his work with the ministerial task force <Col N="343"/>on measures to reduce the demand for drugs, which laid the foundation for the development of our current strategy.  As the House will appreciate, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under the stewardship of the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, is the lead Department in co-ordinating the implementation of the strategy.  The process of drawing up a new strategy to which my Department and the Garda will contribute fully is under way.</P>
        <P>One of the Garda&rsquo;s primary functions is to reduce the supply of illegal drugs of all kinds.  While much of the public attention in recent days has naturally centred on cocaine, the Garda must tackle illegal drugs of all kinds.  The value of drugs seized demonstrates how active the Garda is in this regard.  The most recent figures for this year show that more than &euro;22 million worth of heroin, approximately &euro;13 million worth of cannabis and nearly &euro;3 million worth of ecstasy tablets have been seized.  Including the cocaine at Dunlough Bay in Cork last July, more than &euro;117 million worth of cocaine has been seized this year.  While it may be argued that the find in Cork was to some extent fortuitous, nevertheless a substantial Garda operation was initiated to bring those involved to justice.  These drugs seizures are evidence of the scale of the drug problem, but they are also an indication of the amount of work being done to try to reduce the supply of<?oasys _jy ?>drugs.</P>
        <P>Under the national strategy, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to pursue its strategies to restrict the supply of all illegal drugs in this jurisdiction vigorously.  The Garda National Drugs Unit will continue to co-ordinate large-scale operations against drug dealing or trafficking, with unit personnel investigating cases and assisting local investigation teams as appropriate.  Additional assistance will continue to be made available from other specialised Garda support units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  The new Garda Commissioner, Fachtna Murphy, has made clear the priority the Garda gives to the drugs problem and he is reviewing with his people on the ground their strategies for addressing this issue.</P>
        <P>Of particular relevance in tackling the supply of cocaine to this jurisdiction is the recent establishment of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre in Lisbon.  This centre, of which Ireland is a founding member, will focus on exchanging intelligence leading to the detection of large maritime and aviation drug shipments.  It will focus particularly on the trafficking of cocaine from South and Latin America.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to ensure that the Garda has sufficient resources to tackle the problem and the policing priorities for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which the Minister set recently under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, reflect the urgency with <Col N="344"/>which the Government continues to regard the issue of drug trafficking.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
<P Just="Left">These priorities refer to specific enhanced activity by the force and the Garda National Drugs Unit in particular in places where the presence of drug dealing and the use of illicit drugs is likely.  Of its nature, this would include particular pubs and clubs.  The Garda has been targeting places of this kind and intends to intensify that activity.  The Garda engages in undercover activity to try to bring those involved in the drugs trade to justice.</P>
        <P>It is also important to acknowledge that the Garda needs co-operation from all sections of society in trying to tackle this problem.  Anyone who has information about those supplying drugs, however small the scale, should give it to the Garda.  The policing priorities refer to enhanced liaison arrangements between the Garda divisions and the Criminal Assets Bureau so that those engaging in drug dealing at all levels can be pursued.  Profilers trained by CAB are now present in each division.</P>
        <P>Deputies will agree that, while the State has clear responsibilities in these matters, the fact is that all citizens have choices to make and responsibilities to uphold with regard to drug use.  With the attention of public opinion focused on this issue now more than ever, there is a particular onus on us all not to tolerate or accept any level of drug use in our society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister of State that Ireland has had a bad time in terms of the use of cocaine and other illegal drugs, which has brought forward the stark reality of the Ireland of 2007.</P>
        <P>Regarding the reduction of supply, it was revealed this week that customs officials charged with responsibility for coastline protection have one X-ray scanner for the entire country.  The scanner is useful in detecting illegal drugs, particularly cocaine, along our coastline but if it is being used in Rosslare, the thousands of miles outside Rosslare are free.  Criminals know when the scanner is located in a particular place.  It is nothing short of a disgrace that an island nation has only one scanner.  What steps does the Government propose to take to increase the number of such machines?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is doing everything in its power to increase the level of surveillance along the coastline, one of the largest in terms of this issue.  Ireland has invested significantly in the foundation of the maritime surveillance operation in Lisbon, which will be effective.  There are well known routes through which drugs are trafficked into this country, particularly from Latin and South America.  If there is a further requirement for a customs scan<Col N="345"/>ner, I do not doubt that the Minister will upgrade and provide the necessary facilities, but there has been no request for additional resources to date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>One is enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Government will respond if there is a request for further facilities to assist in the detection of drug smuggling.  There has been a considerable upsurge in the number of seizures and fines.  It is not the case that the figures are going in the wrong direction.  They are going in the right direction relative to the amount of drugs being smuggled in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree with the Taoiseach that the Garda ought to raid house parties or does he believe it to be entirely impractical?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda has indicated to the Department that it will be more vigilant concerning the presence of drugs generally, whether in pubs, clubs, nightclubs, night spots or private houses.  However, there is an operational dimension to the issue.  If the Garda is to begin raiding house parties of one kind or another, there will be a requirement for warrants so that the power is not open to abuse.  Garda&iacute; can routinely enter public houses or nightclubs with a view to investigating whether drug misuse is occurring.  I am sure the Garda will consider the operational issue of getting warrants to raid private homes if it believes the matter should be pursued.  The Government will not stand in the way should the Garda want procedures along the lines of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>From the reply, I gather that the Minister of State does not agree with the Taoiseach and believes the suggestion is impractical.  As garda&iacute; may enter public houses for the purposes of inspecting compliance with licensing laws, why would this provision not be extended to permit garda&iacute; to enter such premises to inspect suspected offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act?  Allow me to give the Minister of State another opportunity to say whether the Taoiseach was talking off the top of his head when he said garda&iacute; should raid house parties.  Perhaps they should, but would it be practical?  I did not ask the Minister of State about whether garda&iacute; should raid public houses or public places, I asked about private house parties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is mischievously trying to bring me into conflict with the Taoiseach.  He will find I am a loyal Minister of State in that regard.  I emphasise clearly that garda&iacute; already have the power to enter premises that we describe as public houses or night spots of one kind or another.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Not under the Misuse of Drugs Act.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="346"/>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand garda&iacute; have the power to inspect premises with regard to potential or actual drug misuse in a public house setting.  There is a different issue, legally, in regard to private homes.  The Minister is a lawyer but I am not.  However, I understand the law on the matter is that if one were to specify a raid on a private home with regard to potential or actual drug misuse, there would be a requirement for a warrant.  Powers may be available to the Garda under general public order legislation if a house party were being conducted in a way that was clearly a threat to public order in a neighbourhood.  I hope that provides the clarity the Deputy seeks.  I am sorry I cannot conflict with the Taoiseach on this vital matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>On 24 October, during a debate in the House on drugs, I called for 24-hour surveillance on known crime bosses, given that only a small number of them are involved in this illegal activity.  What exactly has the Government done to facilitate this 24-hour surveillance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Operation Anvil has been up and running for some time and has been very successful.  It concentrates Garda resources, including spending on overtime, in order that garda&iacute; can focus their efforts on particular areas and gangs where they may be active.  It is essentially the type of operation I hope the Deputy would welcome because it is entirely in tune with what he is calling for.  At least 100 people have been charged with murder offences under the umbrella of Operation Anvil.  I am glad the Deputy supports it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Having regard to the tragedies of recent weeks and the fact that yesterday the newspapers reported on three coroner&rsquo;s inquests into cocaine deaths, what three additional top priority measures does the Department propose to take to deal with this phenomenon?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not intend to reduce our priorities to a numerical basis.  I merely point out that the expansion of cocaine usage is a very serious problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State need not prioritise.  He can just tell us what new measures the Department proposes to take.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I said in my initial reply that there was no simple quick-fix solution to this problem.  It requires sustained work by the Garda and the Department.  I do not believe there is currently a requirement for additional legislation.  We need to continue to reinvest in the existing resources deployed through the drug units in every Garda district.  We also require leadership from parents, other citizens and even <Col N="347"/>the Members opposite to carry the anti-drug message to the public, given that in the past few years, because of affluence, many have become dilatory and complacent with regard to drug usage.  There is an issue around prevention and challenging a culture that finds it acceptable and is tolerant of drug taking.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Charles Flanagan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> the policy changes he proposes to introduce in view of the ever increasing use of illegal firearms and offensive weapons, particularly in the area of serious crime and homicide. </Quest>
        <QRef>[34766/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government attach the highest importance to tackling the use of illegal firearms and offensive weapons generally.  The first of the priorities which the Minister has determined in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2008 is targeting gun crime and the illegal activities most closely associated with such crime, organised crime and drug trafficking.  The Minister has asked that, in pursuing this priority, particular emphasis be placed on the use of specialist units and targeted operations such as Operation Anvil; profiling, intelligence gathering and threat assessments in relation to individuals and groups involved; delivery of Garda commitments under the national drugs strategy; pursuit by the Criminal Assets Bureau of the proceeds of crime; and enhanced activities by the drugs units and the force generally.  </P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that as of 9 December there were 18 murders this year where a firearm was used.  While all of these deaths are completely unacceptable, the figure shows a reduction for the corresponding period last year, which was 22.  With regard to serious or headline crime, the most recent figures available are for the period up to 30 September.  They show that there had been no increase in such crime in the 12 month period to that date.  There are no grounds for complacency, but there should be some recognition for what the Garda is achieving.</P>
        <P>Our legislation in regard to firearms and other offensive weapons is properly severe.  The mandatory sentence for murder is life imprisonment.   The Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for high mandatory minimum and maximum sentences for firearms offences, for example, a maximum of life imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years for the possession of firearms with intent to endanger life and the use of a firearm to resist arrest or aid escape.  The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 and the Offensive Weapons Order 1991, which control knives and offensive weapons, lay down prohibitions on such weapons and severe penalties for breaking the prohibitions.  The Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 have updated and strengthened the law <Col N="348"/>in many areas important to the fight against gun crime.  The Government will continue to bring forward proposals to strengthen the law, including the creation of a national DNA database.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P>Over the lifetime of this and the last Government we will have significantly increased the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The current programme for Government reaffirms the commitment to a Garda strength of 15,000, with a target date of 2010, and commits us to increasing the strength of the force further to 16,000 by 2012.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil is central to the strategy of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating serious crime and, in particular, murder.  The operation which commenced in the Dublin metropolitan region in May 2005 and was subsequently extended nationwide at the Minister&rsquo;s request has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.  Notable improvements have been achieved in the recorded number of incidents of crime being targeted by the operation.  The most recent figures available, up to 9 December, show that as a result of the operation there have been 816 firearms seized or recovered in the Dublin region alone.  There have been 100 arrests for murder, 2,796 for burglary and 1,260 for robbery; more than 40,000 searches for drugs; more than 75,000 checkpoints and property to the value of more than &euro;23.7 million recovered.  Outside the Dublin region, there have been 569 firearms seized.</P>
        <P>While, as the Minister indicated, the fight against those involved in these types of offences is going to be long and has to be relentless, the approach being taken by the Minister and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the unprecedented level of resources being made available to it are producing results which must be built on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation is escalating beyond the control of either the Garda or the Government.  This week alone, on Monday night a man was stabbed to death in a Dublin laneway, on Saturday night a teenager received gunshot wounds to the hand in a shooting in Artane, on Friday night a man was found with a gunshot wound in a rural part of Rathcoole.  This is a daily occurrence.  Where are the criminals sourcing the weapons?  What steps has the Government taken to track down the suppliers of weapons and stop the import of dangerous highly sophisticated weapons from eastern Europe and other parts of the world?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to minimise the problem or sound complacent by quoting the figures I quoted in my initial reply, but the bottom line is that year on year &mdash; I am not saying one swallow makes a summer or that one <Col N="349"/>year&rsquo;s figures are evidence of a serious regression &mdash; there has been a welcome reduction in the number of murders and offences involving weapons.  It is also the case that the majority of unsolved murders are typically the result of internecine fighting between criminal gangs.  The situation is not as bad as depicted by the Member opposite.  The overarching figures on crime are extremely positive.  If one takes a ten-year view of the crime statistics, the number of crimes committed per thousand is well down from a high of 27 or 28 crimes per 1,000 ten years ago to between 23 and 25 per 1,000 today.  That is against a background of a rising population&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is massaging his figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and extra pressure on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because of that growing population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is wasted in integration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is massaging the figures.  It is easy to highlight one year.  The fact is that last year we had the highest number of murders caused by illegal firearms in the history of the State.</P>
        <P>On a specific matter, it appears many of these illegal weapons were used by the provisional IRA in Northern Ireland in the past.  What steps is the Minister taking to intervene in terms of the illegal importation of weapons formerly used in Belfast, Northern Ireland, by members of the republican movement in particular?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a detailed question which, perhaps more properly, should be directed to the Garda Commissioner.  With regard to weapons becoming available because of the post-conflict situation on the island, it must be remembered that many of the guns that arrived here did so for many different reasons.  A significant contributor to firearms becoming available to the criminal classes here is the theft of firearms from farmhouses.  Farmers living in isolated settings are being deliberately targeted for their shotguns and weapons that are used in the farm setting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister is not blaming farmers for the escalation in gun crime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a serious issue.  I do not have figures available to me on the percentage of weapons now available because of the post-conflict situation in the North only to say that is something the Garda monitors regularly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In all family law proceedings relating to the upbringing of a child, the court must always regard the child&rsquo;s welfare as the first and paramount consideration.  Where appropriate and practicable, the court will take into account also the child&rsquo;s wishes in the matter having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  In addition, the law now places an emphasis in terms of recognising the rights of the child to the society of both of his or her parent.  Section 11D of the 1964 Act, inserted by the Children Act 1997, obliges the court in proceedings relating to the welfare of a child to consider whether the child&rsquo;s best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct and regular contact with both his or her father and mother.</P>
        <P>Under the law as it stands, married parents living together are joint guardians and custodians of their child.  If they separate, the custody is normally with the parent with whom the child is intended to reside, but the other parent still remains a guardian.</P>
        <P>An unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child.  Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, appointing the father as a guardian of his child and without having to go to court.</P>
        <P>The 1997 Act also provides for an emphasis on counselling and mediation as alternatives to court proceedings concerning the custody of and access to children.  It encourages couples who are in dispute to think in terms of agreeing to the custody of and access to their children without the need for court interventions.  Before instituting proceedings for guardianship, custody or access, a solicitor must discuss with the parent the possibility of engaging in counselling and mediation to assist in effecting an agreement between the parties.  The court may adjourn any proceedings <Col N="351"/>for the purpose of enabling attempts to be made by the parties to reach agreement, with or without the assistance of a third party, on some or all of the issues in dispute.  An agreement in writing between parties relating to custody, access or maintenance can be made a rule of court and thus become enforceable in the same way as if it were a court order.  Mediation on the various issues is by its nature a voluntary act to be undertaken by two persons who are in dispute.</P>
        <P>The Family Support Agency, operating under the aegis of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, following the enactment of the Family Support Agency Act 2001, brings together programmes designed to support ongoing parenting relationships for children.  Its functions include the provision of a family mediation service, both directly or through support for others providing these services, and the administering of grants for such purposes.</P>
        <P>As regards the hearing of family law cases in general, the <i>in camera </i>rule has recently been relaxed in that the law now allows certain classes of persons to attend family law cases to draw up and publish reports, subject to certain safeguards including a requirement that the parties to a case or any relevant child would not be identifiable.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware of the concerns of fathers in the area of family law.  Operation of the law in this area is being kept under review in his Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister expand on the last point he made about the nature of the review?  I invite him to comment on a recent judgment of Mr. Justice McKechnie in the High Court wherein he called for a review of the law on fathers&rsquo; rights.  One child in three in this country is born to unmarried parents and it is timely that matters would be reviewed having regard to the fact that, in law, the father does not have any automatic rights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is cognisant of the issues arising in this question and these matters are under review in his Department.  That is a commitment from the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does that mean legislation is envisaged?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Wider issues arise involving the consistency of judgments as between courts, whether they be in an urban or rural setting.  An issue has been raised directly by judges with the Department and its officials about the consistency across the courts system with regard to decisions and matters arising from the family courts.  I understand there is a commitment from judges to provide more consistency in terms of the judgments in this area.  That is to be welcomed.</P><Col N="352"/>
        <P>The Minister also commissioned a report by Dr. Carol Coulter on the operation of the family courts.  That report has been published and made available to the public.  Many of the points made in the report are being absorbed into the system, either at official level or by the courts themselves.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> the consideration given by him to revise family law to create a new court family and assessment service to assist the courts in determining family law proceedings and in particular issues relating to the guardianship, custody and upbringing of children and in determining care proceedings relating to children.</Quest>
        <QRef>[34646/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In all family law proceedings relating to the guardianship, custody and upbringing of a child, the court must always regard the child&rsquo;s welfare as the first and paramount consideration.  Where appropriate and practicable, the court will also take into account the child&rsquo;s wishes in the matter having regard to his or her age and understanding.  Similar statutory provisions apply in proceedings in respect of the care and protection of a child.</P>
        <P>With regard to family assessments, section 47 of the Family Law Act 1995 provides that reports can be ordered by the courts dealing with questions affecting the welfare of any party to the proceedings.  These reports deal mainly with child custody and access.  In the past, they were provided by the probation and welfare service.  However, because of the demands of the criminal courts, I understand the probation and welfare service has not been in a position to provide this service for some time.</P>
        <P>Following a request from the Courts Service, the probation and welfare service agreed in 2003 to set up a pilot project for one year to provide these reports for the Dublin circuit family law courts.  This initiative was of great assistance to judges but, owing to pressures from the probation and welfare service&rsquo;s core business in the criminal courts, the pilot was discontinued after one year.  As a result, parties involved in family law disputes often engaged medical consultants, psychologists and others at considerable cost to provide evidence in court.  Some judges dealing with family law expressed concern with the &ldquo;over-medicalisation&rdquo; of family law and the conflicting nature of the reports provided by these medical experts.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Courts Service and the probation and welfare service reached agreement earlier this year that a system funded by the Courts Service would be established for the provision of reports to the family law courts and that the probation and welfare service would assist in the monitoring and quality control of this system.</P>
        <P>Those providing this service will not be direct employees of the probation and welfare service <Col N="353"/>but contracted on a fee per report basis.  Reports will be provided by a panel of external contractors, in the main social workers and retired probation officers.  The panel will have a national geographic spread and reports will be carried out by persons for a fixed fee per report.  It is intended that this system will commence initially in the Dublin circuit family law courts.  The probation and welfare service is appointing a senior manager to supervise and assure quality in this contract arrangement.</P>
        <P>The Minister welcomes this initiative and is appreciative of the constructive work involved on the part of both agencies in developing this service.  While he has no direct responsibility in the matter, the Minister will do whatever he can to support the initiative and looks forward to the service being fully established and working effectively to provide a service to families who find themselves in difficulty.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the proposed service begin?  If it is to start in Dublin, will it only apply to the three Circuit Courts dealing with family law in Dublin?  Guardianship and custody disputes relating to children are dealt with in the District Court to a greater extent than in the Circuit Court.</P>
        <P>Care proceedings relating to children are dealt with exclusively in the District Court.  For years District Court judges have been crying out for a coherent and dedicated service to provide welfare assessments relating to children and family assessments to assist them in their decision-making.  Such decisions are often made by High Court judges.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Why is it deemed this service should be provided for Dublin Circuit Court judges, and some outside Dublin, but to none of the Judiciary dealing with family cases in the District Courts or the High Court?  Will the Minister of State acknowledge it is preferable to provide a dedicated family and welfare assessment service, available to all the Judiciary dealing with family cases?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State explain why child psychiatrists, who frequently assist the courts in such cases through private payment, are excluded through the proposed scheme?</P>

The probation and welfare service is in the process of appointing a family law coordinator who will liaise with the Judiciary on the service it should access.  Referrals will be processed through the Courts Service and accompanied with a sworn affidavit by the applicant and the respondent.  Hopefully, the pilot project will result in a permanent standing service, which the Minister and his officials wish to happen.</P>

	<P>The last project that lasted for one year crashed in 2003.  Will the Minister of State admit that the new proposal is a half-baked grossly inadequate scheme thrown together in desperation to make a pretence of a response to Carol Coulter&rsquo;s report?</P>
        <P>This area needs radical reform with the replacement of the current fragmented court structures with a dedicated system of family courts with proper family assessment and mediation services.  Has the Government considered such radical change with the necessary constitutional referendum to put in place a separate court system to deal with family matters?</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the fact that as of the end of November 2007 there were more than 111,000 outstanding warrants, including 36,000 bench warrants, and whether this indicates a serious problem with the enforcement of court warrants; the steps he will take to deal with this situation and to ensure those in respect of whom warrants are in existence will be called to account; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[34518/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures were provided by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in response to a parliamentary question.  They refer to all warrants recorded on the PULSE system since the commencement of a new release of the system in November 2003, when all remaining outstanding warrants were transferred to the PULSE system.</P>
        <P>It is inevitable in any criminal justice system that at any given time there are a significant number of warrants awaiting execution.  The majority of the outstanding warrants relate to financial penalties, not to violent crime.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to give priority to the enforcement of warrants arising in serious cases.</P>
        <P>It is the case too that many individuals are subject to multiple warrants.  Aside from the large volume of warrants being issued, there can also be unavoidable reasons that warrants take time to execute or prove ultimately unenforceable.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to be precise as to what level of outstanding warrants at any time represents the optimal situation.  The number of warrants outstanding has to be seen in the context of the constantly increasing strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, now in the region of 14,000.  Nevertheless, the Minister has sought from the Garda Commissioner a detailed report on the implementation of warrants in so far as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is concerned.</P>
        <P>In the interim, he has been advised that the Garda Commissioner has recognised that steps need to be taken to reduce the number of outstanding warrants as much as possible.  Each regional assistant commissioner has been directed to give priority to this issue and to review procedures in their areas for the execution of warrants.</P><Col N="356"/>
        <P>The Minister is also taking several steps to deal with this issue.  A particular difficulty is that cases relating to the non-payment of fines clog up the courts system since the Garda have to seek warrants to enforce their payment.  A pilot project has been introduced by the Department under which outstanding fines have in effect been pursued in terms of debt collection by an outside agency, rather than moving directly to the stage where the Garda seeks a warrant.  This pilot project is proving successful and seems to offer good grounds for introducing it on a wider footing.  The Department, in consultation with the Garda and the Courts Service, will take it forward.</P>
     
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P>There is also a Fines Bill before the House.  Among other things, it provides for the payment of fines by instalment and an improved means of assessing the capacity of a person to pay a fine.  These proposals, if implemented, will result in a smaller number of warrants being issued and so reduce pressure on the warrant system.  The Minister is also looking at other legislative measures which might help in the whole area of collection of fines so as to improve the efficiency of the system, particularly by reducing the amount of Garda time dedicated to the warrants process.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission is at present finalising its next programme of law reform, which will begin in 2008.  The programme will include an examination of the enforcement of court orders and the service of proceedings in both civil and criminal cases, in particular the procedure for the execution of bench warrants and search warrants.  This topic is being included because it is recognised that there are significant issues in this area at present.  The programme will be submitted to the Government very soon for approval.  Based on previous experience with the Law Reform Commission, which invariably produces reports and recommendations of the highest standard, it should prove of immense value in this area.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the Garda Commissioner are aware of the importance of administering an efficient warrants process and will continue to monitor the operation of the system, particularly with a view to making whatever changes may be necessary to improve its operation.</P>
 </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>We all have that problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>He claims it is inevitable that in any criminal justice system there will be a significant number of warrants outstanding.  I could accept that for two to five weeks but not for 111,000 outstanding warrants.  How long have these been outstanding?  How many are outstand<Col N="357"/>ing for three months, more than six months and more than a year?  How many relate to bail?</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>It is fantastic for the Minister of State to claim with a straight face that because Garda numbers have risen to 14,000 it makes sense there would be more warrants outstanding.  I would have thought the opposite argument could be made, that because we have 14,000 Garda, more warrants are being executed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is a very clever sophist.  I reassure him and the public that the Garda prioritises warrants for serious crime.  It is not the case that serious criminal issues are losing out or are not being pursued because of this backlog.  Many of these cases involve sums of money of less than &euro;100.  In most of the cases where the financial penalty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The average amount being sought by the Garda in many of these warrants is &euro;100 or less.  Arising from an earlier parliamentary question, the Minister requested the Garda Commissioner to furnish him with a detailed report on the nature and profile of these warrants.  I will ask the Minister to reply directly to the Deputy when that report becomes available.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not hiding behind a reply, I am giving one.  The Minister has asked the Garda Commissioner who, in turn, has asked his regional assistant commissioners to give priority to this issue and report on it to the Government. </P>

	<P>Let us wait and see what the priorities are when the Minister receives the report.  The Deputy may not have been listening when I said a pilot project was under way, whereby outside debt collection agencies were collecting the money involved in these warrants.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s assurances are somewhat less than comforting.  The failure to implement these warrants indicates that the Government does not have its finger on the pulse and has lost its way in implementing court judgments.  A radical change is required to prevent the waste of Garda time in serving such warrants.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State looked into the camera and gravely assured the public that there were no persons being sought for serious offences in respect of whom warrants had not been executed.  How does he know that?  He does not have the profile for the outstanding warrants.  While it may be the appropriate thing to say, is there any scientific basis for it?  Is he serious that a significant number of the outstanding warrants relate to fines of &euro;100 or less? </P>

	<P>That is my information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>One would not be guilty of too serious an offence to incur a fine of &euro;100 nowadays.  I accept that the Minister of State does not have the information on the profile, although I would have expected that PULSE could generate it.  How many of the unexecuted warrants relate to bail, a major issue on which we deserve a reply?  In what circumstances does PULSE record outstanding warrants as being executed or cancelled?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to evade Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s technical questions about PULSE, on which I am not an acknowledged expert.  The Garda assures the Department that it continues to give priority to the enforcement of warrants in serious cases.  That is why I said the sum sought by many outstanding warrants was approximately &euro;100.  I am not suggesting there are no serious cases among them because a warrant being served on a recidivist which he evades could involve a serious case.  I do not wish my remarks to be misinterpreted by anyone in the House or to minimise the importance of clearing this backlog but the Deputy will have to wait until we receive a full report from the Garda which it would be valuable to furnish to the House.</P>

	<P>Is there an outside target date for ratifying the convention?  Will it be necessary to make substantial changes to legislation?  What barriers are there to signing the optional protocol?  Does the Government intend to sign the optional protocol when ratification is complete? </P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government intends to ratify the convention as quickly as possible consistent with the need to ensure all necessary requirements under it are being met.  The <Col N="360"/>Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform chairs the cross-departmental implementation group, the work programme of which encompasses all legislative and administrative matters that need to be aligned with the convention to enable ratification as soon as possible.  To ratify the convention, we need to ensure legislation policies, programmes and schemes are in line with the articles of the convention.  While the national disability strategy comprehends many of the provisions of the convention, Ireland will have to align those matters falling inside and outside the strategy with the provisions of the convention.  The cross-departmental implementation group is doing this work.  The law on the legal capacity of vulnerable adults needs to be addressed.  The Department is preparing the scheme of a mental capacity Bill which will enable Ireland to meet the convention&rsquo;s legal capacity obligations.</P>
        <P>We did not sign the optional protocol on 30 March, as it warrants close examination in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  The Government will address the matter when it considers ratification of the convention.  The protocol deals with the competence of the United Nations to deal with violations of the rights contained therein.  Ireland is among many contracting states which have not signed the protocol.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State aware of developments at UN level such that Ireland could lose out on having an important say on developments if we do not ratify the convention?  Has he given the implementation group a deadline for ratification of the convention?  Does he envisage any major changes to the national disability strategy regarding the capacity of the State to ratify the convention?  Given the various protocols and articles under the convention does he see the current strategy as adequate to meet the demands for ratification of the convention?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> if he will charge prisoners for the cost of their time in prison where prisoners can afford to meet this cost; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to the answer to his Question No. 522 of 4 December 2007 where it was stated that there are no plans to implement any mechanism whereby prisoners would be expected to contribute to the overall cost of their imprisonment.  There would be major practical difficulties and costs associated with trying to recover money from individuals who frequently have no visible assets or means of support.  There are also a number of policy issues, for example, if prisoners have funds available to them, should claims by the Irish Prison Service compete with claims for damages by victims or the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau?</P>
        <P>It is only fair to point out, however, that section 37 of the Prisons Act 2007 provides an appropriate statutory basis for a number of provisions in the prison rules of 2007 which allow a prison governor to charge for access to certain services over and above the standard provision to all prisoners, such as use of the video link, telephone calls and access to materials relating to current affairs such as newspapers, magazines and so on, not related to their imprisonment.  The Act also allows for charges to be made to prisoners for goods or services that are not generally available or are not available on an unlimited basis.  These include access to electronic devices, private medical treatment or escorts provided outside the <Col N="362"/>prison for matters not related to their imprisonment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Prisoners are provided with access to health care services on an equivalent basis to citizens in the general community who are covered by the General Medical Services, GMS, medical card.  Section 37 of the Prisons Act 2007 allows for the prison rules to provide, where it is deemed necessary on the basis of non-convicted status to facilitate a prisoner with access to elective health care outside the public system, that the prisoner will be responsible for the costs associated with facilitating such provision.  Provision of necessary health care to all prisoners on an equivalent basis to that provided under the public health system will continue to be funded by the State.</P>
        <P>In addition to the escort costs that could arise in the facilitation of access to elective health care outside the public system, prisoners are charged for escorts outside of their place of detention with regard to civil proceedings against third parties.  It is not proposed to charge for escorts where the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or an individual governor is listed as a defendant or co-defendant in such proceedings.  It is also proposed not to charge prisoners for appointments relating to any matters before the Residential Institutions Redress Board.</P>
        <P>Access to certain other services in prison is provided without charge and it is not intended to begin charging for these services.  For example, no charge is made for the making of a certain number of phone calls.  Prisoners are entitled to a daily phone call, including calls to their legal adviser, and this will continue to be the position.</P>

	<P>I believe we should study prison conditions because the Irish prison chaplains recently produced their annual report, which pointed out that one in two inmates of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution is illiterate.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am at a loss as to how this relates to Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s rather right wing suggestion that we should charge prisoners for their incarceration.  To my mind Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s proposal is rather loathsome because I believe any person with an understanding of our prison system could easily inform him that the people incarcerated in our prisons tend to be <Col N="363"/>from very poor backgrounds.  I do not believe that the principle of paying for one&rsquo;s punishment, which is popular in right wing circles in the United States, should be introduced to the Irish prison system.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the issues Deputy Carey rightly raised could be addressed properly in our prison system were Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s proposals to come to fruition.  It is odd to hear Deputy Carey speaking out of genuine concern for prisoners in the context of his party colleague&rsquo;s loathsome proposal that seeks to take money from vulnerable people in prison.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has conveniently used what should have been a reply to Deputy Carey to avoid addressing Deputy Carey&rsquo;s questions.  The Minister of State referred to Deputy Varadkar but I should stress that the question does not reflect Fine Gael policy and appears to be the Deputy&rsquo;s personal view.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the fact the Minister of State referred to the prison system and the cost of escorts, can he confirm the new prison at Thornton Hall will have courthouse facilities adjacent to it to minimise expenditure on escorts?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State convey to his senior colleague and brother, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, the need to examine seriously the report highlighted by Deputy Carey and a similar report made by the Council of Europe committee?  These reports indicate we do not accord an appropriate level of rights to prisoners in this country, many of whom are ill-treated and subjected to degrading and inhumane facilities.  This matter requires the attention and resources of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the clarification that charging prisoners is not Fine Gael policy because such a scheme was attempted elsewhere without great success.</P><Col N="364"/>
        <P>The future policy of the Department and Government will be to build courthouses adjacent to prisons and it is hoped this will be the case with Thornton Hall.  I will ask that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform reply directly to the Deputy by letter to confirm this as I do not wish to be too definitive.  I understand that public policy is moving in that direction.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s view on prison conditions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State referred in his answer to the minimalist provisions in regard to the making of telephone calls by prisoners.  What is his view on the unofficial provision?  I read today that 2,000 telephones have been confiscated in prisons but there has been only a handful of prosecutions.  Is the Minister of State concerned about criminal operations being directed by telephone from inside prisons?  Is he satisfied that the system has now clamped down on access to this type of communication from inside prison cells?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an expansion of the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but it is a welcome one.  Given that we are spending on average &euro;91,700 for a year&rsquo;s incarceration of a prisoner, Deputy Rabbitte is right to raise this issue.  I assure him that the illegal possession and usage of mobile telephones to further criminal careers from within prison walls is being vigorously tackled.  There have been significant numbers of confiscations recently.  In addition, there are plans within the Department to seek out technological solutions that will effectively block mobile telephone calls from being made into or out of prisons in this fashion.  This is a matter of great concern to us and action is being taken to deal with it.  We hope to see a yield in terms of results in the not too distant future.</P>

	<P>The parole board reviews the cases of those prisoners serving long terms of imprisonment who are eligible for parole and who apply to be considered and then provides advice and recommendations to the Minister on those cases.  The board has done an excellent job in making recommendations to the Minister of the day.</P>
        <P>On several occasions, the issue has been raised as to whether decisions on the release of prisoners, particularly those with a sentence of life imprisonment, should be made by the Minister or by another body.  This issue was considered by the High Court only this year in a case where two prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment chal<Col N="365"/>lenged, among other issues, the role of the Minister in the process, arguing that the decision on their release was a judicial function not appropriate to the Executive and that the involvement of the Minister was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The court rejected both arguments and upheld the existing system.</P>
        <P>There are no immediate plans to introduce legislation dealing with the parole board, but the matter will be kept under review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister and his Government colleagues know we are out of touch with European human rights law.  Why are we evading this issue by failing to bring Irish legislation into line with European legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure whether the Deputy heard my answer.  As I stated, two prisoners took a case arguing that the operation of the parole board is in conflict with the European Convention on Human Rights and the High Court upheld the Minister&rsquo;s executive role or responsibility in regard to parole decisions.</P>
        <P>Recommendations on how the system may be improved, from the Human Rights Commission and others, are relevant and timely.  I presume this is what Deputy Carey is alluding to.  Suggestions have been made that the parole board should be placed on a statutory or independent basis.  The Minister has informed me that he has an open mind on this issue and will consider it in the context of the ongoing review of the operations and arrangements pertaining to the parole board.  He is ready to look at the issue and, if necessary, legislate for a statutory and independently based parole board if that is what is found to be the best option in terms of harmonising with the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State consider it meritorious that the terms of reference for the role and function of the parole board be broadened to include those convicted of sex offences?  Sex offenders do not come under the parole scheme.  This means there is no incentive for such offenders to avail of treatment programmes because the terms of their sentences exclude them from the remit of the parole board.</P>
        <P>How often does the parole board meet the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?  How often does he request and receive reports from it?  Does the board have a backlog of cases to consider?</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>During 2006, the parole board made recommendations to the Minister on 73 cases.  The total caseload for 2006 was 203 and 60 prisoners accepted an invitation to participate in the review process.</P>
        <P>I do not have the answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on whether sex offences should come within the scope of the parole scheme.  I will ask the Minister to reply directly to the Deputy on that issue.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to clarify the reason for the reduction in the allocation of the Garda Ombudsman Commission for 2008.  The 2007 allocation for the ombudsman commission included significant funding relating to the initial set-up of the office, particularly for the leasing and fit-out of its new premises in Abbey Street, Dublin.  As these were once-off costs, the 2008 allocation has been adjusted accordingly.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the 2008 allocation will ensure the office has the resources to carry out its functions and that there will be no reduction in service.  The commission is still in the process of recruiting its full staff complement and is recruiting additional investigative staff.  There will therefore be more operational staff available during 2008 than there was in 2007.</P>
        <P>Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the ombudsman commission took over several complaints from the Garda Complaints Board.  However, the board must process to completion any complaint in respect of which it had commenced an investigation.  Accordingly, it must continue to operate until all such investigations have been completed.  The increase of 7.5%, or &euro;130,000, in the budget for the complaints board <Col N="367"/>is in the main due to pay increases and other costs in respect of the board&rsquo;s staff in 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State know how many cases have been commenced and so must be completed by the Garda Complaints Board?

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government would not have established an ombudsman commission if it was entirely satisfied with the operation of the Garda Complaints Board.  One follows from the other.

	<P>The commission has been established and is engaged in its work.  The Deputy may have misunderstood what I said.

	<P>The Deputy has asked a very relevant question but unfortunately I do not have the detailed figures requested by the Deputies.  I will ensure the Minister communicates directly on the matter.  I am working on an assumption that new complaints would automatically go to the ombudsman commission, and essentially the allocation or resourcing of the complaints board is merely to &ldquo;trade out&rdquo; the existing levels of complaints subject to investigation.</P>

      <sTitle>Health Service Inquiries.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise the matter.  All children are vulnerable but particular safeguards are required for children with intellectual disability.  The report I wish to raise is that of Dr. Kevin McCoy on the Western Health Board inquiry into the Brothers of Charity services in Galway, and it is disturbing for a whole series of reasons.  One of these has not come to any serious public notice.</P>
        <P>In March 1999 an inquiry team was put in place at the request of the Brothers of Charity to examine serious allegations of physical and sexual abuse of many children who suffered an intellectual disability and who had been cared for within institutions run by the Brothers of Charity in Galway.  It is extraordinary that this commission of inquiry was appointed in March 1999 but by mid 2001 every member appointed to it had resigned.  All that was left was the chairperson, and two of the people appointed to the inquiry by the Western Health Board had resigned by the middle of summer 1999.</P>
        <P>It has taken an unacceptable period for the report to be published, some nine years from the initiation of the inquiry.  If the victims of abuse had not been persons of intellectual disability, there would have been a public scandal a number of years ago and a demand for publication.</P>
        <P>I want an inquiry by the Department on what happened with this inquiry team.  Why had they all resigned by August 2001 and why was this not made public knowledge?  Why did the chairman apparently struggle on and survive until January or February 2006 before resigning?  Dr. McCoy, who finally completed the report, was given the task in spring 2004 of providing assistance and finally piecing together the information to allow a report to be published in November 2007.</P>
        <P>In the context of serious allegations of sexual and physical abuse of people with intellectual disability, it is entirely unacceptable that it took this length of time to publish this report.  I demand an inquiry into the manner in which the Western Health Board and later the HSE approached the task.</P>
        <P>The report itself details yet another tragic litany of abuse but we are given absolutely no information.  Despite taking almost nine years for it to be published, only 21 victims of alleged abuse were dealt with, although 135 residents in Brothers of Charity institutions have sought compen<Col N="371"/>sation through the redress board for alleged abuse of a sexual nature.</P>
        <P>The report did not travel the distance and produce the comprehensive information it was obliged to.  It contains a variety of recommendations, some of which have become familiar to Members because they are a mirror image of recommendations produced in other reports into the abuse of children in institutions.  All that makes this different is that it applies to children who have an intellectual disability.</P>
        <P>This report should have been published by approximately 2001 at the latest, and these recommendations should have been introduced long ago.  I call on the Minister to ensure we have national standards put in place and inspections conducted in residential centres and community homes for children and adults with disabilities.  This has been promised since the mid 1990s but nothing has been done.</P>
        <P>There are currently 400 children with disabilities living in residential settings whose homes are not inspected and where there are no applicable national care standards.  There are applicable standards for children taken into care under the Children Acts, as well as an inspectorate system.  We do not have it for those who have a disability.</P>
        <P>I want an accountable and transparent system which protects the children in this country.  I call on the Minister to take the necessary initiative to give this the priority the Western Health Board and HSE in this case have failed to give.  Will the Minister detail to this House the specific action being taken to ensure the detailed recommendations contained in the report will be implemented?</P>
        
    <HtmlBk SectId="6" />
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">There is another extremely disturbing aspect of the report.  Identified in the report not personally but by number are 18 people who engaged in physical and sexual abuse.  Eight of them have since died, two have been prosecuted and eight have never been prosecuted.  I want to know why prosecutions were not taken in those incidences.</P>
        <P>I would like to posit a brief theory as to why this is the case.  In the courts in October we saw a tragic case of a 20-year-old adult with Down&rsquo;s syndrome in circumstances in which allegations of sexual assault were taken against an individual.  Those allegations were dismissed by our courts because the judge hearing the case took the view that the person suffering from Down&rsquo;s syndrome did not have the intellectual capacity to give evidence and deal with cross-examination.  That court has laid down a ruling that creates a very serious problem.  It indicates to predators that it is open season on those who suffer disability and cannot provide evidence in our court system.  There is an urgent need to enact emergency legislation to address that issue and protect the people who are so vulnerable because they suffer from a disability.  We are in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights in this area.  It is reasonable to posit that no prosecutions were not taken against eight of the people, who, it is <Col N="372"/>accepted, perpetrated sexual and physical abuse against intellectually disabled children referred to in the report, because the prosecution authorities feared the prosecutions would fail for the reason the prosecution failed in the case I have identified.  I ask the Government to address the issue as an urgent matter to protect persons who suffer from disability.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  On Tuesday, 11 December 2007, the HSE published a report into allegations of physical and sexual abuse in the Brothers of Charity services in Galway, at the Holy Family School and Woodlands Residential Service at Renmore, Galway City and Kilcornan Residential Services, Clarinbridge, County Galway.  The inquiry was established in 1999 when the Western Health Board and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na became aware of allegations of abuse within the Brothers of Charity services.  Allegations were made in respect of a period between 1965 and 1998 by 21 clients at the Renmore and Kilcornan services against 18 people.  Some 11 were members of the Brothers of Charity congregation, four were lay staff and three were former service users.</P>
        <P>There was a serious delay in completing the report.  It was initiated by the former Western Health Board in 1999 and no report was finalised until now.  The HSE has apologised to the victims and their families for this delay.  Dr. Kevin McCoy, retired chief inspector of social services in Northern Ireland, was commissioned in May 2006 to finalise the report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State know why the inquiry team resigned?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>The report details terrible abuse suffered by some of the most vulnerable members of society.  It is further evidence of how some of the most vulnerable people in society were badly let down in the past.  On behalf of the Government, I reiterated on Tuesday the Taoiseach&rsquo;s formal apology to all those affected by abuse in institutions operated or funded by the State, including the Brothers of Charity services in Galway.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised me that the original inquiry team acted promptly in 2000 by notifying the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of all allegations of abuse and relaying all files and cases to them.  I understand that two of those who are the subject of complaints received a conviction.  The then Western Health Board and subsequently the HSE have worked closely with the Brothers of Charity in offering immediate support for those affected, follow-up for each individual client using the service, and follow-up for service users generally.</P>
        <P>Regarding the number of cases investigated, it is important to bear in mind that only those who made formal complaints could be dealt with individually by the inquiry.  While we understand that <Col N="373"/>others may have applied for redress under the redress board scheme, their confidentially must be respected.</P>
        <P>I understand that agreement had been reached between the HSE and the Federation of Voluntary Bodies to develop a programme to close all institutional or campus style residential services for people with disabilities and to relocate them to more appropriate community settings.  The Woodlands Residential Centre was closed in 1984, and the Kilcornan Residential Centre is in the process of being closed.  Residents will be relocating to more appropriate accommodation in the community as soon as possible.  I also understand that agreement has been reached with the Federation of Voluntary Bodies to carry out a comprehensive national audit and review of client protection issues within disability services.</P>
        <P>A number of important issues have been highlighted by the publication of this report.  The delay in preparing the report is totally unacceptable.  The HSE has already apologised individually to each complainant and did so again on Tuesday when the report was published.  At the request of the Department of Health and Children, the HSE is developing protocols for the management of all future inquiries of this kind.</P>
        <P>In addition, I have arranged to have an immediate inquiry carried out by an independent person into the causes of the delay in preparing this report.  The person will be asked to report to me as quickly as possible.  I am committed to ensuring that all residential facilities for people with a disability are independently monitored and inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  HIQA has commenced work on standards for designated residential centres for people with a disability which will form the basis for statutory regulations and inspections.  In the meantime, I have asked the HSE to take all possible action to ensure the quality and safety of these services.  The HSE recently published a formal guidance document on residential facilities for children and will do so in respect of adults early in 2008.  The HSE will be making it a condition of funding under its service level agreements that the contractual arrangements between the HSE and agencies that provide disability service will include, for the first time, quality and safety measures to ensure that the users of a service can enjoy a rewarding and safe experience to which they are entitled.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise the problem that seems to have existed for some time with the quantity and capacity of production from the NBPC, the National Braille Production Centre, in Cabra.  A constituent has notified me of a difficulty.  Her son who has a sight problem has not been provided with the books he requires.  She has had a kind of Kafkaesque dialogue with a State-aided organisation in which trying to get information is like trying to get blood from a <Col N="374"/>stone.  From the reply to a parliamentary question I tabled, I understand that 146 clients are waiting to have Braille books delivered.  Of those, 90 clients will have their books provided before Christmas.  When I sent this information back to my constituent I got the following response:</P>
        <P LI="1">We have been trying to get answers from the NBPC and have failed and have considered the FOI Act.  Can you advise if the FOI Act would be a channel we could use to get information from the NBPC?  We have also been in touch with the Equality Authority who have expressed an interest in our case. . . . .  As you can see from the response to your question the number of outstanding Braille books is very high.  These students are obviously waiting for their books since September which is outrageous.  The NBPC kept telling us that we were an isolated case.  [My son] received another 12 pages of one of his maths books last week (the order having been placed in early July), again some of the contents arriving too late for him to benefit from.  He is still waiting for the remaining chapters which we have been told won&rsquo;t arrive now until next year.  In relation to the orders outstanding for the other students I wonder how long ago they were placed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In a separate note she communicated to me as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">[A] Visiting Teacher recently gave our family a demonstration in Braille production.  Within minutes even my 13 year old was able to translate text to Braille on the PC and send it to an electronic Braille embosser, ready for [my son] to read.  The process is so simple and straightforward that I cannot understand why the NBPC cannot produce enough books for so few students, and on time.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P FLI="0">This is no reflection on the Minister who is present but I am sorry the Minister with direct knowledge of the area or the Minister of State is not here to reply to this matter.  What is the problem and why has it taken so long for books to be produced?  Partially sighted and blind students have enough disabilities to contend with in the context of their education.  This should not be compounded by what seems to me to be inexplicable inefficiency from this body.  I have no reason to doubt that modern technology linking computers to an embossing machine could produce these kinds of documents very quickly.  People who are blind or seriously disadvantaged by a sight disability cannot get the books they require on order, even though the knowledge and data of their existence is well established.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister who is here on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science has an answer.  Citizens of this State should not be treated by a publicly-funded organisation as if they were some kind of persons to whom information could not be given and should not be <Col N="375"/>forced to resort to their public representatives asking questions on their behalf.  If this Republic is to celebrate any kind of maturity, then surely we should treat citizens with respect and they should be able to get this information themselves.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the question.  I have noted carefully what he has said and he will find some interesting information in the reply.</P>
        <P>The National Braille Production Centre was established in 2000 to provide blind and visually impaired pupils at first and second level with textbooks in Braille and other alternative formats.  The National Braille Production Centre produces educational materials in Braille, large print format and text-only for children who are blind or visually impaired.  It is an essential service to children and young people who are blind or visually impaired and without it many of them would not be able to access mainstream education or be able to undertake the junior and senior cycle examinations.</P>
        <P>It is important that this service is adequately funded to enable it to meet the needs of children who are blind or visually impaired.  The Department of Education and Science provides annual funding to the National Braille Production Centre of &euro;867,000.</P>
        <P>The National Braille Production Centre has expanded from a workforce of four in 2000 to 26 in 2007.  The centre has achieved a huge increase in textbook production in the past seven years, with client numbers increasing dramatically from 17 clients in 2000 to 301 clients in 2007.  The centre has advised the Department of Education and Science that it has delivered 95% of all guaranteed book orders this year.</P>
        <P>The National Braille Production Centre operates under an agreed timeframe for book orders and deliveries. As high-standard Braille production for education is both time and work intensive &mdash; I have noted what the Deputy said about computers and I see a role for them &mdash; the timeframe ideally envisages orders to be placed as early as possible in an academic year for the following September.  It is accepted practice generally that when a new title is transcribed, the book will be delivered to the student in volumes, unless it is a title that has been previously transcribed, in which case all volumes are available very quickly.</P>
        <P>In the case of late orders or other unforeseen circumstances where a delay occurs in the provision of books, officials from the National Braille Production Centre, in conjunction with the parents of the pupil or student and the Department&rsquo;s visiting teacher service for the visually impaired, work together to establish solutions to provide the books in a timely manner.  In isolated cases a delay might occur due to very late orders, for example, after May of an academic year for the following September, or difficult <Col N="376"/>texts that require manual Braille input and diagram drawing, for example, Braille mathematics.  Another factor in a delay is that during 2007, the National Braille Production Centre has advised that it experienced an unexpected increase in orders and client numbers.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s visiting teacher service for the visually impaired has a significant role to play in the process of ordering books or materials on behalf of a particular pupil or student.  In 2006, a protocol dealing solely and exclusively with the provision of educational materials in alternative formats was agreed between the National Braille Production Centre and the Department&rsquo;s visiting teacher service for the visually impaired.  The protocol was devised on the initiative of the visiting teacher service for the visually impaired and will be reviewed very shortly on the basis of current experience in its operation.  Any amendments to the protocol will be put in place and communicated to all relevant interests, including parents, without delay following the review.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that there is also an advisory board for the National Braille Production Centre in place which includes representation from parents and guardians and other interested parties, including the visiting teacher service for the visually impaired.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy once again for raising this issue.  I hope that by discussion and negotiation with the centre the problems he so well described will be resolved because I fully accept that being without books would be a huge impediment for any student.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise what I believe to be an extraordinary breach of the Irish Constitution, of international law and of the basic rights of the child and the urgent need to redress this breach.  I refer to the imposition of conditions attached to student visas which are implemented by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and which have the net result of depriving children of their rights.  I will concentrate on two cases in the constituency which I share with the Minister present.</P>
        <P>One case involves two parents, both of whom had paid very large fees to a third-level institution to do postgraduate studies.  In one case the mother is continuing her postgraduate study in medieval history and the father has returned to the United States to continue his postgraduate study.  Their child has been excluded from school, in flagrant violation of Article 42.4 of the Constitution which states, &ldquo;The State shall provide for free primary education and shall endeavour to supplement and give reasonable aid to private and corporate educational initiative.&rdquo;  This is not a qualified right; it is not confined to Irish citizens but is available to all children.  In addition to the outrageous breach of Article 42.4, the woman involved has been told that she should provide <Col N="377"/>for her child through private education.  The only private education available to her is the Seventh Day Adventist school.  This limitation on her choice is in clear breach of Article 42.3.1&deg;.  The Education Act 1998 is being broken and the Equal Status Act 2000, as amended in 2004 by the Equality Act, is being broken and the European Convention on Human Rights as introduced into Irish law as a binding form of law is being broken.  The protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights shows the assurances to be quite similar to those in the Irish Constitution.  Needless to say, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is being broken.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Education and Science, in a reply to Parliamentary Question No. 741 of 11 December 2007, washes her hands of the entire situation by stating there is a clear process by which children are enrolled in school.  She concludes the reply ominously and acknowledges,<i> inter alia</i>, &ldquo;Indeed, under the Equal Status Act, schools may not discriminate in admission to schools except where this is necessary to maintain the religions values or ethos of the school.&rdquo;  Her conclusion to the reply shows the flimsy basis for the discrimination.  She said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The report of the interdepartmental committee on the internationalisation of Irish education, published in 2004, sets out a strategy with the objective of enhancing the attractiveness of Ireland as a quality venue for international students and increasing the numbers of students coming to Ireland to participate in further and higher education and training and in the language sector.  It was envisaged that students from outside the EU-EEA and Switzerland, other than refugees and those with humanitarian leave to remain in the State, would participate on a fee paying basis.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">In the course of the discussions leading to the report, the position of minors attending school for second level education was discussed, and the existing immigration policy that student visas should be allowed only in respect of attendance at fee-paying schools was confirmed, on the basis that to do otherwise would give rise to additional demands on the State.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is being implemented at primary level without any legal basis in outrageous breach of the Constitution.  In addition, the Garda is involved in its implementation because, as such parents arrive to have their visas renewed, they are being told that if they have children in State schools, they must withdraw them and send them to a private school.  Will the Minister please respond to the specific questions relating to the breach of the Constitution and the European Convention on the Rights of the Child?  On what basis does the Garda have powers to instruct that a child be taken from a public school?  It has no such powers.  All efforts at finding where responsibility may lie have failed.  I have concentrated on this case by way of illustration but there is another involving people from a much less wealthy back<Col N="378"/>ground who are in the same position with their child who was accepted at a school, the principal of which has written to me about it.  The child has had to be removed from the school on the instructions of the Garda under threat of deportation.</P>
        <P>What right does the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have to impose conditions that contradict the rights of the child which the Minister for Education and Science acknowledged in her reply?  The view of the Department of Education and Science is that it has nothing to do with the Minister, as she only deals with admissions.  The attitude of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is that it is entitled to make this condition.  My advice to the individuals involved &mdash; three in total, two of whom came to see me directly in Galway &mdash; is to seek legal redress immediately.  It is appalling that a totally illegal set of actions is depriving children of their right to a primary education.</P>

	<P>I will continue with the reply and explain the complexities.</P>
        <P>The Minister acknowledges that at first sight there appears to be a contradiction between the policies of the two Departments.  However, on closer examination this is not the case.  The Minister is aware of the right of all children in the State to a primary education and supports it fully.</P>

	<P>As a former Minister of State with responsibility for children, the Minister is particularly well informed on issues regarding children&rsquo;s rights.  However, what is at issue in this instance is not, in essence, the right of a child to an education, which is not in dispute, but the rights and obligations of parents permitted to come to Ireland as students.  In other words, while a foreign national child is entitled to free education while in Ireland, this in no way implies a right for them or their parents to enter the State for that purpose.  All sovereign states have the right to determine who should enter their territory and the conditions attaching to that entry and residence.  That is a basic feature of immigration systems and immigration law.</P>

	<P>Like those of other states, the Irish immigration system caters for various categories of migrant with different conditions applicable to each one.  At one end of the scale, persons granted refugee status have extensive rights.  High skilled workers also benefit from favourable conditions.  Permission to remain in the State as a student, on the other hand, is a very limited form of permission aimed solely at facilitating the student to undertake a course of study.  The student is expected to be self-sufficient during his or her stay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>And to be childless.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>A concession has been granted to allow a student to do some casual work to help support himself or herself while here.  The underlying principle regarding self-sufficiency is that the foreign national who is here on that basis would not need to avail of State funds or State-funded services, nor would any dependent family members allowed to enter the State require such State benefits.  It is clear that having a child educated at the State&rsquo;s expense would be in breach of this requirement.  However, an exception is made where the child is attending a fee-paying school on the basis that the parents are making a contribution to the costs involved.</P>
        <P>The permission to come to Ireland is not independent from the conditions attaching to it.  If students had the right to be accompanied by dependent family members who would be entitled to avail of State-funded services, it is almost certain they would not be allowed to enter in the first place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The immigration authorities are encountering an increasing number of students coming to Ireland for the express purpose of having their children educated.  This is an abuse of Ireland&rsquo;s hospitality and must be seen as <Col N="380"/>contrary to public policy.  To reiterate, it is not a question of a child&rsquo;s entitlement to an education&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>

	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The Deputy is incorrect.  I have no doubt that if the person concerned brings the case to court, it will vindicate the position of the Government.  To reiterate, it is not a question of a child&rsquo;s entitlement while here but rather whether the child and his or her parents should in the circumstances be here in the first place.  I understand the immigration authorities are looking at the matter with a view to making an exception to cover the current school year so as not to disadvantage the children concerned in this case.  This would be on a strictly limited basis and any adult student wishing to stay beyond the end of the school year would be required to adhere strictly to whatever conditions were in force at the time.  I also understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has general concerns regarding the operation of the student immigration sector and the level of abuse of student permissions and that it is his intention to outline policy changes early in the new year.</P>

	<P>N&iacute;l ach tri&uacute;r Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la as Gaillimh here agus t&uacute; f&eacute;in, a Chathaoirligh, sa Chamber anois.  It is with a certain reluctance that I raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I had tried by various diplomatic means and telephone calls to resolve the problem but I seemed to be getting deeper into the problem rather than solving it.  I am glad to see opposite the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who may be able to assist.</P>
        <P>I had contacted the Department about this and got a great deal of conflicting information.  Last week I was told that this man&rsquo;s appeal against proposed designation of a quarry area in south Connemara was closed on 23 August last.  That could not be possible because I have here a letter dated 23 August which the man received on 27 August, stating that in order to progress his request to have the lands removed from the SAC a scientific assessment of the lands in question must be carried out and, in another sentence nearer the end, asking him to confirm his agreement to an inspection by contacting the office by 4 September 2007.</P>
        <P>The man replied to the Department by letter on 30 August 2007, stating that he would give Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell and his assistant permission to enter his lands, but that he must be informed of when they would come.  The man finally got a letter on 11 September acknowledging receipt of his letter of 30 August and stating that the issues he had raised were currently under consideration and the NPWS would write to him in due course.  That would clearly indicate to me that the file could not have been closed on 23 August because there was ongoing correspondence between the NPWS and the land and quarry owner.</P>
        <P>A letter received by the client in October 1997 stated that where restrictions arise compensation will be paid and wished to emphasis that a service is not anti-development, and that the service would not object to the man&rsquo;s proposals to renovate some existing house on his property &mdash; which he does not intend to do &mdash; and has no desire to interfere with the working of his quarry.  That seems clear to me.  As this quarry was pre-1963, its owner must have it registered under section 261.  He fulfilled this requirement and has his <Col N="382"/>quarry registered.  It is No. 81 on the register in Galway County Council.  A letter from Galway County Council to the land and quarry owner on 16 September 2007 stated that the planning authority deemed his quarry to be unauthorised solely on the basis that it was in an SAC.</P>
        <P>It is clear to me that this should be an ongoing case.  The owner of the quarry has made many efforts to have this matter resolved, including a meeting in the National Parks and Wildlife Service office in Letterfrack on 11 May last with Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell, and the Minister would be familiar with that also.  The man left that meeting thinking that the matter was resolved but here we are, six months later, and the matter is not resolved.  I hope there can be a solution to this problem.</P>
        <P>I want to pose a few questions that the Minister might be able to answer.  Although it is not his brief, it was formerly his and he might be able to answer the questions anyway.  Why was this man&rsquo;s quarry included in the SAC designation when it was not necessary to be protected by designation for any scientific or vegetation value included in the Wildlife Act?  Why were all other quarries in Connemara either not included in, or taken out of, the SAC by virtue of the fact that they were operating quarries which were deemed to have no scientific value, and this quarry &mdash; from my knowledge of it &mdash; has certainly no scientific value?</P>
        <P>When the National Parks and Wildlife Service sent proposals to Europe for designation of SACs, the reason given for not using CPOs on privately owned lands was there would be active consultation with individual landowners, compromise to be reached with landowners and compensation to be paid if the landowner was compromised.</P>
        <P>The owner of this quarry and his family have suffered considerable stress and financial hardship as a result of this ongoing problem.  There seems to be no solution to the problem of withdrawing this man&rsquo;s quarry from designation as a SAC so that he could continue to supply material to Galway County Council, as he had done prior to its being designated as an SAC.

	<P>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghlacadh leis an Teachta as ucht an cheist seo a ard&uacute; liom anseo tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go nd&eacute;anfaidh an fhreagra a dtabharfaidh m&eacute; beag&aacute;in&iacute;n soil&eacute;iri&uacute; ar an gceist.  Mholfainn don Teachta comhairle a thabhairt don duine &uacute;d an cheist seo a phl&eacute; leis an lucht plean&aacute;la agus le muintir na Roinne chomh luath agus is f&eacute;idir.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this question and I am happy to respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  As Deputy McCormack will be aware, special areas of conservation, SACs, are proposed for designation under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations. <Col N="383"/> These regulations provide a mechanism for designation and protection of important ecological areas in Ireland as part of Natura 2000 &mdash; a network of protected sites throughout the European Union.  These sites protect Europe&rsquo;s most important and rare nature.</P>
        <P>There is a open and objective system of appeal for any landowner if he or she objects to his or her land being designated.  In fact, I and my colleague, former Deputy S&iacute;le de Valera, were involved in introducing this.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government operates a two-tier objection process.  The first stage, an informal assessment of the objection, is carried out by departmental staff.  This assessment will usually require a site visit.  If an objector is dissatisfied with the outcome of this assessment he or she may have the case referred to an independent appeals advisory board for a formal hearing.  This board consists of representation of both landowner and conservationist interests and will review the scientific merits of the inclusion of the land within the SAC.  On completion of the assessment the board makes a recommendation to the Minister.</P>
        <P>The SAC site in question, the Connemara Bog Complex, was first proposed for designation in March 1997.  These proposals were advertised in the local press and landowners identified by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, were notified directly in writing.  In September 1997, the gentleman referred to lodged a written objection to the inclusion of his lands within the SAC.  However, it was not possible to process his objection as he requested extensive information in advance, which was neither available nor appropriate.</P>
        <P>As a result of an agreement between the Government and farming organisations in 2004, in the context of the national partnership talks, the Connemara Bog Complex SAC was one of 26 sites re-proposed for designation in December 2006.  As in 1997, these proposals were advertised in the local press and known landowners were notified directly in writing.</P>
        <P>The gentleman in question again submitted a written objection to the inclusion of his lands in the SAC.  Despite extensive correspondence and meetings with senior Department staff, it again was not possible for the Department to secure his unqualified agreement to process the objection.  Following a written warning on the 23 August 2007, the gentleman did not agree to an unconditional assessment of his land and therefore his <Col N="384"/>objection was closed in September.  He was verbally notified of this and will be notified in writing in the coming days.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s designation process must be completed in order to complete its list of SACs and provide finalised boundaries for all SAC sites.  Ireland could incur large EU fines should we be unable to finalise objections in a timely manner.  In this context, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has given commitments to the European Commission that outstanding objections will be processed without any unnecessary delays.  Against this background, the Department must strictly adhere to the normal procedures for dealing with objectors who are unwilling to co-operate with the objections process.  In such cases objections are deemed to be closed.</P>
        <P>Under certain circumstances it is possible for development to be carried out within an SAC provided this development does not have an impact on the scientific integrity of the site.  This is vital information as there is a major misunderstanding with regard to this point.  The Department is always happy to discuss proposed developments and activities with landowners.  In other words, if an activity does not have an impact on the SAC, although I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point about the quarry, it is possible to get permission.  It is open for the gentleman in question to apply to the local authority for planning permission for the development.  The Department would then be referred to for input as a statutory consultee.  However, it is also open to him to discuss with local Department staff the details of his proposed development and the type of works that would be acceptable in an SAC.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are many misunderstandings about SACs.  A proposed development is not automatically refused just because it is in an SAC.  In addition, just because an activity for which one has permission is to be carried out in an SAC and is a notifiable action, this does not necessarily mean it is refused if one notifies it.  Thus, I suggest that the Deputy&rsquo;s constituent, who is also a constituent of mine, engage with the relevant authorities to try to resolve the matter and to find a way forward that does not affect the SAC but maintains its integrity while allowing him to continue his activities.  I think that is what the Deputy is looking for.  I encourage the constituent to follow the process clearly outlined in the reply from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

	<P>As at 30th September 2007, the latest date for which Community Garda&iacute; figures are readily available, the personnel strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was 13,531 and the number of Garda&iacute; attached to Community Policing was 598.  This represents a percentage of 4.42% of the total strength of the Force.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account.  Of course, Community Policing involves more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing  issues.  Community Policing is a central feature of current policing policy and members of Community Policing Units are encouraged to engage with the local communities where they are assigned.</P>
        <P>I agree with the view of the Garda Inspectorate, expressed in its most recent report, that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland.  I am informed by the Commissioner that a working group has developed proposals for a comprehensive model of rural and urban Community Policing.  The group has completed its report, &ldquo;The Report of the Working Group on the National Model of Community Policing&rdquo; and it is currently being considered by the Garda <Col N="386"/>Commissioner.  I await the final views of the Commissioner with interest.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 25 June 2001 and subsequently claimed asylum on that day.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  She appealed this decision and was notified by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal that her appeal had been refused and the original recommendation upheld.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was informed by letter dated 16 October 2002 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her and afforded her three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e why she should not be deported.</P>
        <P>Representations were received on her behalf on the 10th of December 2002 setting out the reasons why she ought to be granted leave to remain in the State under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999.  Her case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to all representations submitted on her behalf for permission to remain temporarily in the State. On the 27th of <Col N="387"/>February 2004 the then Minister refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and signed a Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned. A notice of the order dated 5 March 2004 was served by hand on the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was given presentation requirements with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). She failed to comply with the requirements of GNIB and was classed as an evader and arrested and lodged in Dochas Women&rsquo;s prison for the purpose of deportation.  The person concerned suffered from medical problems and was released from Dochas. Judicial Review proceedings were filed in the High Court on the 8th December, 2005 challenging the then Minister&rsquo;s decision to seek to deport her. On the 6th July, 2007, the Judicial Review leave application was heard.  The person concerned failed to appear in court therefore breaking her conditional release conditions.  The Judge then ordered that she attend court on 11th July 2007 and in his judgement of 13th July, 2007 he refused the Applicant&rsquo;s Leave Application.  Arrangements were then made to deport the person in question.</P>
        <P>On the 22nd August, 2007 the person concerned was sent an arrangements letter affirming the Deportation Order and requiring her to comply with the reporting arrangements of the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  The person concerned complied on a number of occasions until she failed to attend GNIB as requested on the 29th November, 2007 and was subsequently arrested and lodged in Dochas Women&rsquo;s Prison for the purpose of deportation. On the 5th December, 2007 the person concerned was released on medical grounds.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport her is justified.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>

	<P>The position is that Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 already contains a statutory scheme whereby any individual may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in their dwelling <Col N="388"/>house.  The scheme is operated by the Property Registration Authority.  A legal challenge to the constitutionality of certain provisions of existing ground rents legislation was heard in the High Court during 2005.  While the Court&rsquo;s judgment upholding the constitutionality of the legislation was delivered in early 2006, it has since been appealed to the Supreme Court.  Operation of the law in this area continues to be reviewed in my Department but there are no proposals for changes pending the outcome of the appeal that I have mentioned. </P>

	<P>It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to assign members of the Force throughout the country. In doing this he takes into account all relevant factors, including of course population but also including other factors such as crime rates and trends as well as operational priorities.  The attested strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as at the 30 November 2007, the latest date for which figures are readily available was 13,780.  In addition 1,043 student Garda&iacute; were at various stages of their training on that date making a total of 14,823. The attested personnel strength of the Garda Reserve as at 30th November 2007 was 171 with a further 98 in training.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that approximately 1,100 Student Garda&iacute; will be attested to the Force during 2008.  The significant increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has meant that, despite the increase in population, the ratio of Garda to population has increased significantly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a series of proposals tabled by the European Commission last month in relation to counter terrorism.  As the Deputy may be aware, the current EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy constitutes a wide-ranging and interlinked approach across EU Member States to tackle the common threat posed by international terrorism.  Progress <Col N="389"/>in the ongoing implementing of this Strategy has been significant and sustained, including in Ireland, where the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 was enacted to extend Ireland&rsquo;s existing, effective counter-terrorism machinery to new forms of international terrorism.</P>
        <P>The European Commission&rsquo;s recent proposals focus on certain specific aspects of this problem, as a supplement to the existing EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy.  Specifically, the European Commission has made proposals for:</P>
<P el="5">(1)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />a Framework Decision on the use of passenger name record &mdash; or PNR &mdash; data for law enforcement purposes;</P>
<P el="5">(2)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />new measures to counter the illegitimate acquisition and use of explosives; and</P>
<P el="5">(3)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />changes to the existing EU Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to outlaw terrorism-related incitement; recruitment, especially via the internet; and terrorist training.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In relation to its tabling of a draft Framework Decision on PNR data, the Commission proposal aims to harmonise Member States&rsquo; provisions on obligations for air carriers operating flights to or from the territory of at least one Member State regarding the transmission of PNR data to the relevant national authorities.  In particular, the draft Framework Decision provides for the making available of PNR data for the purpose of preventing and combating terrorist offences and organised crime, as well as for the collection, retention and exchange of those data by and between the Member States.</P>
        <P>In relation to the proposed changes to the existing Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism, dating from 2002, the Commission seeks to harmonise national provisions on public provocation to commit a terrorist offence as well as recruitment and training for terrorism, whether committed through the internet or otherwise, so that these forms of behaviour are punishable throughout the EU.  It is important to note that the proposal for a Framework Decision on PNR data, together with the other proposals, are simply proposals at this stage.  They have yet to be considered by the Council of the European Union in the relevant Council working groups.  Accordingly, it is not known how these proposals may evolve as Member States consider their terms.</P>
        <P>In this regard, it is, of course, a truism to state that we are all in favour of measures to combat terrorism.  However, in considering any new proposals, particularly at EU level, it is important that we consider both their utility and practicality, their added value and their proportionality.  At this stage, however, the final shape of the proposals will not be known for some time, nor, for that matter, will the disposition of our EU partners.  Accordingly, it is not possible to state <Col N="390"/>whether and how transposition will occur.  In any event, there will, of course, be an opportunity for the Oireachtas to consider all relevant matters, including by my colleagues in this House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to note that marriage to an Irish national does not grant any automatic right to enter or reside in the State solely on the basis of the marriage.  A person, who is visa-required, wishing to come to Ireland to reside in the State with his/her spouse, must apply for a &ldquo;Join Spouse&rdquo; visa.  Where all the required documentation/evidence has been furnished and the Visa Officer is satisfied with the bona fides of the application, a D-type Visa would normally be approved.  In a small minority of cases, where a Visa Officer has concerns over the relationship history for example, a C-type Visa would be approved.  The rationale for this is that the applicant is being afforded the opportunity to demonstrate the genuine nature of the relationship.</P>
        <P>In very exceptional cases, where little or no evidence of a relationship history has been demonstrated for example, the visa application would be refused.  In such cases, the decision of the Visa Officer may be appealed within two months of the date of decision.  Non-visa required nationals who enter the State to reside with an Irish spouse are required to attend their local Garda National Immigration Bureau Registration Office within 90 days and request permission to be registered as resident in the State on the basis of marriage to an Irish national.  In some cases, the local Registration Office will refer the matter to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service for further investigation.</P>
        <P>Comprehensive information on the Visa Application process and the supporting documentation required is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, www.inis.gov.ie</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act, relating to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme, to the making of a behaviour order by the Children&rsquo;s Court.</P>
        <P>In setting up the regime, the intention was that these warnings or good behaviour contracts would themselves address the problem behaviour.  It is only if they fail that an ASBO will be applied for.  In any case, it inevitably takes time to reach the stage where an ASBO itself might be sought.  No significance therefore should be attached to the fact that the stage has not yet been reached in the process where ASBOs have been issued.  Where warnings or good behaviour contracts do not succeed in altering a person&rsquo;s behaviour, however, they will culminate in ASBOs being sought by the Garda authorities from the courts.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that up to 30 November 2007, 383 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 125 to children.</P>
        <P>Among the priorities which the Minister has determined in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2008 is combating, particularly in cooperation with other agencies and the community generally, the problems of public disorder with particular emphasis on alcohol-related behaviour (including underage drinking) and socially disadvantaged communi<Col N="392"/>ties especially through utilisation of the legal mechanisms being made available, such as these provisions and closure orders under liquor licensing legislation.</P>
        <P>All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proactively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour.  Areas subject to such behaviour have been identified as &ldquo;hot-spots&rdquo; by local Garda management and additional foot and mobile patrols are directed to these areas during times when these offences are more likely to occur.  All such incidents, detected by members on patrol or reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are dealt with immediately, and the suspected offenders are dealt with in accordance with the law.  I recognise, as does every member of the House and all public representatives, that while anti-social behaviour is at the less serious end of the spectrum of criminality, it can cause great distress to communities as a whole and individuals in particular, especially the elderly and more vulnerable.  I wish to assure the Deputy that we will continue to take all measures which are open to us to address this issue.</P>

The Deputy should be aware that the numbers in any unit will fluctuate from time to time due to transfers, retirements, resignations etc.</P><Col N="391"/>

	<P>It is only fair to point out that the Chaplains&rsquo; Report commends the recent efforts by the prison management at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution to improve conditions there, including the improved educational facilities and the provision of separate accommodation and education units there for those under 18 years and those over 18 years.</P>
        <P>Literacy work has been a strong element of the Prison Education curriculum since the early 1980&rsquo;s.   A number of significant initiatives in the area of prison literacy commenced or were strengthened since 2003 which paralleled efforts to address adult literacy in the community.  These include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the fuller use of negotiated learning plans for all literacy students;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />introducing the new FETAC level 1 and level 2 literacy courses;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the introduction of the National Adult Literacy Agency&rsquo;s (NALA) assessment framework, &ldquo;Mapping the Learning Journey&rdquo; in each prison&rsquo;s Education unit;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />devising and delivering the NALA and Waterford Institute of Technology 30 hour Initial Tutor Training Course for teachers new to prison education; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />drawing up and rolling out of a national Literacy Plan for Prison Education.</P><Col N="394"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In relation to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, the position is that all inmates are interviewed soon after arrival both for the School and the Industrial Training workshops and there are ongoing basic literacy courses in both the Education Unit and the Special School educational unit for inmates under 18 years of age.  Every effort is made to encourage inmates to partake of the courses available to them.</P>
        <P>In the Special School there are 6 teachers providing classes as well as two workshops providing training in catering skills and industrial skills.  The fully equipped sports hall of the Unit is in daily use with accredited fitness instructors and a Physical Education teacher involved.  Support services are provided by two Probation Officers and Psychology, Medical and Chaplaincy Services.  These personnel are available to inmates on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>In total, there are 18 City of Dublin VEC teachers working in the Institution&rsquo;s Education Unit.  Of these, at least half work in the literacy/numeracy area.  The curriculum also extends to subjects such as: art/crafts, music, computers (including computer literacy), food &amp; nutrition, English, French, maths, history, social studies, parenting.  However, all of the Unit&rsquo;s teachers are aware of the low literacy levels prevailing and will take steps to tailor-make the subject level to the poor literacy levels of their teachers of their students.  A total of 322 individual prisoners attended the Institution&rsquo;s Education Unit over the school year 2006/07.  It must be remembered that participation in education varies with factors such as the turnover of the overall inmate population.  The vast majority of the 322 attendees (circa 80%) were intensively involved for 10 or more hours of education classes per week.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that my Department, through the Probation Service, provides funding to 63 voluntary bodies which provide a range of services to offenders in local communities, e.g. pre-industrial training and education, offender management programmes, residential accommodation, drug and alcohol abuse treatment / intervention / awareness programmes and sex offender programmes.  These programmes are designed to provide an opportunity for offenders to address their offending behaviour, explore their career options and to take part in personal development modules.  The aims of these programmes are to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Prepare participants for work / training / education;</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Encourage them to take full responsibility for their own development; and</P>

The Probation Service, which is an integral part of my Department, through its work in the community and in the prisons, contributes in a significant way to the rehabilitation of offenders and I am pleased to advise the Deputy, that on foot of a Government Decision dated 18 April, 2007, approving a &ldquo;Juvenile Justice and Child Protection Package&rdquo;, an additional  71 professional and administrative posts were approved for the Probation Service which will greatly assist in the provision of enhanced Probation services Nationwide.</P>
        <P>Particular emphasis is also placed on the rehabilitation of young offenders, the Deputy will be aware of the changes in recent years aimed at bringing about improvements in the youth justice system with the establishment of the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) an executive office of my Department which, inter alia, is charged with improving the delivery of services for young offenders.  In addition a dedicated Young Persons Probation Division (YPP) was recently established within the Probation Service which has responsibility to enhance and develop community based programmes and initiatives to assist in the rehabilitation of young offenders and to allow for the full implementation of the sections of the Children Act, 2001 relating to the Probation Service.</P>
        <P>In 2008, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department will provide almost &euro;20m for services to offenders which include the wide range of rehabilitative measures already referred to.  In addition, in excess of &euro;10m will be provided for juvenile offending initiatives.    Overall, that <Col N="396"/>represents 45.9% of the Probation Service budget allocation for 2008.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made and will continue to be made to provide adequate rehabilitative measures for the offender population.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Licensing Acts contain a comprehensive set of legislative provisions designed to tackle the problem of underage drinking. The main provisions dealing with this matter are set out in Part IV of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (as amended by the Intoxicating Liquor Acts of 2000, 2003 and 2004).  Section 31 of the 1988 Act (as amended by the 2003 Act) provides that it is an offence for a licensee to&mdash;</P>
<P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) sell or deliver intoxicating liquor to a person under the age of 18,</P>
<P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) sell or deliver intoxicating liquor to any person for consumption on the licensed premises by a person under the age of 18,</P>
<P LI="1">(<i>c</i>) permit a person under the age of 18 to consume intoxicating liquor on the licensed premises, or</P>
<P LI="1">(<i>d</i>) permit any person to supply a person under the age of 18 with intoxicating liquor on the licensed premises.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Section 31 also provides that it is an offence for a licensee to sell or deliver intoxicating liquor to any person for consumption off the premises by a person under the age of 18 except, with the explicit consent of the person&rsquo;s parent or guardian, in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission.  The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 provides that where a licensee is convicted of an offence under section 31 of the 1988 Act, the Court shall, in addition to any other penalty, make an order for the closure of the premises concerned for up to 7 days for a first offence, or at least 7 and not more than 30 days for a second or subsequent offence.</P>
        <P>Section 32 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (as substituted by the 2003 Act) provides that a person other than the licensee shall not purchase intoxicating liquor for delivery to, or consumption by, a person under the age of 18 years, or deliver intoxicating liquor to him or her. It is not unlawful for such a person to purchase or deliver intoxicating liquor for consumption by a person under the age of 18 years in a private residence with the explicit consent of that person&rsquo;s parent or guardian.</P><Col N="397"/>
        <P>Furthermore, section 33 of the 1988 Act (as amended by the 2003 Act) provides that it is an offence for a person under the age of 18 to&mdash;</P>
<P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) purchase intoxicating liquor,</P>
<P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) consume intoxicating liquor in any place, except with the explicit consent of his or her parent (or guardian) in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission, or</P>
<P LI="1">(<i>c</i>) represent himself or herself for the purpose of obtaining, or being permitted to consume, intoxicating liquor, to be over 18. In general, persons who commit offences under this section are dealt with under the Garda Diversion Programme.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Section 34 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as amended by the Acts of 2003 and 2004, provides that a licensee shall not allow a person under the age of 18 years to be in the bar of licensed premises at any time.  However it is not unlawful to allow: (a) a child who is accompanied by his or her parent or guardian to be in the bar of licensed premises between 10.30 a.m. (12.30 p.m. on a Sunday) and 9.00 p.m. (10.00 p.m. from 1 May to 30 September).  This exemption does not apply where it appears to the licensee that the child&rsquo;s presence in the bar could reasonably be regarded as injurious to his/her health, safety or welfare;(b) a person who is aged at least 15 years but under the age of 18 years to be in the bar between 10.30 a.m. (12.30 p.m. on Sundays) and 9.00 p.m. (10.00 p.m. from 1 May to 30 September);(c) a child who is accompanied by his or her parent or guardian or a person who is aged at least 15 years but under the age of 18 to be in the bar on the occasion of a private function at which a substantial meal is served to persons attending the function.</P>
<P>Moreover, if a child is present in a bar in contravention of these provisions, the child&rsquo;s parent or guardian is guilty of an offence unless he or she establishes that the child was present without his or her knowledge or consent.</P>
        <P>The prohibition on the presence of persons under the age of 18 years on licensed premises does not apply to children of the licensee, persons who reside in the licensed premises, a person who is passing through the bar solely for the purpose of entering or leaving another part of the premises or persons who are employed in the licensed premises.  The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2004 provides that it is not unlawful to allow a person under the age of 18 years on licensed premises, or any part of such premises, at a time when: (a) intoxicating liquor is not being sold, supplied or consumed on the premises or, as the case may be, that part of the premises, and (b) physical access to intoxicating liquor on those premises or, as the case may be, that part is securely prevented.</P>
        <P>Section 34A of the 1988 Act, as inserted by the 2003 Act and amended by the Intoxicating Liquor <Col N="398"/>Act 2004, requires that persons aged 18 to 20 carry an &ldquo;age document&rdquo;  e.g. a Garda age card, passport, driver licence, in order to be in the bar of licensed premises after 9.00 p.m. (10.00 p.m. from 1 May to 30 September).  Section 37 of the 1988 Act gives the Garda&iacute; the power to seize containers suspected of containing intoxicating liquor which are in the possession of persons under the age of 18 in any place other than an occupied private residence, where a Garda suspects that an offence under section 31, 32 or 33 of the 1988 Act has been committed. A Garda may also request the name, address and age of a person where the Garda suspects that an offence under Part IV of the 1988 Act has been committed.  There is a power of arrest if the person concerned refuses to supply his or her correct name, address and age. It is an offence to give a name, address or age which is false or misleading.</P>
        <P>The Government Legislation Programme published on 25 September provides for publication of a Sale of Alcohol Bill in 2008. This Bill will modernise and streamline the laws relating to the sale and consumption of alcohol by repealing the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2004, as well as the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2004, and replacing them with updated provisions more suited to modern conditions.  The proposed Bill will contain reforms which are designed to strengthen existing provisions to combat under-age consumption of alcohol. These include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a new requirement for all off-licences to have written policies and control procedures in place;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a new offence of being in possession of a forged or altered Garda age card with intent to deceive;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a new provision whereby a member of the Garda&iacute; may request the name and address of any person suspected of committing, or of having committed, such an offence; failure to give such details will be an offence; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a new provision permitting a member of the Garda&iacute; to arrest without warrant a person who refuses to supply his or her name and address or gives a name and address which such member has reason to believe to be false or misleading.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Finally, I should say that I intend to re-examine, as a matter of priority, existing legislation on the sale and consumption of alcohol with a view to identifying any further changes in the law which may be necessary with a view to maintaining public order and ensuring public safety.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the National Drugs Strategy, the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs intended to be smuggled into the State. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as part of its enforcement resources, the Customs Service currently deploys 13 detector dog teams.  These teams are based at strategic locations throughout the State. All detector dog teams have passive dogs which allow for the screening of passengers as well as merchandise and baggage. </P>
        <P>As the illegal movement of cash is the life-blood of drug trafficking and organised crime, following the passing of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005, the Customs authorities introduced cash detection capability also and the Service now have a dedicated detector dog team in place for this purpose.  There is a growing investment by Customs in drug detection resources and the Revenue Commissioners advise me that they regard the deployment of detector dogs as a very important part of this resource.</P>
        <P>The Commissioners also believe in ensuring that the detector dog teams maintain a high public visibility at the ports, airports, postal depots and freight forwarders&rsquo; premises in which they routinely operate.  The Customs detector dogs also assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whenever requested to do so.  The cost of the Customs detector dog programme in 2006 was &euro;1,439,000.  In addition, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Dog Unit consists of 2 Sergeants and 14 Garda&iacute; and currently has 26 dogs. Six of these dogs, two of which are based in the Southern Region, are skilled in drugs and firearms residue detection.  There are also 14 general purpose dogs &mdash; skilled in public order duties, tracking for missing persons, criminals and articles contaminated by human scent; 5 dogs skilled in explosives detection; 1 dog skilled in detecting the presence of dead bodies.  Two of these dogs have been trained in tactical support and one in blood detection.</P>
        <P>Consideration is currently being given to a proposal to extend the Garda Dog Unit nationwide, on a regional basis. To this end a pilot, in the Southern Division (based in Cork and Limerick) has been completed. Following the evaluation of this pilot a decision on the further regionalisation of the Unit will be made. To date in 2007, the Garda National Drugs Unit has carried out a number of operations targeting the sale and supply of drugs at places of entertainment.  It is not <Col N="400"/>possible to give the costs associated with drug sniffer dogs only. However, the annual cost of running the Garda Dog Unit is approximately &euro;1.5m.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate the optimum use of both the Customs Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Dog Units is a matter for the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Commissioner respectively in line with overall law enforcement arrangements and operational strategies.</P>

	<P>Since the publication of the Government&rsquo;s National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, Garda resources generally in the fight against illicit drugs have increased. This is particularly evident with the creation of additional Divisional Drug Units in areas of particular need.  These Drugs Units operate in Divisions throughout the country with a primary focus on local drugs activities. </P>
        <P>In terms of personnel resources, as at 30 November 2007, there were a total of 372 Garda&iacute; dedicated to national and regional drugs units (including 58 based at the Garda National Drugs Unit).  These units are also supported in their work by officers from other national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau. In addition, all Garda&iacute; <Col N="401"/>are tasked with confronting drugs related issues as they arise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The assignment of Garda personnel throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.  This takes place against the background of the unprecedented expansion of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which has taken and will continue to take place increasing the overall strength of the Garda&iacute; to 16,000.  Additional Garda resources are coming on stream all the time. These additional human resources will facilitate the Garda Commissioner in the allocation of additional manpower to areas most in need, including areas with a significant drug problem.</P>
        <P>In addition, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Criminal Assets Bureau, under Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services, works closely with other national units, including the Garda National Drugs Unit, and senior investigating officers in all Garda Divisions to ensure, wherever possible, that assets derived from criminal activity, including drug-related crime, are subject to confiscation.  The Garda National Drugs Unit liaises with the Criminal Assets Bureau to particularly target those criminals and criminal groupings believed to be deriving profits and assets from drug-related criminal activity.</P>
        <P>In relation to the issue of the Bureau&rsquo;s work at local levels, I can inform the Deputy that in order to maximise the benefit that can be derived from local knowledge, officers from the Criminal Assets Bureau work closely with Garda&iacute; from specific regions and localities in order to ensure that the efforts of the Bureau are targeted in the most effective manner possible.  In particular, the Bureau is utilising the services of Divisional Criminal Assets Profilers throughout the country.  At present there are twenty seven divisional profilers appointed and operational.  A further five members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are currently being trained as profilers.  The use of local Garda officers in this way ensures that preparatory groundwork can be carried out in advance of a full investigation by the Bureau. Asset profilers have at all times recourse to the expertise and advice of the Bureau.</P>
        <P>The complement of Divisional profilers will continue to be monitored and reviewed on an on-going basis and I have already included in the Government&rsquo;s policing priorities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a specific reference to enhanced liaison arrangements between Garda Divisions and the Criminal Assets Bureau in the pursuit of those engaged in drug dealing at all levels.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Criminal Assets Bureau has sufficient financial and other resources available to it to operate effec<Col N="402"/>tively pursuant to its statutory remit and that the Chief Bureau Officer keeps the allocation of personnel under constant review in light of the Bureau&rsquo;s workload.</P>
        <P>Finally, I will continue to keep the measures and resources for tackling drug trafficking under review and I repeat the assurance that I gave to the House recently during the lengthy debate on crime that it is my intention to continue to prioritise areas such as gun crime, organised crime and drugs.</P>

	<P>The Treaty of Amsterdam, which came into force on 1 May, 1999, added to the EC Treaty a new Title IV which deals with measures in the area of visas, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons. The proposal in question is subject to Title IV of the Treaty, the application of which to Ireland is subject to the provisions of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaties. Under this Protocol Ireland has three months from the date a proposal is presented to Council to notify our intention to take part in the adoption and the application of such a measure. Ireland may also accept a measure any time after it has been adopted. As the option is only used in a positive sense, &ldquo;opting out&rdquo; does not occur.</P>
        <P>Although Ireland did not exercise its option to opt-in within the initial 3 months, a period which overlapped with the general election and the Oireachtas summer recess, this proposed directive is still under review in my Department in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Ireland continues to participate actively in the current discussions on the proposal at EU level. The question of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in this measure will be determined following the adoption of the Directive, and Ireland&rsquo;s participation would require Oireachtas approval at that stage.</P>
        <P>Ireland exercises its option to participate in Title IV measures to the maximum extent compatible with the maintenance of the Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom. Any proposals arising under Title IV are considered on their own merits.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I am determined to ensure that the treatment of victims of crime is accorded a major priority in the criminal justice system.  To that end, and in the context of the outcome of the deliberations of the Commission, I am prepared to take action in advance of any new statutory proposal that may emerge.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), on its visit to Ireland was published on the 10 October 2007, together with the response of the Government of Ireland to the issues raised by the CPT in that report.  During the 2006 visit the delegation from the CPT visited a number of Garda stations, prisons and places of detention and the Central Mental Hospital and indicated that the level of cooperation received during the visit from the Irish authorities was very good, both at central and local levels.</P>
        <P>I am glad to advise the Deputy that action has been taken to address the prison related issues highlighted in the report which covered, inter alia,  the lack of progress in over-hauling the 1947 prison rules; the need for more robust investigation of prisoner complaints about alleged ill-treatment; the poor physical conditions of some of our prisons leading to overcrowding and &lsquo;slopping out&rsquo;; the existence of inter- prisoner violence and intimidation; the number of prisoners on &lsquo;protection&rsquo;; the drugs situation and the need to improve and enhance regime activities for certain prisoners.</P>
        <P>The following is an overview of the key developments:</P>
<P el="5">(a)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />Prison accommodation:  As indicated in the CPT report we recognise the necessity to modernise and expand the prison estate.  The ambitious prison capital programme now underway, with the full support of the Government, will result in the replacement and/or refurbishment of nearly 40% of the entire prison estate and the ending of &lsquo;slopping out&rsquo;.  The proposed new prison complex at Thornton Hall which will replace the outdated Mountjoy complex will provide accommodation for 1,400 prisoners in a range of security settings with all the support facilities to enhance regime activities for prisoners and provide modern facilities as are fitting a modern prison environment.  Other major works include the building of a new prison at Kilworth to serve the Munster region and the provision of additional accommodation at Shelton Abbey, Loughan House, Limerick, Wheatfield, Portlaoise and Castlerea.</P>
<P el="5">(b)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />Prison Rules, 2007:  The new prison rules were brought into effect from 1st October, 2007.</P>
<P el="5">(c)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />Enhanced security measures in our prisons:   In the Government&rsquo;s response to the CPT report on the question of inter-prisoner violence it was  accepted that the CPT had <Col N="405"/>rightly identified an emerging problem and that further measures are needed to deal with the issue. As I have indicated to the House on previous occasions, I am determined to deal with the issue in a proportionate manner by increasing our efforts to stem the flow of contraband items, such as drugs, weapons and mobile phones, which could assist in illegal activity.  Indeed, as the Deputy will be aware significant efforts are made on a continuous basis by the prison authorities to stop contraband getting into our prisons, by for example, the installation of nets over exercise yards, vigilant observation of prisoners by staff, upgraded CCTV monitoring,  the use of screened visits and prisoner and cell searches.  New visiting arrangements are in place in all closed prisons whereby only persons who have been pre-approved by the Governor are permitted to visit.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I believe that technology offers the best solution to dealing with the problem of prisoners using mobile phones.  The first phase of a pilot programme to inhibit the use of mobile phones in prisons has been completed in the Midlands Prison with the second phase of the pilot due to finish in the near future. I am glad to say that evaluation of the project thus far has shown positive results and, if confirmed, the inhibitors will be installed in all our closed prisons over an 18 to 24 month period. In addition, section 36 of the Prisons Act, 2007, effective from 1st May, 2007 makes it an offence for prisoners to have unauthorised possession of or use mobile telecommunications devices.  Under the Act it is also an offence to supply such a device to a prisoner.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the Drugs Policy entitled &ldquo;Keeping Drugs out of Prisons&rdquo; by the Irish Prison Service has seen an intensification of efforts to eliminate the availability of illicit drugs within the prisons .  A significant element in this regard is the introduction of mandatory drug testing under the Prison Rules which became operational from 1st October, 2007.  Facilities for<?oasys _jy ?>screened visits have been installed in all closed prisons.  In keeping with the Strategy prisoners in respect of whom the Governor is satisfied that there is no risk of contraband being passed may be facilitated with open visits.  Prisoners who are caught receiving drugs or who test positive for drugs will be facilitated with screened visits only.</P>
        <P>I am committed to supporting the Director General of the Irish Prison Service by providing additional resources to further enhance security within our prisons.  I am confident that the recently announced package of additional security measures will make a significant difference to keeping contraband out of our prisons.  These measures include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of a drug detection dog service within the Irish Prison Service;</P><Col N="406"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of an Operational Support Group dedicated to, and developing expertise in, searching and gathering intelligence;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the introduction of enhanced security<?oasys _jy ?>screening and searching of all persons (prisoners, visitors and staff) entering our prisons.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Drug Detection Dog Service will involve approximately 30 staff and an appropriate number of dogs.  The Deputy will be aware that a pilot drug detection dog service has been in place since May 2006 and is currently running in the Midlands/Portlaoise area and also in Wheatfield/Cloverhill Prisons, the Mountjoy complex and Cork and Limerick Prisons.</P>
        <P>The Operational Support Group will be available in addition to the normal prison staff and can target specific problem areas.  They will also gather and collate intelligence information in their prison, carry out high profile escorts and assist the chief officer in charge of security in the continuing assessment and improvement of security.</P>
        <P>In addition to the security measures, Drug Treatment Services to prisoners are also being significantly enhanced through the development of new services and programmes for addicted prisoners.  These services are being delivered by the Irish Prison Service in partnership with community based services and contracted private services and supported by additional staffing for prison based Drug Treatment Teams.  Security measures across our prisons will continue to be kept under review.</P>

	<P>The most recent report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate noted the amount of time potentially spent by garda&iacute; in court proceedings.  It also noted that within the Dublin Metropolitan Region a Court Presenter <Col N="407"/>system is in place in the Dublin Metropolitan Court District and that outside the DMR the local District Officer is the Prosecuting Officer, representing the Director of Public Prosecutions, for the majority of prosecutions before the District and Circuit Courts.</P>
        <P>The Inspectorate welcomed developments in the Court Presenters system which frees up significant Garda time from court duty. The Inspectorate has suggested that this scheme should be extended to all courts throughout the Dublin Metropolitan region. They have also suggested that the Superintendents assigned outside of the Dublin metropolitan region should be relieved of their Court Prosecution role.  In addition to the foregoing, Section 5 of the Road traffic Act 2006 provides for administrative charges for certain driving offences. A working group chaired by the Department of Transport is preparing for the commencement of this section which in turn should release garda&iacute; from attendance at court in a significant number of such cases.</P>

        <Quest> if he will introduce legislation repealing the Independent Monitoring Commission in view of the unjustified drain it exerts on the Irish taxpayer and the high opportunity cost of spending on it in budget 2008, whereby the IMC will receive almost as much money as crime prevention measures and more money than services to crime victims. </Quest>

	<P>Far from being a drain on the Exchequer, as suggested by the Deputy, the Monitoring Committee has rendered signal service to the Irish people and continues to do so.  There are therefore, no immediate plans to introduce legislation repealing the Independent Monitoring Commission Act 2003.  The Deputy will be aware that the Commission is an independent body which was jointly established by the Irish and British Governments.  Accordingly, any decision in this regard will have to be taken in concert with the British authorities, not as a unilateral action.</P>
        <P>I would remind the Deputy that the Independent Monitoring Commission&rsquo;s contribution to the peace process has been truly significant.  As its most recent report states, the objective for which the Commission was set up is being progressively achieved, and I would add that the IMC continues to do valuable work monitoring and reporting on the ongoing activities of paramilitary groups on the island.  It also played a critical role in the process of normalisation which saw a significant reduction in the British military presence in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the applications that the Immigration Division of my Department receives are diverse in nature and the processing time frames vary considerably according to the nature and circumstances of the scheme in question.  In all instances, processing arrangements are kept under ongoing review and steps are taken to reduce waiting times where this is feasible having regard to available resources and overall priorities.  For example, the introduction of a new Information Technology System which is currently being developed, is expected to enhance the capability of the INIS to deal with such applications more efficiently.</P>
        <P>Long term residency was introduced by way of an administrative scheme in May 2004. The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.</P>
        <P>While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  I understand that applications received in July 2006 are currently being dealt with. Long term residency is an administrative scheme which will be established on a statutory basis in accordance with the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.</P>
        <P>At time of processing, each application is examined  to verify the applicant meets the residency criteria.  Should an applicant meet the residency criteria a character reference check is then carried out.  This includes a requirement for all applicants to produce a police clearance certificate from their country of origin and any other country they resided in prior to travelling to this State.   The requirement for a police clearance certificate was introduced recently as part of the character clearance aspect of the application process.</P>
        <P>I accept there could be situations where applicants for long term residency, who have been away from their country of origin for considerable periods of time, may encounter difficulties in getting the necessary police clearance certificate.  It is expected that such  situations will arise only on an exceptional basis, and will be considered on a case by case basis having regard to all of the factors involved in the processing of applications for long term residency.</P>
        <P>Insofar as Citizenship is concerned, the Deputy will acknowledge that the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and that applications must be processed in a way <Col N="410"/>which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria. The procedures employed to assess an applicant for naturalisation are as set out in summary form below.</P>
        <P>Upon receipt, each application is examined to determine if the statutory application is completed fully.  Incomplete application forms are returned to the applicant for amendment.  Valid applications are then examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.  Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and enquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary.</P>
        <P>The next stage of the process involves assessing an applicant&rsquo;s financial status in respect of their ability to support themselves in the State.  Enquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard.  At the same time enquiries are also made with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to clarify if the applicant can be deemed to be of good character.  There may also be circumstances in individual cases  which require a greater level of investigation than other cases.  Once all enquiries are completed, the file is referred to me for a decision.  The Deputy will appreciate that these processes can take a lengthy time to complete.</P>
        <P>The above procedures have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.  Consequently, having regard to the resources available, which are kept under constant review, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved. However, I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns regarding the efficiency of the existing system and accordingly, I have instructed my officials to undertake a review of the various processes in order that these might be streamlined further where possible.</P>

	<P>The Fines Bill currently before the House has three main purposes: to index all District Court Fines, to provide for equality of impact for all fines imposed by the courts and to provide for payment by instalment.  These measures should significantly reduce the incidence of default in the payment of fines.  The proposals are in line with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in their reports on the issue. The provisions of the Bill are the first phase in a process of reform of the fines system.  The effectiveness of the measures contained in the Bill, when enacted, will be monitored by my Department.</P>
        <P>The collection of fixed charge fines has also been under examination by my Department for some time, with a view to increasing payment compliance and thus reducing the number of these offences that come before the courts for non-payment.  In April 2006, 31 new offences were categorised as fixed charge penalties. Additionally, legislation was introduced to increase incrementally the number of penalty points on conviction and increase the amount of the fine if not paid after 28 days with the objective of reducing the number of cases coming before the courts.  In addition, a pilot study was commissioned by my Department to examine the feasibility of handing over the collection of  fixed charge penalties to an external credit management agency. The preliminary results of this pilot study were quite encouraging, with over 22% of cases being cleared up.  The Department is currently finalising an assessment of the pilot study with a view to establishing its introduction on a wider footing.</P>
        <P>With regard to committal proceedings, a report commissioned by my Department on people committed to imprisonment for civil debt or non-payment of fines, concluded that fine defaulters tend to be unemployed or not in the labour force. The issue of attachment of earnings has been mentioned as an alternative to prison for fine defaulters.  It may well be that attachment of earnings has a role in the case of an offender with a salary. However, an attachment of earnings <Col N="412"/>mechanism would have no impact where the debtor has no salary. Furthermore, the issue of attachment of welfare payments raises serious questions about the effect of such provisions on people with few means.</P>
        <P>In relation to warrants currently outstanding, the Garda Commissioner recognises that steps need to be taken to reduce the number of outstanding warrants as much as possible.  Each regional Assistant Commissioner has therefore been directed to give priority to this issue and to review procedures in their areas for the execution of warrants.</P>

	<P>The recently published Report of the Family Law Reporting Pilot Project undertaken by Dr. Carol Coulter at the request of the Courts Service makes a range of recommendations to enhance the role of mediation. I fully agree that enhanced mediation procedures are a key element in relation to family law and dispute resolution generally and I understand that this approach will be addressed in new Rules of the Circuit Court.  The Legal Aid Board is also taking action to promote the use of dispute resolution mechanisms in family law cases.  This has incorporated the collaborative law approach as well as structured negotiation techniques and has the potential to be of considerable benefit to those who find themselves in difficult family situations.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to note that the Courts Service is to establish a committee to review Dr. Coulter&rsquo;s report and the implementation of its recommendations, many of which, I should add, fall outside the remit of my powers as Minister.  I look forward to seeing the outcome of the committee&rsquo;s proceedings in due course and, should the com<Col N="413"/>mittee recommend a change to family law legislation, I will carefully consider any such proposal.</P>

	<P>There are, in general terms, two broad categories of organised crime groups operating in this jurisdiction. The first category consists of individuals / groups that are well established and tightly structured and are involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences. The second category involves groups whose activities are characterised by less cohesive group structures and are involved in criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland.</P>
        <P>The membership of organised gangs tends to be fluid and the nature of criminal activity is such that offences committed by members of gangs may or may not be connected with the individual&rsquo;s membership of such gangs.  It is therefore not possible, without the expenditure of an inordinate amount of time and resources, to attribute specific figures to the membership or activity of such gangs.</P>
        <P>Organised criminal gangs operating in this jurisdiction are targeted on an ongoing basis and profiles regarding the personnel of such groups are continually updated.  Their members, operating methods, criminal interests and financial assets are likewise proactively targeted through intelligence-led operations,  primarily undertaken by specialist units of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operating under the remit of the Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services.  Units involved in these  operations include the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Organised Crime Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and operations are regularly undertaken, targeting those suspected of being involved in Organised Crime.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to utilise intelligence-led operations against selected targets to combat the criminal activities of these groups.</P>

	<P>Currently, the Road Traffic Acts provides that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may, where he or she is of the opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of that vehicle, require that person to go to a Garda station and further require that person submit to a blood test or to provide a urine sample.</P>
        <P>The Medical Bureau of Road Safety analyses blood and urine specimens received under the Road Traffic Acts for the presence of a drug or drugs. Urine analysis is the principal method used in testing for drugs in places of detention.  Enforcement of the law on drug driving is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When a member of the Garda suspects that a motorist is driving under the influence of any intoxicant the Garda may arrest the suspect under Section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.  Furthermore, section 38 of the Road Traffic Act 1968, as amended by Section 6 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 provides a statutory power to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety for the supply and testing of apparatus for indicating the presence of alcohol in the breath.</P>
        <P>Section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 (as amended) and section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 (as amended) also provide the powers to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to require drivers to provide preliminary breath specimens for the purpose of indicating the presence of alcohol in the breath.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, road traffic legislation is a matter for the Department of Transport and I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, that at present there is no reliable equipment available for the purpose of roadside testing for drugs.  I am further informed that the Department of Transport will keep under review the development of technology internationally for such testing and that when suitable technology becomes available, any further legislative measures, if required, to facilitate its use will be introduced.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 93 together.</P>
        <P>The Prison Rules 2007, which took effect from 1 October 2007, include specific provision for mandatory drug testing.  Mandatory drug testing forms part of the Irish Prisons Service Drugs Policy &lsquo;Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons&rsquo; which sets out the steps required to tackle the supply of drugs into prisons, provide adequate treatment services to those who are addicted to drugs and ensure that developments in the prisons were linked into the community.</P>
        <P>Mandatory drug testing provides information on trends in drug misuse, enables the identification and referral of drug abusers to treatment programmes, enables enhanced focusing of resources and acts as a deterrent to drug misuse. Mandatory drug testing will also serve to provide important information to prison management that will contribute significantly to decision-making in relation to the management of individual prisoners sentences.</P>
        <P>Mandatory drug testing currently takes place in the Training Unit, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, Castlerea, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey.  All prisoners must be drug free to attend an open centre and the intention is to roll out a programme of testing to the remaining institutions during 2008.</P>

        <Quest> the measures being planned by the Irish Prison Service for the introduction of mobile phone jamming equipment; the reason this plan is necessary if adequate measures are in place to prevent the smuggling of mobile phones into prisons; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I am committed to implementing all appropriate measures to deal with the issue of mobile phones and other contraband being smuggled into Irish prisons.</P>
        <P>One of the major challenges in prisons worldwide lies in preventing access to contraband items, including mobile phones, which for obvious reasons, are viewed as highly valuable commodities which could assist in illegal activity.  Efforts are made on a continuous basis to prevent the flow of such contraband into our prisons, by for example, the installation of nets over exercise yards, vigilant observation of prisoners by staff, upgraded CCTV monitoring, the use of screened visits and prisoner and cell searches.  In addition, new visiting arrangements are in place in all closed prisons whereby only persons who have been pre-approved by the Governor are permitted to visit.</P>
        <P>I can also assure the Deputy that I am determined to deal with the problem of prisoners using mobile phones and, in this context, I believe that technology offers the best solution to dealing with the illegal use of mobile phones by prisoners.  As informed by the Irish Prison Service, I can confirm that a pilot programme of mobile phone inhibition is ongoing in Midlands Prison and that early indications are that the technology is very successful.  If the results of this preliminary evaluation hold true, the inhibitors will be installed in all the other closed prisons over an 18 to 24 month period.  It is my belief that it is both appropriate and necessary to introduce mobile phone inhibitors into all our prisons.  I believe that this inhibition technology offers the most effective solution for dealing with illegal use of mobile phones in prisons.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that Section 36 of the Prisons Act 2007, which was brought into operation from 1 May 2007, makes it an offence for prisoners to have unauthorised possession of or use mobile telecommunications devices.  Under the Act it is also an offence to supply such a device to a prisoner.  The penalty for such an offence, on summary conviction, is a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, and on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.</P><Col N="418"/>
        <P>Random searches of cells and their occupants and searching of correspondence and other items entering the prison have all intercepted significant quantities of contraband in recent years.  When a person is admitted to prison custody, he or she is searched and prohibited items and money are taken.  Similarly, searching takes place of prisoners returning from court, temporary release or after visits.  Searches of prisoners also take place where their behaviour or information received raises suspicions that they may be in possession of contraband.  The Prison Service has recently purchased a number of cameras and probe systems which assist in searching previously difficult areas such as hollow chair or bed legs, u-bends in toilets, drain holes, under floor boards and other cavities.  These new technologies are proving to be a valuable asset in this area.  The planned new prison estates at Thornton Hall and Kilworth will also make it harder for contraband to enter the prison by locating recreation yards away from perimeter walls and having a cordon sanitaire.</P>
        <P>As regards enhanced security, the Deputy will also be aware that earlier this year I announced a range of security measures aimed at keeping contraband out of our prisons.  These measures include: the establishment of an Operational Support Group dedicated to, and developing expertise in, searching and gathering intelligence.  The group will be available in addition to the normal prison staff and can target specific problem areas.  They will also gather and collate intelligence information in their prison, carry out high profile escorts and assist the Chief Officer in charge of security in the continuing assessment and improvement of security.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service is also enhancing these procedures through the introduction of a comprehensive &ldquo;airport style&rdquo; screening and search process in the closed prisons.  This project is under way and it is hoped that it will be completed early next year.  However, the introduction of these procedures are the subject of industrial action by the POA and, accordingly, it has not been possible to proceed with these measures to date.</P>

        <P>I believe that the Committees established have made good progress to date in carrying out their functions. I propose to roll out the Committees to all 114 local authorities in the State as early as possible in 2008. In order to enable this to happen, it is necessary to consider the current guidelines in the light of the experience of the Committees already established and make any changes necessary.</P>
        <P>To assist with this process, my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I hosted a consultation seminar on 29 November with participants in the pilot Committees to discuss their views on the operation of the Committees to date. The outcomes of the seminar are currently being considered with a view to preparing changes to the guidelines. This process is currently ongoing.

However there are a tiny number of cases, by reference to the totality of interactions, <Col N="421"/>which ultimately give rise to a legal liability on the part of the State. In these cases the advices of Counsel, the Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General inform the approach taken in addressing the issues involved while protecting the public purse.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the events in Donegal which gave rise to the establishment of the Morris Tribunal also gave rise to numerous sets of civil proceedings which have had the effect of inflating the amount of monies paid out in the years 2005, 2006 and 2007.  Indeed the disposal of 48 further cases in recent weeks has had the effect of increasing the amount to which the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to &euro;24 million.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s response to those unprecedented events was the enactment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 which introduced significant fundamental structural changes in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and represented the most significant overhaul of the Force since the foundation of the State.  One of the principal aims of the Act of 2005 was the establishment of a framework within which shortcomings in the regime of governance and accountability within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could be addressed.  For example the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is empowered subject to certain conditions independently to investigate any practice, policy or procedure of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a view to reducing the incidence of complaints. Furthermore the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, which has an expertise in international policing, may at the request of or with the consent of the Minister carry out inquiries or inspections in relation to particular aspects of the operation or administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Clearly, these new and innovative mechanisms can play a role in ensuring best practice and consequent minimisation of exposure of the public finances.</P>
        <P>Finally of course the new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Discipline) Regulations which came into operation on 1 June 2007 have streamlined the disciplinary process and replaced the complex system which had developed over the years &mdash; responding to a specific and important lacuna identified by the Morris Tribunal.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that installation and commissioning of the first phase of the new National Automatic Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) went live on 22 October 2007.  While the previous system met Garda requirements over the last ten years or so, advances in technology mean that the new system offers significant new capabilities and capacity including the ability to store palm prints as well as traditional &lsquo;ten-prints&rsquo; and improved matching capabilities for poor quality or partial fingerprints taken from the scenes of crimes.  I understand the Garda authorities are very pleased with the operation of the new system which has already produced a greatly improved &lsquo;hit&rsquo; rate for latent marks taken at crime scenes. Indeed, I myself witnessed the impressive system in operation at its recent launch.</P>
        <P>Work is now under way on subsequent phases, which will be delivered during 2008, and will provide for the capture and storing of a person&rsquo;s fingerprints upon registration by the Garda National Immigration Bureau as well as the ability for GNIB officers to capture prints at ports of entry including sea and air ports.  Full integration of the new AFIS with the Garda PULSE system and GNIB Information system will also be delivered in the coming phases.</P>
        <P>The AFIS system is just one of a broad range of information technology systems being delivered to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the fight against crime.  Other projects include a Major Incident Management system, Automatic Number Plate Recognition system and the new Digital Radio Service.  A total of &euro;102m is allocated in 2008 for Information Technology and Communications related projects.</P>

I fully support the Garda Commissioner in the continued implementation of the civilianisation programme proposed for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and am happy to say that significant progress has been made to date in the recruitment of civilian staff by the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Commissioner that the number of full and part time civilian staff assigned to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as at the 10 December 2007 was 2,276.  Approximately 297 Clerical Officers have been recruited and assigned positions within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the 1 January 2007.  These officers have <?oasys _dc28- ?>been allocated to the Dublin Metropolitan Region, Garda Headquarters and Specialised Units.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>A campaign to recruit a further 300 Clerical Officers for outside the Dublin Metropolitan area is well under way and interviews are currently being held by the Public Appointments Service.  This will release trained members of the Force for front-line duty.  To date, in excess of 30 additional Clerical Officers have been assigned to Garda stations outside Dublin, 12 additional Clerical Officers have been assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit, Thurles, and 25 additional Clerical Officers have been assigned to the Garda Information Services Centre, Castlebar.</P>
        <P>The recruitment of civilian staff to middle and senior positions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is well under way. Appointments have been made to the positions of Chief Administrative Officer, Director of Finance, Director of Communications, Head of Internal Audit, HR Manager, Housing Officer and Transport Manager and a civilian at Principal Officer level has been appointed to the Information Technology section.</P>
        <P>Recruitment for the following positions will start shortly: Director of Information and Communications Technology, Director of Change Management, Head of Legal Affairs and Executive Director of Human Resources.   Other recruitment initiatives are under way. The position of Head of Procurement (AP) in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been advertised and applications are currently being considered. A competition to recruit 28 Crime &amp; Policing Analysts was advertised on 29th November 2007. A Competition to recruit 3 Cartographers and 2 Photographers was advertised on  6th December, 2007. A competition to recruit additional Telecommunications Technicians was advertised on 6th December, 2007. An open competition to recruit a Professional Accountant Grade I and a Professional Accountant Grade II for Internal Audit Unit will take <Col N="424"/>place soon and a variety of other posts will be advertised.</P>
        <P>A dedicated Human Resource Directorate has been established in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to serve the needs of the civilian, administrative, professional, technical and industrial staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to promote an extensive programme of civilianisation.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to developing the civilian support function within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the level of best international practice and that he will continue to work to drive the civilianisation programme forward.  I will fully support the Garda Commissioner in the continued implementation of organisational reform which, as I said, is supported by the analysis and recommendations of the Hayes Group and the Garda Inspectorate.</P>

However, the allocation of additional personnel will be determined by a number of factors including population, crime trends, other operational policing needs and priorities. The allocation of Garda resources is monitored and reviewed on a continual basis and the policing needs of new and developing areas will be fully considered by the Garda Commissioner in the context of overall policing requirements.</P>

The Chief Justice has publicly stated that the proposals for a Judicial Council are being examined across the various court jurisdictions and has advised my Department of progress in that respect.

	<P>The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) is currently well-advanced in the phased expansion of its criminal history vetting service to all sectors and organisations having client groups of children and vulnerable adults.  In the case of the sports sector, this expansion is being managed in liaison with the Irish Sports Council (ISC), which is represented on the multi-agency Implementation Group on Garda Vetting overseeing the implementation of the national strategy on vetting.</P>
        <P>The methodology employed is that the ISC liaises with the National Governing Bodies (NGBs) of sport in respect of the introduction of vetting.  The ISC notifies the GCVU both when a new NGB is in a position to apply for registration with the Unit and of the nominated person in the NGB to manage the process of vetting for that sport.  The GCVU then liaises with this nominated person in the NGB in order to commence the registration process.  On registration, the GCVU delivers training to the NGB, and the vetting service is then extended to that NGB and sport.  This methodology, which has been <?oasys _dc28- ?>approved by the Implementation Group on Garda Vetting, is designed to promote both the integrity and professionalism of the vetting process.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P Just="Left">I am informed by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism that, to date, 16 NGBs have registered with the GCVU, which, as a consequence, has extended its vetting service to those NGBs and sports.  I am further informed that the ISC has recently notified the GCVU that a further 12 NGBs are in a position to commence the registration process.  As of today&rsquo;s date, the process of registering those 12 NGBs has commenced, and it is envisaged that this will be completed and vetting extended to these NGBs and sports by the end of January 2008.  I am also informed that a further 38 NGBs funded by the ISC have yet to commence the registration process.  However, it is expected that the registration of these outstanding NGBs and the consequent extension of vetting to them will be completed by the end of 2008.  The numbers of employees and volunteers involved are not readily available.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the GCVU, in conjunction with the ISC, is progressing the phased expansion of vetting in a professional and expeditious manner, and I look forward to its completion as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Discipline Regulations were introduced by Statutory instrument in May 2007.  Included in the &ldquo;Acts or Conduct Constituting Breaches of Discipline&rdquo; is the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;Prohibited spare-time activity, that is to say&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) identifying himself or herself actively or publicly with a political party,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) behaving in relation to political matters in such a manner and in such circum<Col N="430"/>stances as to give rise to reasonable apprehension among members of the public in relation to his or her impartiality in the discharge of his or her duties, or</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) engaging (whether for reward or otherwise) in any activity which, though not mentioned in subparagraph (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>), is prohibited by the Commissioner (by either general or special directive) as being&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) likely to interfere with the proper discharge of his or her duties, or</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) likely to give rise to reasonable apprehension among members of the public in relation to his or her impartiality in the discharge of those duties, or</P>
        <P LI="3">(iii) for good and stated reasons, inappropriate for members to engage in.&rdquo;</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?><P FLI="0">I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the circumstances of the officer&rsquo;s attendance at this social event with friends did not constitute a breach of the discipline regulations. The officer was a passive attendee in a social context and took no part in political matters. The officer has not engaged in any prohibited activity which would interfere with the <Col N="431"/>discharge of his duties or which would give apprehension in relation to his impartiality in the discharge of his duties.</P>

	<P>I wish to refer the Deputy to the press release which my Department issued on 5 December, 2007 in relation to the 2008 Estimates, which sets out key features of interest. The press release is available on my Department&rsquo;s website (www.justice.ie).  I would also refer the Deputy to my remarks in this House on Thursday 6 December, 2007 during the course of the Budget debate, in which I elaborated on my priorities for the year ahead.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the proposals from a group (details supplied) for the introduction of a bridging visa for a short period for migrants from outside the EU who have entered Ireland lawfully but have become undocumented for reasons beyond their control; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[34541/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no proposals to introduce any general regularisation programme for undocumented migrant workers in the State.  Each case must be considered on its individual merits and this approach is being followed in respect of those brought to the attention of the immigration authorities where the migrant has become undocumented after previously holding a work permit.   Depending on the circumstances of the case the individual may be permitted to remain on in the State for the purposes of seeking a new work permit and granted a short term residence permit to enable them to do so.        </P>
        <P>The introduction of temporary permits or bridging visas without a proper examination of the circumstances of each case would amount to a general regularisation for persons who do not have permission to be in the State.  Such regularisations are highly problematic and carry the danger of creating a pull factor for illegal migration.  I am aware of the proposal referred to by the Deputy.  My understanding is that it would not differ radically in its contents from what is happening in practice for persons who formerly held employment permits, particularly with regard to adopting a case by case approach.  In general, if a person who is illegally in Ireland <Col N="432"/>wishes to regularise his or her position, he or she should leave the State voluntarily and seek to return through the legal channels.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Last October, I announced the establishment of an additional 7 Garda Youth Diversion Projects, fulfilling the commitment to increase the total number of projects operating throughout Ireland to 100 by the end of this year.  There are 31 projects operating in Dublin, 11 in Cork, and 6 each in Kerry and Limerick.  There are 5 projects in Waterford and 4 each in Galway, Louth and Tipperary.  Offaly and Wexford have 3 projects.  Clare, Donegal, Kildare, Laois, Mayo, Meath, Westmeath and Wicklow all have 2 projects while Carlow, Cavan, Kilkenny, Longford, Roscommon and Sligo and Monaghan all have one.  Further details are set out in the table.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Finally, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to increase the number of Garda Youth Diversion Projects to 168 in the lifetime of this Government.   On this note, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that additional resources have been allocated to fund the further expansion of youth diversion projects and programmes in 2008.</P>

        <Quest> if he has agreed a definition of integration and integration policy with the Minister of State responsible for integration; the input this Minister of State has into the development of immigration policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I have overall responsibility for immigration policy.  Broadly, that means setting policy, in relation to foreign nationals, for entry to the State, residence within it, removal if necessary and citizenship together with all aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s protection regime.    This responsibility is given effect to by,  inter alia, bringing forward legislation,  establishing administrative schemes and in the ongoing decision making within the immigration system.  Policy making in the immigration area is informed by the views of other Ministers and their Departments where immigration interacts with matters falling within their policy remit.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of the establishment earlier this year of a separate office for integration under the Minister of State, Mr. Conor Lenihan, T.D. In addition to reflecting the importance placed by this Government on integration matters, the location of the office in the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, and my own Department was also a significant step in bringing together these closely-<Col N="435"/>related policy areas. In this context, the Minister of State continues to have a specific role in representing the integration aspects of immigration policy. Indeed, he has a cross-Departmental mandate to drive and co-ordinate integration policy across all Government Departments and will, I understand, shortly be chairing a cross-Departmental group in this regard.</P>
        <P>As regards definitions of integration and integration policy, our own approach in this area is confirmed by international experience which, rather than seek agreement on precise definitions, seeks to put the emphasis on the principles needed to underpin progress on integration objectives.   The Deputy may also wish to know that such principles were discussed at a recent major consultation workshop with a wide range of stakeholders and its findings will inform ongoing policy development in this area.</P>
        <P>There are many definitions of integration available on the international scene. One that certainly influences Irish policy makers is the EU definition contained in its eleven Common Basic Principles for Immigrant Integration Policy which are as follows: Integration is a dynamic, two-way process of mutual accommodation by all immigrants and residents of Member States; Integration implies respect for the basic values of the European Union; Employment is a key part of the integration process and is central to the participation of immigrants, to the contributions immigrants make to the host society, and to making such contributions visible; Basic knowledge of the host society&rsquo;s language, history, and institutions is indispensable to integration; enabling immigrants to acquire this basic knowledge is essential to successful integration; Efforts in education are critical to preparing immigrants, and particularly their descendants, to be more successful and more active participants in society; Access for immigrants to institutions, as well as to public and private goods and services, on a basis equal to national citizens and in a non-discriminatory way is a critical foundation for better integration; Frequent interaction between immigrants and Member State citizens is a fundamental mechanism for integration. Shared forums, intercultural dialogue, education about immigrants and immigrant cultures, and stimulating living conditions in urban environments enhance the interactions between immigrants and Member State citizens; The practice of diverse cultures and religions is guaranteed under the Charter of Fundamental Rights and must be safeguarded, unless practices conflict with other inviolable European rights or with national law; The participation of immigrants in the democratic process and in the formulation of integration policies and measures, especially at the local level, supports their integration; Mainstreaming integration policies and measures in all relevant policy portfolios and levels of government and public services is an <Col N="436"/>important consideration in public-policy formation and implementation; Developing clear goals, indicators and evaluation mechanisms are necessary to adjust policy, evaluate progress on integration and to make the exchange of information more effective.</P>

	<P>The Probation Service is an integral part of my Department and through its work in the community and in the prisons, contributes in a significant way to the rehabilitation of offenders.   Therefore, I am very pleased to advise the Deputy that the total budget allocated to the Probation Service for 2008 is &euro;64.039 m which is an overall increase of 8% on the 2007 allocation of &euro;59.323m.    </P>
        <P>I am also pleased to advise the Deputy that there has been a substantial increase of 44% in the budget allocation for Juvenile Offending initiatives.  Overall I am satisfied that the combined allocation of the funding for &ldquo;Services to Offenders&rdquo; and &ldquo;Juvenile Offending Initiatives&rdquo; in the Probation Service budget allocation for 2008  is sufficient to meet the needs of the client group of the Service.</P>

	<P>While the Report contains strongly worded criticism of the prison system, in fairness it also rightly recognises the progress that we are making in improving the system and highlights some of the major developments which have take place in the period covered by the Report. In particular, the Report welcomed the significant progress we are making in enhancing the range of rehabilitative services within the prisons and the provision of additional staffing to support these activities including extra nurses and officers to support drug treatment, the awarding of a contract for Addiction Counsellors in the system and the recruitment of additional psychologists. I should also add that well placed senior managers in the Prison Service and my Department would trenchantly reject the suggestion that the Irish Prison System is dysfunctional. </P><Col N="437"/>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service is currently planning for the roll out of Integrated Sentence Management (ISM), which will be funded under the National Development Plan, starting in 2008 and delivered progressively over the lifetime of the Plan.  Delivering Integrated Sentence Management is a key task for the Irish Prison Service.    ISM will provide for initial assessments, individualised plans and access to services for each prisoner.</P>
        <P>The Plan provides funding for the roll out of Integrated Sentence Management throughout the Irish Prison Service estate.  ISM will involve a new orientation in the delivery of services to prisoners and a new emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons.  The end result should be a prisoner-centred, multidisciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress. Piloting of this process has commenced in two prisons, and roll out to all prisons in the prisons estate will be achieved progressively over the lifetime of the National Development Plan.</P>
        <P>There are a number of issues raised in the Report to which the Deputy refers, which I would like to particularly make reference to.  The suggestion that there are only eight spaces available on the Sex Offender Programme does not reflect the reality that the IPS have experienced difficulties in recruiting suitably motivated offenders to this programme in recent years. There is no question of any sex offender who wishes to participate on this programme being denied a place due to the lack of availability. The IPS will provide as many programmes for these offenders as are required. In addition, it should be noted that in addition to the men currently undertaking that programme, circa sixty other sex offenders have participated during the last year in one-to-one work related to their offending.</P>
        <P>In relation to reintegration, the Irish Prison Service, in partnership with community based groups, have developed a number of projects supporting prisoner reintegration in recent years. These projects have focused on the range of issues facing prisoners on their release such as homelessness, unemployment etc.</P>
        <P>Significant additional resources have been dedicated to enhancing the range and quality of drug treatment services in the prison since the launch of the Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy &lsquo;Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons&rsquo; in 2006. This has included the appointment of additional Addiction Nurses, Psychologists and Prison Officers and the awarding of a contract for the provision of 24 Addiction Counsellors. The range and quality of drug services in prisons has been significantly improved and the Irish Prison Service will continue with their phased implementation of the policy of investing in these services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Certain categories of prisoner are excluded from standard remission of sentence under the Prison Rules and these are as follows: Life sentence prisoners; Persons convicted of debtor offences; Persons convicted of contempt of court; Persons being held on remand warrants; Persons serving a sentence of less than one month.  Other prisoners are eligible to earn remission of 25% of their sentence by good conduct.  The position is that provided the conduct of the prisoner is not found in disciplinary proceedings to warrant loss of remission, the prisoner will be deemed to have earned 25% remission.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government envisages a close link between rehabilitation and remission.    Provision has recently been made whereby prisoners may be granted additional remission,  bringing total remission to up to one third of their sentence, where the prisoners in question have shown further good conduct by engaging in structured activity that is likely to reduce the risk of re-offending and make them better able to reintegrate into the community.</P>
        <P>My officials have kept track of developments in remission and parole in other jurisdictions and I know that the Council of Europe has also studied the matter.  Each system has advantages and disadvantages but there is no one approach accepted as best practice.   I will continue to keep the position under review.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In the period in question, a total of 43 life sentence prisoners were given extended temporary release.  These prisoners had, on average, served over thirteen years in custody.</P>
        <P>All prisoners who are serving life sentences are eligible to have their cases reviewed by the Parole Board when they have served seven years in custody.  The Board, which was established in 2001, makes recommendations to the Minister in relation to the management of offenders serving long sentences.  While it is open to the Parole Board to make any recommendation, the experience of recent years with both the Parole Board and the Sentence Review Group (the predecessor to the Parole Board) is that life sentenced prisoners are normally reviewed on a number of occasions over a number of years before any substantial concessions are recommended.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that a life sentence is indeterminate and there is no guaranteed release date.  However, it does not always mean life in prison.  Persons released into the community continue to serve their sentences, subject to conditions, while on release.  It is generally accepted, both in Ireland and in other jurisdictions, that prisoners serving life sentences who are deemed suitable for release and who have spent a considerable number of years in prison should be paroled at the most appropriate time for re-integration.  Each case is dealt with on its merits and the length of time spent in custody can vary substantially.</P>

The exhumation took place on 28 November, 2007 and a post-mortem examination was conducted by the State Pathologist.   I am informed that samples of bone were forwarded to the Forensic Science Service in Birmingham, England for DNA analysis and comparison on 29 November, 2007.  It is expected that the tests will take a number of weeks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 it is open to me to set policing priorities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I recently announced these priorities for 2008. One of the priorities I have set is to combat, particularly in co-operation with other agencies and the community generally, the problems of public disorder with particular emphasis on alcohol related behaviour (including under age drinking) and socially disadvantaged communities especially through utilisation of the legal mechanisms being made available, namely, ASBOs and behaviour warnings and closure orders.</P>
        <P>Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on <Col N="443"/>1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.</P>
        <P>Strong provisions are already in place to combat anti-social behaviour.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in this regard.  The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 contains provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides the Garda with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.</P>
        <P>In addition to the criminal law, there is a range of initiatives in place to get at the root causes of this type of behaviour. My policing priorities for 2008 include the expansion of the juvenile liaison scheme and the continued expansion of the Garda Youth Diversion Project.  The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. The Children Act 2001 gives a statutory basis to the Programme.</P>
        <P>Garda Youth Diversion Projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour.  By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda/ community relations.  I recently approved the establishment of an additional seven projects, bringing the current total to 100 throughout the country.  It is intended to establish a further 68 projects in the lifetime of this Government bringing the total number of projects to 168 nationwide.</P>
        <P>More broadly, a number of reforms have taken place in recent years to bring about a more effective youth justice system and these have been enshrined in legislation in the Children Act 2001, as amended.  The Act is based on the principles of diversion from crime and anti-social behaviour, restorative justice, the expanded use of community-based sanctions and measures by the courts, and the use of detention only as a last resort.  Recent measures have reformed our entire approach to youth justice.  The Irish Youth Justice Service, an executive office of my Department which is co-located in the Office of the Minister for Children, now has responsibility for developing youth justice policy and operating the children detention schools.</P>
        <P>CCTV schemes are a strong deterrent in fighting crime and anti-social behaviour as well as giving communities greater peace of mind.  Both Garda operated and community based CCTV schemes have been set up, and such schemes will continue to be set up.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee in <Col N="444"/>each local authority administrative area.  The purpose of these committees is to provide a forum where members of a local authority and the senior Garda officers responsible for the policing of that area, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area including the levels and patterns of anti-social behaviour such as the misuse of alcohol and drugs.</P>
        <P>There are currently 29 committees established in a pilot phase. In consultation with my colleagues the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I propose to roll out the committees to all 114 local authority areas as early as possible in 2008.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Encounter, commenced by the Commissioner in February, 2002, targets public disorder and anti-social type behaviour by specifically targeting offences contrary to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988  which include the sale and consumption of alcohol by underage persons.</P>
        <P>All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proactively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour. Areas subject to such behaviour have been identified as &lsquo;hot-spots&rsquo; by local Garda management and additional foot and mobile patrols are directed to these areas during times when these offences are more likely to occur. All such incidents, detected by members on patrol or reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are dealt with immediately, and the suspected offenders are dealt with in accordance with the law.</P>

        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P FLI="0">It has been the law for over 50 years that eligible prisoners may earn 25% remission of sentence for good conduct and almost every eligible sentenced prisoner would earn such remission.  The courts are aware of this provision when determining what sentence to impose.</P>
        <P>Persons sentenced to life imprisonment continue to be bound by the sentence for the rest of their natural life. Depending on a number of factors, most importantly public safety, and after they have served a lengthy period of imprisonment life sentenced prisoners may be allowed serve part of their sentence in the community on temporary release and subject to conditions.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government envisages a close link between rehabilitation and remission.    Provision has recently been made whereby prisoners may be granted additional remission,  bringing total remission to up to one third of their sentence, where the prisoners in question have shown further good conduct by engaging in structured activity that is likely to reduce the risk of re-offending and make them better able to reintegrate into the community.</P>
        <P>My officials have kept track of developments in remission and parole in other jurisdictions and I know that the Council of Europe has also studied the matter.  Each system has advantages and disadvantages but there is no one approach accepted as best practice.   I will continue to keep the position under review.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the concerns expressed by a person (details supplied) that the building of large scale prisons, such as Thornton Hall, will do nothing to reduce violence in prisons and that smaller units are a better way to minimise violence and provide opportunities for rehabilitation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The concerns expressed by the individual referred to by the Deputy are set out in a recently published article.  That article states that instead of having smaller units with self contained facilities at the new Thornton Hall prison development in North County Dublin, it <Col N="446"/>instead appears that the intention of the Irish Prison Service is to have two main prison buildings on the complex each accommodating between 400-500 male prisoners, with shared facilities.  Such a course of action, the author claims, would mean that threats of intimidation and violence would infect the regime of the new prison. </P>
        <P>This assertion is completely without factual basis and I have been informed by the Irish Prison Service that they are unclear as to what the author is basing his views as he has never seen the proposed plans for the new prison development.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy the secure and safe custody of all prisoners and staff has been and will continue to be the primary focus of efforts at the conceptual, study and design stages of the Thornton Hall project.</P>
        <P>Thornton Hall will not operate as a single large prison, but rather a campus development containing eight individual, practically self-contained facilities, each with its own unique and discrete regime which will give access to work training, education, rehabilitative programmes and recreation areas and activities appropriate to that population.  Such a range of facilities cannot be provided to prisoners on a wide scale basis at their present locations in Mountjoy.</P>
        <P>The accommodation units in Thornton Hall will encompass a range of accommodation styles and designs.  The main house blocks will contain 192 cells over four wings with two landings per wing.  The range of accommodation facilities reflects that some accommodation units will have no more that ten rooms in each house and some accommodation is singular apartments style.  This range of accommodation styles and design will allow for the appropriate and separate accommodation of prisoners who may be in conflict on the outside.</P>

The issue of pension adjustment orders may be addressed within this context.</P>

	<P>In December 2006, the Law Reform Commission published a Consultation Paper on Multi-Unit Developments which highlighted a broad range of issues relating to the governance and operation of such developments, including problems arising from the manner in which company law currently applies to property management companies. The Consultation Paper suggested that action to address these problems would be required across several policy fields, including company law, consumer protection law and the development of regulatory structures.</P>
        <P>Following publication of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s Consultation Paper, the Government established a high-level interdepartmental committee to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive response to the broad range of issues arising in relation to multi-unit developments and the governance and operation of property management companies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A key task of the committee is to identify the legislative and administrative actions to be taken in response to the definitive reform recommendations which, following a lengthy consultation process, will be set out in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s forthcoming Report on Multi-Unit Developments and to determine a timescale for their implementation.  I understand that the Commission&rsquo;s Report is currently nearing completion and I can assure the Deputy that I am absolutely determined to ensure that appropriate action will be taken at an early date in response to the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations for reform in this area.</P>

As the Deputy will have noted these measures are now separately funded in Subhead E8 of Vote 19 in 2008.  Consequently the allocation to this subhead (&euro;9.293m in 2008) must be taken into account when comparing the allocation of resources to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in 2007 and 2008.  I am satisfied that the level of resources allocated to immigration related activities in my Department will, in the context of overall Departmental budgets, be sufficient to ensure that appropriate levels of service are provided in 2008.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 204, 205, 207 and 208 together.</P>
        <P>The intimidation of witnesses is an offence pursuant to Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  Section 41 specifies the offence as harming, threatening or menacing or in any other way intimidating or putting in fear another person who is assisting in the investigation of an offence by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the intention of causing the investigation or course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.  The offence applies to the intimidation of witnesses, jurors or potential jurors or any member of the said persons&rsquo; families.  The offence is punishable upon indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to ten years.</P>
        <P>Moreover, since 1997, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has operated a Witness Security Programme in response to attempts by criminal and other groups to prevent the normal functioning of the criminal justice system, including threats of violence and systematic intimidation of witnesses.  Legislation was not required to establish this Programme, but its operation is supported by complementary legislative provisions in Section 40 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  Section 40 makes it an offence for any person, without lawful authority, to try to identify the whereabouts or any new identity of a witness who has been relocated under the Programme.  The offence is punishable upon indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to five years.</P><Col N="450"/>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rigorously and conscientiously enforces these statutory provisions.  In particular, where the possibility of intimidation of witnesses may be an issue, the case is closely monitored throughout the investigation, up to and including any criminal proceedings.  Where a threat to or intimidation of a witness or a potential witness arises during the course of criminal proceedings, the matter may be addressed through the trial judge, who has the discretion to revoke bail or place other sanctions on the accused/suspect.  Any such incident would also be the subject of a thorough investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a view to seeking directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).</P>
        <P>In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of proceedings commenced in respect of the offence created pursuant to Section 41 of the 1999 Act for the years 2002 to 2006 are as follows:</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the comments made by the Master of the High Court, Mr. Edmund Honohan SC, who referred to the systematic failure of self-regulation of solicitors and called for a robust agency to deal with rogue solicitors; his views on the comments made by Mr. Honohan; the proposals the Government has for the effective regulation of solicitors; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I am aware of the comments to which the Deputy refers.  The current regulatory arrangements for solicitors include an independent Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal appointed by the President of the High Court to investigate complaints of misconduct against solicitors and an Independent Adjudicator.</P>
        <P>However, the Government recognises that improved regulation of the legal professions is necessary.  That is why legislative proposals for the establishment of a Legal Services Ombudsman have received Government approval.  The Ombudsman will replace the Independent Adjudicator and will </P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />provide a form of review for customers of legal services who are dissatisfied with the outcome of a complaint made to the Law Society or Bar Council.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />oversee the complaints procedures of the Law Society and Bar Council by examining a selection of complaints files each year taken on a random basis.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />oversee admission to the legal professions, particularly with regard to the adequacy of the numbers admitted.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">On 12 December 2007 the D&aacute;il Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights accepted my amendment of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 to delete Part 2 which provided for the establishment of a Legal Services Ombudsman.  A separate Bill is currently being drafted in place of Part 2 to provide for the establishment of the Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>In addition to this development a  number of the recommendations in the Brosnan Report on regulatory matters in relation to solicitors are being provided for in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006. For example, the Bill provides for  a majority of lay membership of regulatory committees. Provision is also made to ensure better enforcement of orders of the Solicitors Disciplinary Committee.</P>
        <P>The Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Bill 2007 was presented by me to the House on 30 November 2007 and second stage took place earlier today. The Bill promotes the better use of the <Col N="452"/>Irish language by legal practitioners and the provision of legal services through Irish.  A Legal Costs Bill is also  being developed by my Department to reform the manner in which disputed legal costs are assessed with the allied objective of making the market for civil legal services more predictable, consistent and transparent to consumers.</P>

	<P>The High Court Judgment was appealed to the Supreme Court which treated the case as a simple question of fact &mdash; had the children been unlawfully retained in the UK while an Irish Court was hearing guardianship proceedings?  As the answer to this question was yes, the Supreme Court remitted the proceedings back to the UK where the main proceedings are being heard. The advice available to me is that as far as Irish law is concerned the case has no wider implications. However, as indicated in the House on several occasions in response to Questions, my Department is keeping the operation of the law in this general area under ongoing review.</P>

	<P>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 provides that the details of all convicted sex offenders be recorded on a sex offenders register. The requirement to register is just one component of the external monitoring of convicted sex offenders. The register is the property of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is not available to the public. In exceptional circumstances, such as where the Garda&iacute; are aware of an immediate or serious threat from a particular individual, they may decide to disclose the name of that individual to persons on a strict need to know basis.</P>
        <P>In November 2006, a Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the UK was signed in relation to the sharing of information on convicted sex offenders travelling between Ireland and our neighbouring jurisdictions. I intend to place this on a statutory basis in a Sexual Offences Bill currently being prepared in my Department. In that context, the operation of the sex offenders register is being examined to identify ways it can be made more relevant and expanded.  I have no plans, at this time, to allow for unrestricted public access to the register, as envisaged in &lsquo;Megan&rsquo;s law&rsquo; type legislation.</P>

        <Quest> his views on introducing a VAT reduction, exemption or refund for community voluntary groups purchasing emergency life saving medical equipment and supplies such as defibrillators, oxygen and airway management equipment and so on in view of the important role these groups play in the community and the fact that many of these groups are wholly reliant on charitable donations to fund their work; and if <Col N="454"/>he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. In relation to the issue of applying an exemption of reducing VAT rates for a certain category of consumer, the position is that the rate of VAT which applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the status of the consumer. It would not be possible to reduce or remove VAT on goods purchased by community voluntary groups.</P>
        <P>In relation to introducing a VAT refund the position is that charities and non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive. This means they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</P>
        <P>The tax code already treats charities in a favourable manner. The tax code currently provides exemption for charities from Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Capital Acquisitions Tax, Stamp Duty, Probate Tax, Dividend Withholding Tax and the uniform scheme of tax relief for donations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States. In the Irish context, these derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.</P>
        <P>While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, who are the deciding authority, have to date refused all such requests.  The Commission maintain that, in keeping with the EU Energy Tax Directive, Member States must apply at least the EU minimum rates of excise on fuels in such circumstances and that any further favourable excise treatment is not allowable. In this regard the Commission&rsquo;s decision was published on its website in March 2007. At the Commission&rsquo;s behest my officials have indicated that <Col N="455"/>Ireland will avail of the forthcoming Finance Bill to make the necessary legislative changes to conform with the Directive.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, the relevant line Departments who have primary responsibility in this regard are, in conjunction with my Department, exploring alternative non-tax support mechanisms that could be put in place where appropriate to maintain the assistance currently being provided, subject of course to compatibility with EU State Aid requirements. In the interim the reduced rates applicable to fuel used will be maintained.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 to 101, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established in 2001 to meet as much as possible of the costs of social welfare and public service pensions from 2025 when these costs are projected to increase dramatically due to the ageing of the population. Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission controls and manages the National Pensions Reserve Fund. The Commission has discretionary authority to determine the Fund&rsquo;s investment strategy in accordance with the Fund&rsquo;s statutory investment policy of securing the optimal total financial return provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the Commission.</P>
        <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 provides for the payment each year to the Fund from the Exchequer of a sum equal to 1% of GNP.  A total of &euro;15,184 million has been paid into the National Pensions Reserve Fund from the Exchequer to date. The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission publishes a valuation of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and a report on the Fund&rsquo;s performance quarterly. The market value of the Fund at end-September 2007 was &euro;21.26 billion.</P>
        <P>&euro;6,515 million was paid into the Fund from the Temporary Holding Fund for Superannuation Liabilities in 2001. This included 1% of GNP contributions in respect of 1999 and 2000, the proceeds of the sale of Telecom &Eacute;ireann (&euro;4,528 million) and the interest earned on those sums. The amounts paid over in respect of 2001 and subsequent years under the statutory requirement to pay over an amount equal to 1% of GNP were as follows:</P>

The amounts paid from my Department&rsquo;s Vote in respect of home travel and subsistence (which includes payments for any mileage) for the staff of sections of my Department which decentralised to Tullamore, were as set out in the table.  These amounts include payments in respect of mileage, subsistence and other related expenses, some of which would represent one off expenditure relating to the initial transition period.  As regards overtime, the amount spent on certain administration services which, prior to decentralisation, had been met from a central business unit for the Department cannot be disaggregated in the time available.</P>

        <P FLI="0">With regard to Newcastlewest all the work that was carried out prior to decentralisation was not completely carried over to the new decentralised location until very recently and allied to this the nature of work has changed somewhat. Consequently a direct comparison is not possible.  The Office of Public Works currently has 23 posts in the OPW Advance Office in Claremorris, which commenced operations on 10th September 2007.  At this stage it is too early to analyse the comparative costs associated with mileage and overtime.</P>

        <Quest> if the proposals contained in budget 2008 relating to the claw-back of stamp duty by first time buyers who cease to be owner-occupiers within two years of claiming relief or exemption for first-time buyers applies to first-time buyers who rented out their property before budget day; if a back dating of the proposal will be applied; the way a first time buyer who rents their property who availed of a lower stamp duty rate as opposed to a total exemption is treated if they have rented their property before the applicable cut-off date; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[34776/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>First-time buyers are treated favourably under the stamp duty code in recognition of the special circumstances of persons purchasing their first home.  Preferential rates and thresholds were afforded to first-time buyers up until the Finance (No. 2) Act 2007, which introduced a full exemption from stamp duty for first-time buyers on the purchase of new or second-hand dwelling houses or apartments.  There is also a full exemption available for other owner-occupying purchasers of new dwelling houses or apartments under 125m<?oasys _cf7- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>.  In addition, partial relief is also available to owner-occupying purchasers of new dwelling houses or apartments over 125m<?oasys _cf7- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>.</P>
        <P>In order to restrict these three stamp duty reliefs to persons who reside in the property, purchasers were required to declare that they will reside in the property for a defined period of five years.  Where any rent is derived from the property concerned before the expiration of this period, other than under the rent-a-room scheme, the stamp duty relief was clawed back.  This claw-back period was reduced from five to two years from Budget day.  This change applied to persons who purchased property from Budget day and for <Col N="461"/>those persons who had purchased before this time but had not let out their property.  There is no back-dating of this provision.</P>
        <P>Where first-time buyer&rsquo;s relief is clawed-back, the purchaser is liable to stamp duty at the normal rates that would have been liable at the time of purchase.  In this respect, where a person received a full exemption from stamp duty under the current rules, they would be liable to pay the full amount.  However, where a person paid a reduced level of stamp duty the claw-back would only be chargeable on the difference between the amount that was paid and the amount that should have been paid at the time.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The HSE (and before 2005 the health boards) has undertaken a substantial programme of work in recent years to improve data quality of the GMS client database.  For example, in 2003 and 2004, work carried out by the health boards led to deletion of approximately 104,000 inappropriate entries where, for example, there were duplicate entries for the same person, the expiry date on the card had passed, or the person had moved away or was deceased.  This exercise did not involve any reduction in the actual number of persons who held medical cards but rather resulted in a more accurate picture of the number of individuals in receipt of GP services under the GMS Scheme.</P>

In December 2006, a revised employment ceiling for the health service of 108,000 expressed in whole time equivalents was sanctioned, representing an increase of 10,450 over the previous approved ceiling. The ceiling was further increased to 108,285 in October 2007.  There has also been a substantial expansion of training places available at undergraduate level across a range of health care professions in order to ensure an ongoing supply of personnel in sufficient numbers for our health services into the future.</P>
        <P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy. My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>Sildenafil Citrate (Viagra) and Cialis are licensed in Ireland and reimbursable under the GMS and community drugs schemes.  In order to ensure availability for genuine need, but to reduce the possibility of inappropriate usage, the maximum reimbursable level for Sildenafil Citrate (Viagra) under all schemes is four <Col N="465"/>tablets per month.  This is in accordance with the findings of the Expert Group set up by my Department in October, 1998 to consider arrangements for the supply of Sildenafil Citrate (Viagra).  The maximum reimbursable level for Cialis is also four tablets per month.</P>

The initiative is designed to ensure that private beds in public hospitals are freed up for the use of public patients by having co-located private hospital beds built on public hospital sites.  Successful bid<Col N="466"/>ders for 6 co-location sites have been selected and University College Hospital Galway is not among these sites.  Expressions of interest were received from private consortia wishing to become involved in this initiative at University College Hospital Galway.

A UK preliminary study on &lsquo;Uninsured Driving in the United Kingdom&rsquo; published in June 2004 has recommended that insurance of the individual driver rather than insurance of the vehicle should continue to be the basis for third party liability cover in the UK.</entry>

	<P>The headquarters of the Road Safety Authority (RSA) is in Ballina and there is a staff complement of 129 posts there.  Some 67 of these 129 posts came from an existing decentralised location. The Government decision to establish <Col N="474"/>the RSA resulted in 62 additional posts being located in Ballina. These 62 posts were secured under the decentralisation programme from the Ballina CAF, open recruitment and internal promotion. The holders of these posts transferred directly to Ballina on assignment. Mileage and overtime paid since decentralisation is a matter for the RSA.</P>
        <P>50 posts were also decentralised to Loughrea &mdash; 10 of these are Department of Transport posts and the remaining 40 are RSA posts. The cost of overtime and mileage for these 50 posts amounted to &euro;17,502.93 and &euro;64,250.49 respectively for the year prior to decentralisation to Loughrea.</P>
        <P>Following decentralisation, the cost of the Department&rsquo;s posts in Loughrea in respect of overtime and mileage amounts to &euro;5,246.90 and &euro;9,567.22 respectively. Mileage and overtime paid since decentralisation in respect of the RSA posts in Loughrea is a matter for that Authority.</P>

	<P>The following is the information requested by the Deputy.  &euro;780.45 (inc VAT) annual hosting fee for the Transport 21 website was paid in July 07.  This includes payment in advance for this service up to July 08.  This is normal practice with a website hosting company.</P>
        <P>While my Department operates a system of making monthly grant payments in advance to the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) from Subheads C2 and C3 based on the Agency&rsquo;s estimate of its funding requirements for the month in question, I understand from the RPA that it has not paid in advance for works or services that will not be commenced before the end of the 2007 financial year.</P>
        <P>Since the launch of Transport 21, the RPA has not had recourse to new borrowings and the system of advancing monthly grant payments to the Agency is therefore necessary to ensure that the RPA is in a position to meet its financial obligations for works and services as they fall due.</P>
        <P>In relation to agencies, the issue of payments in advance for works or services, is an operational matter for each individual agency and not a matter for my Department.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is Irish Aid&rsquo;s Headquarters, will decentralise to Limerick. Good progress has been made and personnel have either been assigned to, or identified for, 103 posts or approximately 83% of the 124 posts scheduled to be decentralised. An advance party of 55 staff decentralised to interim office premises in Limerick at the end of May 2007. The remainder will move on a phased basis during the first half of 2008 on completion and fit-out of the permanent premises in Henry Street. </P>
        <P>The cost of mileage paid to the holders of the 55 posts that have already decentralised, in the 12 month period from May 2006 to May 2007, was <Col N="476"/>&euro;2,645. The corresponding amount paid from May 2007 to date was &euro;21,033. The increase in mileage costs since May 2007 is mainly due to travel between the interim office in Limerick and the existing Headquarters in Dublin. It is expected that such mileage costs will be reduced considerably following the transfer of the remaining staff of Irish Aid in 2008.</P>
        <P>The amount of overtime paid to the holders of these 55 posts in the twelve month period from 1 June 2006 to 31 May 2007 was &euro;15, 781. The amount of overtime paid since 1 June 2007 to the end of November 2007 was &euro;11,388. Overtime incurred in preparing for the advance move in May is included in the amount for this latter period.</P>

        <P>The following business units/Offices of my Department have been selected as part of the Decentralisation Programme and will be relocated in the new decentralised office:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Companies Registration Office/Registry of Friendly Societies</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Insolvency Payments Section</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The OPW has advised my Department that they anticipate that construction of the Permanent Office in Carlow, subject to no planning issues arising, will commence in June 2008 and completion of construction of the permanent office is expected by December 2009. In order to accommodate staff who wish to move earlier than the projected building completion date of late 2009, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, opened an advance office in Carlow on July 30th 2007.

<P el="10"><i>Agency Decentralisation</i></P>
        <P>Under the current Government Decentralisation Programme, four of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department are due to decentralise as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S is to move 383 posts to Birr, Co. Offaly;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Enterprise Ireland (EI) is to move 300 posts to Shannon;The Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny, and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The National Standards Authority of Ireland is to move 132 posts to Arklow, Co. Wicklow.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My Department continues to provide advice and support to each of the four Agencies in progressing their decentralisation programmes and there is a dedicated Agency Decentralisation Committee to drive the process forward.  In addition, I am satisfied that each Agency is fully engaged in the process and taking all of the relevant steps to advance their decentralisation plans.  The cost of mileage and overtime paid to Agency staff is a day-to-day operational matter for the four agencies concerned and one in which I have no function or responsibility.</P>
<P el="10"><i>F&Aacute;S</i></P>
        <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, F&Aacute;S is due to transfer its head office including some 383 posts to Birr, County Offaly.  F&Aacute;S currently has 21 staff members working in leased F&Aacute;S Offices in Birr.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Enterprise Ireland</i></P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland (EI) is to move 300 posts to Shannon under the decentralisation programme. Progress on the full transfer of EI&rsquo;s HQ to Shannon, within the Government decentralisation programme, will be influenced by factors (many exogenous to EI) such as; the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by CAF applicants and by progress made during discussions at a central level on various issues central to Agency decentralisation. To date, no posts have moved to Shannon under this scheme.</P>
        <P>Latest figures available to EI from the Central Applications Facility reflect that no Enterprise Ireland staff have applied for decentralisation to Enterprise Ireland in Shannon. The number of applications received from within the civil and public service amounts to 25.</P>
        <P>EI now has a major presence in the Shannon region. EI has established its new National <Col N="480"/>Regional Development Headquarters in Shannon and has established the County Enterprise Support Unit in Shannon. Currently there are 40 staff working in EI&rsquo;s Shannon office and it is expected that a total of approximately 65 EI staff will be in place in Shannon over the coming months</P>
<P el="10"><i>Health and Safety Authority</i></P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny. To date a total of 62 people (11 HSA staff, 41 Civil Servants, 10 Public Servants) have expressed an interest through the Central Application Facility (CAF) process in transferring to Thomastown, County Kilkenny.</P>
        <P>In anticipation of the move to Thomastown, the Authority established an interim office in Kilkenny city in August 2006.  To date, 27 staff have re-located to that office.  That office is now fully occupied and discussions are currently on-going with a view to securing larger office space in the area.  All staff that move to the Kilkenny office will transfer to Thomastown when those premises are completed and all newly recruited Dublin based staff are ultimately contracted to move to Thomastown.</P>

	<P>To date my Department has transferred 70 posts to temporary accommodation in Fossa Killarney.  The transfers took place in two tranches with 45 posts transferring in September 2006 and a further 25 in July 2007.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to make direct comparisons in relation to mileage and overtime costs between the holders of the posts in question, prior to decentralisation and afterwords, as a number of these posts have been reconfigured to allow for effective management of the process.</P>
        <P>However it is estimated that between October 2006 and October 2007 my Department&rsquo;s mileage costs increased by &euro;15,000 due mainly to decentralisation.  Overtime costs in the same period are estimated to have increased by &euro; 14,000 due to decentralisation.</P>
        <P>As the state agencies under the aegis of my Department namely F&aacute;ilte Ireland, The Sports Council, and the Arts Council have not been given early mover status by the DIG (Decentralisation Implementation Group) no timeframe has been given for their decentralisation. Therefore no transfers have taken place to date. The Office of Public Works (OPW) is currently assessing a number of options regarding suitable locations and properties for these agencies.</P>

	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season.  Fuel allowances are paid from end-September to mid-April. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person&rsquo;s normal heating expenses.</P>
        <P>A detailed review of the fuel allowance was carried out in 1998.  This review looked at alternatives to the weekly payment method including a single lump sum payment. A survey of recipients with the allowance on a customer panel showed that the majority (58%) preferred weekly payment, 22% wanted a once-off lump sum payment, 12% favoured direct debit to a supplier while 8% would rather have two lump sum payments during the fuel season.  The review recommended continuing with the weekly payment method.</P>
        <P>I will keep all aspects of the fuel allowance scheme, including the issue of a lump sum payment, under review.  Any significant changes to the scheme that would require additional expenditure could only be considered within a budgetary context and in the light of resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.	</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 151 together.</P>
        <P>Illness Benefit, which was known as Disability Benefit prior to 2nd October 2006, is a payment for insured people who cannot work due to illness. Annual Statistics in relation to the number of recipients of Illness Benefit are published annually by my Department in the form of a report entitled Statistical Information on Social Welfare Services, which is available on request from my Department or at our website, www.welfare.ie . Statistics in relation to the Labour Force are available from the Central Statistics Office.</P>
        <P>Illness Benefit is just one of a range of illness and disability related payments offered by my Department, each of which has different medical, social insurance and means related requirements. These requirements are tailored to the particular objectives of each scheme and also to the segments of the population for which they provide income support. Similarly, other OECD countries have illness and disability related schemes in place which have very different eligibility requirements and provide support to different categories of the population. For example, many OECD countries have statutory sick pay schemes in place which place a burden on the employer, whereas Ireland does not. Therefore, it is not appropriate to compare the number of recipients of Illness Benefit in Ireland with that of other OECD countries because those schemes do not have the same eligibility criteria and, therefore, no conclusions can be drawn from the results of any such comparison.</P>

	<P>In order to qualify for a range of Social Welfare payments, including Child Benefit, applicants are required to satisfy the Habitual Residence condition (HRC), which was introduced on 1st May 2004. Since 1st January 2007, when Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU, nationals of those countries, who were not previously registered with the Department of Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform, are required to have a Work Permit issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment in order to be legally employed in Ireland. </P>
        <P>The person referred to has indicated that she worked illegally since her arrival in Ireland in June 2006 until her child was born in July 2007. She has never had a work permit and does not appear to have been registered with the Dept of Justice prior to January 1st 2007.</P>
        <P>She has a partner who is also a Romanian national.  He claims to have been resident in Ireland since September 2004 per information <Col N="487"/>supplied by the claimant with the Child Benefit application.  She also indicates that he had been working illegally in Ireland until December 2006, but is not currently employed due to an incapacity.  He has never had a work permit and does not appear to have been registered with the Dept of Justice prior to January 1st 2007.</P>
        <P>The Child Benefit application has been refused as the Deciding Officer, having considered all the circumstances, does not consider that the person concerned can be considered to satisfy the HRC condition at this time.

While there are, in the more developed rural areas, either hackney or taxi services, these are at the discretion of the providers of these services and do not provide a guaranteed service to rural people.  </P>
        <P>It was against this background, therefore, that earlier this year &mdash; following a number of discussions between officials in my Department and the Department of Transport &mdash; I introduced a new evening transport service, on a pilot basis. The aim of the service is to allow rural people to fully participate in the various activities &mdash; community, sporting and social &mdash; that take place in their areas.  The new Scheme also aims to address <Col N="488"/>the market failure that currently exists in this area.</P>
        <P>The 34 groups currently delivering the Rural Transport Programme &mdash; operated by the Department of Transport &mdash; were invited by Pobal to submit applications to be considered under my Department&rsquo;s new scheme.  Following the appraisal of the proposals submitted, seven groups were selected to run the pilot Scheme, namely:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />West Cork Rural Transport;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Avondhu Development Group in East Cork;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Meath Accessible/Kilnaleck Community Cavan;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />County Sligo LEADER Partnership;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Tumna Shannon Development Company Roscommon;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />S&iacute;ob Teoranta Donegal; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Laois Trip.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The seven projects were selected having regard to such criteria as:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />evidence of need;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />strength of their proposal;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />capacity of the group;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />value for money; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />geographical spread.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The budget for the pilot is &euro;500,000.  The first service commenced in June and service numbers and passenger numbers have increased throughout the Autumn.  Although only in the early stages yet, I understand that the services are being very well received by communities and passengers alike.  In this context, the Deputies should note that during the month of October, there were 154 services with 1,341 passenger journeys.</P>
        <P>Early indications are that older people, people with a disability and young people are particularly enthusiastic about the new services and new activities are being planned around the availability of services.  All services focus on maximising the general community good and I am, of course, conscious of the need to ensure that no displacement takes place of commercially viable existing services as a result of the introduction of the new scheme.  My intention is that the pilot Scheme will be reviewed after a year and decisions in relation to its future will be informed by the outcome of the evaluation.</P>

	<P>To date, 74 officers from my Department have transferred to an interim location in Tubbercurry, Co. Sligo and 10 officers to Na Forbacha, Galway.  While decentralisation is an on-going process the major part of this relocation took place in July and August 2006.</P>
        <P>Because of the turnover of staff and some re-organisation of Divisions as part of the decentralisation process, it is not possible to provide the comparative figures requested.  However, I can provide overtime and mileage figures for the Department as a whole for the years 2005  &mdash; before decentralisation was implemented, 2006 &mdash; when the main decentralisation process took place and to date in 2007 &mdash;  post-decentralisation. The figures are as follows:</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Overtime expenditure</i></P>
        <P el="5">2005: &euro;144,294</P>

        <P el="5">2007 to date: &euro;300,487</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The decentralisation of 30 posts by Foras na Gaeilge to Gaoth Dobhair is still at the planning stage and no staff have decentralised as yet.  The Pobal office in Clifden was opened early in 2006 and 22 posts were based there by the end of that year.  The majority of these posts were new to the organisation and all except 1 post was filled by way of local recruitment. Comparative figures are, therefore, not available. The total expenditure on travel for Clifden in 2006 was &euro;38,366. No overtime costs were incurred.</P>

	<P>In line with <Col N="490"/>Public Financial Procedures, the policy of my Department is to make payments on foot of matured liabilities, i.e., after goods or services have been received and found to be satisfactory or as otherwise provided for by contract.  In the case of agency services provided on behalf of the Department, payments may be made in advance of the end of the year in order to ensure the continued provision of services in the early part of the New Year.  This is done through a suspense account, with the amounts charged to the Department&rsquo;s Vote in the year in which the service was delivered.  I understand that in relation to the agencies under the ambit of my Department it is not practice to make payments in advance for works or services that will not be commenced before the end of the 2007 financial year.</P>

	<P>The funding available to Local Authorities from the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government (D/EHLG) for Local Improvement Scheme (L.I.S.) roads has increased significantly over the past number of years (from approximately &euro;11m in 2002 to  &euro;30m in 2007).  Funding for L.I.S. roads in Mayo increased from &euro;1.4m in 2005, &euro;3.2m in 2006 to just over &euro;4m in 2007.</P>
        <P>Consequently, this year my Department decided to place a greater emphasis on funding other measures such as water and sewerage schemes under the CL&Aacute;R Programme.  In this context, it should be noted that grant approvals for Mayo County Council in 2002 for water and sewerage schemes was &euro;450,000.  Approvals in 2007 are in excess of &euro;2.3m.  At the end of November, I did, however, announce &euro;500,000 funding for works to be carried out on 39 L.I.S. roads in CL&Aacute;R areas in County Mayo.</P>
        <P>Finally, it should be noted that the total funding made available between my Department and the D/EHLG for L.I.S. roads nationally in 2007 has increased by almost 6% from that available in 2006.</P>

This Directive was discussed at Coreper on 12 December but failed to reach agreement on two issues, and referred discussions on these two articles to the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting next week.</P>
        <P>The process for reaching agreement on these proposals involves the Co-decision procedure between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  The European Parliament has already voted on this Directive at its first reading and has made 122 amendments to the text.  Should there be political agreement at Council next week, the text will then be forwarded to the Parliament to initiate discussions between the Council and Parliament with a view to achieving a common position on the text of the Directive.  These second reading discussions are likely to commence in April 2008.</P>
        <P>The Directive, when agreed, will be transposed into Irish law by way of a Statutory Instrument within the prescribed time limits.  The proposed Directive was discussed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food on 2 November 2006.</P>

	<P>To the end of November, 253 posts have decentralised to my Department&rsquo;s offices in Portlaoise.  Both travel and overtime costs are tracked by the use of cost centres, which are allocated to Divisions of the Department, and on an individual basis.</P>
        <P>The Department is implementing decentralisation on phased basis, transferring posts and staff over the course of the programme.  This phasing extends to a Divisional level, staffing and moving sections of Divisions over a period of time, which facilitates skills and knowledge transfer and mitigates the risk inherent in the move.  Therefore it is not possible to present the information requested using cost centres, as they are not directly attributable to groups of staff in a particular location, but in a particular work area.</P>
        <P>To present the information requested on an individual basis would require a detailed examination of individual records of the current and past holders of the 253 posts over the period 2005 to 2007 and would require considerable resources.  However, the Department sends a quarterly return to the Decentralisation Implementation Group, which details the non-property costs of decentralisation, including costs such as travel and overtime.  To the end of the last quarter, these costs amounted to &euro;53,922.</P>

	<P>The only payments made in advance relate to Information Communications Technology (ICT).  My Department uses an extensive range of ICT hardware and software products, to underpin its key operations.  Some of these are off-the-shelf and some are tailored.  These hardware and software products require ongoing support and enhancement, to ensure their satisfactory operation and modification to meet ongoing changes to business needs.  By the end of 2007, my Department will have paid for a range of enhancement, support and maintenance services, to be delivered during 2008.  These are <Col N="495"/>set out in the attached table.  Telecommunications costs including both voice and data capacity, with the exception of call charges, are also paid for in advance.</P>
        <P>In the case of some of these services the only contractual option available is to pay in advance.  In the case of others, it is more beneficial to the <Col N="496"/>Department to do so.  As part of composite billing, my Department has also paid two days (1st and 2nd January 2008) line and equipment rental to Eircom Virtual Private Network (VPN) account service.  With regard to agencies under the aegis of my Department, payment for works or services are operational matters for the bodies themselves.</P><Col N="495"/>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category B.  Category B caters for farmers who made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000-2002.  Investments can include purchase or long-term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.  The person named applied under Category B (iv) in relation to other investments but he was deemed ineligible under this category, as he did not submit the required documentation in support of the investments made.</P><Col N="498"/>
        <P>The person named subsequently appealed against this decision and submitted additional documentation in support of his appeal.  In all such cases, the procedure is that all contentions put forward in support of an appeal are first of all reviewed within my Department to see whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant any change to the original decision.  In this case, the documentation was examined by my Department but did not provide grounds to alter the original decision.</P>
        <P>This case has since been forwarded to the Single Payments Appeals Committee who will carry out a full review of the case and will correspond directly with the person named following the outcome of their review.</P>

	<P>An application for the transfer of entitlements under the 2007 Single <Col N="499"/>Payment Scheme to the person named was submitted on 4 April 2007.  During processing of the transfer application it was necessary for an official of my Department to write to the person named requesting specific legal documentation.

Payment in respect of 108.26 standard entitlements transferred to the person named by Inheritance will issue shortly.</P>

	<P>The position is that an application for the Transfer of Single Payment Entitlements to the person named was submitted on 24 April 2007.  As the person named is not a registered herd owner, it is not possible to process the application.  An official from my Department wrote to the person named on two occasions outlining the position and also requesting specific legal documentation in the event that the person named became a registered herd owner.</P>

The legal representative of the person named was advised that further documentation to clarify ownership of the entitlements is necessary.</P>
        <P>Upon receipt of satisfactory information, my Department will process the application to transfer the entitlements and will be in direct contact with the person named.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 175 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department provides a range of teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs, including children with Down&rsquo;s Syndrome.  The precise level of support is determined by the special educational needs of the particular child.</P>
        <P>Children with Down&rsquo;s Syndrome are entitled to additional provision in school, either under the terms of the general allocation system of teaching supports if the child&rsquo;s assessment places the child in the high incidence disability category or through an allocation of additional resources if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department&rsquo;s circular.</P>
        <P>In circumstances where a Down&rsquo;s Syndrome child has other associated needs and would fall into the low incidence disability categories, this may automatically attract an individual resource teaching allocation.  The number of additional teaching hours allocated would range from three to five hours per week depending on the pupil&rsquo;s special educational needs including the level of general learning disability.  Applications for such support should be referred to the local Special Educational Needs Organiser SENO by the school.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> the incentives available from her Department for persons returning <Col N="501"/>to full-time education to complete the leaving certificate and who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[34662/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has put the resources and supports in place to ensure that there is a wide range of course options available in the Further and Higher Education sectors for people who wish to return to education later in life.  The priority target group of Further Education programmes generally is those who are disadvantaged and who lack basic skills. For this reason, incentives for persons returning to full-time education to complete the Leaving Certificate are confined to recipients of social welfare payments. Financial incentives are not available to people who are not in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>However, tuition and books and materials are provided free of charge or at nominal cost.  People who have not completed upper second-level education are one of the target groups of the Further Education service.  I would be keen to encourage people to return to education to complete a Leaving Certificate course.  The adult education services, which are financed by my Department and delivered locally by VECs, are geared to the needs of adults who wish to do so.  For example, the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) is aimed primarily at adults who have not completed upper second-level education. This initiative is being provided on a part-time basis.</P>
        <P>A key aim of this arrangement is to increase the flexibility and responsiveness of the system (e.g provision in the mornings, night-time, weekends etc. as needed, in a way which enables learners to pursue individual modules and accumulate credits towards full awards in line with their needs). The eligibility criteria for participation in the BTEI have recently been amended to allow free tuition to any adult with less than upper second level education. Childcare support is available to BTEI learners.</P>
        <P>Persons considering returning to full-time education should contact the Adult Education Officer of the local vocational education committee to find out what courses and supports are available to them.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Summer Works Scheme was introduced in 2004. Since then, over 3,000 projects costing in excess of <Col N="502"/>&euro;300 million have been completed. Considerable extra investment has been provided in the Budget to increase funding for school buildings to almost &euro;600 million next year. With so many small projects having been completed over the past few years, I intend to focus on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008. There will not, therefore, be a new Summer Works Scheme as part of our building programme next year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 and 179 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with special needs, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who have received additional training in autism, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. As each child with autism is unique it is important that teachers can draw from a range of interventions, including ABA, so their pupils&rsquo; broader needs can be met.</P>
        <P>In excess of 275 autism-specific classes have now been sanctioned around the country, including North Dublin, by my Department in conjunction with National Council Special Education (NCSE).  The NCSE will sanction additional classes as required.  These classes are funded in respect of teacher and special needs assistant salaries and receive grants for equipment and significantly enhanced rates of capitation.  In addition, my Department has invested significantly in the provision of autism-specific training courses for teachers of these classes.</P>
        <P>My Department does not provide grants for parents who choose to home educate their children outside of the school system or who wish to establish their own schools outside the normal school processes.  My Department does provide <Col N="503"/>grants, through the home tuition scheme, to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the facility in question has sought inclusion in an expanded pilot scheme which funds a number of facilities for children with autism. This scheme was established in the absence of a network of school-based special classes for children with autism. The Programme for Government commits to the long-term funding for the centres that are currently in the ABA pilot scheme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable the Department to support them as primary schools <Col N="504"/>for children with autism. I am pleased to advise that the issue is being actively progressed.</P>
        <P>In terms of autism provision in other locations, we will continue to work to ensure that all children can have access to a broad programme, with provision for ABA as appropriate, in special classes.</P>

        <Quest> her views on criticisms in relation to Department circular 0044/2007; and her further views on the NCCA&rsquo;s proposals regarding language and literacy in Irish-medium primary schools. </Quest>
        <QRef>[34741/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Circular 0044/2007 relates to Language and Literacy in the infant classes in Irish medium schools. It requires such schools to implement arrangements under which minimum timeframes set out in the curriculum are provided for, and the introduction of English as a second language is not delayed beyond the start of the second term in junior infant classes.</P>
        <P>The revised primary curriculum was launched in 1999 after extensive consultation with the partners in education.  Page 27 in the Introduction to <Col N="505"/>the Curriculum states &ldquo;It is a particular feature of Irish primary education that children, from the beginning of schooling, have experience of language learning in two languages.&rdquo; It also sets out a suggested minimum weekly time framework for tuition. This provides that where a first language is being taught, there should be four hours instruction per week, and 3 hours per week where there is a shorter day for the infant classes. Where a second language is being taught, the suggested minimum timeframe is 3.5 hours per week, and 2.5 hours per week for infant classes with a shorter day.</P>
        <P>Some time ago my Department sought the advice of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on issues relating to emergent literacy in Irish medium schools. The NCCA produced a series of reports on the matter, including a consultation paper, a literature review of research, and a report on the consultation process. The Council presented its final advice in February 2007.</P>
        <P>Having considered the advice in full, I have determined as a public policy issue that the position as set out in the curriculum, and in previous Parliamentary Questions, should remain unchanged i.e that the minimum recommended timeframe set out for a second language in the curriculum should be adhered to. The fundamental issue in this case concerns upholding the rights of all children to access the full curriculum from the earliest possible stage.  The Circular on this issue is now the subject of a legal challenge in the High Court, and it would not be appropriate to make any further comments about the matter.</P>

	<P>Payments in advance for works and services are made in the ordinary course of Departmental business in certain circumstances under public financial procedures. These can arise for a variety of reasons and include advance funding to the Office of Public Works for building projects and other prepayments. The annual appropriation account includes details of all such payments as at the 31st December in each financial year. The work in compiling prepayment information for the current financial year will commence in January 2008 and conclude in March 2008.  The appropriation account which is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General is published in September of each year and reflects the financial position including advance and prepayments as at the previous 31st of December. To undertake the compilation of this information outside of the appropriation account work programme would involve a disproportionate amount of resources.</P>

        <P>I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that one of the current building and refurbishment projects in County Kildare is the construction of a new Garda Station at Leixlip; this is progressing well and is due for completion in 2008.  Extensive improvement works to Celbridge Garda Station are nearing completion and works are planned for Castledermot and Clane Garda Stations in 2008.  Major funding of the Garda Building Programme will continue with &euro;260 million from the National Development Plan.  The Garda authorities are working on the development of a strategic, multi-annual development plan as recommended in the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s third report.  In addition, an annual maintenance budget is provided in the Garda Vote for the upkeep of stations including those in County Kildare.</P>

The Small Area Population Statistics, published by the Central Statistics Office and based on the 2006 Census, are currently being analysed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Apart from demographics, the allocation of additional personnel is also determined by a number of factors including crime trends, other operational policing needs and priorities.  The allocation of Garda resources is monitored and reviewed on a continual basis.  When resources next become available, the policing needs of the Carlow / Kildare Division will be fully considered by the Garda Commissioner in the overall context of Garda Divisions throughout the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198, 206, 209, 210 and 212 together.</P>
        <P>I am advised by Garda management that in general terms there are two broad categories of organised crime groups operating in this jurisdiction.  The first category consists of individuals/<?oasys _jy ?>groups that are well established and tightly structured and are involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences. The second category involves groups whose activities are characterised by less cohesive group structures and are involved in criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland.</P>
        <P>The membership of organised gangs tends to be fluid and the nature of criminal activity is such that offences committed by members of gangs may or may not be connected with the individual&rsquo;s membership of such gangs.  It is therefore not possible, without the expenditure of an inordinate amount of time and resources, to attribute specific figures to the membership or activity of such gangs.</P>
        <P>Organised criminal gangs operating in this jurisdiction are targeted on an ongoing basis by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and profiles regarding the personnel of such groups are continually updated.  Their members, operating methods, criminal <Col N="513"/>interests and financial assets are likewise proactively targeted through the use of intelligence-led operations which are   primarily undertaken by specialist units of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na acting under the remit of the Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services.  A number of organised crime groups have been successfully targeted in this manner recently with firearms and drugs being recovered.  This has led to a number of people from these organised groups being prosecuted and convicted before the Courts.</P>
        <P>In November 2005 the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation was set up to combat the growth of organised crime, and in particular armed criminal gangs.  This Unit has been expanded and now comprises of 70 members working full time to proactively target the various criminal groups throughout the city.  The Unit continues to work closely with other specialist units including the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Special Detective Unit / Emergency Response Unit in targeting those suspected of involvement in organised criminal activity.</P>
        <P>The National Bureau of Criminal Investigation is also closely involved in Operation &lsquo;Anvil&rsquo;, particularly within the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  Local initiatives under Operation &lsquo;Anvil&rsquo; are now in place in all regions nationwide in order to address more comprehensively at a national level increases in violent crime.  This operation has successfully targeted a number of criminals gangs involved in gun crime.  Operation &lsquo;Anvil&rsquo; commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in 2005 and was extended nationally during 2006.  It is an intelligence-led policing initiative, the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity, through extensive additional overt patrolling, static checkpoints, by uniform mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain-clothes patrols, in conjunction with other, covert, operations.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau has been successful in identifying, targeting and seizing funds accumulated by criminals, thus depriving them of the profits of their criminal activity.  A dedicated unit within the Garda National Drugs Unit has been established to liaise with the Criminal Assets Bureau to target those criminals and criminal groupings believed to be deriving profits and assets from drug-related criminal activity.  The multi-unit, integrated approach adopted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reflects best international practice and continues to use, in a coordinated manner, specialist resources and available criminal legislation to its fullest extent.  Operations are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure their effectiveness.</P>
        <P>Within the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Anti-Racketeering Unit is involved <Col N="514"/>in the prevention and detection of this type of criminal activity on a national basis.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na complies with the provisions of Section 34 of the Private Security Services Act, 2004 in that it provides information on applicants for a licence to the Private Security Authority on request.  While there have been instances where persons involved in the security industry have been charged with criminal offences, there is no evidence to support the view that there is any orchestrated infiltration of security industry.</P>
        <P>The Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation has carried out a number of investigations where organised crime groups have used employees of financial institutions to obtain data to enable them to commit fraud.  Such groups have also used members of their group to gain employment in financial institutions for the same purpose.  There is no substantive intelligence to indicate that organised criminal groups have infiltrated the financial services area from a money-laundering perspective.  However, there is substantive evidence to indicate that these groups are prone to use alternative banking systems and cash &lsquo;couriers&rsquo; to transport large amounts of cash out of the jurisdiction thus avoiding the use of conventional banking systems.</P>
        <P>In this respect, current legislation, Section 38(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, empowers a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or Customs Officer to seize and detain cash which is being imported or exported from the State if the amount is greater than the prescribed sum (&euro;6,250) and there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it directly or indirectly represents the proceeds of, or is intended by any person for use in, drug trafficking.  Furthermore EU Regulation 1889/05, which came into force in June 2007, requires a declaration by any person importing or exporting cash from the EU above a prescribed amount (&euro;10,000) to an official from the appropriate Customs Authority.  Where information comes into the possession of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicating the involvement of criminals in the type of activity suggested in the question it is subject of thorough investigation.</P>
        <P>In terms of Irish criminals operating in foreign jurisdictions, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works closely with International law enforcement agencies in targeting the activities of these individuals and the offices of Europol are used extensively to coordinate the exchange of intelligence in the targeting of these criminals.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has liaison officers posted in a number of European countries including London, Paris, and Madrid, in addition to officers posted to the Hague and Europol.  It is the function of these staff to liaise with the police and judicial authorities in those and neighbouring jurisdictions in the context of serious and organised criminal activity with an Irish dimension.  Garda management continue to review operational activities to ensure that the <Col N="515"/>most effective response to criminal activity is in place and to counter new and emerging trends.</P>

	<P>I am satisfied that there is effective ongoing co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and police forces in other jurisdictions which is facilitated and enhanced through Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the activities of Europol and Interpol.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to target the activities of criminal gangs involved in drug trafficking at home and abroad in cooperation with other international law enforcement agencies.  This is achieved through several means including conducting targeted operations against individuals and organisations operating within this jurisdiction with known linkages to international drug traffickers, including Irish Nationals residing abroad, and exchanging strategic and operation intelligence with foreign law enforcement agencies, including Europol and Interpol.</P>
        <P>In order to facilitate the exchange of information and intelligence on criminal matters including drug-trafficking, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has Liaison Officers posted in a number of locations throughout Europe, as well as officers on secondment to Europol and Interpol.</P>
<P>In June 2004 the President signed into Law the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Act which legislates for the competent authorities of two or more EU Member States to carry out criminal investigations with a cross-border dimension.  This legislation further enhances law enforcement agencies within Member States to carry out criminal investigations with an international perspective.</P>
        <P>In September 2007, I signed an Agreement formalising Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Marine Operations Analysis Centre (Narcotics) in Lisbon.  The purpose of the centre is to better enhance international cooperation in the suppression of illicit drug trafficking across the Atlantic towards Europe and the West African Seaboard.  The centre will collect and analyse operational information, enhance intelligence through better information exchange, and ascertain the availability of naval assets to facilitate interdictions in accordance with the national laws of the participants involved.</P>

	<P>With free movement of <Col N="518"/>persons within the European Union, in particular, it is difficult to assess the number of those suspected of involvement in criminal activity living overseas. Where information exists that a person, who is wanted in relation to a particular crime in this jurisdiction, is living abroad and where the particular legal requirements apply, surrender of the person  from the relevant Member State of the European Union or extradition from the relevant country are sought in accordance with the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 as amended or Part II of the Extradition Act 1965 as amended respectively.</P>
        <P>Currently there are 56 active requests for surrender in accordance with the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003. There are 4 active requests for extradition in accordance with Part II of the Extradition Act 1965.  In 2003 there were 23 extradition requests to the United Kingdom under the provisions of Part III of the Extradition Act 1965 and 8 cases are still outstanding. Part III of the Extradition Act 1965 has been repealed and there have been no Part III requests to the United Kingdom since 2003.</P>

	<P>Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.</P>
        <P>Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006. In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003. I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehen<Col N="519"/>sive.
