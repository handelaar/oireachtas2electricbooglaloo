      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems as if the Progressive Democrats has moved into primary position today.  This is the time of year in many parts of the world where people look at their lives and examine what it is we have done and what it is we have failed to do.  The T&aacute;naiste is in the right place at the right time.  Deputy Rabbitte commented yesterday that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s performance might be the last time he took leaders&rsquo; questions from that position.  It might be more relevant in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s case.</P>
        <P>I would like to ask him about a number of broken promises.  I could mention the promise to end hospital waiting lists by 2004, or the promise to spend taxpayers&rsquo; money wisely, when the country was given electronic machines and PPARS.  I could mention the broken promises in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s own portfolio, where, under his watch, murder is up by 43%, gun crime is up by 39% and rape is up by 25%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Wow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The only thing going down seems to be the detection rates.  The T&aacute;naiste pointed to an end to the revolving door system in prisons, yet 3,000 prisoners were let out of jail early in 2006.  I could ask him about all those promises, but I will not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Standing Order allows for one question on a topical issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; s&eacute; ag teacht.  I want to ask the T&aacute;naiste about the biggest promise he made.  This time five years ago, he gingerly climbed up a ladder on a lamppost in Ranelagh and said &ldquo;Single party Government?  No thanks.&rdquo;  It was one of the pictures of the decade.  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline what exactly he has done to prevent single party Government, given that there is an endless list of broken promises in which he was involved?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="502"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am deeply grateful to the Deputy for not asking all the other questions for which I was prepared.  I will answer the question for which I am totally unprepared, which is about what I have done to prevent single party Government.  The people of Ireland chose the Government on the last occasion, not me.  The people of Ireland will have the opportunity in the coming months to choose another Government.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Just like on the last occasion, I am absolutely confident that they will take a long, hard look at those benches and say &ldquo;No thanks&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>They will say &ldquo;Go now&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny will not be in a position to put questions to either the Taoiseach or myself after the election not because he will be on this side of the House, but because of other events.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that a punch line?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>People sometimes forget the situation that existed when the Deputy and a number of others around him were sitting at the Cabinet, while Deputy Rabbitte was sitting at the high chair of the Cabinet table as a half Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not want a history lesson from the T&aacute;naiste.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the year in which Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte collectively will be 50 years sitting in this House.  I have attended meetings throughout the country and asked audiences to name one achievement by either Deputy at any time in those 50 years.  Nobody can give me an answer.</P>

	<P>What do the focus groups say about the T&aacute;naiste?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When asked on RTE radio last Sunday what he could point to in his career in politics that was an achievement for the Irish people, Deputy Kenny said he had improved the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>He kept it on the same date.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is hallucinating again, it is a serious condition.</P>

        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps Members of the Fine Gael Party will allow their leader to submit his question without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of the history lesson from the T&aacute;naiste.   In his previous political life, he was special adviser to a former Taoiseach, although he might not use that term.  We could talk about what happened in the 1980s, or even the 1970s and 1960s.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The time that Fine Gael doubled the national debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il trebled it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That is irrelevant to where we are now.  The T&aacute;naiste is the deputy leader of the Government.  As such, he is partly responsible for the 40,000 operations that were cancelled in the past two years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>He is partly responsible for the 29,000 people who cannot meet their consultants because of endless waiting lists.  He is partly responsible for the length of accident and emergency waiting times.  He is partly responsible for the failure of the Government to reduce class sizes, even though the Minister for Education and Science knows that more than 100,000 children are in classes of 30 and more.  He is partly responsible for bringing in the cross-compliance form for farmers, which has 1,460 boxes to be ticked.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, crows in Portlaoise about all the things he has done and will do.  That is the type of nonsense the Progressive Democrats speak in this House, giving us their legal lessons from the Four Courts.  The T&aacute;naiste is obviously worried and desperate if he is asking questions about Fine Gael at meetings throughout the State.  I do not know where these public meetings take place because there is no record of any of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fine Gael Party is holding s&eacute;ances in the evenings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In the midst of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s difficulties last year, it was the T&aacute;naiste who said behind his hand to him that they had managed to get through it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>They got away with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the T&aacute;naiste who put the poster on the pole with the message &ldquo;Single Party Government &mdash; No Thanks&rdquo;.  In the wake of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s difficulties, the T&aacute;naiste told the Irish people he would see to it that new ethics legislation would be introduced quickly in this House.  He said that to save his own bacon because of his <Col N="506"/>carry on and the fact that he desperately wanted to hold on to power.  The good lady beside him would not have acted that way and neither would her predecessor.  The T&aacute;naiste did so because he has a craving to be in power and in the limelight.  He does not understand that he above anyone else should see that commitments he has made to the public are honoured.</P>
        <P>Where is the new ethics legislation that he promised publicly to the people?  There are reports on this in today&rsquo;s newspapers.  I notice the T&aacute;naiste has to be advised by his Whip as to the status of his legislation.  It is like the answer the Taoiseach gave yesterday to Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s query about promised legislation, that it is somewhere along the corridor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is sad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste made a commitment in this regard.  Where is the legislation?  What are the issues in respect of which his party has prevented Fianna F&aacute;il from being a single party Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Kenny to give way to the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

	<P>The Cabinet approved the text of the Bill and Deputy Kenny knows it is coming.  He has merely rattled out a series of assertions.  There are questions he does not want asked &mdash; his only direct question to me was when this ethics legislation will be brought before the House.  It is the next legislation that will come before the Seanad shortly and it will come to this House thereafter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>When we were kicked out in 1997, more than 9% of people were unemployed.  That was better, however, than the 14.2% who were unemployed in 1992 when the Progressive Democrats Party was kicked out.  Deputy Kenny and I may have chalked up 50 years between us but the T&aacute;naiste would be well on the way to that number if his constituents had not given him a long holiday every time they saw his performance in this House.  I might have been on the high chair at the Cabinet but there is a good chance the T&aacute;naiste will get the high jump from the people once more, as has been his habitual record.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask the T&aacute;naiste about a file he received last year from the parents of children with special needs in Drogheda.  The organisation in question, Special Needs Active Parents, represents 64 families in Louth and a smaller number in Meath.  In this file, these parents set out that there are 139 children under six years of age and 350 between six and 18 years with spina bifida, cerebral palsy, autism and several other disabilities in their area.</P>
        <P>This file, which was sent to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, explains that these children cannot access occupational therapy and speech therapy service.  There is one occupational therapist, who was appointed only a year ago, to serve these children.  The need for these services is recognised by the HSE, which says there should be one occupational therapist per 15 children.  The reality, however, is that there is only one full-time occupational therapist for these 490 children and provision for a half day a week for another occupational therapist who sets up the special equipment.</P>
        <P>The file includes parents&rsquo; harrowing letters detailing how their children are affected.  One <Col N="508"/>child, for example, who is named and whose parents are willing to be named, was born on 18 February 2003 and diagnosed with spina bifida and hydrocephalus.  Since birth, he has received only four sessions of occupational therapy.  His parents state:</P>
        <P LI="1">Our children do not have time on their side and we, as totally worn out and frustrated parents, can only do so much.... A lot of us, myself included, have given up paid employment to be at home full time with our children.</P>
        <P>Did the T&aacute;naiste read the letters or any one of them and did he reply to them?  Has he taken any action in response to that file?  Can he explain why, given his view of us having more resources than we need, those parents are left in that limbo land without the services acknowledged by the HSE for their children with those particular disabilities?</P>

	<P>As the Deputy knows, one of the functions of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to take charge of the promotion in these Houses of the legislation which was necessary to deal with the disability area.  The Deputy will be aware that last year the Minister of State with particular responsibility for disabilities, Deputy Fahey, and I put in place the sectoral plans to deal with all aspects of disability and the statutory basis for all of those plans to be implemented.  Ireland has one of the most advanced laws on disability.  The entire disability sector was brought into a very lengthy process of consultation on how we would tackle the various facets of disability in our society.  We put through the disability legislation and the sectoral plans.  These were published and became the responsibility of individual Ministers with their own sectoral plans in each area. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The correspondence to which the Deputy refers would, of course, have gone to the equality section of my Department and would have been considered there by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and fed into the process which led to the disability legislation being enacted and the disability sectoral plans.  This year a sum of &euro;800 million, up 30% on previous funding, is being spent on special needs education.  This year we are increasing very substantially the number of occupational therapists in training.  As part of the overall expenditure in the health area, the Health Service Executive is getting major increased resources to deal with specific cases of the kind the Deputy mentioned, such as parents whose children are afflicted with the tragic condition of spina bifida.  We were speaking earlier about Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s comparison with ten years ago and Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s comparison with the unemployment rate of ten years ago.  If one considers what has been done in the lifetime of the two Governments, in which the current parties are partners, it is clear there has been a dramatic transformation.</P>

	<P>I think the Ceann Comhairle left out the word &ldquo;entertaining&rdquo; for our guests.  Last week, I and other Deputies tabled parliamentary questions to the T&aacute;naiste, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, because concerns had been raised with us about the role of garda&iacute; and former garda&iacute; in the car insurance business.  On Sunday, the T&aacute;naiste will know that a newspaper claimed to have strong evidence of the extent to which former garda&iacute;, or even serving garda&iacute;, are apparently accessing information about insurance claimants from Garda files and perhaps indeed from Government Departments.  I certainly hope this proves to be absolutely without foundation, as one insurance player has strenuously stated.</P>
        <P>If this does prove to be the case, however, does the T&aacute;naiste agree it would be in breach of the Data Protection Act and the Official Secrets Act?  If it is indeed the case, does the T&aacute;naiste also accept that the real victims are legitimate claimants whose entitlement to proper and full compensation will have been undermined by such actions?  We have a responsibility to recognise who the real victims are in this situation.  I pose these questions to try to help establish the full facts.  As I said, I hope it proves not to be the case but if it does then it will certainly be necessary to take important actions.</P>
        <P>In my parliamentary question I asked the T&aacute;naiste what procedures were in place to ensure that retired garda&iacute; do not misuse privileged information accessible to them while serving in the force, or access information covered by the data protection legislation.  In his reply, the T&aacute;naiste cited section 62 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  If he has the information to hand, I would like to know if any serving or former garda has ever been prosecuted under this legislation.</P>

	<P>I also had another question which did not elicit a response.  I asked whether concerns had been raised with the T&aacute;naiste about compliance by insurance companies or their agents with their legal obligations under the data protection legislation.  I also asked about specific contracts between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and individuals serving in the force, or former members of the force, with any particular insurance operation.  I understand that there is a special relationship concerning the recovery of vehicles involved in road traffic accidents in a pilot project that has been in place in part of the country for a number of years.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Does the T&aacute;naiste not think that this represents a special relationship with one player in the sector?  The pilot project is of several years standing and the declared intent of the Garda Commissioner is to roll it out across the State, if it proves useful and effective.  The project has not been lived up to or honoured, however.  Will the T&aacute;naiste tell the House what he knows to be the factual situation concerning all the matters I have raised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Deputy for asking me a question which was envisaged by the procedure under the rules of this House, unlike the last two questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is horrible, patronising arrogance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like the Deputy, I read the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> story&rsquo;s suggestion that serving and former members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had abused their positions to favour one insurance company by giving it access to information held within the force&rsquo;s official records.  When I read that story I was gravely concerned and in a moment I will tell the House the actions I took on foot of it.  First, however, I want to say that of course it would be a breach of the Official Secrets Act and the Data Protection Act for any garda to engage in that behaviour.  It would also be a breach of Garda discipline and simple, straightforward ethics for any garda to behave in that way.</P>
        <P>When I read that story, therefore, I regarded it as a matter of the utmost gravity.  When I saw the particular document on which the story was based, my concern rose because if that document were genuine one could only conclude that a very serious scandal had been in position for some time and was being exulted in by people who were party to it.  I contacted the Garda Commissioner and my Department has also had a number of contacts with the Commissioner.  The Garda Commissioner shares my view that the allegations in that article were of the utmost gravity concerning an abuse of position.  They will be treated as such and inquired into fully.</P>
        <P>In fairness to the insurance company in question &mdash; I am referring to the article in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>, with which I am most concerned &mdash; I should say that as far as I understand, it is claiming that the document is a forgery, was concocted to embarrass it and has no substance whatsoever.  Either it is a forgery or it is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a forgery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If it is not a forgery, then it is a matter of the utmost gravity.  If it is a forgery, then that is another matter of the utmost gravity, <Col N="515"/>but different inquiries will follow on foot of it.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s view that it would be entirely wrong for any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make any private company engaged in the insurance sector a party to information held by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, other than through officially sanctioned and conventional channels.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that it would be entirely wrong for any insurance company to enter into a financial arrangement with any serving member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for such information to be imparted to it.  I also share the Deputy&rsquo;s view that it would completely undermine fair competition in the insurance business, as well as undermining public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, if that situation were either true or tolerated.</P>
        <P>Either the documents in question are forgeries designed to bring about a major mischief, or genuine, in which case it implies that a significant issue of gross misbehaviour and gross abuse of office is recounted in those documents.  Whatever is the case, it will be dealt with as a matter of utmost gravity by the commissioner and me.  The commissioner has assured me that it will be dealt with as a matter that merits serious investigation and that we will not walk away from the issue without resolving it one way or another.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his full reply and the clarity of his response in terms of the commitment he and his office have made to establish the full facts and the truth of the situation, reflecting also on the intent of the commissioner&rsquo;s office.  Serious concerns have been raised in the article in question, concerns that reflect a variety of opinions expressed to Deputies, about the practice of insurance companies offering incentives to the legal representatives of claimants to recommend to their clients that they would settle for a sum less than might ordinarily be expected or which could, arguably, be their full entitlement.  Has this matter, which has serious ethical and legal implications for practitioners in the solicitors&rsquo; field, been raised with the Minister?  We have no evidence to support the claims made but, given the seriousness of the allegation, has the Minister had the opportunity this week to make inquiries as to whether evidence so exists and the steps he can and will take to address it?</P>
        <P>Everybody wants to see affordable insurance cover and a successful insurance industry sector to sustain that.  This is not about showing weakness in relation to those involved in fraudulent claims &mdash; far from it.  My emphasis at the outset and again in conclusion is to ensure that those who are seeking to process their legitimate claims are dealt with fairly and properly and have a fair and equal opportunity to secure their full entitlement under their insurance cover.  What protection has the citizen who has a legitimate claim from the alleged type of heavy-handed tactics that are apparently being employed by some <Col N="516"/>insurance companies, including, it is clearly alleged, the use of former garda&iacute; in direct approaches to said claimants and all that can entail in the mind of the individual and his or her family, placing them in what can only be described as an invidious position.  That too must be addressed in the overall issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern regarding the article that suggested that members of the legal profession were being inveigled into short-changing their clients, whether the item referred to in the article was genuine or a forgery.  The Law Society is investigating this suggestion but I believe the vast majority of solicitors are upstanding professionals who would not short-change a client or enter into a compromised or corrupt arrangement with an insurance company at the expense of clients.  If anything, the solicitors&rsquo; profession has erred the other way sometimes by being overly active in pursuit of clients&rsquo; interests.  </P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy that we all want a competitive insurance market.  Going back to a point made by Deputy Kenny earlier, if he wants to hear of an achievement of this Government and, in particular of Deputy Harney when she was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, he should look to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  If I may claim some credit for myself in terms of achievement, Deputy Kenny should look to the law relating to fraudulent claims.</P>

	<P>There has been a dramatic transformation in this country&rsquo;s compensation culture and, as a result, insurance premiums have fallen by up to 60% in a few years.  If Deputy Kenny wants to hear of an achievement, this is one that Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has had the decency to acknowledge.  There has been a dramatic improvement in this context.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Regarding the compensation culture, it is important that claims be investigated quickly and settled early.  It is also important that we avoid a system of dealing with personal injuries and road traffic compensation that involves protracted, paper-driven, court driven solutions when there are perfectly common sense, out-of-court arrangements to deal with such issues.  I do not wish to appear critical of those who get on with the job and settle cases quickly, who, when fault is abundantly clear, do not hide behind legal <Col N="517"/>procedures to avoid paying out and who find out the facts in the immediate aftermath of accidents to reach a settlement.  There is nothing wrong with such behaviour in principle or in practice.</P>

There is nothing wrong, in principle, with retired members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na acting as claims investigators.  However, there should be clear distinctions, protections and ethical guidelines to ensure that nobody pretends to be a person in authority and that people do not feel they are dealing with a person in authority investigating the claim from a different perspective in the context of an insurance claim investigation.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.  </P>
        <P>The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has responsibility for compiling the Irish consumer price index, CPI, and in accordance with the Statistics Act 1993 the director general of the office has sole responsibility for, and is independent in, deciding on statistical methodology.  The CPI is designed to measure inflation.  The CSO advises that to do this accurately the index must reflect the change in the average prices paid to purchase the full range of consumer goods and services available on the market, including tobacco products.  This position is fully aligned with international best practice and, in particular, it applies in the compilation of the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, at EU level.  The CSO compiles a sub-index that excludes tobacco products and it is shown prominently in the monthly CPI statistical release.  I understand that some countries use such a sub-index as the reference index in wage bargaining.</P>
        <P>As regards discussions with the social partners, the negotiation of pay agreements under social partnership is not linked systematically to the evolution of the CPI.  Inflation is, however, a significant consideration in these negotiations and the question of the appropriateness of taking account of a measure that includes tobacco can be considered when the pay terms of Towards 2016 next come up for consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Minister of State saying?  Did he say the attempt to excise tobacco has not died but will be raised again when something &mdash; I am not sure what &mdash; happens regarding Towards 2016?  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, pledged to make this change in the budget but discussions with the social partners <Col N="519"/>obviously did not go well.  Does the Minister of State agree that it would be entirely wrong to excise tobacco from the calculation of the consumer price index because the price of tobacco is part of the cost of living?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, boasted about his tenure of office as compared to 1997.  The inflation rate, which is hovering at around 5%, was 1.5% in 1997.  Has the attempt to excise tobacco and, in so doing, give a mistaken view of the cost of living been withdrawn or will the Government return to the issue when something &mdash; I did not catch the phrase the Minister of State used &mdash; is realised in respect of Towards 2016?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I made with regard to the negotiations on wages and a new partnership deal was that inflation is a significant consideration in negotiations and the question of the appropriateness of taking account of a measure which includes tobacco can be considered when the pay terms of Towards 2016 next come up for consideration.  My comments are made in the context of discussions on wage agreements and pay, etc, taking account of such a measure.  Countries throughout the European Union have already done so.  In Belgium and France, for example, it is a legal requirement to use a CPI sub-index which excludes tobacco products for the indexing of wages and collective bargaining agreements.  This was agreed as a result of negotiations with social partners.  The matter arises in the context of social partnership bargaining. </P>
        <P>With regard to the methodology, Deputies are aware that the Central Statistics Office works independently of Government.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to ministerial colleagues.  In checking with the CSO, the only intervention by Departments or Ministers was made recently by the Department of Health and Children, which raised the possibility of excluding tobacco from the consumer price index as a result of an observation made by the Irish Cancer Society.  This is an ongoing discussion.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, an increase in excise duty of 25 cent adds approximately 0.4% to the rate of inflation.  The price of tobacco is, therefore, an issue.  Nevertheless, we must respect the independence of the Central Statistics Office.  The basket of consumer items used in the CPI was rebased to take account of the many new consumer products people purchase.  Tobacco is still one of the items adjudicated on as part of the calculation of the consumer price index.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>While I fully agree with the Minister of State about respecting the independence of the CSO, his Government sought the excision of tobacco from the calculation of the CPI.  The Minister for Finance said as much in his budget speech.  Given that no Member of the House is trying to traduce the independence of the Central Statistics Office, the Minister of State and I are <Col N="520"/>not in dispute on this matter.  I heard him state, however, that as soon as the pay terms of the latest partnership agreement &mdash; patriotically termed Towards 2016 &mdash; expire, the Government will raise the issue again and take into account the contribution tobacco makes to inflation.  While I do not know how the T&aacute;naiste, who is briefing the Minister of State on the issue, feels about the social partners being able to obstruct this attempt by Government to artificially reduce inflation, they are correct that it would be an artificial reduction.  Is it the position of Government that, having been thwarted on this occasion, it will return to the issue when the pay terms of the current agreement expire?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Issues such as that raised by Deputy Rabbitte will be dealt with by agreement.  The Government is trying to reduce the number of people smoking for health reasons.  There is an ongoing debate on how tobacco should be treated in the methodology by which the CPI is calculated.  The issue may come up for discussion by agreement.  It is important to note that in 2000, tobacco accounted for 3.6% of total expenditure, whereas in 2005, the figure had declined to<?oasys _jy ?>2.6%.  Government policies, for example, the introduction of the smoking ban in public places and health awareness programmes, have had an impact.  Underlying this discussion are the health implications of smoking for members of the public.  The consumer price index is based on independent data.  With regard to further negotiations the matter would require agreement in the context of new negotiations in the partnership process. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I will repeat my question because I still have not received an answer.  Does the Government intend to seek again to excise tobacco as an element in the CPI?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, if it could be done by agreement. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the Minister of State&rsquo;s admission and the information he provided indicating that the proportion of expenditure on tobacco is declining, what would be the effect of removing tobacco from the CPI calculation?  He referred to the approach taken in Belgium and France of producing a sub-index of their consumer price indices.  Is it not the case that the state is the retailer of tobacco products in both these countries?  Perhaps this is the reason for using a sub-index.  </P>
        <P>On the general issue of the consumer price index, does the Minister of State accept that the amount spent on the cost of housing, both in mortgage and rent payments, accounts for the largest variation between Irish inflation and average European inflation?  Is this not the principal reason for the discrepancy between CPI figures here and those of other countries?  Does the Mini<Col N="521"/>ster of State have plans to remove housing costs from the consumer price index?</P>
        <P>The CPI is used as a formula for calculating a number of thresholds for taxation purposes, for example, inheritance tax, for which the value of a property is increased every year in line with CPI, even though house price inflation is significantly higher than the consumer price index.  Will a specific indicator for these thresholds be introduced to measure inflation in terms of particular sectors of the economy, including housing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>To discuss mortgage interest rates is to depart from the subject matter.  There is no question of removing mortgage interest from the consumer price index.  If there had not been upward movements in energy prices and mortgage interest rates, the inflation rate would have been 2.1% rather than 4% because these two areas account for around half of the inflation rate.  Unfortunately, both factors are outside domestic control.   </P>
        <P>To conclude the discussion with Deputy Rabbitte, any efforts to remove tobacco from the consumer price index would be made in the context of wage agreements.  The CPI must take account of tobacco because it is a commodity people buy and use.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If the lads agree to it, the Government will agree with them. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>To put it another way, if, for example, the Minister for Health and Children wanted the price of a packet of cigarettes to increase by &euro;1, a conflict would arise because any such change would immediately increase the consumer price index.  These issues are open for discussion in the context of wage agreements.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The method of calculating the rate of inflation needs to be changed but not in the way the Government requires.  Is it not a complete sham of an inflation rate when, for example, over the past ten years Fianna F&aacute;il and its partners in Government have facilitated at every turn the greed of speculators and developers, causing the price of a home to rise by 300% or 400%?  That is not part of the consumer price index but it is a millstone around the necks of hundreds of thousands of working people and their families.  It is like trying to give a picture of life in the 19th century without taking into consideration the burden on the peasant people of Ireland caused by the rackrenting landlords.  Is it not a complete sham?  If the real cost of living on workers was included in the official rate of inflation, it would be massively greater.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is obviously not aware that we use European and international standards.  There is no question of Ireland being any different from any of the other EU member states.  There are EU-harmonised indices of consumer prices.  As I said, the HICP reflects all the <Col N="522"/>standard items used, including energy prices and mortgage interest rates, for example, which make up a major part of our inflation rate.  If those two elements were eliminated from our inflation rate, it would be 2.1%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>House prices are not included.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>A huge element of the housing situation is built in with regard to the consumer price index. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The standards used are independently based.  The CSO uses internationally recognised standards and is very much in line with our European colleagues.  There is no official HICP sub-index that excludes tobacco, so tobacco is used in the indexes of other countries also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>House prices are not included.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The cost of mortgages is included.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a different issue.  The Minister of State refers to EU harmonisation when it suits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>How many times have the constituent items which make up the CPI been altered in the past 20 years?  Is it not the case, for example, that house prices were included at one time but were subsequently removed?  The items causing inflation which are not included in the CPI, such as the house prices referred to by Deputy Joe Higgins, are nonetheless major contributory factors in determining the actual level of inflation.  Would it not be more realistic to make the CPI more reflective of the actual inflationary tendencies and the items that cause those tendencies in the economy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s first question is outside the scope of these questions but we will hear the Minister.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>All of the data can be accessed from the available statistics.  Some 36 new items have been introduced while 33 have been deleted from the basket of goods and services and a further 48 items have been modified with respect to definition and coverage.  The net effect is that where the previous basket of goods and services had 613 items, the new basket comprises 616 items.  The main changes to the basket are outlined in documents I would be glad to share with the Deputy.</P>
        <P>There are ongoing changes, as the Deputy noted.  The most interesting point in this data is that the index is very much up to date.  For example, MP3 players have been included for some years, replacing Walkmans and Discmans.  Freshly prepared foods, fresh chilled shellfish, fresh chilled ready-to-eat meals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>People are no longer buying zips.  This is up-to-date information.  I have dealt with the issue of mortgage interest rates, based on the European standards.  The position is the same as any other European country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>This question has been on the Order Paper for a long time.  I suspect we are grateful to Dr. Paisley for distracting the Taoiseach so we actually reached it.</P>
        <P>A serious issue is involved, which I am not entirely sure the Minister of State has correctly addressed.  First and foremost, statistics from the Irish economy are an integral part of the statistics for the European Union and the methodology applied presumably must comply with EUROSTAT standards.  It is not a question of any Government or Administration arbitrarily selecting the commodities, or of the CSO acting independently &mdash; it must act in compliance with agreed European standards and, if there is a change, it is one that is accommodated within the EUROSTAT principle.</P>
        <P>Do I take it from the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply that the Government is trying to enable the Minister for Finance to put a punitive increase on the cost of tobacco in order to reduce consumption but at the same time to ensure that such an increase in the price of tobacco would not be factored into the calculation of inflation for the purposes of wage negotiation?  Can the Government do this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The answer is no.  It is one of the goods consumed by the people.  In weighting the goods, one must accept the realities.

      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I have checked this.  The only Government or departmental correspondence came from the Department of Health and Children, to which I referred earlier, on the basis of queries from the Irish Cancer Society, which was making a point in principle with regard to the inclusion of tobacco.  This data is compiled based on international standards.  We must accept the realities of modern living.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

Any discussion on this issue relates to national agreements and agreements with the social partners.  There are realities and facts with regard to consumer goods, irrespective of whether we like them.</P>
        <P>The Government has done much work in reducing consumption, in particular the Minister, Deputy Martin, in banning smoking in the workplace.  This is reflected in the figures.  As I said, tobacco as a percentage of total expenditure in 2000 was 3.6% and in 2005, it was 2.6%.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State said it is the policy of Government, given the opportunity and agreement with the social partners, to remove tobacco from the calculation of the consumer price index.  I hope, notwithstanding the very close relationship, that the social partners will never change their view on this issue because, however much we in this House might deplore smoking &mdash; it is one small point of agreement I have with the Minister, Deputy Martin &mdash; nonetheless, it is a fact of life in terms of the cost of living.  Were it excised, it would artificially reduce <Col N="525"/>the CPI to the credit and advantage of the Government of the day and misrepresent the reality of the cost of living.  The Government has been thwarted on this occasion because the social partners did not agree, but is committed to trying again.  I hope it is not successful.</P>

	<P>I explained the matter clearly to the Deputy, but I repeat I accept the realities.

I am very much aware of the position of the social partners and the trade union movement on the issue.</P>

        <P Just="Left">It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.30 p.m.; (2) No. 15 shall be decided without debate; (3) the following shall apply with regard to amendments and sections which may be recommitted at the commencement of Report Stage of No. 25 today: (i) the recommitted amendments and sections shall be taken first today; (ii) the ruling of the Chair that Report Stage amendments, when recommitted, do not have to have a separate Report Stage, shall not apply; and (iii) the proceedings on the recommittal shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. tonight by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, with regard to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; (4) Report and Final Stages of No. 26 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10.30 p.m. tonight by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Health and Children; and (5) Private Members&rsquo; Business, No. 71, motion re Kyoto Protocol, Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply and green procurement, resumed, shall be taken at 7 p.m. tonight or on the conclusion of No. 25, whichever is the later, and shall be brought to a conclusion after 90 minutes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Normally we get a note indicating what was agreed by the committee, but I did not receive any extra information about the International Hydrographic Organisation.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that the country is literally flooded at some times of the year.  With all the water problems we have, there may have been something of relevance in the convention.  The Whip should send a note the next time.</P>

	<P>I support Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s request for more information.  A debate on the issue in the House, of whatever duration that can be managed, would be appropriate.  The matter I raised under Standing Order 31 referred to the problem in Galway.  There is a need for an update on the situation and for us to learn from the mistakes of the past.  The opportunity should not be missed to have that debate because there are current issues that were probably not dealt with at the committee as a result of the daily change in the situation.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with No. 15 without debate be agreed to,&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
   
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 25, recommittal of the Criminal Justice Bill 2007, agreed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I pay tribute to the Chair and those in the Bills Office who have worked under extraordinary pressure since last week, in particular yesterday, to deal with this matter.  I welcome the recommittal of the untouched sections, but there was consensus at the end of our debate last week, when we dealt with 11 sections in as much detail as we could, that a good job was being done.  There should be no guillotine on the remaining 41 sections.  We will work diligently to make a better Bill if we are allowed and I ask, in that context, that there be no guillotine at 7 p.m. today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This has been a very difficult situation, even for Opposition spokespersons.  We now have two versions of the Bill, that as amended in committee before the House proper and that we are about to recommit.  Most of us have done our work on one Bill, but we have a different Bill to cross-reference now.  There are amendments which we saw for the first time yesterday.  I have submitted amendments to the Minister&rsquo;s amendments and will have to find out how they fit into the discussion as we move through the Bill.  There is enormous pressure on the Members of the House to do a proper job of parliamentary scrutiny and on the officers of the House to keep us in order in doing the job.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reversal at the end of Committee Stage last week when, probably prompted by external pressures, he determined that we should have a proper Committee Stage debate on this Bill.  Articles in today&rsquo;s national newspapers suggest that at least some sections of the proposal are unconstitutional.  I wish to be assured that we can debate those matters so that we can be sure of the constitutional basis of our criminal law.</P>
        <P>External comment that the Opposition is somehow responsible for not stopping this bulldozer is difficult to swallow when we oppose and vote against it but the guillotine is decided by the <Col N="529"/>majority in this House which is determined that we do not have adequate debate on these serious and important provisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s<?oasys _jy ?>U-turn and the fact he has bowed to pressure from within and outside the House to have some extra hours of debate on this Bill.  He is only agreeing, however, to make a very bad situation somewhat less bad.  Everybody accepts that parliamentary democracy requires that Bills receive proper scrutiny.  That is how it has worked for centuries.  When dealing with serious issues proper debate is all the more necessary. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Our debate on 11 sections of the Bill and the amendments thereto last week was good and constructive.  The Government side has admitted this in discussion.  The right approach would be to continue that debate without a guillotine, or the sword of Damocles, hanging over our heads.  I am pressing this because we have made clear that our approach has been to offer constructive comments on the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s approach and amendments to some of which the T&aacute;naiste agreed, although he said there would not be an opportunity to incorporate them into the Bill.  Let us continue that constructive debate.  The Taoiseach assured us yesterday that the D&aacute;il will resume after Easter, so what is the rush?  Let us do the job properly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Criminal Justice Bill is being cited outside the House as important for various reasons, beyond its substance, including how it bears on our democracy and how that must be taken into account.  I have come from a conference in the National Library organised by TASC, entitled Power to the People &mdash; Assessing Democracy in Ireland.  This Bill was cited as an example of whether it is progressive or regressive. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>To withold the temptation to use the guillotine means that democracy and accountability are not being further undermined and hopefully better legislation will flow from more reasoned debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in opposing the imposition of the guillotine in this case.  I understand from Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh that the recommittal process will not allow Deputies the opportunity to table amendments on Report Stage tomorrow.  The closing time is 11 a.m. today.  It is very unsatisfactory.  The T&aacute;naiste was putting down amendments up to yesterday evening.  Where and how can Opposition voices respond to those with appropriate amendments?  It is a closed operation.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste is being congratulated on the recommittal process and the opening of other sections but that is stunted by the imposition of <Col N="530"/>the guillotine again which is unnecessary, unhelpful and will lead not to best practice but to flawed legislation.  We oppose the guillotine and ask the T&aacute;naiste to reconsider it.</P>

We had an interesting discussion, and I am not criticising it, on a new proposition that we should treat unconstitutionally obtained evidence in a new way.  I am happy to discuss that type of issue but the Bill before us does not contain that proposal.  I ask the Deputies opposite to concentrate on what concerns them in the Bill, rather than bring in new material which on any analysis has not been the subject of lengthy public debate.

	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 26, Pharmacy Bill 2007, Order for Report, Report and Final Stages, agreed to?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the 11th piece of legislation to be guillotined this week.  A dog&rsquo;s dinner has been made of the Criminal Justice Bill 2007 and three separate Bills are now to be passed almost at once, which is something I have not seen in all my time in the House.  Bills are now being chopped, one after the other, without taking into account the requirement of the House to hold the Executive to account by scrutinising legislation.  We oppose this guillotine as we do all others.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very important piece of legislation and has been long expected.  It is unacceptable that it is to be truncated by guillotine.  There are many interested parties to the amendments and they must be debated.  I urge that the guillotine be lifted.</P>

        <P>Has the Government fixed a date for the resumption of the D&aacute;il after Easter?</P>
        <P>In view of comment in the public arena, has the Government sought advice from the Attorney General on the legality of holding a general election subsequent to the date of the final presentation of the census figures?  If so, what is that advice?</P>
        <P>Does the T&aacute;naiste wish to comment on statements from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors to the effect that he has interfered directly in the running of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a daily basis?</P>

	<P>Backbenchers in this House cannot get to ask a question on the Order of Business because of the amount of time taken up on this type of question.  In fairness to them, I ask Deputy Kenny to stay within the terms of the Order of Business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I want fair play for everybody but, as the Deputy knows, week after week it is impossible to allow the Members who sit behind the Deputy to ask questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The ethics Bill will be initiated in the Seanad.  The Government has approved its text and it will be put before the Seanad at the earliest available opportunity, although I do not know the exact timing.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s promise of last October is broken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is another broken promise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been no broken promise.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Chief Whip that the House will reconvene on 24 April.  The Government has considered the issue relating to the census, raised by Deputy Kenny.  There is no question of invalidity in holding an election in those circumstances.</P>
        <P>If Deputy Kenny had raised the matter relating to the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors with me during Question Time today I would have given him a very long and detailed answer, to prove that there was no substance in those remarks.</P>

	<P>I will ask a question on the commitment given by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment &mdash; with special responsibility for trade and commerce, Deputy Michael Ahern, to introduce a statutory restriction on the use of the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;.  Apparently people are misrepresenting themselves as accountants and caus<Col N="537"/>ing damage.  Will the relevant legislation be introduced during the lifetime of this D&aacute;il?</P>
        <P>I will also ask a question on the commitment of the Government to repay approximately &euro;1 billion collected illegally from nursing homes and similar institutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the difficulty?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should submit a question on that issue to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has no proposals to introduce legislation relating to the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; as the term is rather generic.  For example, there are turf accountants, as well as chartered and certified accountants, just as there are lawyers who are not barristers or solicitors.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>There is promised legislation in an area which may be pertinent to the meeting between the Taoiseach and Northern colleagues today.  It relates to paedophiles or suspected paedophiles coming here from abroad who have no legal obligation to inform the Garda when applying for a job that puts them in contact with children and with no mechanism to monitor this.  The promised legislation on the register of persons considered unsafe to work with children may have an impact on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call the T&aacute;naiste on legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the assembly and institutions are to be re-established, hopefully, will that legislation be introduced and when will we have it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe I have answered that question three or four times in the past month.  Serious consideration needs to be given to the issue of legislation to give effect to the protection of children by preventing unsafe people from working with them.  One of the problems relates to the issue of soft information and hard information.  One of the points that arises in that contexts is what we propose to put into a constitutional amendment.  We have not achieved consensus on the latter issue.  How we deal with this legislation is contingent on reaching some <Col N="538"/>view on whether we need a constitutional amendment in place before introducing the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Will we have the referendum first?</P>

        <P FLI="0">I argued previously against the concept of outsourcing any part of the justice system.  This provision deals with arrangements for electronic monitoring and allows the Minister to make contractual arrangements with any persons he or she considers fit to conduct the monitoring.  This would permit the outsourcing of electronic tagging.  My preference is that this should be an additional task which would be allocated to the probation and welfare service.  If required, that service should be enabled to employ additional staff to carry out this task.  The people monitoring an electronic tagging scheme should be public servants.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage we discussed the question of cost effectiveness.  Deputy Howlin was particularly interested in this.  The Department has been examining this issue and has looked at evidence from, among other places, the United Kingdom, where a report by its Comptroller and Auditor General showed that the numbers on curfew had risen from 9,000 in 1999 to over 50,000 in 2004-05.  It showed that the Home Office spent &pound;102 million sterling on electronic monitoring in the latter year.</P>
        <P>Officials in the Department met some providers of the service and received an outline of technological capability in the range and type of electronic monitoring service delivery available.  It will not come into force until an arrangement is made in accordance with sections 13 and 16 of the Bill and, as is normal practice, detailed specifications would have to be worked out and public procurement and tendering processes adhered to before electronic monitoring would be introduced.</P>

	<P>I am obliged to the Minister for that detailed information.  The &pound;102 million sterling spent in the UK in 2005 related to 50,000 people on curfew.  I take it that of the two types of electronic monitoring described, this is fixed point monitoring.</P>

	<P>I have no information on that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Courts in this jurisdiction are reluctant to deny bail without a compelling reason due to the principle that people are innocent until proven guilty.  People on bail are obviously awaiting a determination of the court.  We are arguing that where there is a real likelihood of an offence being committed, the individual should be kept in custody.  The notion that 50,000 people would be subject to curfew indicates that where there is a lesser option such as electronic monitoring, it would become more readily used.  How would that fit in with our Constitution, which guarantees people liberty?  Monitoring is a curtailment of liberty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not know what percentage the 50,000 cases would be of the overall number of bail application cases in the United Kingdom but it appears to be a significant proportion.  I am worried that it could be perceived as not a major step to delimit somebody&rsquo;s freedom to the extent of requiring them to be subject to curfew or monitored in this way.  Is it an option that might, if it was overused, fall foul of our Constitution&rsquo;s right to liberty and free movement and, second, the right to be determined to be innocent until proven guilty?</P>
        <P>Is there further information on cost?  The Minister told us last week that the more people who are involved, the cheaper it will be.  Will there be an economic reason for having the system used more often rather than less often?</P>

	<P>I have always held the view that somebody is better off being electronically tagged and out of prison than in prison.  I say this based on every perspective, particularly that of civil liberties.  It is also of huge advantage as far as the taxpayer is concerned because the average cost of keeping someone in prison is approximately &euro;2,000 per week.  The figures I receive from the UK indicate that it costs &pound;800 per month, which is about &euro;1,200, to tag someone.  This translates to about &euro;300 per week.  If those figures are correct or still stand, it would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      </Speaker><Col N="546"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that if one did not have a scale, one might not be able to run at a rate of &euro;300 per week.  Still, it indicates that the figures are much more cost-effective from the taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective.  </P>
        <P>I also accept the point consistently made by Deputy Howlin that, at this stage, the only assured system that works properly and cost-effectively is the home curfew system, which is related to a telephone connection, as opposed to GPS monitoring where there are continuing difficulties and greater expense.  I envisage using the home curfew system initially.</P>
        <P>I have two questions for the Minister, the first of which is probably not hugely relevant now, although it was relevant when we discussed this issue a year ago.  Is the Minister committed to this?  Without a political commitment from the Minister, it will not be operational.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will not be operational.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It will hardly be relevant as far as this Minister is concerned at this stage.  I was impressed by the comments of the head of the Garda inspectorate yesterday when she spoke about issues which were close to my heart.  She then seemed to suggest that the bureaucratic obstacles to getting anything put in place were substantial hills to climb.  Leaving aside the question of whether the Minister is very committed at this stage and taking into account the fact that, since the passage of the last Criminal Justice Act, there is a provision in law for electronic tagging as a post-release condition, how long would it take to get the system operational if one was fully committed?  How long would it take from the point of view of tendering and dealing with contractors?  Could it be operational within six or nine months?  Based on his experience in office, if it was pushed, how long would it take to have such a system operational so that judges can make orders pursuant to the law we are putting through the Oireachtas?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is almost impossible to be absolutely scientific about how long these processes take.  From dealing with a number of projects which required procurement, my view is that it would be optimistic, from the time of a decision to definitely go ahead with it and to put out a tender specification, to say that one would have a result and implementation within a year of that date.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is very disappointing.  On the other hand, if steps had been taken to put it into operation when we passed the last Act a year ago, it would be virtually operational now.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>A year has not passed since we passed the last Act so I do not, therefore, agree with that proposition.  Since the Deputies are <Col N="547"/>spending some of their time here looking at electoral tea leaves, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe might be better employed asking Deputy Howlin whether he wants this at all if he anticipates being in a position to influence the decision himself.  </P>

        <P FLI="0">This is a new section.  It occurs earlier than on Report Stage.  I am very conscious that this falls foul of the Minister&rsquo;s instruction to us not to <Col N="550"/>think up our own ideas and to limit ourselves to his view on what is proper to the Bill.  Notwithstanding that, I will deal with it very briefly because I do not wish to take up too much time on it.  It is an area in which the Minister will have much more experience than I.</P>
        <P>I raised this issue in the context of the last Criminal Justice Bill last year.  The amendment seeks in a long-winded way to provide that where the criminal law prohibits something subject to an exemption, as it states in the first part of the section, &ldquo;where an enactment or rule of law creates an offence but provides for a qualification, exception, exemption, proviso or excuse&rdquo;, it is a matter for the defendant to prove that the exception applies to him or her rather than for the prosecution to prove that it does not apply.</P>
        <P>A very simple example of it, although I am not using it in respect of this debate because we are talking about criminal legislation here, is that if the law states that a person must have a television licence and he or she asserts that he or she has one, it should not be up to the prosecuting authority to prove that he or she does not have the licence.  The person should be able to prove that he or she has the licence.</P>
        <P>It was suggested to me by practising lawyers that it would strengthen the hand in respect of the prosecution of offences by shifting the evidential burden in matters where an excuse provision exists.  When I say &ldquo;excuse&rdquo;, I mean a qualification, exemption and so on as listed in subsection (1) of my amendment.  At the hearing of a complaint charging that offence, if the defendant wishes to rely on that proviso, the burden of proof that such a proviso exists rests on him or her.</P>
    </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is an interesting proposal which would effectively codify as a canon of interpretation the law which is common law to some extent and judge-based law in respect of when exceptions must be proved or disproved.  Subsection (2) proposes to set out the exact criteria which a court should have regard to in deciding to apply rules of construction.  It also proposes to deal with submissions of no case to answer.</P>
        <P>I do not know where the original text of this proposal comes from; I do not know whether it is home-grown or whether it comes from some foreign criminal code.  Regardless of where it comes from, I would need very extensive debate to see how it would interact with our existing law.  One would need to look at all existing case law to decide whether it is a good idea to put it into law.  We would also have to decide whether it would change the law significantly.  The content of subsection (1) is all very well, but subsection (2) tells the court how it is to apply subsection (1).  I am not clear in my own mind about this.  For example, one of the criteria is in subsection (2)(<i>d</i>), which states: &ldquo;the comparative ease or difficulty for the prosecution and the defendant in <Col N="551"/>discharging the burden of proving the fact in question&rdquo;.  I do not know whether that adds anything to the existing law or whether it makes the law more or less clear.  I believe that this interesting proposal needs further study so I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Deputy Howlin on putting forward the proposal.  I utterly reject the earlier remarks of the Minister, which seemed to suggest that it is inappropriate for members of the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not suggest that.  Since we have limited time, I appealed to them not to bring in material that we have not had an opportunity to consider and which the public has never considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That supports my point about the suggestion by the Minister that it was inappropriate for the Opposition to bring forward issues&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say it was inappropriate, I said it was perfectly permissible under the rules of the House, but we have limited time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not our fault.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Deputy said that there are many important things in the Bill which he wanted to discuss.  I could go on for two hours on this if he wants.  The problem is that the public has never had an opportunity to consider this proposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The public and this House have had very little opportunity to discuss many of the propositions put forward by the Minister.  If we are to talk about improvements to the criminal justice system, let us talk about them.  However, suggesting that any such discussion should be based solely on proposals by the Minister is entirely wrong and undemocratic.  While I have considerable reservations about the proposal put forward by Deputy Howlin, I compliment him on putting it forward.  In discussing improvements to the criminal justice system, it is only by having rational, healthy debate on ideas that we will end up with a better system.  Such debate should not be confined to ideas emanating from the ministerial stable.</P>
        <P>At first sight, Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s amendment looks attractive.  However, I thought the example he quoted about the television licence was a little unfortunate.  I am sure there are many people with television licences who have not got a clue where the actual piece of paper is and who would not be in a position to produce it.  I might have some difficulty.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="552"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It could also refer to a driving licence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I carefully keep my driving licence in my wallet on the basis that I need to produce it if I am stopped on the road as there is a law that tells me I must do that, but there is no law that states that one must keep one&rsquo;s television licence in a safe and secure place so that it is not the best example.  There should be some evidence from an inspector to show that he checked the list and the payment does not appear to be recorded on the list.  Some <i>prima facie </i>evidence should be produced on behalf of the prosecution.</P>
        <P>Having said that, it seems in certain circumstances that the burden of proof should be more on the accused than currently is the case.  If we had a proper debate on Committee Stage, we could have got evidence from people in this area who could give us a better understanding on where we are at the moment and how we might rebalance the law somewhat to put the onus on the accused, but ensuring that we do not do so unfairly.  I am glad this amendment was raised, but I am not utterly convinced that we should adopt it in its current format.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

        <P LI="2">14.&mdash;The Criminal Justice Act 2006 is amended by the insertion of the following Part, after section 197, as Part 16:</P>
     
        <P Just="Center">&ldquo;PART 16</P>
        <P Just="Center" el="5">SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANT</P>
        <P LI="3">198.&mdash;(1) In addressing a court on the question of sentence, a solicitor or counsel on a defendant&rsquo;s behalf may address the court, on his or her client&rsquo;s instructions&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="4">(<i>a</i>) on the evidence already received by the court, and</P>
        <P LI="4">(<i>b</i>) as to the defendant&rsquo;s current state of mind in relation to the offence of which he or she was convicted.</P>
        <P LI="3">(2) A court shall not, unless it considers the interests of justice require it to do so, receive or place reliance on other state<Col N="553"/>ments made by a legal representative in relation to which evidence from a witness, rather than submissions from a legal representative, ought more properly be received.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is an amendment to ensure that there is no abuse of the plea of mitigation.  I understand that this is the practice in the courts, but it would be useful to have it incorporated into law.  Its intention is to ensure that there is no abuse of the right to make a plea in mitigation and to ensure that if a defendant wants to rely on anything in his or her plea of mitigation, that fact must be proved in evidence and not merely asserted, to provide for that to be done legally and for that evidence to be tested.</P>
 </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This section more or less describes what actually happens at the moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, it is not particularly necessary.  When someone is convicted in the District Court, it is usual for the judge, when telling the solicitor that his client is being convicted, to ask if he is employed, whether he has a family and whether he has any previous convictions.  He accepts the solicitor&rsquo;s word on this and the Garda is there to contradict the solicitor if he is not correct on these issues.  That is better than asking the solicitor to bring his client forward so that his marital status can be investigated, evidence provided of his marriage and so on.</P>
        <P>This amendment will not change things.  If a judge had no reason to disbelieve a barrister or a solicitor acting for someone whom he is sentencing, he will ask questions about the circumstances of his client and he will act on that, unless he has doubts or unless the prosecution demands evidence of that.  Letters are often handed in with background information on the accused and nobody sees the contents of them &mdash; I think this practice has been condemned by the courts.  For example, a letter is sent in by a parish priest, a bishop, an employer or a TD.  It is a character reference handed to the court and sometimes it sets out propositions that might not have been known.  The person might have had a difficult childhood and so on.  I think the Court of Criminal Appeal has disapproved of the practice of accepting information in that form, but I do not think there is anything wrong with the judge asking the defence to provide information about the client before he is sentenced, as long as the judge is happy to accept the word of the defence and the prosecution does not object.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is useful to discuss this proposition from Deputy Howlin.  I have some concerns about accepting it because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure we will fall apart on this issue, or indeed on any issue.  We will certainly not fall apart on this.  It is an opportunity for us to outline our stance on the position of an accused before the court.  My concern above all is that there must be a fair trial and a fair opportunity given to the accused.  This proposed section is formulated in such a way that it could, by inference, exclude certain matters that should properly be put before the court by the defendant.  If we specifically provide that counsel on behalf of the defendant may address the court on the evidence and on the defendant&rsquo;s state of mind, it could be said by inference that the court could not be addressed in regard to any matter other than these two.</P>
           <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As the Minister pointed out, there are situations where the judge properly looks for information on the position of the accused, such as marital status, employment or employment prospects and so on, before deciding a penalty.  It is more likely such considerations will arise in the lower courts rather than in the criminal courts.  I have always found the practice that has developed sensible and reasonable from the point of view of giving the judge a better fix as to what is an appropriate penalty.</P>
        <P>It is worthwhile looking at the issues raised by Deputy Howlin.  It is an issue we should consider carefully and closely in the next several years.  Deputy Howlin will have my fullest co-operation in so doing.  For now, however, I hesitate to rush into accepting it.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment is straightforward.  The Minister has said in the past that there is a significant number of regulations and that it would put an onerous burden on Members to deal with all of them.  When it comes to such major changes in our justice system, however, we have a duty to ensure the regulations come before the Houses of Oireachtas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As an Opposition Member, I often complain about the regular procedure whereby motions are referred to committee without debate.  However, the work being done by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs through its scrutiny sub-committee is an example of how to deal with a broad range of legislative provisions and directives.  Where there is no great opposition to a particular provision, as is often the case with many of these practical measures, it would be beneficial to society to provide an opportunity for Members to make an input.  This would help to ensure that mistakes do not happen and that regulations are made better through this additional scrutiny.  It is akin to a watchful eye cast upon them every now and then.</P>

       <P LI="3" FLI="0">&ldquo;time already served&rdquo; means the period of time, prior to conviction, during which the convicted person was detained in custody without bail.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We have been talking about sentencing and I have long had the view that one of the greatest concerns of the public has been inconsistency in sentencing.  If I get any greater series of complaints above the norm, it is when cases appear to be inconsistent so far as the public is concerned.  It is not unreasonable for the public to expect a standard of consistency in regard to sentencing.  Is there inconsistency?  Clearly there is.  We do not even have a database to establish the level and range of sentences that have been passed.  It is an inevitable consequence of what essentially amounts to an <i>ad hoc</i> situation that there is inconsistency, and that is wrong.  Everybody should know that if they commit a particular offence, a certain level of sentence will probably follow.  If a person is before the court the public should know that if that accused person is convicted he or she is likely to get a sentence within a certain range, and that sentence will be imposed unless there are particular circumstances which, in my view, should be explained in open court.</P>
        <P>The approach I adopt to sentencing is that for serious crime there must be tougher sentencing but it must be consistent.  An absolute basic approach to consistent sentencing is that there must be a register of sentences.  That is the central issue in this series of amendments and is the basis for consistent sentencing.</P>
        <P>The right approach in regard to sentencing is that we should have a register.  At present a judge, particularly one who deals with many criminal cases, has, of his or her own knowledge, a fair idea of the level of sentences that have been passed in that area.  Judges who have been newly appointed or who do not have a tradition in criminal cases may not be aware of the level of sentences and there is no ready access to a register of sentences available to them.  It is possible they will be advised by the counsel for the accused, but that would be a plea in mitigation.  There is no normal circumstance where, unless requested by the judge, the prosecuting counsel gives a view on sentencing, and that is ridiculous.</P>
        <P>On the issue of sentencing, I would like to introduce a register of sentences which would be readily available to judges but also to everybody else, including those who might be contemplating committing a crime so that they would know what is in store for them if caught.  In that way, when a person is being sentenced in court there would be sentencing guidelines which would establish the range of sentences that could be expected for any particular offence.  That is what happens in other common law countries.  Why do we not have that system here?  We should start with the register of sentences and establish the range of <Col N="560"/>sentences and the guidelines.  It is up to the Oireachtas to do that.</P>
        <P>As of now we merely point out a maximum sentence but that is not a great guideline to the court.  We should establish sentencing guidelines, tariffs as they are known in some other common law jurisdictions, but at the end of the day we have to accept the judge has the discretion to make his or her decision on sentences.  We should also require, and the Oireachtas is entitled to do so, that if the judge goes outside the tariff laid down by the Oireachtas he should explain in open court why he or she is so doing.</P>
        <P>A completely new approach is needed to sentencing.  The fundamental basis is that at least we have a database, a register of sentences.  That is the centrepiece of this series of amendments.  If we agree to establish that database we will start the process, at long last, of the beginning of the end for inconsistency in sentencing.  As long as we do not have that register of sentences we will continue with the present <i>ad hoc</i> approach, helped here and there by directions from appeal decisions from the Court of Criminal Appeal and so on, but essentially still an <i>ad hoc </i>system.</P>
        <P>The other proposals relating to amendment No. 66 deal with the issue of a register of sentences and access to it.  What I would like to see is an approach whereby the minimum basic tool is available to judges in particular but to everybody else who is involved in the criminal justice system to enable us to begin the process of eliminating inconsistency in sentencing in our courts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important and useful debate that links in to a parliamentary question I have tabled, which we shall deal with later, on the issue of judicial conduct.  Before the Minister&rsquo;s time, he was, no doubt, involved in wearing a different hat as Attorney General, and we had a great debate on the general public concern that, while we are very well served by excellent judges, each appears to be a corporate soul in his or her own court.  It is important for the public to have faith in the criminal justice system if there is to be certainty and consistency in regard to judgments.  </P>
        <P>The information we get is often partial.  Nobody sits through a full court case.  Even the court reporter can only synopsise the flavour, demeanour and all that takes place over several days of a court case in a few paragraphs, but that does not give the full picture.  Sometimes judges are unfairly criticised.</P>
        <P>There is a need to bring the judicial arm of the justice system into a structure that allows for consistency and confidence in the system.  That has to be done in such a way that gives it absolute independence.  It is a hard balance to strike, I do not pretend it is an easy one.  Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe said there should be an explanation, but for many it would be a horrific intrusion to have to explain in open court why they are doing <Col N="561"/>something while for others it would be normal transparency.</P>
        <P>There is a need to look at the whole issue of judicial conduct, training and conferencing so that shared values and understanding of evolving societal matters are fully comprehended across the Judiciary and everybody buys into it, and that there are better communications with this House and the Judiciary in regard to the intention of the law makers as opposed to the law interpreters.  In that context, the suggestions by Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe concerning understood tariffs and guidelines are useful.  If there is disagreement about them it should be a two-way dialogue so that we can better understand the reasoning of the Judiciary, and craft our laws better than we currently do to suit the needs of the process.  Having practised for many years in the courts, the T&aacute;naiste is particularly well placed to bring that judgment to the House.  The independence, which is important, has led to a disconnect that is eroding public confidence.  Probably to political advantage and to the annoyance of many of his former legal colleagues, the T&aacute;naiste made great play of public concern over some judicial decisions.  While we make the law and set tariffs in primary statutes, they must be interpreted and administered in the courts in an understandable, parallel and consistent manner.  In that way, the public can have confidence in us as law-makers and in the Judiciary as law interpreters and decision-makers on individual cases.</P>

	<P>The debate on sentencing is an important one but it is not taking place beyond the few Members present who are interested, as well as members of the Bar or the Law Society.  Obviously judges themselves would have a view on it.  Sometimes we are forced to react by sensational headlines about a perceived wrong or inconsistent sentencing by a judge, but I am concerned that the debate has not dealt fully with such matters.  There is an increasing rush towards mandatory sentencing rather than towards my proposal in the amendment that was ruled out of order, which was to set out proposed minimum or possible maximum sentences when legislation is being framed.  However, we should leave it to a judge&rsquo;s discretion having heard all aspects of a case.  Sometimes people are rightly concerned if there is a wide divergence between sentences on the basis of what they see.  One way of addressing that would be to establish guidelines when we frame legislation.  Such guidelines would not detract from judicial discretion.  That discretion is required and, if at all possible, we should not interfere with it.  Mandatory sentencing, however, is interfering with the role, duties and responsibilities we place on judges.  Their sentencing might not be appropriate sometimes, in our view, but as other Deputies have said, we have not sat through the entire court case, nor <Col N="562"/>have we heard all the ins and outs of a case.  It can be quite harrowing for the victims of an offence to find that the perpetrator has received a suspended sentence or a lesser sentence than the victim presumed the judge would impose.  We could examine other mechanisms in the case of acquittal, which were mentioned earlier in the debate.  Those matters should be examined together with sentencing generally and, as Deputy Howlin said, allowing the DPP to submit an appeal against what may be considered a lenient sentence or acquittal.  I would like those matters to be teased out along with sentencing because they are all intertwined, which is the problem if we proceed as suggested by this section of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I would like to address Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s specific proposals.  A working group on sentencing in the courts is currently operating in the Dublin Circuit Court.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Who are they?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is chaired by Mrs. Justice Denham and includes Mr. Justice Kevin O&rsquo;Higgins, Mr. Justice Esmonde Smith, Her Honour Judge Miriam Malone and Professor Tom O&rsquo;Malley.  They are reviewing sentencing systems worldwide and have decided to establish a pilot project in the Dublin Circuit Court.  I understand that two researchers have been selected to collect and collate information on sentencing outcomes in cases on indictment in designated courts, in accordance with criteria specified by the committee.  The objectives of that project are to identify criteria and other information employed by the Judiciary in sentencing for particular types of offence in criminal proceedings; to record and retrieve such information in individual cases; to design and develop a database to store the information retrieved and to enable its retrieval in accordance with various search criteria; to share or disseminate the information utilising information or communications technology via a judge&rsquo;s intranet or other means; and to assemble appropriate material on sentencing for a bench book and website.  That work is ongoing and, in fairness, I should acknowledge that it is a judge-led initiative in this area. </P>
        <P>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s proposal is an elaborate one, but I hope he will not mind me saying that I think it is overly ambitious at this stage.  It would require a vast amount of work to be done concerning every offence in every court.  The case number of the offence and the particular offence could be done on a computer, but it would take a lot of work by officials to put down any mitigating factors relied on by the convicted person or his or her defence counsel.  They would have to listen to and note the arguments and put them down in some written form.  They would also have to put down the person&rsquo;s previous convictions as well as details of the offence.  They would have to follow <Col N="563"/>it up by dealing with the Prison Service to find out if the sentence was served or if early releases occurred.  Such things would be extremely complicated to do.  It may be that in a perfect world there would be sufficient human resources to deal with such matters, but at the moment I cannot honestly accept the amendment because I could never implement its provisions within existing resources.  Members of the Judiciary would probably have to spend a lot of their time inputting this material, otherwise registrars or specially appointed court officials would have to do this kind of work.</P>
        <P>I fully accept what Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe said, that the purpose of this proposal is to give people a picture of what is going on in the courts.  However, if it is not an accurate picture it will be misleading.  One cannot just establish it and allow it to tick over, otherwise the media would draw inaccurate or incomplete pictures from the relevant data.  We must ask ourselves whether what the Courts Service and the Judiciary have done is more promising than what Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe is doing.  I tend to think that it is, in terms of giving us a statistical knowledge of what is going on.  The Deputy&rsquo;s proposal is not really worthwhile, unless he has some strong objection.</P>

	<P>The exclusionary rule is the rule that defines the circumstances under which a court will exclude evidence on the grounds that it has been obtained in violation of the accused&rsquo;s rights.  This issue was examined in some detail by the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group chaired by Dr. Gerard Hogan.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14- ?><P>Customarily, the common law did not have an exclusionary rule and the courts allowed evidence to be admitted which had been obtained as a result of, for example, an illegal search, provided the evidence was otherwise admissible and relevant.  Following the 1960s Supreme Court decision in the <Col N="564"/>O&rsquo;Brien case, the exclusionary test to be applied can be summarised as follows: evidence obtained as a result of a conscious and deliberate violation of the accused&rsquo;s constitutional rights is not admissible in evidence, unless there are extraordinary excusing circumstances.  This remains the essential test today.  If unlawfully obtained evidence does not fall to be excluded under this test, the court will then have a discretion whether to allow the evidence to be admitted.</P> <?oasys _dc0- ?>
        <P>The question of extraordinary excusing circumstances has not been an issue that has arisen frequently before the courts.  Likewise, whether the right that had been infringed was a constitutional right or a common law right has not been a matter of great debate.  The question as to what is meant by &ldquo;conscious and deliberate&rdquo; has, however, been hotly debated.  The Supreme Court decided  the issue in the case of Kenny in a manner that involves a significant extension of the exclusionary rule.</P>
        <P>It is, however, interesting to note that the decision of the Supreme Court in Kenny was not a unanimous one.  There were two strongly dissenting views to the three majority judgments.</P>
        <P>One of the central problems of a strict exclusionary rule is that it does not allow the trial judge to weigh the public interest in ensuring that constitutional rights, including public rights, are protected by agents of the State as against the public interest in ensuring that crime is detected and punished and that the constitutional rights of victims are vindicated by the courts.  Neither does a strict exclusionary rule allow the courts to have regard to whether a defect in a warrant is caused by factors outside the control of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>It is against this rule that the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group developed its recommendations.  The group considered three alternative approaches: a constitutional amendment, statutory regulation and the statutory provision of a list of factors which a court may take into account in deciding whether to exclude evidence.</P>
        <P>The group measured these three options in detail.  The recommendation by the majority of the group can be summarised as a desire to see a situation where the court would have a discretion to admit unconstitutionally obtained evidence or not, having regard to the totality of the circumstances and in particular the rights of the victim.  It should be noted that the chairman of the group, Dr. Gerard Hogan, senior counsel, did not concur with the majority recommendation.  His dissenting view is appended to the Report of the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group, which was published by me on 23 March.</P>
        <P>During the course of the Committee Stage debate on the Criminal Justice Bill 2007 last week, I debated the exclusionary rule with Deputies Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe and Ardagh and others before this House.</P><Col N="565"/>
        <P>I know the rest of my answer will appear on the record.  This is a very interesting topic but it is not one that is easily remedied on the hoof, so to speak.</P>
     
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>As I stated last Thursday my belief is one that would support the minority judgments in the Kenny case.  The minority, or discretionary, view in the Kenny case was that a balance had to be struck between rights rather than a rigid view being taken.  I would prefer if that view were reflected in the law.  The question is how we can achieve this.  We should think carefully in undertaking a possible constitutional amendment on such a complex issue.  In the first instance, the approach should be to see whether a change in jurisprudence emerges following use of the appeal provisions in Part 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  However, as was noted in last week&rsquo;s debate, that appeal procedure depends on a suitable case emerging that would lead to reconsideration of the law in this area.  If not, the other options would then have to be examined and considered, including the question of legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>As a continuation of an amendment I tabled to the Criminal Justice Bill I wish to raise the following issues.  Does the Minister accept that the public interest is not served and the mood of the public is aggravated by people who are charged with serious offences getting off on technical grounds?  Does he accept that there is an onus on us to find a way to ensure justice is done?  A person with a fair defence is entitled to an acquittal but without one, he or she should be convicted.  It is up to us to put in place measures that ensure that a fair result emerges.</P>
        <P>The majority recommendation of the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group, chaired by Dr. Gerard Hogan, was to introduce a change and this has given us a lead.  I note the dissenting view of Dr. Hogan and respect it as it relates to a concern about constitutional difficulties that may arise.  Does the Minister agree that we must find a way to change this rule within the constitution?  If necessary we can follow the recommendations of the debate last week that any such Bill be a single issue Bill and perhaps be referred by the President for constitutional proofing under Article 26.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept that we should examine this matter in a broader way than the narrow confines the report of the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group allow?  We should examine the situation in Australia and I am indebted to the Oireachtas research service for finding these details.  In Australia a discretionary approach is taken, in the United States a good faith exception exists and in Canada there is a three pronged approach involving a trial fairness test and other elements.  The broader international context <Col N="566"/>shows that this issue does not affect us only, solutions have been found in other countries and we can learn from them.  I want to see a political commitment to a solution from all those with an interest in this issue and I want to see that solution put into effect as soon as possible in the next D&aacute;il, whichever parties are in Government.</P>

	<P>I agree with the Deputy and the minority view in the Kenny case.  I am bound, as is every citizen, by the majority view of the Supreme Court but, had Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe or I held the swing vote things might have gone the other way.  However, we were not there and other people decided the case the way they did.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not mean to put that thought in anyone&rsquo;s head.  The Deputies should take a look at the rule on unforeseen consequences.</P>
        <P>I once defended a person and the garda applied for a warrant for St. Audoen&rsquo;s House, an apartment complex, but the District court clerk, misreading the garda&rsquo;s handwriting wrote it out for St. Andrew&rsquo;s House and the case collapsed on that point.  The garda knew what apartment they were going to, the clerk did not know the difference between the two and the case was thrown out on the basis that the garda did not have a valid warrant to search the apartment in St. Audoen&rsquo;s House, though they were acting in good faith.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Most people feel this is not a common sense approach.  The American approach is better.  Whether a person acts in good faith is of critical importance.  Getting from where we are now to that point poses a challenge to us and I feel the best solution would be a single section Bill to begin in the next D&aacute;il.  This would require a good deal of care to ensure there are no unforeseen consequences but it would crystalise the issue.  If the Bill was narrow, carefully planned and well balanced we could bring this matter back before the courts again.  The exclusionary rule does not arise every day in the courts but it has a chilling effect.  When mistakes are discovered the Director of Public Prosecutions is faced with the dilemma of dropping an otherwise perfectly good prosecution.  In the case of Judge Brian Curtin the DPP was subject to judicial criticism for ploughing on in the face of a defect.  This issue could be addressed on a cross-party basis in the next D&aacute;il if there is cross-party consensus.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that the circumstances giving rise to the judgment in question constitute further evidence of an extremely disturbing picture of misbehaviour by some garda&iacute; in County Donegal in the 1990s.  Anyone who strongly supports the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as I and the vast majority of Deputies and citizens do, is entitled to express and feel a great sense of shock, disappointment and dismay at what happened to the person to whom Deputy Howlin refers.  While the two members who were central to this case, one a superintendent and the other a detective garda, have either been dismissed or resigned, the case shows more clearly than perhaps any other the need for the radical reform which was facilitated and underpinned by the historic enactment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</P>
        <P>The Supreme Court was unequivocal in its condemnation of the disreputable conduct of the two members of the Garda who were central to this case.  I am heartened, however, that the court acknowledged that the manifestly egregious behaviour of the two garda&iacute; in question should not be let cast aside our respect for the dedication shown by the vast majority of members through the years.  It is important that I should make this point because I am aware that many exemplary members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na feel betrayed by what the Supreme Court characterised as the &ldquo;gravest dereliction of duty and abuse of power that one could ever fearfully contemplate would be engaged in by servants of the State and officers of law and order.&rdquo;   In addition to the formal apology already offered by the State in the context of proceedings, the Garda Commissioner has written to the individual in question offering an apology on his behalf and that of the force.  I understand this apology has been wholeheartedly accepted.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asks my view about an offer which was made by &ldquo;someone in authority&rdquo; to the person in question to the effect that if he dropped his appeal the State would not proceed with the six outstanding charges pending against him and he would be transferred to an open prison and released early.  My understanding is that while the existence of this offer only came to light during <Col N="568"/>the civil proceedings, the name or status of the person in authority who made the offer was not disclosed.  The implementation of any such offer, which in my view would have been gravely wrong, would require the agreement of the Director of Public Prosecutions as regards the prosecutorial aspects and agreement of the Minister as regards the aspects relating to imprisonment.</P>
        <P>My personal attention was not drawn to this matter until the Supreme Court issued its judgment on 21 March 2007.  The Supreme Court states the offer was made in October 1995 when neither I nor my immediate predecessor was in office.  While I am not in a position to comment on the state of knowledge of the Minister of the day, I would be very surprised if the then Minister was aware of or approved the making of such an offer.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no responsibility or authority in respect of the prosecution of criminal offences and was not party to the original prosecution or the appeal in question.  I have been informed by my officials that from the checks made within the time available, there is no evidence in the Department that either the Minister of the day or officials were parties to, consulted about or even aware of the making of an offer of this type.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Garda Commissioner to conduct inquiries into this matter to ascertain if there was any Garda involvement.  Decisions relating to the prosecution of criminal charges are a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions and I am not in a position to make any comment on that aspect.  I will, however, ask the DPP to ascertain whether any such offer was made by or made known to any person acting on behalf of the DPP.  I will also ask the Irish Prison Service and the probation service to make inquires into the making of such an offer, which I regard as a very serious matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s full response.  It is almost necessary to preface all questions of this type by stating, as the Minister did, that the great majority of garda&iacute; are fine, upstanding, hard working, diligent, law-abiding people who do the State a great service.  While I do not believe it is necessary to make this statement every time we comment on these matters, I do so because it reflects the general view.</P>
        <P>We have given extraordinary powers to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the House will later discuss a Bill which will give it further powers.  We must, therefore, have confidence that these powers will never be abused in the manner indicated by this awful case.</P>
        <P>Since I tabled the question I listened to Mr. Shortt speak on radio when he said he was very moved to receive a personal letter from the Garda Commissioner.  This was a welcome step.  Since the apology from the State, to which the Minister referred, was, to use Mr. Shortt&rsquo;s word &ldquo;dragged&rdquo; from the State&rsquo;s legal team during the <Col N="569"/>court proceedings, will the Minister take this opportunity to make a full apology to the Shortt family on behalf of the State for the egregious wrong done to them and the terrible suffering they endured?  Such a gesture would help the process of healing, understanding and moving on.</P>
        <P>The Supreme Court, in its ruling, argued that a countervailing check is required to the practice of giving particular weight to the evidence of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Robust mechanisms must be in place for this purpose and the requirement set down by the Chief Justice, that the Oireachtas take all necessary steps to ensure, in as far as is practicable, that such deliberate abuse of power is not repeated and is prevented, must be met by the House and the Minister.</P>
        <P>On the offer of early release from prison made to Mr. Shortt, I welcome the inquiries the Minister is undertaking of each of the arms of the State which may be in a position to shed light on the matter.  I am confident the Minister of the day did not have knowledge of the offer and I accept the Minister&rsquo;s word that officials in his Department were not aware of it.  We need to know the source of this offer, which placed pressure on a person who had been cruelly damaged by the State and its agents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is of some note that the judgment of the Chief Justice states: &ldquo;Who was involved in making this offer of a &rdquo;deal&ldquo; to the plaintiff and how the fulfilment of a promise to drop outstanding charges and ensure early release could have been achieved was never explored or explained in the evidence.&rdquo;  I am totally in the dark, as was the Chief Justice when he wrote the judgment, as to precisely what were the implications of that evidence.  </P>
        <P>In case my earlier remarks carried a different implication, I do not suggest that the then Director of Public Prosecutions was party to such an offer and I would be very surprised if that were the case.  This begs the question as to who was behind the making of such an offer.</P>
        <P>On Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s first question, I completely endorse and repeat, in the same terms, what the Garda Commissioner said in his letter to Mr. Shortt.  Everybody who has heard about these matters shares a sense of revulsion, shock and contrition that servants or agents of the State would behave in such a manner towards a citizen.</P>
        <P>In fairness to the lawyers acting for the State in the case, whereas they may not have offered an apology readily, lawyers are normally sent in to defend cases rather that act as Ministers of the State in making apologies.  I do not want my comments to reflect in any way on their competence or professionalism.  I am sure they were doing as they were asked in a competent and professional manner.</P>

	<P>The effect on the Shortt family is more important. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act put in place a radically different approach to accountability from that found by Mr. Justice Morris when he conducted his inquiries into events in County Donegal.  Apart from individual accountability and remedies and new disciplinary procedures, the Act also provides for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Ample inquiries have been made in the case under discussion.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission will be a very significant countervailing force.  However, if we invest members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with these very significant powers, which they must have in a sophisticated society, there is a correlative obligation of responsibility, loyalty, truthfulness and ethical behaviour that must be upheld to the highest standards.  The vast majority of garda&iacute; understand and acknowledge this and feel betrayed when one or two of their number departs, as in this case, in such a spectacularly criminal way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>At this late stage, can we explore the identity of the person who made &mdash; as was stated by the Supreme Court &mdash; a cynically arranged offer to Mr. Shortt on condition that he drop the appeal against his conviction in order to obtain early release?  Will the Minister appoint an external person to make the inquiries to which he referred, rather than simply writing a letter, so he can come back speedily to Mr. Shortt and perhaps to the House to report on how those inquiries have advanced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to add to the suffering of the individual who was so wronged by the State by dragging him into this matter.  Clearly, the individual in question must know how the offer was communicated and who communicated it, if not who was behind the making of the offer.  It may have come through lawyers but, as I do not know the facts, it is a matter I will have to examine.</P>
        <P>Before I appoint people to make these inquiries, I should make preliminary inquiries to ascertain whether there is a simple explanation for this and whether a simple identification of who was involved is possible.  Rather than establishing a formal inquiry, I would prefer to make informal inquiries to see whether I can get to the bottom of this allegation, which I regard as grave.</P>

        <Quest> if consideration has been given to expanding the Criminal Assets Bureau to include a local bureau in each of the 25 divisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12992/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I refer the Deputy to my reply of 22 February 2007 to Priority Question No. 3 in which I dealt with this subject.  I set out the following summary points in responding again today to the issue of a more localised Criminal Assets Bureau structure.  I have no difficulty in principle with a proposal for more localised CAB bureaux but what must determine our attitude is an assessment of how in practice CAB can be best structured.  I will first deal with any possible misconception that CAB&rsquo;s work is wholly centralised, without any connection or interaction with what is happening at local level.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that while the bureau requires a high degree of specialist staff for its functioning, CAB&rsquo;s operational success is very often intrinsically linked to information made available to it from local levels.  This is facilitated in particular by the work carried out by the trained criminal asset profilers who have been appointed in every Garda division in the country.  The background to this initiative is that since 2004, a programme has been in place whereby one member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from each Garda division is trained as a profiler in respect of criminal assets.  The initiative was developed by the CAB in conjunction with the office of the Director for Public Prosecutions.  A divisional asset profiler is now in place in each of the 25 Garda divisions and a full complement of divisional profilers is being maintained.  Essentially, a key function of these profilers is to ascertain and build up information at local level and point out individuals at whom the bureau&rsquo;s work can be targeted.  Such information is then investigated and followed up further by CAB.</P>
        <P>In the course of investigations, garda&iacute;, generally speaking, should be encouraged to be on the lookout for assets that appear to be the proceeds of crime.  For example, when they apprehend a bank robber and search the house, they should be on the look out for assets that look like the proceeds of crime or documents that suggest involvement in crime.</P>
        <P>There is an appetite for this task.  It would be wrong for Deputy Cuffe to take the view that CAB is simply operating in a goldfish bowl in Dublin, and does not have local eyes and ears, which it does &mdash; it has a formalised system of local eyes and ears.  It also has the backing of the entire force and interacts with other agencies within the force.  It does not operate in isolation.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="572"/>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Should we not go further than this?  In the past five years Ireland &mdash; the cities of Dublin and Limerick in particular &mdash; has seen a phenomenal rise in organised gang-related crime.  Fuelled by the massive amounts of money to be made from the trafficking and sale of drugs, gangland crimes have resulted in a dramatic increase in gun-related murders.  We need to send a clear message to the members of criminal gangs that crime does not pay.  Unfortunately, at present crime pays handsomely here.  A few weeks ago, the Minister will have heard in this House, stories of criminals claiming social welfare payments while driving around in SUVs.  These are the ones who are the driving force behind the gang-related violence we are currently experiencing.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt CAB has done good work in recent years but, by its nature, it is a centralised and limited operation, notwithstanding the trained criminal assets profilers.  It is time to consider the establishment of sub-offices throughout the country.  In the United Kingdom the Serious Organised Crime Agency works closely with the police force with regard to intelligence and operations at national level as well as the work of police forces at local level.  This link at local level is not strong enough in the Irish situation.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that the setting up of local bureaux in some or all of the Garda divisions would send a strong message to the criminal community that CAB is not only interested in high-profile drug barons in Dublin but that it and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is fighting organised crime in every corner of the country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would not like Deputy Cuffe to create the impression that CAB&rsquo;s activities are confined to the city of Dublin, which is not the case.  It is active and pursues the proceeds of crime throughout the country.  For example, it has been very active on a number of occasions in Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s constituency and has recovered very large sums of money.  It is not the case that CAB members are somehow sitting in Harcourt Square, thinking only of high profile Dublin people.</P>
        <P>The Deputy makes the point that the more CAB can do throughout the country, and the more it can operate on the basis of local information, the better.  I have conveyed these views to the Garda Commissioner and the head of CAB, who are responsible for the day to day operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and CAB respectively.  Contrary to what has been said in Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s constituency in the past couple of days, I am not micro-managing the Garda and am not in a position to direct it in one direction or another.  The Garda Commissioner decides on the deployment of resources.  Nonetheless, I have given him every encouragement to expand CAB and my Department has made available civilian accountant and forensic accounting experts to help the bureau with its work.  Nobody should <Col N="573"/>think there is any holding back by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the funding or resourcing of CAB.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This one practical measure could have more impact on organised crime here than all the provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill currently being railroaded through the House.  Infringements of the right to silence and extending the maximum periods of detention will not make this kind of crime less lucrative.  However, if we can get hold of criminals&rsquo; SUVs, cash and other property, we can certainly make it less attractive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a choice between one and the other.  I welcome the support for the Criminal Justice Bill of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and most of the political parties, with the exception of the Deputy&rsquo;s party and Sinn F&eacute;in.

       <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The perceived advantage of a separate authority is that it interposes an additional layer of independent accountability between the political process and the management of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The idea of such an authority makes perfectly good sense in the context of the UK regional police structure where there is no corresponding regional democratic unit, and in Northern Ireland, where there were and still continue to be unique requirements associated with <Col N="574"/>the need for confidence building in a cross-community environment.</P>
        <P>One important point about the Northern Ireland policing board which is often overlooked by persons who suggest a similar authority for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that the Patten Commission recommended a majority of members of the board be elected politicians in Northern Ireland.  It is not an independent policing authority in any conventional sense, but is, in its majority, a representative, political group with a minority of non-political people on it.  Therefore, when people here suggest we get rid of ministerial accountability and do what was done in Northern Ireland, nobody is suggesting that Deputies should constitute a majority on an independent policing authority.  I do not think it would be appropriate they should.</P>
        <P>Second, we do not have an example anywhere in the world of a national police service being subject to an independent authority.  This just does not happen in the common law world.  For example, the Met in London is directly responsible to the Home Secretary and to Parliament and the same applies to the RCMP.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The RCMP is an independent police force.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is our intelligence service.  It would be unspeakable and an error of monumental proportions to put that away from Government.  I appeal to the two parties opposite to consider my final point very carefully, namely that our Constitution requires the executive powers of the State to be answerable in the House to the public representatives here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should say that to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very good point.  The executive powers of the State are required by our Constitution to be the subject of accountability in the House.  That is the reason Ministers for Justice have statutory functions with regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are called to book here in the House when something goes wrong.  The Deputies opposite cannot have it both ways.  They cannot say I am not doing my job and at the same time say somebody else should make all the day-to-day decisions separately and independently from me.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We know the Minister likes to manage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a profound constitutional question with regard to a proposal that the executive function of policing the State should be hived off from Government and given to something like the RTE authority or the Health Service Executive.  That is a profoundly erroneous proposition.  It is one put forward by <Col N="575"/>the Labour Party about 20 years ago on two separate occasions in Government, but it was never progressed because it is a fundamentally suspect, unprecedented and unwise proposition.</P>
        <P>I have the authority of the Government to establish&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said the same about the establishment of an ombudsman commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I said nothing of the sort about an ombudsman commission.  I have the authority of the Government to establish an all-party policing and security committee.  That is the appropriate way for the House to act.  Members of that committee and the members of the Northern Ireland policing executive should form an all-Ireland policing forum.  That is the way forward.  I have established, in the legislation we will debate later this afternoon, an executive advisory board to bring in outside executive schools to assist the Garda Commissioner in the governance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is the right way forward and I emphatically reject the notion that it would be in any way an advance for democracy, civil liberties or anything else if the Minister in my position in a future D&aacute;il was to stand here and say he or she could not respond to the question as to why the Garda did A, B, or C because the decision was made by a group of people independent of the Minister and over whom he or she had no control.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Minister accept the current system does not work properly and we must, therefore, look for a new system?  Furthermore, does he accept that the suggestion that ultimate authority lies with the Oireachtas may be fine in theory, but does not work in practice?  Does he not recollect that only last week the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, which represents the Oireachtas, dealt with a series of Votes dealing with justice worth &euro;2.5 billion?  For a variety of reasons, mainly due to the time available to the committee, these Votes were dealt with over a period of only one and a half hours.  This is not effective accountability.  Does the Minister accept it is possible to have an independent Garda authority, which could do good work, and still have a Minister accountable to the House?  Does he accept that this does not preclude the establishment of an all-party Oireachtas security committee, something for which I have been calling for years?  These are not mutually exclusive.</P>
        <P>We should start from the position that the current system does not work properly and look for a new and better way to work.  I have listened to the Minister in the past and raised issues such as no anti-stab vests for garda&iacute;, no proper training procedures or indoor ranges for training on firearms.  His normal response is that the Garda Commissioner has all the resources he needs and <Col N="576"/>that he will get whatever he asks for.  We know this is complete baloney.  We also know the Commissioner cannot stand up openly and say it is baloney and that it is not possible.</P>
        <P>We should, therefore, create an interposing body, the composition of which can be open to discussion.  I do not see it as one that should be overloaded with politicians, but they should not be automatically excluded nor be in the majority.  I am not sure there should be any politicians on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might have the time next year to be involved on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It would have civilians who would, ultimately, be nominated by the Minister, subject to scrutiny by an Oireachtas committee.  Does the Minister not accept that in those circumstances, setting his face against it as being &ldquo;not a satisfactory system&rdquo; is the wrong way to go about it?  He should join with those parties currently in Opposition in seeking a new and fresh approach that will bring about a better result for everybody, the Garda, taxpayers and the general public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I emphatically do not &mdash; that is the short answer.  I am amazed to hear Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe say, having espoused the notion of an independent Garda authority, that he does not yet know whether elected public representatives would be part of such an authority or in what numbers.  This is astonishing.  The Deputy has obviously not even consulted with those in the Labour Party who were the real ones to draw up this policy to discover what they have in mind.</P>
        <P>I make this point strongly.  The transformation taking place in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a major revolution in accountability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The change has been dragged out of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it has not been dragged from the Government.  I am implementing and doing it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Ten years late.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>For somebody who was in a party that 20 years ago was going to establish an independent authority, I do not think the Deputy can say that what I have done in five years is wrong.</P>
        <P>The other point is that we are part of a D&aacute;il that is entitled to accountability from the Garda Commissioner, who is now the Accounting Officer for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is and will be provision in the about-to-be-formed policing committee for him to be directly amenable to questioning on the performance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by a dedicated committee of the House.  That is a major step forward.</P><Col N="577"/>
        <P>On accountability, it has been suggested by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe that it is illusory for me to say I am making resources available.  I want it on the record that I have never refused a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na application for expenditure for investment in resources.</P>
        <P>I have made tranches of money available to the Garda, and asked if it can use it.  The Commissioner is a fine man who would stand up to me and say I was letting him down financially if he thought that was the case.  Neither the Department nor its Accounting Officer has ever stinted the Commissioner on money.  The opposite is the case.  We resource the Garda and emphasise in various ways that the resources it needs are available.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner has loyally served the Garda and he does not think up ways to throw money around.  He is careful as the Accounting Officer and I appreciate the care he shows in custody of the resources he has.  It would be wrong for the House to draw the impression that I veto projects.  I must tolerate the impression that anti-stab vests are not there because I say we cannot afford them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No, that is still the case and remains so.  The Bill as proposed builds on the report of the committee on judicial conduct and ethics chaired by the former Chief Justice, Ronan Keane.  That report recognised the need for a procedure for dealing with complaints of judicial misconduct which, while serious in itself, might not warrant the ultimate sanction of impeachment by the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Consultations on the proposed Bill have, as is usual in the development of any legislative proposals, taken place with the Office of the Attorney General.  I have also considered it prudent, given the nature of the subject, to seek the observations of the Chief Justice.  Since January 2005 I have been in dialogue with the Chief Justice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the T&aacute;naiste been in dialogue with him for two and a half years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I have had several meetings with the Chief Justice on the matter and have put several models before him and asked for his views on them.  I await those views and will act on them as soon as I receive them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste will not be around to receive them.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>This borders on the farcical.  The original plan to deal with judicial misconduct and standards by this Administration, and its immediate predecessor, was to have a constitutional amendment in mid-2001.  The present T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was, I think, Attorney General at that time or shortly thereafter.  The referendum was to coincide with the Nice treaty referendum.  That proposal was dropped in a fit of pique when it was criticised.  I wrote an article on the subject for <i>The Irish Times</i> and the then Minister said he could not proceed with a constitutional amendment unless he had all-party agreement on it.  He promised instead to introduce legislation. </P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s list of legislation published in 2003 promised that the Bill would be published and every declaration, list and response to a parliamentary question since then has promised that it is coming.  I have the last two responses to parliamentary questions, in which phrases such as &ldquo;it is coming&rdquo;, or is &ldquo;imminent&rdquo; or &ldquo;will be approved by Government shortly&rdquo; or &ldquo;will be published shortly&rdquo; are used.  The T&aacute;naiste tells us he is in dialogue with the Chief Justice for further comment.  He is running out of time.  This seamless succession of Administrations has been in office for ten years.  This issue has been on the front burner, notionally, since 2001.  It is now April 2007 and nothing has been delivered.  Dialogues, discussions and analysis to beat the band have happened, with no result.  People want results.</P><Col N="580"/>
        <P>We had a brief discussion about some of the matters touching on this issue.  Since the events that gave rise to the urgency of this matter in 2001 we have endured the Curtin affair which highlighted the need for legislation in this area.  We do not have it.  Will the T&aacute;naiste agree that for all his dialogue and promises and discussions he has produced nothing in this area for his tenure in office?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

	<P>No that is not the case but, contrary to the impression that might sometimes be created, I like to consult with the Judiciary and on a matter of such importance I would be loathe to act unilaterally.

        <Quest> his plans to install two-way mirrors in every Garda station in order that victims of crime can identify a suspect without having to come face to face with that person; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to two way mirrors in his question to be to one-way mirrors.  I did not think up that line &mdash; that came from one of my officials.  Deputy Cuffe has a fan somewhere. </P>
        <P>The process by which the identification of a suspect by a victim or witness occurs is an important part of the criminal justice process.  Formal identification parades are the main way this information is tested prior to court.  In this jurisdiction, there are no published statutory provisions governing the procedure to be followed in the conduct of an identity parade.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that instructions issued to every member of the Garda set out how, based on established best practice and case law precedent, a parade should be conducted.  The current procedure used by the Garda was introduced following advice from the law officers.  It involves each participant in an identity parade being assigned a number.  To ensure there is no doubt as to the person the victim or witness has identified, it is necessary that a clear identification is made.  This may be done in a number of ways, including pointing or stating the position or number of a person on the line-up or stating a number assigned to them.  Prior to this the procedure necessitated the witness or victim placing their hand on the person as part of the identification process, which does not involve a one-way mirror.</P><Col N="582"/>
        <P>The balance in the criminal law review group, which reported to me last month, noted that it was not clear that a change in the law was required to allow the use of one-way mirrors.  The group favoured the concept of allowing an injured party to identify the suspect through a one way screen as far as practicable.  I support this recommendation in principle and I am considering it with a view to determining how it should be implemented.  Should dedicated rooms with galleries, lighting and so on be established?  Should a portable screen be used, which could be transported between Garda stations?  This involves logistics and resources exercises.  If a mirror is placed in every Garda station, how often will it be used?  Should mirrors be deployed on a divisional basis or would it be better to use a portable unit, which could permit a witness to identify somebody where he or she was being detained rather than bringing him or her to a station in which the one-way mirror system was in place?</P>
        <P>Generally, I agree completely with the Deputy that it was unsatisfactory that victims were required to put their hands on somebody but that is no longer the case.  They should not be brought into the person&rsquo;s presence but identity parades must be the subject of some formality and scrutiny because there is no point in bringing six small people and one large person in if a large person is the suspect.  Somebody must observe what happens and there must be some degree of formality.  The quality of an identity parade is hugely important to the reliability of the evidence in question.  Bearing in mind existing law, which is quite circumspect about, and suspicious of, visual identification, it is all the more important that we get this right.  I am grateful to the Deputy for raising the issue and I intend to progress it in the context of the report of the Hogan committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for noting my belated April fool&rsquo;s attempt.  However, this is a deadly serious issue and it must be an awful experience for a victim of a rape or a mugging to have to touch his or her attacker on the shoulder.  One can only imagine the trauma a victim would experience if forced to go through that.  It is almost as traumatic for the victim to look his or her attacker in the eye in a line up.</P>
        <P>It is not rocket science to retrofit one-way glass in an office in a Garda station and such a room could be used as a normal office most of the time.  It is simply a matter of adjusting the lighting behind the glass.  Will the Minister listen to the Rape Crisis Centre and Victim Support?  They want the suffering and trauma experienced by victims of such crimes to be limited.  These facilities should be in place in larger Garda stations, which experience significant crime reporting.  It is not impractical to retrofit such rooms and it is time to move on this.  This would be a small but practical step to make victims of crime feel safer when coming forward to report a crime.  It would <Col N="583"/>also send a signal that the Government and the Garda will provide support for people who have been through traumatic events.  It is grossly traumatic for a rape victim to have to face his or her attacker, look the person in the eye and, if not touch them on the shoulder, make a sign that the person attacked him or her.  That can be just as frightening as dealing with the aftermath of violence, rape or a serious assault.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to move much more quickly on this.  Many European countries have such facilities in place and they are also commonplace in the US.  As a matter of human decency, courtesy and respect, we should move ahead with such one-way mirrors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy but clearly if I was an accused person who allegedly was picked out in an identity parade and I did not see the person picking me out or did not see who was with the person at the time or what they were doing <i>vis-&agrave;-vis,</i> me, that would be a matter of concern.  One of the implications of the one-way mirror system is that the accused cannot at a later point say what was happening when he or she was identified and, therefore, a case could be made for videotaping not merely the parade itself but also the room in which the identification took place behind the mirror so it could not be said afterwards the person had difficulties pointing out somebody and pointed towards one person or another in circumstances where the accused could not see what was happening.  That is the countervailing difficulty, which would tend to suggest dedicated suites should be used for the purpose.  That, in turn, would involve making a serious decision on the number of suites throughout the State.  These issues must be considered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept he is dealing with the issue in his usual abstract, academic way?  An operational approach to the issue is needed, as Deputy Cuffe rightly highlighted.  We discussed this issue last week in the context of an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill 2007 and the Minister was at the same level referring to difficulties.  Something must be done about this because it is not a new issue.  It was mentioned in the Leahy report five years ago and it was touched on in the Hogan report last week.  There are two issues.  Is there a need for legal cover?</P>

	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Hogan report said this was doubtful and I tabled an enabling amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill in case it was needed.  The second issue is practical.  As Deputy Cuffe pointed out, one-way mirrors are used in most other countries.  We do not have to reinvent the wheel.  Can the Government not learn from <Col N="584"/>what they are doing and implement a similar system?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a total of 331 garda&iacute; are dedicated to national and regional drugs units.  These units are also supported in their work by officers from other national units such as the national bureau of criminal investigation, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  In addition, all garda&iacute; are tasked with confronting drugs-related issues as they arise.  As the Deputy will appreciate, policing operations and the deployment of Garda resources are matters for the Garda Commissioner.  It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel within the Garda organisation on a priority basis in accordance with overall policing requirements.  The Garda Commissioner responsible for the allocation of Garda officers sanctioned the immediate recruitment at a minimum of an additional two sergeants and ten garda&iacute; to the national drugs unit, thereby increasing the personnel strength of the unit to 60.  I understand that competitive interviews for these positions have recently been completed and the additional personnel will shortly be appointed.  Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed by him.  Such monitoring ensures optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best policing service is provided to the public.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the total personnel strength in all ranks of the Garda national drugs unit is 48 although that is, as I said, about to be increased to 60.  On 1 March 2007 there was one detective chief superintendent, two detective superintendents, three detective inspectors, one inspector who was a customs liaison officer, seven detective sergeants, two sergeants, 31 detective garda&iacute; and one uniformed garda.  In conjunction with this, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Com<Col N="585"/>missioner is also currently arranging for an additional allocation of personnel to the national unit.</P>
        <P>On the broader issue of Garda resources being made available by the Government, in December 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, I secured Government approval for the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000.  The Taoiseach and I have recently agreed to increase that figure to 16,000.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am consulted.  Additional Garda resources are coming on stream all the time, with an accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College.  These additional human resources will facilitate the Garda Commissioner in transforming the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the allocation of additional manpower to areas most in need.</P>
        <P>There is a demand for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na everywhere, which is why the civilianisation programme is gathering strength.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Deputy that, when his party was in office with the Labour Party, the number of garda&iacute; was allowed to decline at a time when the population was rising.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Late last year the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform described increasing gangland activity, particularly gangland murders, as analogous to attacks on the State by subversives in earlier decades.  Does he agree that the increase in gangland activity is largely based on the drugs industry in the State?  In that context, does he agree that to staff the national drugs unit with just 48 members is scandalous, considering that in 2005 there were 55 members and in 2002 there were 50?  Has he heard a firm date from the Commissioner as to when the additional members, bringing the complement up to the weak target of 60, will be appointed?</P>
        <P>Seizures of heroin last year amounted to 136 kg with an estimated street value of &euro;27.2 million.  That represented a fourfold increase on the volume of seizures in 2005 and, as is evident from international statistics, that is only a fraction of the volume of heroin available on the streets.</P><Col N="586"/>
        <P>Was the Minister as shocked as I was by the test undertaken by DCU on banknotes in which 100%, of an admittedly small sample, showed signs of cocaine?  Does he accept that cocaine now pervades society across this country and is widely used?  If the words he uttered at the end of last year are to be taken seriously, does he not agree that having a national drugs unit with fewer members than years ago is lamentable?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will put this discussion in context.  We discussed the Criminal Assets Bureau earlier and the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of numbers involved in the battle against drugs has grown substantially over recent years but they are located across the country.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have the numbers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The 331 officers to whom I referred are the ones on whom we should concentrate, as opposed to those in the centralised unit.  The same arguments made by Deputy Cuffe for localising resources apply to CAB.  At the end of December 2002, there were 50 people in the national drugs unit and in 2003 there were 52.  In 2004 the unit had 49 members, in 2005 it had 55 and in 2006 there were 48.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 48 now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.  It has not changed by more than a handful over that period.  However, the strength of drug units nationally has expanded substantially in the same period.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Howlin that drugs are a very serious issue but drugs units are not the only component of the battle against gang land.  Detective units carrying out surveillance and other operations and the armed detective units who participated in Operation Anvil and Operation Oak work shoulder to shoulder with the drug detectives so the 331 garda&iacute; and 48 members of the national drugs unit do not represent the total complement dealing with gangland activity.</P>
        <P>I also agree with the Deputy that cocaine specifically is a very serious problem and have spoken out against the notion that it is a recreational drug which people are free to take in a libertarian way without consequence to others.  There is a direct consequence to others as there cannot be cocaine without cocaine cartels or cocaine cartels without people being shot down.  The consumption of cocaine has profound effects on our society.</P>
        <P>The test carried out by DCU was very interesting because it suggests cocaine is widely available in Ireland.  If, however, money is sorted and counted in machines, cross-contamination may occur and the fact that every note had a trace of cocaine could well be a result of cocaine-soiled notes being sorted with others.  I do not draw the <Col N="587"/>conclusion that every note in people&rsquo;s pockets has recently been in the hands of a drug user.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>A variety of notes were tested and some contamination levels were very high.  Some had a concentration greater than two nanograms per note and some had levels 100 times higher, so the traces were not tiny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Nanograms are very small.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no idea how big a nanogram is.  A similar survey on dollar bills in the US showed 65% to be contaminated so it is worrying.</P>
        <P>The Minister said there were 12 vacancies, for two sergeants and ten garda&iacute;, to bring the complement of the national drugs unit up to 60.  There is agreement that their recruitment is a minimum requirement so when can we expect them to be in place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Competitive interviews were carried out recently so appointments will follow very rapidly.  I cannot give a date as I do not micromanage the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>While obviously it is difficult to predict in advance the extent to which ASBOs will be resorted to, there is absolutely no question of a lack of resources inhibiting the effective operation of ASBOs.</P>
        <P>I directed the commencement of Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings for anti-social behaviour by adults, on 1 January 2007.  The application by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the courts for a civil order comes at the end of a process.  The first step in the procedure is that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issues a behaviour warning to a person who has behaved in an anti-social manner.  The behaviour warning warns the person that failure to comply with the demand may result in an application to the courts for a civil order or that <Col N="588"/>issuing of a subsequent behaviour order might also result in an application to the courts for a civil order.  If a behaviour warning or a series of warnings does not result in the person changing his or her behaviour, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may apply to the District Court for a civil order to prohibit the person from doing anything specified in the order.  An order will remain in force for a period specified in the order, which cannot be longer than two years.  If no period is specified, an order will remain in force for two years.  The penalties for breach of an order are a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or a maximum of six months imprisonment or both.</P>
        <P>I commenced Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children on 1 March 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by children, including: a warning from a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian; referral to the Garda juvenile diversion programme; and the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am advised by the Garda authorities that the number of behaviour warnings recorded since 1 January 2007 is 21.  There have been no civil orders for adults or behaviour orders for children sought in this period, which is to be expected in view of what I have just told the House.  For both adults and children, a behaviour warning remains in place for three months from date of issue.  For children specifically, a good behaviour contract lasts for six months, but may be renewed for a further three months.  The approach the legislation adopts is to make every effort so that the child and his or her parents or guardian address the child&rsquo;s behavioural problems in a way that minimises contact with the courts system.  The Act ensures there is full parental involvement at all relevant stages.  It is therefore highly unlikely that a Garda officer would apply for a civil order or a behaviour order before the end of these periods.</P>
      
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P>I am confident the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to operate the provisions of the Act.</P>
        <P>The detailed allocation of Garda resources, including the allocation of personnel to various units is a matter for the Garda authorities.  The deployment of Garda personnel throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, is continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>In December 2006, I announced Government approval for 300 additional civilian support staff for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to release an equal number of garda&iacute; from administrative duties and <Col N="589"/>free them up for operational policing duties.  The Garda Commissioner has signed a service level agreement with the Public Appointments Service for the provision of candidates on a weekly basis to be offered positions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na until the 300 clerical officer posts are filled.  Since the beginning of the year, 93 additional clerical officers have been appointed to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and a further 46 persons have been offered a clerical officer post.  It is anticipated that some of the newly recruited clerical officers will carry out administrative tasks on the administration of the provisions of the legislation.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength, all ranks, of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,178, following the attestation of 273 new members on 14 March 2007.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702, all ranks, on 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 2,776, more than 23% in the personnel strength of the force during that period.  The combined strength, all ranks, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training on 14 March was 14,258.  Furthermore, on 19 December 2006 as part of the package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000.  The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met.  The Garda budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and its highest level ever.</P>
</Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ascertain the additional burden on the Garda and whether it was fully evaluated.  Clearly considerable time will be spent on tracking, as was the case in the UK where much administration of ASBOs is involved.  Many of the activities that are the subject of ASBOs relate to criminal rather than anti-social behaviour.  Breaking up bus shelters, phone boxes etc. is rightly within the remit of the Garda.  Before I was elected to this House I was critical of us having many laws without the ability to put them into practice because of resource issues or failure to think out the practical elements of applying the law.  What evaluation was done on the application of such orders prior to the introduction of legislation?  Is it a case of introducing legislation and then discovering how it pans out?  I am concerned that we might divert garda&iacute; from activities like community policing and areas where they are most visible.  We will spread the resources even more thinly because they will have to deal with even more administration.  What resource implications were considered prior to the introduction of the legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has a somewhat mathematical approach to the matter.  I cannot say in advance, nor can anybody make an intelligent guess as to the level of resources that would <Col N="590"/>be applied unless we came to a conclusion on how many such orders would be issued.  If I were asked in December how many orders would be issued by the start of April, I could not have predicted whether it would have been 21 or 221.  I was not in a position to say that.  Local Garda superintendents take a very shrewd and experienced view on what they want to do with their resources.  They need to make decisions on community policing and other issues, including whether it is appropriate to issue an ASBO in a particular case or to use the conventional criminal law.</P>
        <P>For instance vandalising a phone kiosk is not anti-social behaviour; it is a criminal offence.  For a garda who is aware that an individual has behaved in that way, I do not believe it is appropriate &mdash; I venture my opinion &mdash; to regard that simply as anti-social behaviour.  It is something more serious; it is a criminal offence.  I do not suggest that it needs to proceed to a criminal trial.  On some occasions the youth diversion programme might represent the appropriate approach to keep children out of trouble and juvenile liaison officers may be the appropriate people to address such matters.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question presupposes that someone sat down at a desk and decided that 400 orders would be issued by June 2007, consuming 380 man-hours which would be taken from the community-policing budget.  That kind of operation does not take place.  If we were to decide to change the limits for drink driving, nobody would sit down to decide how many additional prosecutions would take place because they do not know.  The Garda makes a decision based on policy and afterwards it ascertains how the offence carries through.  While I am not trying to avoid the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I have a sneaking suspicion that she does not like ASBOs at all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point.  Therefore she is asking whether a mathematical exercise was carried out to determine the amount of resources necessary to make them effective.  The answer is that it was not.  We do not live in a command economy where somebody can sit in a room and predict on the basis of 1,000 ASBOs by December so many additional Garda resources would be necessary.  The real world does not work that way.</P>

	<P>When the debate adjourned earlier, we were discussing a register of sentences.  A number of options are open to us on the broader question of sentencing guidelines.  In continental Europe under the civil law system, which is somewhat more structured than our system, minimum and maximum sentences are provided for.  In general under the common law system, it is for the Judiciary to decide within certain maxima what sentence is appropriate.  I agree with Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe that it is not satisfactory for individual courts to operate so much in isolation from each other.  Consistency requires a collective effort.  It is important for us to have a means of harnessing what I believe is good will on the part of the Judiciary towards making that effort to achieve consistency.  The Denham committee, which I mentioned earlier, is an important forum in which to address the issue.</P>
        <P>It appears to be implicit in some of the reports I have read recently that if something is going wrong with sentencing it is the function of the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal sentences with which he is unhappy.  If it is going wrong, it is not fair to ask the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal all these cases to get it right.  There is a tendency in some areas, and it is by no means prevalent, to do some hand washing and say that if there is a major problem, the Director of Public Prosecutions would be appealing the cases and that since he is not appealing a significant number of cases, there is not a significant problem.  There is a significant problem with consistency of sentencing.</P>
        <P>Although it might have been reassuring to somebody in my position to watch the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme a few nights ago, in which a jury was more severe in its attitude than the Judiciary appears to be in respect of a number of specimen cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not like to appear before a few of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;it is a fact that judges deal with a huge volume of cases.  We generally do not allow juries to determine penalties.  If one is faced with a murderer on one day and on succeeding days with a rapist, a burglar, an assaulter, a white collar thief, a child abuser and somebody in court on a child pornography charge, it allows one to see the broad mass of humanity and to see crimes in a more general context.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="593"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>One is inured to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The point can also be made that judges get tired and worn out with the volume of crime with which they must deal and that they lose the freshness of anger and dissatisfaction that people facing the issue for the first time would have.  The truth lies between the two positions.  That is the reason I do not believe we should have a system of selection of penalties by juries or that we should always assume that the penalty agreed on by, for example, an audience of 100 in an RTE studio would necessarily be the correct penalty.  By the same token, we cannot assume the contrary, that is, that whatever the Judiciary decides in every case is always right.  That is an equally extreme point of view and is not correct either.</P>
        <P>I am strongly of the view that it is necessary for the Judiciary to create databases and a common consciousness, to provide information, to receive input from outside and to study issues collectively, not just individually.  I am not talking about judges reading <i>The Irish Times</i> over their cornflakes and coming to individual views, but about holding seminars on, for example, the extent of the drugs problem in Ireland and the <i>modus operandi </i>of drug gangs.  They would assess such issues by reference to collective self-education.  I do not like the notion of judicial training, as if judges are a group of circus animals who can be told to do things and respond in certain ways by having a political whip cracked at them.  However, self-education is not simply a matter of musing quietly on the ways of the world based on the caseload that comes before an individual judge.  There is a requirement that the Judicial Studies Institute should engage in collective deliberation and discussion about what is the appropriate response to a particular form of crime.</P>
        <P>The all-party committee on sexual offences heard valuable evidence on some aspects of the criminal law.  It was an educational process.  The Judiciary organises conferences but I believe that process must be dynamised to ensure that judges really engage in collective discussion about, for example, what it is appropriate to do with a 23 year old man who rapes a girl and what is the fair approach to that issue.  It does no harm to consider hypothetical cases in the context of actual cases.  I am not asking the judges to behave like robots but to step up massively their collective activities in these areas.  It does not infringe on their independence.  Collective action by the Judiciary to bring about cohesion in its approach to sentencing is hugely important.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to spend too much time on this issue but I will make a final point.  There is a view expressed in today&rsquo;s newspapers that the role of the Judiciary in criminal law is purely as arbitrator in an adversarial process, but that is not the case.  It is the case when judges are adjudicating <Col N="594"/>in an adversarial process, but sentencing is not an adversarial process.  Sentencing is a process where the judge is the instrument of criminal justice.  It is not a matter of asking what the prosecution and the defence consider to be the appropriate sentence and deciding between the two.  That is a wholly wrong model of the function of a criminal judge in the common law system.</P>
        <P>It is the function of the Judiciary, affirmatively, to select appropriate penalties.  It is also its function, in this context, to protect society and to uphold public confidence in the system of law and public cohesion in the face of crime.  Furthermore, it is its function to hold open the prospect of rehabilitation and to deal with cases not only on an individual basis, because all offenders are different, but also on a collective basis, because all offences fall into broad categories and ranges.</P>
        <P>There appears to be an idea that it is somehow impossible to bring to the sentencing process a dynamised, active, collective approach by the Judiciary, and that judges are individual, autonomous units who operate independently of each other, but I do not accept that proposition.  I believe there is a collective responsibility on the part of judges &mdash; I do not mean this critically &mdash; to confer widely with each other and to come to consensus views on a sustainable, cohesive approach to sentencing policy.  It is not the case that the traditional view of the judge as the arbiter between contending sides applies in the sentencing process.  Judges are integral to the protection of everybody&rsquo;s rights under the Constitution, most particularly societal rights and the rights of individual victims.</P>
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a different approach from the Minister.  It is not the job of the judges to provide a database any more than it is their job to provide a courthouse.  It is the job of the Executive and the Oireachtas to provide the means by which the judges do their job.  One of those means is the provision of courthouses, the other is the provision of databases or registers of sentences, which is what I propose in this amendment.  I accept that the judges should have an input and that the Denham committee can have an input, but it is not up to that committee to supply a database or a register of sentences.  It does not have the resources to do so.  That is a matter for the Executive.</P>
     
        <P>I do not approve of open criticism of judges, some of which I have heard from the Minister.  It might be populist but it is improper.  That is not to say that judges should not be answerable for their role.  It is for that reason I support the establishment of a judicial council.  It has not yet been established, but it will be.  I followed the proceedings of the Curtin committee and have no doubt about the need for such a council.  However, that is another day&rsquo;s work.  I am talking about all this in the context of consistency of sent<Col N="595"/>encing.  I also firmly believe it is the one area which really undermines public confidence in our criminal justice and judicial system.  This is something about which we must be absolutely careful.  It is also something for which we have an answer, but the answer lies with us, be it the Executive or the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the role of the DPP.  The DPP has a role, but we cannot expect him to go beyond the role we have given him, which is provided for in legislation, except in one respect.  We have given the DPP a role from the point of view of appealing on the grounds of leniency in certain circumstances.  I envisage that if we have consistency of sentencing, this role would only be used in very limited circumstances.  The one additional role I want to see the DPP play is in respect of sentencing.  Whatever about the Bar Council, whose guidelines in respect of the prosecution approach to sentencing are wrong, the DPP should arrange in every case to make a plea in prosecution if he considers it appropriate, without being asked by the judge, which is the current situation.  I am not talking about the DPP demanding 20 years, as they do under continental courts.  Rather, he should point out particular issues which are of an aggravating nature and which would be at the higher end of the guidance I wish to come to next.</P>
        <P>It is mainly the job of the Executive, but with the support of the Oireachtas, to establish guidelines, as other common law countries have done.  This is our job from the point of view of trying to ensure this consistency.  We should establish the tariffs and guidelines.  This is what happens in other countries so why do we not do it?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The public has an interest from the point of view of ensuring, as far as possible, that hardened criminals are sent away.  That is its main interest.  I saw the RTE programme on the matter and like everybody else, I would not like to be judged by the panel in respect of a sentence.  It was a cross-section of opinion.  They want hardened criminals to get tough sentences.</P>
        <P>How do we achieve that and how do we achieve fairness and consistency?  I very much push the approach about which I am talking, beginning with this amendment and the register of sentences, and following it with pleas at the sentencing hearing, particularly from the DPP, guidelines and an explanation from the judge if he or she goes outside the tariffs or guidelines.</P>
        <P>The other point where I differ somewhat from the Minister is in respect of judicial training.  Everybody needs training, not just animals in the zoo.  Anybody who wants to do a job properly needs ongoing training.  We have it in the Law Society from the point of view of continuing training.  I imagine it exists at the Bar, but I am not as sure.  Everybody needs to continually upgrade their skills and keep in touch with changes.</P><Col N="596"/>
        <P>Again, we have a role here.  I am all for judges having meetings, including, on occasion, those in pleasant surroundings.  I have no problem with that, but, again, it is for the Executive and the Oireachtas to ensure proper facilities are available from the point of view of judicial training.  It exists in other countries so why does it not exist here on a formalised basis?</P>
        <P>I accept the criticism in respect of the way in which my amendment is drafted.  The Minister effectively suggests that my amendment and I are too perfect.  I plead guilty.  I have been too prescriptive in respect of amendment No. 66.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Pleading guilty to being perfect &mdash; I thought I did that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of the source of the accusation.  I would be quite prepared to accept, provided the enabling provision was there, that the detail is probably something that would be better spelled out in regulation.  This is all the more reason to start, as was rightly pointed out by the Minister, with certain basic things on a register, subject to the development of the appropriate technology.  One would not start with all the details in amendment No. 66 because it would take quite some time before one developed the technology to include any of those.</P>
        <P>This is the right way forward.  I cannot bring it any further at this stage.  I hope I have convinced everybody that this is the way forward from the point of view of a register and guidelines.  Without any great hope that the Minister will do anything about it in the short time left to him in office, I can only say this should be put on the Statute Book at an early date and I hope, with others, to be in a position to ensure this is done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very conscious of time.  We have three hours in which to reach very important parts, including this part because the Minister has moved a great distance from his original proposal in respect of sentencing.  We need to deal with the Minister&rsquo;s amendments and tease them out.</P>
        <P>Having said that, I will make a few important observations about the debate we have had and try to do so without being seen to talk about any particular cases.  We must examine an issue &mdash; I will not say it is a difficulty &mdash; with the operation of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Certainly, judges in their courts are looking over their shoulders to some extent at the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Some say that this is the way it should be, but the Court of Criminal Appeal is not a fixed court.  There is not necessarily consistency coming from that court, depending on its individual make-up.</P>
        <P>I do not know instantly how we are going to solve that, but it is an issue we must resolve.  If there is to be an appellate court that is setting down the pattern of sentencing, that in itself must be consistent.  We must achieve this.  I am concerned that judges are now saying that if they had <Col N="597"/>their way, they would give what they would deem to be an appropriate sentence but, having regard to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in a similar case dealt with by them, they will not give a sentence they deem to be appropriate.  This is an issue which we must address in some way.</P>
        <P>We come back to the issue I raised this morning and again in respect of one of my priority questions, namely, judicial standards.  I do not have any difficulties with using the phrase &ldquo;judicial training&rdquo; because other professions are trained.  What used to be called teacher training colleges and are now called colleges of education provide training.  Training in a professional capacity is no bad thing, we should not shy away from it and one does not need to say it is analogous to training circus animals.  It is professional training to have consistency, understand what is required and apply broad experience from others to it.</P>
        <P>I am intrigued that the Minister said the Judiciary needs a common consciousness in respect of it.  This sounds vaguely like something out of the 1960s.  How we going to get this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">Maybe he is a child of the 1960s.  I thought when the others were wearing their flares and flower power outfits, the Minister was wearing his FCA uniform, so he was out of step even then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to recapture that issue in a way that, as I said, has been off the agenda since the former Chief Justice&rsquo;s report on this in 2000.  I do not wish to spend any more time on it.  The net issue we must deal with is the need for a common database.  I am impressed by the argument put forward by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe that this is something that should not be <i>ad hoc</i> and that one should not take an approach that says &ldquo;right lads, you are the professionals and if, by chance, you agree it and can input it into it and sure we will even give you a few bob to do the technology for it&rdquo;.  Having a look at what are common practices and similar cases, what colleague judges have decided in these matters and what body of sentences has been built up should be part incrementally over time of the service provided by the Courts Service to the Judiciary in a modern professional democracy.  If we are not going to accept it in this legislation, we will accept a model like this very shortly as a proper function of the Courts Service, although it may not be as ambitious a model <i>ab initio</i>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to make one final comment.  The Minister said that he did not want the DPP to be catapulted into a parallel judging system, as his role is to appeal constantly.  I provided another role for the DPP and I want to highlight it now simply to keep it in the mix.  Where there is interference with the jury and that interference becomes apparent afterwards, there must be some mechanism whereby such a wrongful decision can be adjusted.  Another issue is where there is compelling new evidence for very serious cases, but I do not want to go off on a tangent again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to delay this, but I would like to respond to Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe.  The Courts Service is a unique body.  It is mainly run by the Judiciary and it is independent of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is responsible for servicing the courts system, for getting the databases together, for producing annual reports and for collating statistics.  That is its function.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Who sets its budget?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the service has its own Accounting Officer, but the Department provides it with a block Vote every year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Do its officers say what they need, or does the Minister tell them what they are getting?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an Estimates process.  They come to me and they get a block Vote.  The chief executive of the Courts Service is the Accounting Officer.  In case people think that the Executive still runs everything, gets all the information and leaves it on a shelf, I would like to say that this is not so.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not do that anymore.  That is all done by the Courts Service, which is independent of the Department.  The only issue is resourcing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister sets its task under the Act.  Its duties are defined by this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  I was just making the point that the Judiciary is not acting as a group of amateurs when running a data project of its own.  That is its function.  One of the key functions of the Courts Service is to inform the Judiciary on what is going on.  The old-fashioned notion that the Department does everything and the judges are helpless does not exist anymore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister saying that the judges or the Courts Service or both should establish this register?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="599"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes.  Nothing is holding them back.  One of the functions of the Courts Service would be to assist the Judiciary in this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Do we not set those functions in law?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Denham committee is not some notion that occurred among judges in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green one afternoon.  They run all of these things and are quasi autonomous in this area.  They collectively decide whether to sponsor Dr. Coulter&rsquo;s report and so on.  They do not come to me looking for money for these things.</P>
        <P>Before the DPP was given a right of appeal against unduly lenient sentences, there was a provision that somebody could have his or her sentence increased on appeal, but the only appeal was at the instigation of the accused.  When that was the case, nobody ever said that it was for the prosecution to demand sentences.  It was clearly understood that it was the personal responsibility of the trial judge at the time to get it right.  In those days when the DPP had no right to appeal, it was all the more reason for the judge to get it right.  If the sentence was unduly lenient, nothing could be done about it at all.</P>
        <P>I am counselling the House not to go down the road where the judges should retire to being independent arbiters between two conflicting views.  That would be a heinous error.  Part of the job of a judge is to be an independent arbiter between two sides at that stage of the case, but an equally serious part is to take on the role of defending the Irish people&rsquo;s constitutional rights by punishing crime in an appropriate way.  It is not just a question of being between two contending views.  The judge must take on the personal responsibility to get the appropriate sentence.</P>
        <P>There is a deep philosophical trend emerging which states that if the judges are getting it wrong, the DPP should tell them.  That is not right.  It is for the Judiciary to get it right in the first instance and on appeal.  Judges will not approach cohesion and consistency if they do not sit down together and discuss hypothetical cases, if they do not generate the database we mentioned, if they do not keep each other informed of what they are doing and if they do not take collective responsibility for this area of law which is their responsibility alone.  I am passionate about this because there is a tendency to say that every individual case is different from all other cases and all judges are free to do what they think, as there is an appellate process to correct them if they get it wrong.  That is totally unhistorical.  When imposing sentence, it is the function of a judge to defend Irish society from crime.  He must impose a sentence that commands public confidence and there is no escaping that obligation.  He cannot say that the media and the politicians are all wrong and he is all right.  Judges are independent, but part of their independence is <Col N="600"/>that they owe a duty to Irish society to get their decisions right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister in favour of a prosecution&rsquo;s submission on sentencing, which is a basic part of my approach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the Deputy, I do not believe that a prosecutor should demand 18 years or something like that.  If the Courts Service developed a corpus of data, it should be open to a prosecutor to draw to the attention of a judge precedents from the Court of Criminal Appeal, as well as the general pattern of sentencing in an area.  It should be reasonable to put those points before a judge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.  I do not think that speech is an aggravation or necessary.  When imposing sentence, a judge should have obtained from the Garda the effects on the victim, the antecedents on the accused and he should have the facts of the case fairly clearly in his or her mind.  A judge does not need speeches to remind him or her of that.  We do not have to go down the road where people are demanding this or that penalty, but we need a common understanding by the Judiciary of principles that should apply to the sentence.</P>
        <P>Nearly 20 years ago, I was a barrister in The People (DPP) <i>v</i>. Tiernan, which dealt with the reduction in a 21 year sentence for rape.  From memory, I think it was reduced to 16 or 17 years.  In that case, the Supreme Court stated that rape was such an offence that it demanded an immediate and substantial prison sentence in every circumstance, except in highly unusual circumstances which the court could not imagine.  That was a principle, but I do not know what has happened since because we now have suspended sentences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I made my pitch.  The T&aacute;naiste takes a different philosophical approach from mine.  Although we may not be 100 miles apart in our objective, I believe that there is a better way <Col N="601"/>of achieving it.  We will have to agree to differ on that.  I agree with him on the issue of rape and the decision of the Supreme Court.  Rape is one of the most heinous crimes imaginable and anybody convicted of rape should automatically have a custodial sentence imposed.  That would be a starting point in dealing with rape.  However, I feel the counsel for the prosecution should have a duty on sentence to point that out to the judge.  We must agree to differ on this point.</P>
        <P>We have had a good debate on these issues and there are other amendments to consider.  Perhaps we can discuss this further on Report Stage.  I will not press the amendments.</P>

	<P>I move amendment<?oasys _jy ?>No. 69:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 18, to delete lines 21 to 44, to delete pages 19 and 20 and in page 21, to delete lines 1 to 11.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment proposes to delete section 24, which deals with sentencing in its entirety.  However, I will deal first with amendments Nos. 70 and 80, which are alternatives to amendment No. 69.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 70 and 80 propose that the provision that section 24 applies to offences specified in Schedule 2 should include an exception in the case of &ldquo;an offence under section 2 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 unless the offender in committing the offence acted for the purpose of making profit&rdquo;.  It is preferable that we should have a Bill dealing specifically with human trafficking rather than attempting to deal with the issue by stealth.</P>
        <P>Members on this side of the House, as well as some Deputies on the other side, have been pushing for legislation on human trafficking for several years.  In the absence of such legislation, it is difficult to ascertain whether this section should stand.  There are instances, for example, where a person may have assisted another in good conscience, rather than for personal gain, to enter the State and avail of its protection and sanctuary.  I understand what the Minister is trying to do here but I am not sure it is appropriate.  Those who are involved in the trafficking trade, which is essentially modern day slavery, deserve the harshest  possible punishment.  However, the imposition of mandatory sentencing may lead to the criminalis<Col N="602"/>ation of people who have acted in good conscience.  It is inappropriate to deal with such persons through these provisions.  Separate legislation is required.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 69 proposes to delete section 24 in its entirety.  The Minister admitted earlier that a working group on sentencing outcomes is engaged in ongoing work.  Would it not be better to await the report of this &ldquo;judge-led initiative&rdquo;, as the Minister described it, before introducing legislative provisions on sentencing?  I do not know the timeframe within which this working group must report; it may be open ended.  It is only after we receive its report that we should consider what is appropriate to include in legislation.</P>
        <P>I have made the case during debates on other legislation that mandatory sentencing is ineffective and inoperable.  Experience in other jurisdictions shows that mandatory minimum sentences do not necessarily reduce the incidence of drug related crime, drug supply or drug abuse.  Many of those in our prison system are drug abusers.  It is they who are most likely to be subjected to this provision because they are the people most likely to re-offend.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not condone such reoffending.  However, it is incumbent on us to ensure there is adequate investment in rehabilitative and support services for prisoners who are drug abusers when they enter jail.  We must ensure they are drug-free when they leave.  Otherwise, we face the prospect of increasing numbers of those convicted of crimes related to their drug habit returning to prison.  I do not excuse such crimes, but far more must be done before we go down this road.  Supports must be put in place to ensure the rate of recidivism is reduced to a level similar to that in the rest of Europe.  It is only when we have achieved such a reduction that we should consider the provisions proposed in this Bill for re-offenders.</P>
        <P>There is a danger that the imposition of mandatory sentences may discourage some accused persons from pleading guilty, which is helpful to both the court system and the victims in ensuring a speedier trial.  There is no inducement for persons charged with a crime to engage with the justice system in this regard because they know they will, on conviction, be subject to three quarters of the maximum sentence for a second offence, for example.  There is no leeway to encourage accused persons to co-operate with the courts.</P>
        <P>The Human Rights Commission, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and others have raised this issue in the context of the accused&rsquo;s right to a fair trial.  A mandatory sentencing regime means that the sentence is already decided before the person is even brought before the courts.  Questions have also been raised as to whether sections 24 and 30 in particular would withstand the test of a constitutional challenge from the perspective of proportionality.  The Minister does not <Col N="603"/>like opening the way for barristers to receive even more money.  We should do everything we can to ensure this legislation is not subject to constitutional challenges that tie up the courts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have made my arguments on mandatory sentencing before.  I know where the Minister is coming from and I do not agree with him.  The Human Rights Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties have pointed to elements of case law that are relevant to this issue.  I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s opinion on some of these.  For example, they refer to the comment by &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh CJ in Deaton <i>v</i>. the Attorney General:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">... It is inconceivable to my mind that a Constitution which is broadly based on the doctrine of separation of powers... could have intended to place in the hands of the Executive the power to select the punishment to be undergone by citizens.  It would not be too strong to characterise such a system of Government as one of arbitrary power... In my opinion the selection of punishment is an integral part of the administration of justice and, as such, cannot be committed to the hands of the Executive.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">In The State (Healy) <i>v. </i>Donoghue,  Henchy J. stated that the Constitution, by virtue of Articles 38.1, 40.3.1&deg;, 40.3.2&deg;  and 40.4.1&deg; &ldquo; necessarily implies ... where guilt has been established or admitted, of receiving a sentence appropriate to his degree of guilt and the relevant personal circumstances&rdquo;.  That is one of the issues, that there needs to be proportionality and it needs to be taken into account rather than in each case the sentence is already decided under this section.  Other points have been raised on the issue of sentencing.  I urge the Minister to reconsider deleting this section.</P>
        <P>We have not had the debate that should have taken place on this issue in the preparation of this legislation or the time between Second and Committee Stages.  If we had taken more time it would have been interesting to hear the views of various interested groups.  That is the way we should approach judicial legislation of this magnitude.  There are many different parts of this Bill that need to be teased out in greater detail.  Thankfully the Bill has been recommitted, but it is a pity we do not have sufficient time to debate it because once it is passed we will not come back to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not often I fully agree with our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues, but certainly I am in total agreement on the issue of adequate time to debate the approach in section 24.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Are we open to a coalition then?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a step too far.  Section 24 is a concept that was pulled out of the blue by the Minister and it is a matter for him to stand it <Col N="604"/>up, not in a tabloid headline but on whether the approach adopted is the appropriate one for inclusion in our criminal justice system.  My basic approach is that it is necessary for the Minister to show that what he is proposing will have sensible, good, practicable outcomes in stemming the tide of criminal activity.  That is what most of us would be interested in, drawing possibly on similar approaches in other countries, because we have not had the benefit of advices, consultative documents or submissions in committee or otherwise on this approach.  The nearest we get to it is, perhaps, watching the &ldquo;three strikes and you are out&rdquo; approach in the United States of America.  The Minister has a responsibility in objective terms to support the wisdom of including this approach.  If he has an approach that stands up I will back it, but the onus is on him because he has produced this argument to convince the House that this will be an additional weapon in the fight against serious crime, which will have a practical outcome.</P>
        <P>It is clear there is no point in introducing such a measure if it is going to fall on constitutional grounds.  That is an issue that needs to be examined in light of some questions that have been raised.</P>
        <P>Other aspects arise in regard to the section and the amendments tabled thereto. This is a section that deals with minimum sentences for repeat offenders.  I am advised there is a lacuna in the section in that in calculating the seven year period to which repeat offending gives rise, the lengthier sentence, the period of imprisonment for the first offence is excluded.  It appears to mean that offences committed while in prison would not attract the new sentencing regime.  If the proposal is to go ahead the provision should be amended so that it should apply to any offence committed during the period of imprisonment for the first offence and for seven years after the release of the offender.  That is a gap that should be closed if we are to proceed with this approach.</P>
        <P>Before I return to the basic point, I want to know what prompted this measure and why the Minister considers that the element of judicial discretion in sentencing should be removed in this situation.  What is the benefit to be achieved from the point of view of our criminal justice system? This is harking back to our previous debate on the whole issue of sentencing.  This is in a situation where we have no register of sentences or database in this jurisdiction.  That is the starting point.  We cannot have a proper analysis of the levels and effectiveness of sentencing penalties as of now.  We do not have the database so we cannot give an analysis as to the benefit or otherwise of the levels and effectiveness of sentencing penalties.  In a sense we are in the dark on that issue.  The failure to put such a system in place is as much a serious impediment to a rational approach to the adjustment of maximum sentences by the Oireachtas as it is to the assess<Col N="605"/>ment by the Court of Criminal Appeal of the appropriateness of the sentence imposed in any particular case.</P>
        <P>We are all looking at the &ldquo;debate&rdquo; on sentencing and to a large degree we are affected by tabloid-like expressions of outrage at particular sentences &mdash; that is understandable &mdash; and, as I mentioned earlier, the appropriate and justifiable ministerial attacks on courts and judges.</P>
        <P>The genesis of this section goes back to the press release of 13 February which states that the new sentencing regime will apply to persons convicted of &ldquo;firearms, drug trafficking or other offences associated with gangland activity&rdquo; who reoffend within seven years.  My immediate reaction to the Minister&rsquo;s press release was, hear, hear.  I am in favour of that and I want to join in the effort to stop those who are involved in firearms, drug trafficking or other offences associated with gangland activities.  I agree with the Minister on that.  Let us be blunt about it, this section makes no mention of gangland activity, although the press release did.  Many of the offences scheduled to the Act probably will be committed by people with no connection to gangland activities.  Offences such as causing serious harm, threats to kill or cause serious harm, false imprisonment, burglary, blackmail, all of which are serious, are by no means always associated with gangland activity.  There is a confusion as to the objective in so far as that objective is translated into the actual framing of the section.</P>
        <P>We have overlooked who may be caught by the terms of this section.  There is no doubt that the prime people who will be caught are the first in line, not the gangland people, but drug addicts.  I will not go on record as having huge sympathy for drug addicts, particularly those who use dreadful means to feed their habit, but at the same time I do not associate drug addicts with gangland activity, at least not automatically.</P>
        <P>As I understand it, having spoken to people who practise in the field, in some instances drug addicts may be attempting to come to terms with their addiction.  I gather that there is some success rate there but maybe we do not have sufficient support facilities to help them.  Such support should be available for those who are attempting to come to terms with their addiction.  It might be that the just man may fall a few times on the route while dealing with the addiction, so is it proper to lump him off to jail for ten years in such a situation?  Let us be frank about it &mdash; despite the best efforts of governors and prison officers the level of support available is inadequate.</P>
        <P>Contempt of court by intimidating witnesses is one of the most disturbing features of gangland activity, yet this aspect is not covered by the section.  As I understand it, that is not treated as a serious offence under it.  The Minister has, and always has had, my support in genuine efforts to cope with serious crime, particularly gangland <Col N="606"/>crime.  Overall, however, the blunderbuss approach is not the way to deal with serious crime and gangland crime in particular.  We need a more calibrated approach which will distinguish between those who, on the one hand, commit crimes because their circumstances are desperate and pathetic and, on the other, hardened criminals who are motivated by avarice and do not care for anyone else in society.  Members of the latter group will commit any heinous act, including murder, to achieve their objectives.</P>
        <P>I am not opposed in principle to what the Minister is trying to achieve but I am concerned that this section will not achieve the objective he has outlined.  I am also concerned that people, although I will not categorise them as innocent, who do not fit into the category of those we are after &mdash; the tough, hardened gangland criminals &mdash; particularly those who may be making an effort to mend their ways, may fall foul of these provisions.  Above all, my real concern is that because of the broad brush or blunderbuss approach being adopted, the provision will not end up having any significant, practical effect on those we are really after &mdash; the toughies or hardened criminals.  They are the guys I want to nail, but the approach the Minister has outlined does not give any assurance that they will be nailed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>May I come in after the Minister has explained his amendments? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe and &Oacute; Snodaigh for what they said.  The purpose of this section is as set out in the original scheme of the Bill which, as Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe stated, sounds right.  We must ask, however, whether this is the right way to do it.  I am conscious of the fact that we began with the proposition that anybody who got a one-year sentence was walking into this repeat category.  I came to the conclusion that if these were serious offenders and were getting one-year sentences, the threshold was clearly too low before this response would be triggered.  I believe, therefore, that a five-year offence distinguishes burglaries or aggravated burglaries from run of the mill offences into which people might blunder.</P>
        <P>There is another point, however, which is that burglaries are not what this legislation is about.  There may be serial burglars, and burglary can be committed in broad circumstances.  Burglary and robbery sounds terribly serious but, in fact, a mugging amounts to a robbery, so that is why I want to take them out.</P>
        <P>Having listened to Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, I will have to go further in all of this, tying it down much more narrowly.  That is because, although it is possible that a gang will engage in trafficking illegal immigrants, it is equally possible that somebody who had nothing to do with such things could get done twice for <Col N="607"/>that kind of offence &mdash; or once for that kind of offence and once again for another offence.</P>
        <P>Looking at the list, we have cast the net too widely.  I would not like to call my approach a blunderbuss one, but there has been a scatter-gun approach to the category of offences with which we are dealing.  Serious offences, including kidnapping, murder, the use of firearms or explosives, aggravated burglary, drug trafficking and organised crime offences, are most likely to be committed by gangland people.  If that is what the Bill is all about, we should contract the number of offences more radically than envisaged by the amendments I have tabled.  I do not regard the Constitution as some kind of inconvenient obstacle in all of this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to hear it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I regard the Constitution as something that we all have to uphold wholeheartedly, as we understand it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is also our shield.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It strikes me that it is a reasonable approach to serious gangland crime that certain offences should attract substantial sentences if they, or offences of a similar category, are repeated.  In that context, we should not be reluctant to provide a safety valve mechanism so that if the imposition of the three quarter sentence was gravely disproportionate, a court should not impose it.  There is a proportionality obligation which is implicit from the case law cited by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  </P>
        <P>I take Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s valid point about offences committed while in prison.  If a person commits certain serious offences, is released and then commits another serious offence which falls into that category, in those circumstances, a person should know from the moment they leave jail for the first offence that if they ever commit such offences again they will face a heavy sentence.  In other words, if they have done a serious term of imprisonment for a serious offence and commit a serious firearms offence on release, in those circumstances they will receive a very heavy sentence, as a matter of policy.  That would be subject to the proviso that if it was grossly disproportionate it would not apply.  If we are talking about the Oireachtas laying down policy guidelines, this is a policy guideline for the Judiciary.</P>
        <P>If a person commits an offence in this category and comes back before the courts, having spent a long time in jail for an offence in this category, the norm is three quarters of the maximum, or ten years imprisonment, unless such a sentence would be disproportionate.  People who have already been convicted of such offences will know that if they are caught again with, say, firearms in their cars, they must face up to the fact that they <Col N="608"/>will be sent to prison for a long time, unless there is an excusing circumstance that makes this disproportionate.</P>
        <P>With this in mind I am taking on board what is being said in this House and I appreciate the support for the principle of what is involved.  This Bill seeks to lay down the rules for the guidance not only of the courts but of people contemplating getting involved in serious criminality.  This applies particularly to those who have committed one serious offence because if they go back to that territory they can expect serious penalties.  Such an approach would be in accordance with the scheme of the Bill as published.</P>
        <P>Most people think robbery means only bank robbery but, unfortunately, robbery is also committed by a person who throws a victim against a wall and takes his or her wallet.  As Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe pointed out, such an act could be committed by a drunk or a crazed addict, rather than a person involved in gangland activities.  With regard to causing serious harm, this offence does not require intent and can be committed by a person recklessly.  In these circumstances we should not throw the net too widely.</P>
        <P>If the principle of this is agreeable we should all understand that while gangs can engage in the distribution of child pornography, it does not necessarily follow that all child pornography distribution is done by members of gangs.  I am now inclined to narrow the Schedule severely and to introduce the safety valve of proportionality.  I wish to leave in place a clear guideline to the Judiciary that a repeat offence in this narrower category of offences should attract a severe penalty, unless it would be disproportionate.</P>
        <P>This respects the Constitution, the roles of the Judiciary and so on.  It also accords more faithfully to the scheme of the Bill as published than the comprehensive list of statutes mentioned in Schedule 2, which is too broad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am profoundly worried by what we are doing at the moment because the Minister&rsquo;s change of mind since last week is extraordinary.  This would have passed last week on Committee Stage had we not had a change of heart and recommitted it.  These matters are very serious because we are discussing a range of crimes that will have mandatory sentences for repeat offences.  We have seen the shape of the amendments in the past couple of days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I indicated it last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister indicated what he was going to do last week but we have seen the shape of the amendments only in the past couple of days.  The Minister proposed to change the sentence from one year to five years, which remarkably changed the character of this issue.  Now he is talking about changing the Schedule beyond the removal of &ldquo;burglary and robbery&rdquo; to be replaced by &ldquo;aggravated burglary&rdquo; to something <Col N="609"/>we do not yet know.  I do not know the other delimitations that have been promised.  We are on Committee Stage of the Bill and it will be concluded in two hours.</P>
        <P>I engaged in this debate, like others, because we wanted to send out a message on gangland crime, but the message must be clear rather than disjointed.  We agreed, regarding some of the points I raised last week, that we need to approach the Bill again on issues such as jury intimidation and manifestly unjust acquittal, and I think this matter falls into that category.</P>
        <P>It is a lot to ask of the Minister but I request that he not proceed with section 24.  We will return to a criminal justice enactment shortly because we have unfinished business, including other issues that have been raised by the Hogan committee and have not been captured by these proposals.  We must make this legislation as solid as possible as it would indicate that we are listening not only to opinions in this House but also to external views.  This issue is important but it is not mature enough in our thinking to justify it becoming the law of the land a week from now when it passes through the other House.  I ask the Minister to park this issue on the basis that there is an understanding of what we seek to achieve.  There is a narrow range of offences that are clearly gang-related.  Is it possible that a murder with a firearm would be classified as gang-related but a murder with a baseball bat or knife would not?  We must think these things through carefully.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s original press release on this section refers to instances where a person who has been convicted of firearms, drug trafficking or other serious offences reoffends &mdash; the two crimes mentioned are firearms and drug trafficking.  The Schedule, however, presents a much broader template.  It enabled one very distinguished barrister to speak about a serial offender breaking into a school and stealing a rubber.  Such an offence would be covered by this, though I cannot imagine a person receiving 12 months imprisonment for such a crime.  Notionally, it could happen.  We must think about this more carefully if we are to achieve what we want to across the benches, that is, to be coherent, strong, clear and logical.  This is an issue we need to return to.  I ask that we do not find ourselves compelled to divide on it, though we will be close to that point if the Minister does not accept what I ask and park it as part of the further package.</P>
        <P>As the Minister pointed out succinctly in his opening comments, criminal law is a rolling programme, not an event.  One cannot simply present a package and expect it to remain sufficient.  There will be a rolling programme of modifications required as crime changes and the manipulators of criminal law seek to find loopholes.  We must do our best to stay one step ahead.</P><Col N="610"/>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I know it is a lot to ask of the Minister on the hoof, but I request that he not proceed with this section so we can have clarity on delimiting the offences that will be captured by it and will know exactly what the saver clause that he has mentioned entails.  I have only heard of this clause and we have nothing before us to explain how it will be formulated and presented.  It would give robustness to the remainder of the Bill if we parked this for inclusion with other serious, important and largely agreed measures that need to be examined when the pressure of the dying days of this D&aacute;il is not on us.  We could do this if we were in a normal committee and had weeks, rather than hours, to deal with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister and Deputy Howlin.</P>
    
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have to make up his mind.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing a criminal justice matter.  The changes referred to by the Minister would vastly improve the section.  The original section, as I highlighted, takes a blunderbuss approach which would be ineffective, would not achieve the objectives outlined by the Minister, which I support, and would probably be unconstitutional.  The new approach has a much better chance of standing up constitutionally and being effective in achieving the objectives outlined.</P>
        <P>I would still like the offence of witness intimidation included in the section.  It is the only addition I would make to the list of offences, although I am not certain how best this could be done.  It is crucial in the context of taking on criminal gangs.</P>
        <P>I am impressed by and support Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s proposal.  At 4 p.m. last Thursday, we completed Committee Stage without having had an opportunity to discuss these issues or refine the provision.  It is possible that, on reflection, the approach could be further improved, particularly be taking advice from people who clearly want to give it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a form of words. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not dismiss any lobby on this issue.  The Oireachtas has established bodies such as the Irish Human Rights Commission which have a role and function in highlighting issues that may make us uncomfortable at times but need to be highlighted.  I have spoken to genuine individuals from the Bar and Law Society who have highlighted genuine concerns, not least regarding this provision.</P>
        <P>Due to the Minister&rsquo;s change of stance on the question of having further debate and the considerable improvements made to the original proposal, it may be that, with more time, the section <Col N="611"/>could be further improved and made more finely focused and effective.  For these reasons, I believe Deputy Howlin made a good point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies will appreciate the Bill will proceed through this House, go before the Seanad and return to the House.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it come back to the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I do not want to do something which is unconstitutional or unworkable.  I do not want to have window dressing which does not have much practical effect.  I suggest to Deputies that while the purpose of the section has general support, we need to address the question of whether it will be effective in achieving its aim.  I propose to review the section and if I can recalibrate it to make a sensible and worthwhile provision, in other words, if it is worth the bother, I will do so.  If I cannot do so, it will be no skin of my nose to agree with Deputy Howlin and return to the section on another day.  I am not in a position, on the hoof, to come to a judgment on this matter at this point, as suggested by Deputy Howlin.  If I was genuinely convinced the provision should be abandoned, I would do so immediately. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister will appreciate, it is difficult for Deputies to make a judgment when we do not have a scheme before us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  If I recalibrate the provision, I will return to the House with the recalibrated version.  I do not want to discard it on the hoof on the grounds of difficulty without consulting my colleagues in Government, whom it would be a courtesy to inform of any proposed change in this matter, and ensuring that a recalibrated section with a narrower focus is worth having in place.  If it is not worth having, saving my face is a rather dubious exercise and I do not propose to have something pointless on the Statute Book.  The approach I propose to take is to examine this section as it goes through the Houses and either recalibrate or abandon it. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister introduce a further amendment for tomorrow to change or abandon the section?</P>

	<P>If the Minister produces an amendment, even one which is not formally part of the proceedings, Deputies can agree that it may be tabled in the Seanad and formally introduced in the House later.  We will find a way around the problem if we take an agreed approach.  On that basis, I am prepared to pass the ball back to the Minister to give him a chance. </P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister indicated at the start of the debate that he would listen to Deputies and in fairness to him he has done so.  In re-examining the section I ask him to consider a number of cases other than the two I cited to highlight the issue of proportionality and demonstrate that penalties should not be arbitrary.  Other circumstances must be taken into account to ensure we do not fill more jails.  We will probably need three or four prisons of the size proposed for the Thornton Hall site if the section is enacted.</P>
        <P>As I stated, this legislation is being rushed.  It is crazy that at this point, to all intents the concluding Stage of the Bill, it is proposed to remove or substantially change a section.  My opposition to mandatory sentences has not changed but at least if the Minister were to proceed in the manner he has suggested, the legislation might become more measured and focused, which is his stated intention.</P>
        <P>If the section enters into force, will it operate retrospectively?  Will it affect those who have been sentenced for the crimes to be listed in the Schedule?  If so, will it be necessary to make all such persons aware that circumstances have changed and they will face a different, substantial penalty if they engage in the types of activity cited in the legislation?  It should be noted that such persons face stiff penalties as matters stand.  The difference is that sentences would be predetermined.  The Garda and the Courts Service should be able to bear this out.  People who are caught for a second offence are often more susceptible to turning State&rsquo;s evidence against fellow gang members to avoid prison.  In that instance, there is no incentive if it is stated in the Bill that one must serve three quarters of the maximum for a second offence.  We need to be careful we do not prevent somebody from getting a conscience or at the least from being too afraid to go to jail for a second time.  Information from such a person would be liable to help us prevent further crime.</P>
        <P>The DPP would probably have to weigh this up but if we are too prescriptive, certain matters would be prevented by such black and white <Col N="613"/>legislation.  I thank the Minister for at least reconsidering the section.  We can come back to it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment<?oasys _jy ?>No. 84:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 21, to delete lines 12 to 45, to delete page 22 and in page 23, to delete lines 1 to 39.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Amendments Nos. 84 and 89 to 92, inclusive, are in my name and relate to crime prevention orders.  At present, before a convicted person is released, it is often possible for the person to be granted temporary release.  During that period, the person is usually subject to something similar to what the Minister proposes in that the person is not allowed to associate with certain people or get involved in certain activities.</P>
        <P>When a person is sentenced, the judge takes into account all the facts and conditions.  The idea is supposedly that when the person is convicted, he or she will go to jail, serve the sentence and pay his or her dues to society.  However, I am of the view that imprisonment is meant to rehabilitate or, if need be, retrain a person so he or she would have a skill when coming out of prison.  If enough time, effort and investment are put in to <Col N="616"/>ensure this happens, such a person will not reoffend upon release.</P>
        <P>There is concern with regard to the crime prevention orders as laid out in the Bill.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties raises a number of concerns and I have other concerns.  By itself, the crime prevention order was not supposed to operate beyond the full term of the maximum sentence &mdash; my amendment No. 90 seeks to ensure this happens.  The purpose of the order is supposedly to govern behaviour during the balance of the sentence up to the maximum.  The ICCL has stated that the new orders would enable the courts to impose additional conditions on people who have already served a sentence and that breaching these conditions would be an offence.  However, while one of the conditions might be to stay away from a certain location, to be in that certain location is not in itself criminal conduct.</P>
        <P>The problem is we would create or criminalise the offence by taking that route.  Similar to other areas of the legislation, we need to tease out the issues more.  I have not heard any major clamour for this.  The intention, obviously, is to prevent recidivism and to discover who reoffends, the reasons for doing so and ways to prevent them from doing so.  This is important but, as I said earlier, we need to implement the first part of the project first, namely, to put the investment into education in jails and into support for those going through drug rehabilitation in our prisons.  We need to put adequate supports in place so that when people leave prison they will have access to housing and additional support.</P>
        <P>People who have served a long sentence will have lost many of their connections with society, family and friends and in many cases will be left on their own.  I know the probation and welfare service has a role in this regard as well as other organisations.  However, it does not have a big enough role or budget to ensure that people who fall off the wagon or who may be inclined to fall off the wagon are supported.  The proposal in the Bill is a bit ahead of itself in this regard and we would need more time to tease out the issue.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister will outline in greater detail from where the proposal arose, other than coming as a result of one report.  Will he also indicate whether there has been a clamour for such a provision?  It seems similar to provisions in the draft legislation in England in terms of serious crime and serious crime prevention orders.  If there are examples of how these work in another area or jurisdiction, they might help inform us better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcomed the crime prevention order on Second Stage, but I have some questions on it.  I am sure the Minister saw the article in today&rsquo;s edition of<i> The Irish Times </i>by a distinguished former Attorney General which cast serious doubt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="617"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I saw it, but do not agree with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s view on it.  The former Attorney General calls them &ldquo;crime prevention orders&rdquo;.  The point is they are very vague in the structure of the Bill.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on that?  We need to address that because if there is a lack of guidance, what impact will that have on their constitutionality?</P>
        <P>I feel crime prevention orders are good as a mechanism to deal with the situation.  We talked about having post-release conditionality on the last occasion we dealt with the legislation.  The notion we can have conditionality linked to early release, such that people will be debarred from certain areas at certain times for a certain period of time is good.  However, I would have liked more time to think the issues through and to ensure it was presented more clearly and understood more fully.</P>
        <P>The first amendment in my name looks innocuous and seeks to delete the word &ldquo;an&rdquo; and insert the words &ldquo;a civil&rdquo; in line 20 of page 21.  The Bill reads: &ldquo;the court shall consider whether to make an order ... &rdquo;.  I suggest this should be changed to &ldquo;a civil order&rdquo;.  I suggest this in order to replicate the language of the ASBO legislation and make it clear that it is a civil order of the nature of an injunction rather than a punishment.  This is what we did in the case of ASBOs to make it clear that an additional punishment was not being given to an individual.</P>
        <P>In passing, some members of the Law Library already call these crime prevention orders &ldquo;super ASBOs&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what they are called in Britain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that where the term originates?  I only heard it for the first time during the week.  These super ASBOs have a role, but they are probably too vague as proposed in the Bill and could be refined rather than abandoned.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 88 seeks to insert a right of appeal.  The section does not currently provide for a right of appeal and is defective in that regard.  I suggest that on page 22, after section 11, we insert a new section 12 to read: &rdquo;(12) The offender or the prosecutor may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against a decision of the court referred to in <i>subsection (1</i>) as to whether to make or not to make a crime prevention order or as to the terms of the order.&rdquo;  This amendment might capture the issue of an oversight in terms of the vague power conveyed.  If there was a case where an unreasonable imposition was made, there would first be a requirement in justice for an appeals mechanism and, second, some mechanism for a second opinion on the terms of the crime prevention order, particularly if it was outrageously broad, unreasonable, <Col N="618"/>overly burdensome or did not properly take into account certain factors in determining it.  This would give people more confidence in the orders, would certainly do no harm to the concept and would make them more robust and just.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I like the idea of crime prevention orders but have questions with regard to their practical application and benefits.  They are a good idea in principle.  I would like to hear more about their practical application in the UK and elsewhere and the benefits derived there.  There is a lack of direction in terms of how the section is framed.  Questions arise as to what practical measures have been or are intended to be put in place to enable courts to decide whether to make such an order.  What type of orders may be made by courts?  Will probation reports be required?  Will prosecuting garda&iacute; be expected to advise the court or prosecuting counsel in respect of the matter?  Who will instigate the process?  We need more information on the process.</P>
        <P>These orders seem to be an import from the UK, not that I hold that against them.  However, we need to know more about them.  Have they worked well there and what are the downsides?  What difficulties have arisen in respect of crime prevention orders there?  Have these orders been in operation elsewhere?  These are issues that must be considered.  As Deputy Howlin mentioned, there has not been any debate, informed or otherwise, on the practical benefits of crime prevention orders.</P>
        <P>Some areas of this section need further consideration.  Perhaps the entire section should be given more detailed consideration.</P>
        <P>Section 25(2) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The court may specify in a crime prevention order such conditions as it considers necessary for the purposes of ensuring that while the order is in force&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) persons who are likely to be adversely affected by the presence of the offender are protected,</P>
        <P FLI="0">How is the court to ascertain that or who will instigate it?  Is a victim entitled to come before the court and say he or she will be afraid when the person comes out of prison on remission, early release or otherwise?  I am in favour of the victim having a voice and role in this situation but I am not sure about the mechanics involved in bringing the views of the victim to the attention of the court to trigger the imposition of such an order.</P>
        <P>If we had proper time to tease this out in detail many other points would arise but one that stands out is that throughout the section there is reference to notifying an inspector of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I am not sure why.  I am mindful of areas such as the Beara Peninsula in my constituency which is virtually the size of County Louth but where there is no inspector of the Garda S&iacute;och<Col N="619"/>&aacute;na.  I recently brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention that there were only a sergeant and a garda operating in the area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That will change shortly. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad that, as a result of pressure, the situation has changed.  Despite this, however, while there are a sergeant and four garda&iacute; in Castletownbere and one other garda in Adrigole there is no inspector.  The inspector crops up in every section where there is a reference to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>I am sure this will have no relevance in Beara, because thankfully the people there and particularly those who will vote in the next election will have nothing to do with criminal activity.  Outsiders, however, might come into the area.</P>
        <P>I am interested in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s response to the general issues and the specific points I have raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In the course of the Criminal Justice Bill we provided for partly suspended sentences.  The court in those circumstances can sentence a rapist, for example, to ten years&rsquo; imprisonment, five of which would be served and five of which would be suspended on whatever conditions the court established, one of which might be that the rapist not go near the victim.  That would be a straightforward case.</P>
        <P>In regard to people who receive a full sentence the question arises as to whether the court should have the right to make a preventive order for the period after the person has served a term in prison.  This would impose necessary conditions to either protect persons who are likely to be adversely affected by the presence of the perpetrator, or keep the perpetrator on the straight and narrow after his or her release.  It is analogous to a partially suspended sentence and its purpose is to enable courts imposing a lengthy sentence, subject to the maximum possible sentence, to impose a condition post-release of a kind that is considered reasonably necessary for either of those purposes.  That is a reasonable proposition because it has a deterrent effect, and a reassuring effect for the victims of crime.</P>
        <P>This is not mandatory but if a court imposing sentence says that a person has been seriously involved in the drugs trade it can provide that he must notify the Garda of his whereabouts when he is released.  This is similar to the requirement that sex offenders notify the Garda in certain circumstances of their whereabouts.  It enables the court to impose on an individual receiving a prison sentence a post-release obligation which will keep some tabs on the individual without putting him in prison or holding a suspended sentence over him, and give the Garda some handle on that person.  It is not wildly controversial and does not ask the courts to do anything they could <Col N="620"/>not do if they were minded to structure a suspended sentence through that method.</P>
        <P>I take the point that there does not appear to be a direct right of appeal but under section 13 there is a right to vary it and we might provide for a right to appeal against a refusal to vary the order.  I do not envisage the prosecution appealing against a refusal by the courts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 13 covers the court that made the determination.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>If a judge were to impose an unjust set of conditions as can happen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point that maybe we should do both.  I agree.  It could be improved by having some form of appeal against it. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely there would be a right to appeal against the original order which would probably be a combination of custody plus crime prevention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Howlin, working on the analogy with the ASBOs, referred to this as a civil order.  It is an order consequent on a conviction which distinguishes it from an ASBO.  It is like a criminal bankruptcy order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not then an intrinsic part of the punishment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be better to see it that way.  That is why I am not attracted to the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment calling it a civil order.  In those circumstances it would be better to make it appealable as the condition of a suspended sentence is appealable to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It would be more logical to deal with it as an order consequential on a conviction and make it appealable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste introduce an amendment to that effect?</P>

Crimes are sometimes committed such as shooting at a neighbour or members of a family over a land dispute or rapes where the victims are in terror for a long time and even when the offender is released, they are still in fear of him or her.</P>

	<P>What about the inspector issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If any member of the Garda is enabled to accept notification by an offender, the offender will say, for example, that he or she told Sergeant Clohessy at the fair in Castletownbere last week where he or she was living.  There must be formality and, therefore, an inspector or superintendent should preform this function.  The inspector route was chosen because his or her knowledge would be more localised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of areas are not covered by inspectors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The Deputy has spent half his life speculating on the outcome of the forthcoming general election.  However, if the House was to be graced again by Paddy Jer Sheehan, perhaps the Beara Peninsula would be dripping in garda&iacute;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is suggesting the current Fine Gael Member for west Cork does not have the same interest in Beara.  Sergeants should perform this function because they are deployed in every area.  For example, the Garda deploys only two inspectors in my constituency, which is larger than many counties.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe is considering this issue from the perspective of Beara and south-west Cork. Sergeants do not necessarily have a geographical function whereas an inspector, in most cases, is responsible for an area.  A sergeant may only be deployed in a <Col N="622"/>station and he may not have a geographical responsibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have sympathy for the point raised by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe.  Perhaps in this new modern era, a desk sergeant should be reported to by offenders who are released so that the notification would immediately be input into the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will examine that suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The officer in charge of the Garda station in the area the offender resides could be used.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>That would mean the information could be input into the system immediately and a garda tracking the individual could access the PULSE system.</P>
        <P>My amendments seek to ensure appeals are permitted within a short period.  A breach of these conditions is criminal conduct and the individuals involved should be entitled to free legal aid because, in this instance, they have been recently released from prison and they might not necessarily have the means to make an appeal against crime prevention orders.  I remain to be convinced that these orders are well thought out.  What is the difference between the restriction of movement orders provided for under the Criminal Justice Act 2006 and crime prevention orders?</P>
        <P>I understand what is being proposed and I agree the orders should be used to prevent the victims of crime living in fear when the offenders are released but I presume approaching a garda would help people who feel they are being intimidated or somebody is stalking them or seeking retribution for the time he or she spent in prison.  These orders are intended to ensure the perpetrators of the crimes do not live in the same district as their victims or do not interfere with them in any way.  We need to be careful because people have the right to freedom of movement, particularly if they have served their time.  The exception is sex offenders, particularly predatory sex offenders and child abusers.  Their movements should be monitored and recorded to ensure they do not engage in further sex crimes.</P>
        <P>Crime prevention orders sound good but, at the end of the day, the gangland figures at whom they are aimed could not give a hoot about being restricted in their movements and who they can meet because most of their activities can be carried out by telephone.  The orders do not prevent people from visiting them and engaging in further criminal activity.  I am not sure about such but I will withdraw my amendments on the basis that they can be debated again tomorrow.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;27.&mdash;The Act of 1984 is amended by the insertion of the following two words &rdquo;or mainly&ldquo; after &rdquo;solely&ldquo; in Section 18(1).&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This concerns the section allowing inferences to be drawn in certain circumstances, representing a major shift in the law apart from the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act, which have been used only on rare occasions of late and has not been effective.</P>
        <P>There needs to be a protection for people to prevent them from incriminating themselves.  The Dean Lyons case is an example of how somebody can be coerced into incriminating himself.  In other jurisdictions, in particular the United States, a person is allowed to have a solicitor present during interview.  If television programmes about the US justice system are anything to go by, I do not know how the police ever get any convictions because solicitors tell their clients not to say anything.</P>
        <P>People are wary of their answers being recorded and how they might look.  They might have reasons for not explaining their whereabouts or for refusing to account for marks on their person or objects in their possession, which might be innocent or, perhaps, the result of an extra-marital affair which they do not want to put in writing or give as video evidence.  Thankfully, videos will not now be as freely available or be used against individuals, as has happened.  People have had to produce them for their crime bosses and I can envisage circumstances where men might have to produce them for their wives to explain why they were in a certain place at a certain time.</P>
        <P>The interference with the right to silence and the right not to incriminate oneself is a concern and it has been raised in connection with inferences drawn from the silence of people brought before courts or interrogated under the Offences Against the State Act.  I do not have time to go into great detail on this and to adduce examples from other jurisdictions, as I would like.  Has any study been done on the consequences of people remaining silent or refusing to account for movements, marks on their person or objects in their possession?  Has any study shown that reserving that right severely impedes investigations and prevents convictions in the courts?</P>
        <P>All Members have a copy of the documentation of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Irish Human Rights Commission, so I will not quote from it.  Thankfully, it highlights their concerns, as is their right and obligation to do so.  If we had more time, we could have gone into greater detail on their comments.</P>
        <P>I urge caution on this proposal.  My preference is for the section to be withdrawn to ensure we do not trample upon rights gained over many years and undermine protections for people against incriminating themselves or owning up to something they did not do.  The potential for miscarriages of justice has been demonstrated in a <Col N="625"/>number of cases not only in this State, but in others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We are dealing with serious issues and it is important to have adequate time to tease out the implications of the proposals.  The Criminal Law Review Group, under the chairmanship of Dr. Gerard Hogan SC, dealt with the issue of the right to silence in a 50-page preliminary report and, more extensively, in a final report containing 100 pages, so there are obviously many angles to the issues.  It is also interesting that the proposals of the Minister do not seem to accord with the recommendations of the group, which raises questions.</P>
        <P>The criminal law review group decided to leave until its final report the question of amending the law on existing practice, so as to permit comment by the prosecution and the trial judge on the fact that an accused has not given evidence at a trial.  To make the issue even more complex, in the final report a majority of the group considered that neither the trial judge nor the prosecution should be permitted to comment on the failure of the accused to give evidence at his or her trial.  Even within a very experienced and highly qualified group, there is a difference of opinion on that point.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In considering the issue of inferences we should have before us not just the views of the Criminal Law Review Group, the Irish Human Rights Commission and others, but also the view of practising lawyers outlining the benefits to be derived from an approach dealing with inferences.  We are not starting from scratch; the Bill proposes to amend sections 18 and 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.  We are not talking about entirely new legislation but legislation that has been in place for more than 20 years.</P>
        <P>What is striking about existing provisions and other measures in law relating to the drawing of inferences from silence is how rarely they are used, which gives rise to questions.  Why are they so rarely used?</P>
      </Speaker>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason is that the only person who may ask the question is the arresting garda under the 1984 Act, which is bizarre.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If there are practical difficulties, we should address them.</P>

	<P>They are addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an answer to one of the many questions I had on the approach.  I am advised that provision is made in section 7 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996.  Coincidentally, both Acts to which I refer were enacted while Fine Gael and Labour were in office.  What use has been made of that Act and what benefit has it been in bringing to trial and convicting people?  My advice is that when hard<Col N="626"/>ened criminals and gangland desperadoes are arrested, they remain silent.  Provisions already exist, including under the 1996 Act, for drawing inferences from such silence.  Why has that not happened already?  If this legislation is to be of such benefit in the fight against gangland crime, what is the big difference between it and what already exists?</P>
        <P>The provisions in the Bill do not seem to accord with the proposals of the Criminal Law Review Group.  Why is this so?  Do the proposals go far enough?  I understand from the Criminal Law Review Group that any changes we make in this legislation should be accompanied by changes in the judges&rsquo; rules.  Why are we not doing so?  It appears we are doing only half the job.  The analysis of the review group was very thorough.  I would be much happier with an approach that followed its recommendations.  I do not understand why the T&aacute;naiste has not proceeded accordingly.  In the circumstances, I question whether the changes proposed will be effective in dealing with the fundamental objective of bringing serious gangland criminals to justice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not rehearse the ground already well travelled by my colleagues.  I approach this legislation as a non-lawyer and as a practical citizen.  Some of the niceties of court bamboozle people.  For example, a person who has heroin on the heel of his or her shoe might not give any explanation.  The notion that he or she is not required to give any explanation strikes most people as odd.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe said, the T&aacute;naiste needs to explain two things so that we can have confidence that we are moving in the right direction.  While I do not wish to sound like a total Luddite in these matters, the right to silence seems to be a sacred cow that cannot be touched or tampered with.  Changing it is almost regarded as being a fundamental assault on personal liberty.</P>
        <P>In the past the House has modified that right in certain circumstances.  The T&aacute;naiste is now proposing that we broaden it to other offences while introducing more safeguards to balance it.  Two questions, which have already been posed, need to be answered.  Why is the T&aacute;naiste not transposing the exact proposals from the Law Reform Commission?  Is he confident that the proposals will have practical effect given that the law in this area in the past has not had the practical effect we would have wanted?</P>
        <P>People claim that the right to silence is being changed.  I invite the T&aacute;naiste to set out clearly the changes proposed here.  It is proposed that they would apply to proceedings related to an arrestable offence.  Inference may be drawn from a failure to mention any fact relied upon in the person&rsquo;s defence in subsequent proceedings.  Inferences may be drawn from failure to mention a fact at the time of being questioned, charged or informed which in the circumstances existing at the time clearly called for an explanation when so questioned, charged or informed.  Failure to <Col N="627"/>mention facts could arise during questioning, upon being charged or upon being informed by the garda that the person might be prosecuted for an offence.</P>
        <P>These relate to the timing.  When drawing an inference, the court or the jury can have regard to the time at which the fact is first mentioned by the accused.  The T&aacute;naiste talked about sequencing so that the judge or jury can have regard to the disclosure of the information.  Failure to mention a fact can be treated as corroborative of other evidence but not convincing evidence on its own.</P>
        <P>Tomes have been written on this area and we need to give as simple an explanation as possible to the public as to what is proposed.  How does it change the clear and long-established right to silence and be protected from self-incrimination?  Why is the provision necessary and why will it be effective?  I invite the T&aacute;naiste to present his argument in the clearest possible terms why this proposal represents the correct and effective formula.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Subject to some comments which I will make later, it has been the case since 1994 in England and Wales &mdash; I am not sure about Scotland &mdash; and since 1988 in Northern Ireland that inferences can be drawn from one&rsquo;s failure to mention certain facts, when one is being interviewed by the police, which one later relies on as part of one&rsquo;s defence.  Does that trench from the right to silence?  The right to silence has never been the absolute right that is contended for.  When I went to King&rsquo;s Inns many years ago, for example, I clearly remember learning that if a girl had been raped, was confronted in the aftermath with the alleged rapist, identified him as the rapist and he remained silent in those circumstances, the jury was entitled to have regard to that in determining whether her accusation was true.  That was part of the law at the time.</P>
        <P>It moved from there to a proposition that no inference could be drawn from a failure to make a statement when in Garda custody.  That was the situation up to 1984, when we provided for Garda detention for the purpose of questioning.  That law provided that presence at a particular place or marks on one&rsquo;s clothing were circumstances where inferences could be drawn from the person&rsquo;s failure to account for them when asked about them in the course of interrogation, provided the questions were put to the person by the arresting garda.  In the 1996 and 1998 Acts, the matter was moved further.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I was a Member of the Seanad and I recall the debate in 1984.  At the time, the notion of detention for questioning was novel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and huge protection had to be provided.  We have, in principle and in respect of drug trafficking and the Offences Against the State Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>In the 1996 Act was there the same issue of the arresting garda?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure, I will check it.  The 1984 Act provided for the arresting garda.  We now have a different situation.  First, videotapes are made of these interviews and, second, there is a different understanding of the right to silence.  The right to silence, as I understand it, is a right not to be forced to incriminate oneself.  It is categorically different from circumstances where if one advances a proposition at one&rsquo;s trial, somebody is entitled to draw an adverse inference if, when one was asked about that point beforehand, one said nothing.  The adverse inference is that the explanation given is not true.  If it is true now, why did the person fail to account for it when asked about it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is when did the person make it up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  This is not a general proposition that a jury can look at an accused person being interrogated and staring at the wall and decide that if the person was innocent, he or she would say something.  It cannot decide on that basis to convict.  The person must be asked about a proposition which he is advancing in his defence.  That is the difference.  An inference can be drawn from his failure to mention it when questioned, where he later relies on it as part of his case.  It is a somewhat different situation.</P>
        <P>In the Murray case, the European Court of Human Rights considered the drawing of the inference to be unfair where the person in custody had been denied access to a solicitor for a critical period at the commencement of his detention.  That is why the Bill provides expressly for a reasonable opportunity of access to a lawyer as a condition for the drawing of any adverse inference.  I believe the Human Rights Commission has suggested that there should be a lawyer present at all times before an adverse inference can be drawn.  That has not come from European jurisprudence and this island does not have a history of providing that a lawyer must be present throughout all interrogations.  If we did have such a provision, by simply not having a lawyer a person could immunise themselves against the operation of this Bill.  The Bill provides for reasonable access.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Howlin said, the provisions for drawing inferences in this Bill contain more safeguards than the 1984, 1986 and 1998 Acts.  The first condition is that the matter in question called <Col N="629"/>for an explanation.  Second, the person cannot be convicted solely or mainly on the inference.  In other words, there would have to be a <i>prima facie</i> case of sorts, independent of an inference being drawn.  Third, there is an explicit condition of reasonable opportunity of access to a solicitor.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s question about the 1996 Act, the Act refers to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not the arresting member.  This Bill is a well balanced set of proposals.  It puts Ireland in a similar position to Britain under the 1994 Act.  However, the British Act includes a measure which I have not included in this legislation.  Perhaps a future D&aacute;il will consider inserting it.  In the English trial process since 1994, at the end of the prosecution case the trial judge informs the accused, in front of the jury, that there is a case to answer and that he is entitled to give evidence and not to give evidence.  If he does not give evidence, the jury can draw whatever inference it considers appropriate from it.  In case people think I am going out on a limb with this Bill, that provision is not part of this legislation.  People might believe it should be, but it is not.</P>
        <P>Another point should be borne in mind.  Until the 1890s in England and the early 20th century in Ireland, an accused was not competent to give evidence in a trial.  The 1924 Act in Ireland, which deals with failure to comment on an accused remaining silent, was passed in the context of a huge change in our criminal procedure.  The accused was being made a competent witness, as was his spouse.  Until then, an accused was not entitled, as of right, to participate in the trial process.  I mention this because some people appear to think that since the dawn of creation the criminal law has always been the same and that the rights of an accused in a criminal trial have always been the same.  That is not the case.  The criminal trial process has changed dramatically and moved on with time.  The accused was not allowed to testify at one stage and was made a competent witness at a later stage.  Britain has now gone so far as to provide that if an accused does not take part, a jury can draw an adverse inference generally from that failure to testify.</P>
        <P>There are two further questions.  First, can the inference be generally corroborative of the prosecution case?  Second, should the inference be simply related to the credibility of the accused, which is what I understand Dr. Gerard Hogan&rsquo;s committee sought?  My view is that it is more appropriate to have our law in line with the law of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and to state that it is corroborative of the prosecution case.  Let us remember what we are now providing for in respect of section 29, which reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">Where in any proceedings against a person for an arrestable offence evidence is given that the accused&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) at any time before he or she was charged with the offence, on being quest<Col N="630"/>ioned by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the offence, or</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) when being charged with the offence or informed by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that he or she might be prosecuted for it,</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">failed to mention any fact relied on in his or her defence in those proceedings, being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time clearly called for an explanation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is crucial.  It is not simply a question of where a person was the previous night.  This is something which clearly called for an explanation from him or her when so questioned, charged or informed, as the case may be.  The section states that:</P>
        <P LI="1">The court, in determining whether a charge should be dismissed under Part IA of the Criminal Procedure Act 1967 or whether there is a case to answer and the court (or, subject to the judge&rsquo;s directions, the jury) in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged (or of any other offence of which he or she could lawfully be convicted on that charge) may draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper; and the failure may, on the basis of such inferences, be treated as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence in relation to which the failure is material.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Subsection (2) states: &ldquo;A person shall not be convicted of an offence solely or mainly on an inference drawn from a failure to mention a fact to which subsection (1) applies.&rdquo;  It must be a fact relied on in his or her defence.  It does not mean the person must testify.  It is a fact relied on in his or her defence, therefore, it is the credibility and truthfulness of the entire defence in the case, rather than the credibility of the accused, that is at issue.</P>
        <P>I honestly do not see that this is a dramatic change in our law.  I tend to agree with Deputy Howlin.  Where somebody has been asked a question which demands an explanation at the time, refuses to comment but comes up with the self-same explanation at a later point, common sense demands that a member of a jury looking at that would consider this capable of undermining the allegation of fact being put before him or her at that point.</P>
        <P>I find it very difficult to understand what is the objection to this.  Juries operate under the rule of law.  How is the presumption of innocence or the right to silence affected if somebody puts forward a fact in his or her defence in a case and, at a critical point in the investigation, failed to mention that fact?  How are the rights of the accused in those circumstances curtailed or subverted if somebody can draw an inference from that set of circumstances that is adverse to the defence?  I do not know and have never seen any cogent explanation for it.</P><Col N="631"/>
        <P>There has been a knee-jerk reaction to this proposal.  How is it right that one&rsquo;s presence at a particular place is something which could call for an explanation since 1984 and the presence on one&rsquo;s clothes of a mark or substance could call for an explanation but some other fact which is central to one&rsquo;s defence does not call for this explanation and no inference can be drawn?  I do not see any logical reason, if the 1984, 1996 and 1998 Acts were justifiable in any shape or form, we should now say we will keep it narrowly confined to substances and location in a particular place and will not bring into the equation other things such as the money under the bed or a defence that the machine gun was left by the lodger the previous night and the defendant was not aware of it with the defendant producing the lodger from the previous night to tell the court he or she left it there.  Why when the defendant was asked about it on the day did he or she not come up with this explanation?  Why should a jury try a case with blinkers and why should the criminal justice process preclude common sense inferences being drawn from fairly straightforward sets of circumstances?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe very strongly in this proposal and that it is reasonable.  I will not go into the matter any further.  I have listened with an open mind to much of the criticism that has been directed at it.  Much of this criticism is conservatism, which defies common sense.  It is simply a desire to leave everything as it is and a belief that everything is perfect as it is when this is not the case and where juries, properly instructed under the present law, must be told not to draw an inference in particular circumstances where anybody trying to apply common sense to the facts of a case would draw such an inference.  That is all this proposal is about.    </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem with the principle involved here, but I want to elicit some further information.  Why is it that the existing inferences have not been effective?  I take the point that under the 1984 Act, it is confined to the arresting garda, but the 1996 Act was not so confined.  Why has this not been effective?  Why will the new provision be more effective in such a situation?  I want to get effective and practical results from this.  </P>
        <P>Why is it that the recommendations of the expert group on criminal law reform have not <Col N="632"/>been followed?  Why has the Minister gone off on a solo run, having set up this expert group of people we all recognise, trust and respect?  He has not followed its recommendations.</P>
        <P>In respect of the additional proposals of the review group, why has the Minister not taken on board the proposal in respect of an issue touched on in an amendment of mine?  This amendment proposes that there be changes and amendments as are necessary to the judges&rsquo; rules and, in particular, to the form of caution given to persons to whom this part of the Act applies.

	<P>Strong points have been raised by people outside this House who are entitled to raise concerns.  Some of them are recognised groups like the Human Rights Commission, while others are more loosely organised groups like groups of lawyers from the Bar Library.  At the very minimum, would it not have made sense for us to have the opportunity to discuss the points raised by these groups with them before putting the Minister&rsquo;s proposals into the legislation?  Would it not make sense to do so from the point of view of achieving an effective and practical outcome that will be of use and benefit in the fight against gangland criminals?  Would it not have been more sensible to follow that course of action?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the views that have been expressed by people outside the House, they are entitled to those views.  However, I find it very surprising that in all their letters to the newspapers and speeches on television, none of them pointed out that this has been the law in Great Britain since 1994 and in Northern Ireland since 1988.  They made me look like some wild experimenter who was coming up with something that had never been tried anywhere else before.  They did not give me credit, which Deputy Howlin has done, for bringing in safeguards here which were not present in previous measures put before the House in this general territory.  I do not understand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;30.&mdash;Section 2 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 is repealed.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This section deals with the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  A jury does not have the opportunity to draw any inferences because there is no jury.  We get annual reports on the Act in this House.  Some parts of it have never been used, while other parts are rarely used.  The amendment repeals section 2 of the Act.  The demise of that Act is long overdue.  Security normalisation and dealing with repressive legislation was a requirement of the Good Friday Agreement, but we have not moved on it.</P>
        <P>There are enough laws and sentences to deal with much of what this State had covered within the Act.  We can deal with it within the normal courts system with all the rights and protections <Col N="634"/>for those who are charged.  Additional rights and protections are required for witnesses, victims and the system itself.</P>
        <P>I get opportunities once a year to discuss the report on the Offences Against the State Act and since I have been elected, I have consistently made the point that the Act should be repealed in full.  We have a Bill to that effect on the Order Paper.  At some stage, we will hopefully have that debate and the Minister and others will support it.  He has produced a number of laws in the past five years which have many of the same effects as this Act, albeit in front of juries of people&rsquo;s peers.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 102:<b></b></P>
        <P LI="1">In page 30, after line 47, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;31.&mdash;(1) The Minister may make regulations providing for the administration of cautions by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to persons in relation to offences.</P>
        <P LI="2">(2) The regulations may include provision for&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) the form of caution to be administered to a person&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="4">(i) at any time before the person is charged with an offence, on being questioned by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the offence,</P>
        <P LI="4">(ii) when the person is being charged with an offence or informed by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that he or she might be prosecuted for it, or</P>
        <P LI="4">(iii) in any other circumstances in which a caution is required, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) the procedures that are to apply in circumstances where a person to whom a caution has been administered is to have the caution withdrawn and a different caution administered to him or her.</P>
        <P LI="2">(3) Regulations under this section may provide for different forms of caution to be administered to a person in different circumstances and in different classes of cases.</P><Col N="635"/>
        <P LI="2">(4) A failure on the part of any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to observe any provision of the regulations shall not of itself render that member liable to any criminal or civil proceedings or of itself affect the admissibility in evidence of anything said by, or the silence of, a person to whom<i> subsection (2)(a)</i> applies.</P>
        <P LI="2">(5) Regulations under this section may contain such incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of the regulations.</P>
        <P LI="2">(6) Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment inserts a new section in Part 4 of the Bill.  That part deals with the circumstances in which a court may draw inferences from a person&rsquo;s failure to account for certain matters, or matters which he or she fails to disclose and on which he or she later seeks to rely on in court.  The new section provides that the Minister may make regulations providing for the administration of cautions by members of the Garda to persons regarding offences.  By doing so, it implements a recommendation in the Hogan report that what amounts to a code of conduct for the questioning of suspects by members of the Garda should be governed by regulations other than the judges&rsquo; rules, which first appeared in 1912.</P>
        <P>The review group took the view that while it is true that the rules contain a good deal of practical common sense worth preserving, an overhaul and re-examination of the rules is overdue.  This is particularly the case having regard to provisions in Part 4 of the Bill, which expand the circumstances in which a failure to answer a question may give rise to inferences.  The proposed regulation-making power also allows the Minister to set out the procedures that are to apply in circumstances where a person to whom a caution has been administered is to have the caution withdrawn, or a different caution administered to him or her.</P>
        <P>It is also necessary to have regard to the amendment that I intend to bring forward on Report Stage, concerning the need for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make a contemporaneous written note of interviews with suspects.  My proposal stems from a recommendation of the Hogan report and is the type of practical recommendation that can be implemented without delay.  In circumstances where interviews are being routinely recorded, it makes little sense to hinder the <Col N="636"/>flow of a Garda interview by the need for the interviewing garda&iacute; to transcribe the full interview into manuscript.  This amendment will override the requirement currently in the judges&rsquo; rules that a written note be made.  A written manuscript will be required only where an interview is not being recorded.  That will only arise where the suspect has requested that the interview should not be recorded.  That change will require an alteration to the form of caution contained in the judges&rsquo; rules.  This can best be achieved by means of the proposal before us, which allows the Minister to make regulations governing the form of caution to be used by the garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s amendment seeks to insert a new subsection (4) in the new section.  My amendment in subsection (4) provides that the garda&iacute; will not be liable in civil or criminal proceedings by virtue alone of a failure to observe provisions in the regulations.  The Deputy&rsquo;s amendment will repeat that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister explain what I intend?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Howlin also deals with the liability of a garda and I will await his comments before making my comment on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the formula put forward by the T&aacute;naiste.  There is case law in regard to decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal where cautions were found to be defective.  A formula should be devised.  I am advised there are several statutory instruments or laws already enacted by the Oireachtas that require a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to explain an issue in ordinary language.</P>
        <P>To simplify matters, my amendment proposes that where the Minister prescribes a particular formula for a caution in a particular case, this will also be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of other enactments.  This will mean that where this formula is applied, there is no need to offer the caution in a separate way to satisfy the provisions of a previous enactment.  The purpose of the amendment is to capture that clearly and make it simpler.</P>
        <P>I am anxious that we should have time to discuss periods of detention but I am not sure how this may be done.  Would it be possible to allocate some part of the Report Stage debate tomorrow &mdash; even half an hour &mdash; for a continuation of Committee Stage?</P>

	<P>I have no difficulty with any practical arrangement to use the limited time available to best effect.  We have used our time effectively today and that has been of benefit to the Bill.  It raises the question of how best to use the remaining time and suggests how much better this Bill could be if the normal parliamentary time were available for its consideration.</P><Col N="637"/>
        <P>I am glad the Minister is taking on board the proposals in regard to the administration of costs.  The amendments I tabled were along the same lines.  Amendment No. 103 seeks to empower the Minister to &ldquo;make such changes and amendments as are necessary to the Judges&rsquo; Rules and to the form of caution given to persons to whom this Part applies&rdquo;.  Amendments Nos. 161 and 162 are similar.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s new proposals seem to satisfy the recommendations of the Hogan committee.  I assume his formulations coincide with the advice of officials and are best designed to meet our intentions in this regard.  On this basis, I will withdraw my amendments and support the Minister&rsquo;s proposals.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;31.&mdash;(1) Section 27 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 is amended by the deletion of subsection (3B).&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As far as I recall, we dealt with mandatory sentences for drug barons last year, but we are legislating for them again in section 31.  I do not know what has happened in the past year to necessitate these changes.  Perhaps it merely shows we did not get it right last year.  Again, my objection relates to the imposition of mandatory sentences in general.  I have made my argument in this regard and will not labour the point.</P>
        <P>My amendment No. 106 seeks to ensure a more precise definition of &ldquo;young person&rdquo;.  The Minister&rsquo;s amendment No. 105 is similar and it seems to meet my intention.  My amendment No. 107 is similar to the one I tried to insert last year in regard to mandatory sentences.  It proposes that judges should have to take into account certain mitigating and aggravating factors.  I have argued my case on this issue before and the Minister knows my position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to get into a protracted debate on mandatory sentences for drug <Col N="638"/>offences.  I am strongly of the view that there should be a general tariff of ten years for serious drug trafficking offences.  As I said at the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors conference, I strongly believe that a sentence of seven and half years, taking account of standard remission, should be the norm for persons convicted of a serious offence.  This seems so obvious to me that I do not know who disagrees with it as a proposition.</P>
        <P>There are some who contend that drug mules and the smaller cogs in the machine should not be dealt with as though they are Mr. Big.  However, Mr. Big requires the mules to operate in this manner.  I do not like commenting on individual cases but I notice a particular judge made this point recently when he observed that if the smaller cogs did not participate in this activity, the Mr. Bigs could not do their business.  This judge gave the defendant in question a ten-year sentence.</P>
        <P>The constitutionally required escape clauses are in place.  The reformulation of these provisions is necessary to state clearly the policy of this House, which is that, save in these entirely exceptional and specific circumstances, a person convicted of carrying drugs of a commercial quantity can expect to serve seven and a half years in prison on foot of a ten-year sentence.  I do not know what is strange or controversial about this proposition.</P>
        <P>I do not like being prescriptive.  I recently made a speech in King&rsquo;s Inns in which I said I do not go for an absolutely rigid tariff.  However, drug trafficking has such a horrific effect on Irish society and causes so many innocent people to lose their lives either through drug abuse or the activities of drug pushers that a sentence of seven and a half years for those who play a significant part in the entire operation is a reasonable deterrent.  It is the type of sentence that public confidence in the administration of criminal justice requires.  Save in circumstances on which I will not comment, lesser sentences subvert public confidence in the rule of law.  That is the reality.</P>
        <P>It has been pointed out in this House on many occasions that we do not have a rigid United States-style mandatory offence regime.  There is an escape hatch from the norm for the Judiciary.  The issue we must confront is whether we are entitled to have such a norm in place.  Alternatively, is there some view of society we are collectively missing whereby lighter sentences should be the order of the day?  I do not accept that the great majority of Irish people agree with this proposition.  In this respect, it is not a question of the Legislature trespassing on the independence of the Judiciary.</P>
        <P>It is a Legislature trying to establish a viable workable criminal law that brings home to the Irish people, potential criminals and people to observe the criminal justice system from outside that a ten-year sentence, which means seven and a half years in effect, is to be imposed in all <Col N="639"/>except the most exceptional and specific cases as the sentence which a commercial level drug trafficker can expect to receive when he or she goes before an Irish court.  That is a simple proposition and 90% of Irish people think that is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief as I am conscious that others wish to contribute.  I told the Minister on the last occasion that I had changed my views in regard to mandatory sentencing on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I had a very rigid view that it should be for the courts to have the ability to make a discernment in each individual case but because I am now convinced that the issue of drugs is so pervasive, is all over the country and doing extraordinary damage to communities all over the country, that we need that wake-up call.  I agree with the Minister that it is not simply the Mr. Bigs who can manipulate from prison cells, using mobile phones, or from Spain, Holland or wherever they are.  They need a distribution system and it has to be confronted rigidly.  I accept that because of the position we are in.  I wish to make two points on this issue.</P>
        <P>The new level the Minister is suggesting for a minimum ten-year sentence that must be served is &euro;500,000 worth of drugs.  There is a view, and it has come also from Government backbenchers to me, that might give the signal that the new level of acceptability is &euro;500,000 worth of drugs and that volumes below that level should not be dealt with at that level of severity.  I raised that point on Second Stage but I did not hear a response to it and it is something that causes me concern.</P>
        <P>I am a convert to the view that we need a mandatory sentence for this offence.  Normally I do not go down the road of mandatory sentences or of the &ldquo;three strikes and you are out&rdquo; or the &ldquo;lock them up&rdquo; approach, which in the prisoner&rsquo;s view is part of the American criminal justice system.  I wish we had more time to tease out these issues but we have not, unfortunately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly tougher sentences are needed to deal with serious drug traffickers and serious drug offences.  I support an approach that will involve such sentences.  When I spoke about tougher sentences on the last Criminal Justice Bill and, in particular, the removal of the exceptional circumstances clause for a second conviction, the Minister initially indicated that he had major constitutional concerns.  The phrase he used at the time was that his heart was with my argument but his head was against me.  In regard to these proposals is the Minister satisfied they will stand up constitutionally and that the concerns he had previously on the case I was making for tougher sentences against drug offenders will stand up?  </P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of the length of time to be served.  Do I take it that on the issue of a <Col N="640"/>ten-year sentence that effectively, under the existing code of remission of sentences, it will be no more than seven and a half years, that the automatic remission will apply to the ten-year sentence?</P>
        <P>My last point follows on the point raised by Deputy Howlin.  From the point of view of consistency of law, how do we relate the approach we are adopting for the offence, now being created, for drugs valued at more than &euro;500,000 with the approach in existing law for drugs exceeding a value of &euro;13,000 and the mandatory sentences that still stand for such lower values?  What consistency exists between the two legislative proposals?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not labour the point except to state that I welcome the fact that drug barons and drug dealers are convicted for ten years by judges, albeit infrequently, but I have a problem with taking away the discretion of the Judiciary.  The more drug barons and drug dealers who are locked up, the better.  However, I have a problem as to whether this will be effective and whether it will interfere with judicial discretion.  On the point I made earlier in regard to sentence guidelines, I would be much more comfortable with that approach but I want to ensure that judges understand fully the effects of the drugs crisis.  The Minister&rsquo;s commitment to this aspect is welcome if only it was backed up by the other tools required to tackle the drugs crisis in Ireland as a whole and that the local drugs squads and national drugs teams had the required resources to make a huge dent in this scandal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>On the figure of &euro;500,000, the Attorney General has advised me that is a permissible proportionate barrier over which we could say the discretion cannot apply.  I have approached it on that basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Could it apply in the circumstances?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have approached it on that basis but I am mindful of the point Deputy Howlin has made, that is, that it may create a two-tier approach in sentencing and it may send out a signal that if drugs are not valued at more than &euro;500,000, one is not in the big league.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I take that point.  That is a matter I want to consider again with my Government colleagues.  I am interested in the points raised on that issue because if it had that effect it would be counterproductive and would send out the wrong signal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It cannot do both.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  I want to look at that issue very carefully.  I have been contemplating <Col N="641"/>for a few weeks whether the point Deputy Howlin raised on Second Stage is correct and I want to look at it.  </P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In regard to the judge&rsquo;s discretion, the Bill clearly provides that where it would be unjust to do so for specific and exceptional reasons it need not be done.  As far as I am concerned, that is sufficient latitude but there can be no doubt it is extremely dispiriting for the Garda, which finds a person with a few hundred thousand euro worth of cocaine, to see that person walk out of court or to get a one or two-year sentence.  Public opinion and public confidence in the judicial system is damaged by sentences of that order.  That is the point I am making.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no such plans.  I sat in on the debate last night and listened intently to what the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, had to say.  I chaired the televised session at the recent Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis, which Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd may have missed.  I introduced both Ministers in a session which dealt with the focus on a greener Ireland.  It was great to hear delegates from all over the country, including Louth, making points on that issue.  I am glad we are all of that mind.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto Protocol commitment to limit average national greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above the 1990 levels.  Compliance with these commitments will be assessed over the five-year Kyoto period 2008-2012.  Ireland will reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 17 million tonnes in each year during that period.  This will be achieved by the combined effect of emission reduction measures that have been implemented across the economy, including participation by our heaviest emitting installations in the EU emissions trading scheme.</P>
        <P>These measures will be supplemented through use of the flexible mechanisms in the Kyoto Protocol to purchase allowances arising from emission reductions in other countries.  This is the point at which I usually get heckled but I am glad Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd is concentrating on his job.  I appreciate that fact.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s first national climate change strategy was published in October 2000 and, by any standards, it has been enormously successful.  That is not just my opinion, it is a fact that stands up to scrutiny.  First, while our greenhouse gas emissions were about 25% above 1990 levels in 2005, the economy grew by an astonishing 150% in the period 1990 to 2005.  We have therefore successfully and significantly decoupled greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth &mdash; an achievement of which any country would be proud.  Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions must be viewed against the background of sustained economic growth.  The challenge we face is to maintain that strong economic performance while, at the same time, lowering our greenhouse gas emissions.  It is not a question of one or the other &mdash; <Col N="644"/>we can and must do both.  We have a moral responsibility to meet our Kyoto Protocol commitments and we have a national responsibility to maintain economic competitiveness and growth.</P>
        <P>Second, as my friends on the Opposition benches seem to be convinced that the 2000 strategy was a failure, they should consider some of the measures that were introduced in the areas of energy, transport, homes, business, agriculture and waste.</P>
        <P>I wish to mention Tallaght for a moment.  In last night&rsquo;s debate there was a lot of banter about transport.  I am proud, as ever, of where I live.  One of the great things about the new Tallaght is the progress that has been made in delivering transport infrastructure, including the Luas system.  Other colleagues said last night they did not think it would happen, but it did.  I use the Luas as often as I can, as it runs close to my home.  The Luas currently runs from the city through various suburbs to Tallaght, but there are plans to bring it through the Tallaght west estates to Saggart and Citywest.  My colleague, Deputy Curran, has helped as much as I have in delivering that goal.</P>
        <P>I am not afraid to say &mdash; I have said so to successive Ministers &mdash; that we should not stop at that.  There is huge potential for that transport system and both the metro and Luas should be extended in various places.  Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country.  There is great potential for such routes to other parts of Tallaght, including the village, Oldbawn and Firhouse.  When the economy is doing well and money is available for infrastructure, we should not be afraid to listen to what communities are saying.</P>
        <P>I am not ashamed to say that I come from a bygone era in Dublin and remember seeing trams as a small child.  I always lamented the tracks being pulled up, yet here we are in 2007 with the economy doing well so we should not be afraid to give priority to public transport.  I hope Government policy continues in that direction for the benefit of future generations.  Those will be my views for the next six or seven weeks and beyond.</P>
        <P>The programme published this week by the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, contains measures to remove an additional 5 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year.  On any measurement, the Government&rsquo;s policy on climate change is working.  The success we are achieving in the run up to meeting our Kyoto commitments in the 2008-12 period puts Ireland on a sound footing to meet more challenging greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, which we anticipate post-2012.  At the recent summit of the European Council, Ireland had the confidence to support a higher level of ambition by all developed countries, initially in the period to <Col N="645"/>2020 but also beyond, to 2050.  Perhaps some of us might still be around to see that being achieved.</P>
        <P>The business before us this evening is particularly important.  It is not concerned solely with discussing the environment, but is also about taking action.  I am glad that my colleagues in Government are doing so and I am happy to support them.  This may be the last Private Members&rsquo; debate in this D&aacute;il term in which I will have an opportunity to participate.  It is good to take the opportunity to deal with day-to-day business issues of concern to our communities, such as Swords, Balbriggan, Tallaght, Clondalkin, Louth, Limerick and the northside of Dublin.  As I knock on doors and go about my business &mdash; I was in the Square in Tallaght this morning &mdash; people are talking about issues of concern.  The environment is striking a chord, whether it concerns bin collections or other aspects of waste management.  People are discussing it and I expect they will engage with us even more in the coming weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion tabled by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd.  Today we received a delegation from the US Congress and a lunch was hosted for them at Iveagh House.  The conversation at our table turned to what people would do later on this evening.  I mentioned that I would be speaking on this particular topic.  When we left Iveagh House it was a beautiful day and the bus had arrived for the delegation.</P>
        <P>One of the congressmen turned and said to me jokingly that climate change suits our country well because he had enjoyed a glorious day here.  As we walked back and discussed it in general terms, a number of us stopped for a moment to consider what is climate change.  People of my age can remember that, when we started to drive, a car&rsquo;s windscreen would be frozen over on many mornings but now this is only occasional.  At night time outside pubs and hotels one would see cars with newspapers on the windscreens, but that era is now gone.</P>
        <P>It is important to realise that global warming is not just a concept but something that is happening around us &mdash; we do not need statistics to verify that it is happening because we can see the changes in our own lives.  From this point of view, this motion is timely and important.</P>
        <P>This country has seen radical change in the past ten to 15 years and it is crucial that we play a role.  I acknowledge that our emissions have gone up in recent years but this is in the context of late economic and industrial development.  The challenge today is to maintain economic activity while managing future emissions.  It is important that people of my era continue to have the opportunity to work and support families and that we hand a safe and sustainable environment to our children.  This is the challenge we face and there are competing goals involved.</P><Col N="646"/>
        <P>I have listened to the comments of others but I believe the Government is addressing the serious issues in a responsible manner.  The challenge is to meet the competing goals by ensuring economic viability is maintained and sustained while, at the same time, meeting our environmental challenges.  There is not one simple answer as the subject crosses a range of issues and I intend to touch on some of these in the time available to me.</P>
        <P>The Government has adopted a cohesive and dynamic approach to delivering on our sustainable energy agenda.  Evidence of this commitment and our achievements to date can be seen in the recently published bio-energy action plan, the White Paper, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, and the national climate change strategy.  This motion has given the Government the opportunity to outline the numerous areas involved.</P>
        <P>Support programmes put in place by the Government have more than doubled our renewable electricity capacity in the past two years and we have established new targets of 15% by 2010 and around 33% by 2020.  Ireland has over one GW of renewable powered electricity connected to the national grid and providers of a further 630 MW have signed connection agreements.  It is estimated that the contribution of renewable electricity to gross electricity consumption is now in the region of 8%.  Between 2005 and 2010, the Government will have tripled Ireland&rsquo;s consumption of renewable electricity.  Some of us who travel around the country can see the physical evidence of this in wind farms.  We have set specific targets and goals and we are achieving them.</P>
        <P>It is expected that wind will be the dominant technology in the 2010 mix of renewable electricity but the Government is not dependent on this source alone and is examining other renewable sources.  For example, the Government is currently implementing an ocean energy strategy that involves the upgrading of research facilities at the hydraulics and maritime research centre in University College Cork, UCC, and the testing of a number of devices.  There are clear and specific targets.</P>
        <P>Talk of increases in our emissions in recent years leads people, rightly, to point to the area of transport.  In the region of 2.25 million vehicles are on our roads and as our economy and workforce have grown, so too has the number of vehicles on the road and this is an area that must be addressed.  Between 1991 and 2006 our workforce doubled from 1 million people to 2 million people.</P>
        <P>The approach to reducing such emissions must be twofold: public transport must be increased while individual vehicles are also taken into account.  I listened to some of the contributions last night and there seemed to be a lack of appreciation for efforts made in the area of public transport.  It is easy to say there should be more <Col N="647"/>and more public transport but real, tangible public transport has been delivered.  Luas carries 80,000 passengers per day, DART has been upgraded to carry 90,000 passengers per day and we are in the public consultation phase on metro north and metro west.  All of these are very significant public transport provisions.</P>
        <P>A new train station will open at Adamstown in Lucan, my own area, in the next week or so.  I am not suggesting that this in itself is sufficient but it is one of a number of projects and we are moving in the right direction.  In coming years the capacity on the Kildare route line will increase significantly as we move from two to four tracks and create a proper commuter service with trains at ten minute intervals during rush hour.</P>
        <P>In addition, there has been huge investment in quality bus corridors, QBCs, in my area.  The Dublin Bus fleet has recently increased and new routes have been introduced.  One new, interesting and experimental route in my area starts in Clondalkin and heads towards the city.  Instead of weaving through various estates, the route stays on QBCs to offer a faster journey from parts of Clondalkin to the city.  All of this has an impact on the increasing provision of public transport.</P>
        <P>Some Members of this House are critical of our investment in roads and suggest they have nothing to do with public transport.  Buses and inter-city connections constitute public transport and it is important that they are included in the overall picture.  Increasing public transport alone is not sufficient action on climate change, although it will reduce the number of trips made in private vehicles.</P>
        <P>The other side of this issue lies in addressing emissions from vehicles.  In last year&rsquo;s budget the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, suggested taxing vehicles based on engine emissions rather than engine capacity.  Government policy is addressing climate change in a range of areas.</P>
        <P>In 2005, we launched an innovative pilot programme on bio-fuels excise relief.  This resulted in the creation of eight bio-fuel projects and 16 million litres of bio-fuels going on the Irish market over a two year period.  Building on the success of the pilot programme, we have put in place a further five year excise relief package, costing in excess of &euro;200 million, that will see bio-fuels exceed a 2% market penetration in Ireland by 2008.  A year ago none of my constituents mentioned bio-fuels but last week a constituent who had fitted a conversion kit to his car complained that there are not enough outlets supplying bio-fuels.  The point is we are moving in the right direction.</P>
        <P>I believe we are well on the way to meeting our targets under the Kyoto Protocol but we must recognise that climate change does not consist of a single issue, such as public transport, industry, residential consumption or lifestyles.  It is the <Col N="648"/>combination of these areas that is crucial and projects run by the Government, such as the Power of One campaign, will ensure we meet our Kyoto Protocol targets in the period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I request that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann commend the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012 and the energy White Paper, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland.</P>
        <P>The national climate change strategy published by the Government on Monday provides the platform for Ireland to develop into a low-carbon economy.  It puts forward a comprehensive and coherent approach to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto Protocol commitments and lays a solid foundation for Ireland to meet more challenging targets in the post-2012 period.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="6" />
        <P>The strategy is detailed and specific and focused primarily on policies which are in place or are in the process of implementation.  While the document looks forward, it is not about commitments to take action at some unspecified point in the future but simply sets out measures which have been introduced and quantifies the consequent reductions in emissions.</P>
        <P>The strategy also establishes the framework which will develop measures to deliver the deeper cuts we will need in the future.  The period when we begin to face deeper emissions cuts than those provided for in the Kyoto Protocol is now less than six years hence.  In the context of the timeframe required for the implementation of major, far reaching policies and measures, this is not long.  The Government has, however, correctly established the framework for such policies and measures not only through the new national climate change strategy, but also through the national development plan; the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016; the transport investment programme, Transport 21; the strategy for science, technology and innovation; and the energy White Paper, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises that climate changes requires a whole range of Government effort across the economy, from agriculture and forestry to energy, transport and waste management.  It recognises that taking action to reduce emissions also means making energy use more sustainable, delivering the investment needed to bring about a modal shift in transport and harnessing our research and innovation capacity and unparalleled natural resources to make Ireland a world leader in renewable technologies.</P>
        <P>The national climate change strategy makes clear that the public sector must lead the way.  As the largest landowner, property owner and tenant in the State, it is in a unique position to show leadership in adopting high standards and practices which can drive change through the wider economy.  It also has the capacity to play an <Col N="649"/>important role in creating markets and supply chains for renewable technologies by setting high standards of energy efficiency in its public procurement of goods and services.  This was a prominent feature of the debate on the motion yesterday evening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Opposition puts forward the proposition that the Government is ignoring the role of the public sector when the opposite is the case.  The Office of Public Works is leading the way with a programme to ensure Government buildings reach high standards of energy efficiency.  It is converting the heating systems in 20 large State buildings from their existing fossil fuel burners to biomass burners over the course of the next 12 months, rolling out energy awareness campaign in central government offices and ensuring that new office accommodation procured under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme is built to the highest standards of energy saving and sustainable construction, including the greater use of bio-energy to fulfil the heating and energy requirements of buildings.</P>
        <P>The Government is also leading in the area of green public procurement.  With a total purchasing budget of more than &euro;10 billion per annum, it has significant leverage in moving the market towards the competitive provision of sustainable products and services.  It will publish a green public procurement action plan in 2007 which will set out how public procurement can be used to achieve environmental goals.  The Government has succeeded in publishing a strategy which will enable Ireland to meet its Kyoto Protocol targets and place us in a strong position to meet future, more challenging targets.</P>

I support the amendment and commend the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Government for the efforts they have made in recent years and the responsible and balanced manner with which they have acted. </P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s first national climate change strategy was published in October 2000 and, by any standard, has been enormously successful.  This is not just my opinion or view but a fact which stands up to scrutiny.  While our greenhouse gas emissions were approximately 25% above 1990 levels in 2005, the economy grew by roughly 150% in the period 1990 to 2005.  We have, therefore, successfully and significantly decoupled greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth, an achievement any country would be proud to claim.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions must be viewed against the background of sustained economic growth.  The challenge we face is to maintain strong economic performance while lowering our greenhouse gas emissions.  It is not a question of achieving one or other objective but ensuring we meet both of them.  We have a moral responsi<Col N="650"/>bility to meet our Kyoto Protocol commitments and a national responsibility to maintain economic competitiveness and growth, with particular emphasis on retaining jobs in heavy industry.  Many hundreds of such jobs are in businesses in my constituency, including Aughinish Alumina and the Tarbert power station on the Shannon estuary.  It would not be acceptable to concentrate all our efforts on reducing greenhouse gas emissions while ignoring the important role played by heavy industry.</P>
        <P>The Opposition parties seem convinced that the 2000 strategy was a failure, which is not surprising as all parties play politics.  Friends of the Earth and other non-governmental organisations are wrong to describe our efforts as a failure.  I will list some of the measures introduced as a result of the strategy.  In energy, the Government will ensure that 15% of the electricity supply comes from renewable sources by 2010.  This will reduce emissions by almost 1.5 million tonnes.  In transport, technological improvements in vehicles, despite the rapidly rising car numbers on the roads, will remove almost 500,000 tonnes of emissions.  Rebalancing of motor taxes and fuel economy labelling will remove approximately 50,000 tonnes of emissions, while investment in public transport will remove approximately 800,000 tonnes.  Use of bio-fuels as an alternative to petrol and diesel will reduce emissions by 770,000 tonnes.</P>
        <P>In our homes, the combined effect of three previous enhancements of the energy performance requirements of the building regulations, coupled with further revisions which are due to come into force in 2008, will remove almost 500,000 tonnes of emissions.  In the business sector, Sustainable Energy Ireland programmes to reduce energy consumption, including the large industry energy network, energy agreements programme, commercial bio-heat scheme and combined heat and power programme, will reduce emissions by more than 500,000 tonnes.</P>
        <P>In agriculture and forestry, CAP reform will reduce emissions by 2.4 million tonnes per annum.  In addition, 2 million tonnes of emissions will be removed annually from the atmosphere by forests.  In the waste sector, the capture of gas for power generation from landfills and a reduction in the volume of waste going to landfill will contribute to reducing total national emissions.  We have achieved significant reductions in the amount of waste going to landfill and can be proud of our record on recycling.  One third of household waste is being recycled, which is good for all of us.</P>
        <P>Every one of the measures I have outlined was contained in the 2000 strategy and has been implemented.  It is clear, therefore, that the strategy was not a failure but a success.  In total, measures introduced under the 2000 strategy will remove almost 9 million tonnes of greenhouse gas <Col N="651"/>emissions each year during the Kyoto Protocol period, 2008 to 2012.</P>
        <P>The new strategy published this week by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, contains measures to remove an additional 5 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually.  On any measurement, the Government&rsquo;s policy on climate change is working.  The success we are achieving in the run up to meeting our Kyoto commitments in the 2008 to 2012 period places Ireland on a sound footing to meet the more challenging greenhouse gas emission reduction targets we anticipate after 2012.  At the recent summit of the European Council, Ireland had the confidence to support a higher level of ambition by all developed countries, initially in the period to 2020 but also beyond that to 2050.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Government and the Minister, Deputy Roche, on the responsible manner in which they have managed to balance the growth in our economy that has produced the jobs to which I referred.  I compliment industry on the responsible action it has taken in reducing emissions and for taking part in emissions trading.  We have been criticised during the recent debate on the Carbon Fund Bill for buying carbon credits but we are perfectly entitled to do so as part of the criteria laid down in the Kyoto Protocol.  We have done it successfully and, in doing so, we are assisting the industries that have been responsible and are playing their part.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to share time with Deputies Catherine Murphy, Finian McGrath, Connolly, McHugh and Cuffe.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Fine Gael motion before the House, as does my party.  I am a little disappointed it did not go further in terms of calling on the Government to live up to the commitments under Kyoto.  With the few weeks the Government has left to it for all time, or certainly for a long time into the future, it probably was not worth its while.</P>
        <P>With regard to dealing with CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions in the north east, many people were delighted to see reports in the media on Sunday that Indaver was threatening, if that is the right word, to pull out of Ireland unless the Government imposed a &euro;5 per tonne tax on landfill and handed it over to the company.  It claimed its incineration system would not work without such a windfall from the taxpayers.  The notion is absurd that taxpayers would fund an already very rich company for coming to Ireland and poisoning its people through its incineration system, yet it expects taxpayers to shovel money into its coffers.</P><Col N="652"/>
        <P>The Government has so far indicated it will not bow to such a threat but, as with everything else connected with this Government, it is difficult to believe.  If the &euro;5 per tonne landfill charge were applied, it would mean an extra entrance fee to landfill of approximately &euro;200 per truck.  While we want alternatives other than landfill, if this were the case, we could expect householders to have to pay perhaps twice as much for their wheelie bin service, which would have serious consequences in terms of additional fly-tipping and other waste issues.</P>
        <P>With regard to the proposed incinerator at Carranstown, County Meath, which is near to where I live, the level of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions from that poisonous plant is estimated at 61,000 tonnes per annum.  There is no doubt Indaver would burn plastics, rubber and all sorts of products with a high calorific value in order to keep its costs down and try to make the plant efficient.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note Deputy Coveney has just arrived in the Chamber.  I commend him for standing with the Irish people recently when he voted against the European Commission&rsquo;s attempt to recategorise incinerators as waste recovery rather than waste disposal &mdash; we all know it is waste disposal.  Unfortunately, other members of the Fine Gael Party did not follow Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s good example and a number of them voted with the Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to ensure incineration does not enter this country.</P>
        <P>It is important there is consistency among all parties on the issue of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  We cannot have mixed messages.  There needs to be a strong, uniform message going out to Government and the people that we are determined to ensure this poisonous process does not gain access to this State and that we will challenge it at all levels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>If we are to meet our international targets and reduce the need to purchase carbon credits, we not only need to set year-on-year targets but we must scope down to the <Col N="653"/>actions that we need to deliver on those targets.  Alternative energy is clearly one component but energy conservation can play an equally important role.  We need to identify on a sector-by-sector basis many of the changes we need to make, which must be very practical.</P>
        <P>For example, on my way to Leinster House this morning I listened to a caller to my local radio station who wanted to find out where she could buy energy saving bulbs for a particular type of light fitting, which constitutes approximately 50% of light fittings sold.  People were being very helpful but there was only one specialist shop in the county where she could buy the bulbs.  This is a practical issue.  We are asking people to make individual changes but we are relying on the public to drive that agenda.</P>
        <P>On the issue of transport, we must tackle the issue of car usage by delivering a flexible public transport system.  We must also consider new ideas.  Transport 21 is supposed to take the long view.  However, with regard to train projects in my constituency, the Kildare route project which was originally supposed to go to Newbridge will now only go as far as Celbridge &mdash; very little of it is in Kildare although it is called the Kildare route project.  Essentially, it will deliver a very good service to Celbridge but will not go beyond that to towns like Sallins or Newbridge where there has been huge population growth, with further growth projected.  Kilcock is virtually a town under construction at present but there is just a single-track line between Maynooth and Kilcock.  After Transport 21 has been provided, it will still be a single track.  How is that considered strategic thinking?</P>
        <P>The Dublin Bus review identified the need for 200 buses but just 100 were delivered.  Some 15 of the buses were to go to west Dublin and north Kildare.  They were delivered last December but they are still parked in the garage and will remain there until the autumn because of red tape.  The 1932 licence issued to an operator means one cannot make a change on the corridor until that service is up and running.</P>
        <P>Climate change will not wait.  These are the practical measures we need to put in place.  We need to reduce the amount of red tape and consider the issues on a practical basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak in this important debate.  It is time to deal with this issue head on.  We have had too much talk and fudge from the Government parties.  The sad reality is that Ireland is ranked at 22 out of 27 EU countries when it comes to wind, wave and biomass generation despite having the best potential energy generation in these sectors.  We also have a situation where only 3% of Ireland&rsquo;s primary energy supplies comes from renewables.  It is time to get on and set targets for reduction in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions for each Department and State agency. <Col N="654"/> Let us lead by example and convert all public buildings to green energy and let us hold every sector to account on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>While we are dealing with this serious environmental debate, I would also like to raise the issue of Dublin Bay and my total opposition to the 52-acre infill proposal.  We cannot allow anyone or any port company to destroy our beautiful and natural Dublin Bay.  I stand by the tradition of Se&aacute;n Dublin Bay Loftus in this important debate.  I strongly support and commend Dublin Bay Watch Limited and the Clontarf Residents&rsquo; Association for their great work in preserving Dublin Bay.  Last week, I gave a commitment to a packed hall in the GAA club in Clontarf that I would support them in the D&aacute;il.  Tonight, I am supporting them in this debate.  Anyone who claims to support a clean environment must be on the side of Dublin Bay.</P>
        <P>I would like to see all parties and Members commit to a climate pollution law.  I am prepared to support the Opposition as recent figures show the rise in Ireland&rsquo;s climate pollution is almost twice the level to which we committed under the Kyoto Protocol.  The Government agreed to limit the rise in emissions to 13%, but in 2005 emissions were 25% above the 1990 levels and the trend is upward.  Unless urgent action is taken, we will pay the price of Government failure.  This debate is about climate change, the Kyoto Protocol and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions, but above all it is about protecting our environment and building a healthy planet for all our citizens, children and taxpayers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome and support the motion.  There is more carbon dioxide in the air than ever before, not just in measurable parts per million, and the rise in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> levels is increasingly the subject of public controversy.  Some people feel the rise in emissions is no less a threat than terrorism, avian influenza or rising oil prices.  The planetary consequences of atmospheric carbon dioxide are what former US Vice-President, Al Gore, referred to in his documentary as &ldquo;an inconvenient truth&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Architects are increasingly coming to the conclusion that new buildings should be designed to use only half the fossil fuel energy used today by such buildings.  The goal for 2030 is to have reached a position where new buildings are carbon neutral or use no energy from fossil fuels that produce greenhouse gases.  There is the concept of a passive house, even in Ireland.  This is a house that does not give off carbon emissions.  There are systems available that contribute to improvement in this regard, for example, Quad-Lock systems.</P>
        <P>I welcome the grant aid that is available for people who want to change the type of energy they use, for example, grant aid for wood pellet heating systems or solar panels.  However, it is almost pointless providing these grants unless the <Col N="655"/>Government examines the possibility of reintroducing grants for improving insulation.  There is no point in heating a house and allowing the heat escape through the ceiling.  These grants should be coupled or increased to allow people improve the insulation of their houses.</P>
        <P>In 25 years time we should, ideally, be in a situation where no oil, coal or natural gas are required to build, heat, cool or light new buildings.  We should be thinking along these lines, but we have not moved into that groove yet.  Architects could contribute significantly towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions through better design of new and the renovation of existing buildings.  With regard to public buildings, no more than in the area of public transport, the Government has an onus to lead and give direction to the public.  Such innovations could include configuring buildings to be heated, cooled, ventilated and lit more efficiently, specifying green and recyclable construction materials.  This would also entail buying renewable energy, while harnessing solar, wind, geothermal and biomass energy and exploiting available energy technologies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion.  The Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions set out targets that must be met by countries, including Ireland.  However, Ireland has not achieved its targets and has bought its way out of trouble by purchasing carbon credits.  This is not an acceptable approach for the future.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to set about the business of reducing emissions in a more structured way.  Rather than rely on the purchase of carbon credits, the Government now needs to make a decision to reduce greenhouse gas emissions nationally.  A determined effort must be made to identify opportunities for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions on a sector by sector basis.  If we do not follow this path, Ireland will continue to pay millions of euro in fines or on the further purchase of carbon credits.</P>
        <P>Renewable energy can make a major contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by adding to the energy mix and reducing reliance on carbon emitting fossil fuels.  However, renewable energy will only prosper if the Government creates the necessary conditions to allow for expansion.  Ireland has a distinct advantage in the development of renewable energy.  We have a favourable climate for wind energy, with strong and relatively consistent wind speeds.  We have not, however, invested sufficient resources in researching the feasibility of wave and tidal energy.</P>
        <P>The renewable energy possibilities for Ireland are varied, ranging from wind, wave, solar and bio-fuels, etc.  Currently, we have an over-reliance on imported fuel for energy generation.  Surely, rather than paying millions to purchase carbon <Col N="656"/>credits, it would make more sense to put millions into building wind farms.  People involved in the industry seriously question the Government&rsquo;s estimate that buying credits will cost approximately &euro;270 million over the next five years.  These people put the cost at up to &euro;1 billion, which would be a massive injection in funding for wind farms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this motion.  First, I would like the motion to be more specific.  It suggests we should set a target for a reduction in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions, but what should that target be?  The European Union has taken an honourable lead in this area and in international negotiations and has put forward a target of a 30% cut below 1990 levels by 2020.  It has decided on this target because its scientists, and ours, show we are in severe danger of crossing a tipping point in the global climate where a number of events could occur and create a catastrophic runaway climatic effect which would threaten the viability of humankind on the planet.  They recognise and realise that now is the time to stop us going over the tipping points where we would see the likes of the Siberian tundra melting and methane being released into the atmosphere, which would have a catastrophic effect, or the Amazon rainforest dying back due to climate changes.  They tell us that to stop this happening we must keep temperatures below a 2o increase.  In order to do that, we need to cut our emissions by approximately 30%.  We must try to get below 1990 levels by 2020.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s strategy report tries to wriggle out of all sorts of obligations and suggests we might only need a 2% cut because perhaps America and China would not join in and, therefore, we would not have an international solution.  It also suggests the European Union will again see Ireland as the poor man of Europe and give us the same soft deal we got the last time.  In my mind, none of this is relevant because the 30% cut is only a start.  We need to go beyond that in the next decade and make a similar reduction again.  Let us examine the Minister&rsquo;s fantasy situation where we would only have to make the level of cuts to bring us 2% below 1990 levels.  The reality is the Government&rsquo;s energy agency predicts our emissions from energy will increase by 30% in that period on the basis of current practice, but there is nothing from the Government showing us how it will reverse it.</P>
        <P>If we are to achieve the target and stop climate change as part of a global international reaction, we will have to wake up and be honest about the challenge ahead of us in that regard.  This is not a small or easy challenge.  It makes sense to accept the challenge.  We know that in the same timeframe global oil production is due to peak and following that there will be a 2% to 3% reduction each year in availability of oil globally.  We can only imagine the price increases that will <Col N="657"/>correspond to that.  By some strange coincidence, we need to make cuts by roughly 2% to 3% per year on the amount of fossil fuels we are burning.  However, currently our use is increasing by 2% to 3% per year, and by 7% in transport.  Turning the country around from a 2% to 3% increase per year to a reduction of 2% to 3% per year is the biggest political challenge the State will ever face.</P>
        <P>Globally, it is the biggest challenge mankind has ever faced.  The challenge is to maintain our civilization and maintain people in the life to which they are accustomed and to keep them alive.  We need to start being honest with the people and ourselves as to the scale of the challenge.  We must start by setting a target.  We must not just say we will set a target, but agree on that target.  This is not a party political issue, but one for the future of mankind.  Whether one is left or right, Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael, it does not matter.</P>
        <P>What must we do to achieve the target.  Bio-fuels alone will not do it.  They will help us and we can use waste products and give farming a boost, but we cannot replicate the amount of liquid oil we currently burn with bio-fuels.  The petrol we currently use is a bio-fuel.  One hundred million years ago, small bio-planktons in warm seas died, fell to bottom and were covered in sand, cooked and turned into oil.  The oil we used in 1997 was the equivalent of some 420 years of bio-fuel growth that had accumulated over the millennia.</P>
        <P>We can never replicate that store from our bio-fuel stocks.  They will be useful and will provide a vital strategic oil asset, but they will not solve the problem.  We need radical and utterly different transport in future if we are to meet those targets.  Parties opposite and elsewhere say that this is in some way mad, strange, impractical or uneconomic.  If they are serious about climate change and want to discuss it, they must talk about serious changes in the transport system because that is one area in which we can make reductions.  That leads to a more civil society which works.</P>
        <P>We need to be honest.  If other parties here are going to don green clothing they should be specific rather than saying, as in the Government&rsquo;s strategy paper, that there are measures planned that have yet to be quantified, such as the sustainable transport action plan.  Why is it not quantified and set out?  Is it simply set out until after the election as a vague promise that means nothing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to share time with Deputy Neville, if he turns up.  If he does not, I will speak for 20 minutes.  I am happy to have an opportunity to speak in this debate and I am sorry that there are not more people and journalists watching it, although hopefully some of them are watching on their monitors.</P>
        <P>The previous speaker was passionate about this issue which is central to his party.  The rise in sup<Col N="658"/>port for his party in Ireland, and for similar parties across Europe, shows that people are engaging with the issue.  In typical fashion, Fianna F&aacute;il is also pretending to engage with it as a general election approaches.  I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in what is potentially the final week of this D&aacute;il on the issue of Ireland&rsquo;s responsibilities in respect of greenhouse gas emissions and its failure to live up to commitments entered into in this regard.</P>
        <P>The failure of this country to develop a renewable energy and alternative fuel industry is perhaps the greatest missed opportunity of the past five years.  This could have a positive impact on greenhouse gas emissions and while it would not solve the problem, it would be a step in the right direction.  Not only had we the capacity, the opportunity and the natural resources available to do so, we also had the finance to kick-start a new way of thinking through direct support and tax incentives which would have forced people to think in a different way about energy and fuel use.  To make matters worse, this is also a blatant breach of commitments into which the Government entered with the European Union and the United Nations, for which taxpayers must pay directly.</P>
        <P>On 31 May 2002, all 15 then member states of the European Union deposited the relevant ratification paperwork relating to the Kyoto Protocol of a few years previous with the United Nations.  The EU was then producing approximately 22% of global greenhouse gas emissions.  We agreed to an 8% cut in emissions on average across the EU from the base year, 1990, levels.  Since then, the European Commission has tried to be more ambitious and has announced an intention to try to cut emissions across the EU by another 20% before 2020.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s commitment under the EU agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions was to limit the increases to 13% above 1990 levels.  We hear guff from Government spokespersons that because the economy grew so quickly we could not play our part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, despite the commitment we gave.  The truth is that we were an exception.  While most countries radically reduced greenhouse gas emissions, we were allowed to increase our emissions from the base year, which takes into account economic growth and rapid development over that time.</P>
        <P>It is not an excuse to say that because our economy was growing between 7% and 10% a year for a decade we could not possibly cope with the commitments we made in different times.  They were not such different times when we made that commitment and we got a good deal, but we have not followed through on that commitment and made the tough and sometimes unpopular decisions needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In hindsight, they would have been popular <Col N="659"/>decisions when people understood why there were being made.</P>
        <P>We emit approximately 26% above 1990 levels so we have already doubled our exceptional increase limit.  We should have met the EU target only from 2008 on.  We must significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions just to meet our original target, which was an increase on 1990 levels.  This is an appalling failure over a relatively short time.</P>
        <P>We have had the capacity to deliver on the commitments we made and could have done so if we had taken action some years ago.  Over the past five years, we should have set specific targets in various sectors, for example, transport.  Why have we not promoted the idea of blending ethanol with petrol to try to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions coming from each car?  Even in the United States, which environmental activists around the world criticise for not reducing greenhouse gas emissions, many states have a blending obligation of 2%, 5% or 7% ethanol with petrol.  Why has that not happened here?  People assume that it requires reinventing the wheel.  We need only copy what works elsewhere.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Why are we not replacing diesel with biodiesel in tractors, fishing boats and lorries?  I visited the oil refinery owned at the time by ConocoPhillips, which had completed an international study on blending diesel with biodiesel.  The company said it would do this in the morning in its refinery if the Government encouraged it to do so.  It would cost no extra.  It experimented by introducing the blended diesel with biodiesel into diesel pumps across Munster and nobody noticed.  Engines do not need to be altered.  We have not done this because we are the last in the class to perform.  We are only now talking about reducing tax on low-emission cars, five years later.</P>
        <P>We introduced one alternative energy requirement, AER, scheme after another, which failed to produce what they promised.  We have improved the scheme somewhat recently but we are still a miserable performer for a country that has such opportunity and resources in terms of wind speed, consistency and so on.   There are limitations because this is an island and the grid cannot rely too much on the inconsistency that comes from wind turbines.  However, why have we not interconnected the Irish and British grids?</P>
        <P>Five years ago when I was party spokesperson on energy I sat with Deputy Eamon Ryan on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  We called for the Government to pay for a proper interconnector for the Irish and British grids between Wicklow and Wales.  Instead, the Government sought interest from the private sector, which was never realised.  The interconnector has not been built and, as a result, the State does not have the capacity to significantly increase the contribution from wind energy to the domestic grid.</P><Col N="660"/>
        <P>Other European countries with less consistent wind speed put Ireland to shame.  For example, an article recently published regarding Spain states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Taking advantage of a particularly gusty period, Spain&rsquo;s wind energy generators this week reached an all time high in electricity production, exceeding power generated by any other source in Spain.  The nation&rsquo;s electricity network said in a statement, &rsquo;Wind power generation rose to almost 27% of the country&rsquo;s total power requirement.  Wind powers contributes over 8,000 MW to the nation&rsquo;s power consumption of just over 31,000 MW&rsquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We still struggle in Ireland to produce slightly more than 500 MW.  The Government has failed to impact on the key sectors of energy generation, transport and energy efficiency and then two months before a general election, it publishes a climate change strategy because green issues are topical.  It is a good document, which contains many positive proposals, but the issue is whether it will be implemented and who is best to implement it.  It is difficult to have faith in the Government parties on the basis of the past ten years that they are serious about implementing the strategy.  I wish it were otherwise.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I refer to a specific failure on the part of the Government to support a bioenergy project in my constituency, Limerick West.  The Minister of State represents a neighbouring constituency and he will be well aware of the difficulties experienced in west Limerick because of job losses.  Last year, Capway Bioenergy intended to be part of a new system and had proposed to commence a large-scale, state-of-the-art biodiesel processing plant at Foynes port that would use Irish raw materials.  Towards this end, the company submitted an application to the Irish Government which was not supported.  The company commenced operation in 2005 and constructed a pilot research facility for biodiesel production at its laboratory at Shannon, County Clare.  It developed skills-based biodiesel technology operating procedures and a quality control system and it also developed a core staff with expertise to transfer to a commercial scale plant.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>In the past two and half years, more than 1,000 jobs have been lost in Limerick West in three companies, both directly and indirectly.  I refer to Kantoher, Castlemahon Poultry and Microtherm.  Last October, I pleaded with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to support job creation in my constituency, but he failed to do so.  Capway Bioenergy submitted an application to the Minister under the bio-fuels and mineral tax relief scheme for excise duty relief, which was not approved.  This comprehensive proposal included a supply agreement with Dairygold Co-Operative and Acorn Independent <Col N="661"/>Merchants Group.  Capway Bioenergy had provisional distribution agreements in place with three of Ireland&rsquo;s leading oil distributors, Topaz Energy Products, Maxell Group and Tedcastles Oil Products.  Furthermore, the company had signed the provisional supply agreement with high profile capital fleets, Roadstone Provisions Limited, STL Logistics and Pallas Foods.</P>
        <P>This was an excellent proposal to create jobs in my constituency.  A total of 80 jobs were involved and this would have been an injection of confidence into the constituency on the part the Government.  Approximately 80 jobs would have been provided during the construction period along with direct employment during the operational period of more than 30 full-time positions and significant indirect benefits in the Foynes area.  It would have been a new bioenergy company and would have been one of the first positive initiatives in the constituency following the devastation of the three closures to which I referred.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The company&rsquo;s work would have been complementary to the work being undertaken on the development of alternative farm enterprises through the growth of miscanthus grass in the area.  Capway Bioenergy proposed to construct a large-scale, state-of-the-art biodiesel processing plant at Foynes which would use domestic raw materials.  In its proposal, the company outlined that our planet&rsquo;s store of fossil fuels is finite and it is widely considered that the point in time defined as &ldquo;peak oil&rdquo; is imminent.  This is the time the slow dwindle in oil supplies commences and this moment will inevitably be accompanied by unprecedented oil price shocks.  The earth&rsquo;s remaining reserves of fossil fuels are predominantly concentrated in politically unstable regions.  This increases the risk underlying continuity of supply in future.  Fossil fuel use results in the emission of greenhouse gases that cause climate change.  Scientists state we are rapidly approaching a tipping point, perhaps within ten years, where, without a radical reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, dangerous and uncontrollable climate change is unavoidable.</P>
        <P>The EU has taken the lead in addressing the problems associated with fossil fuel dependency.  The Union ratified the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, which is legally binding.  The protocol obliges Ireland to have its greenhouse gas emissions below 113% of its 1990 emission levels by 2010.  Ireland&rsquo;s emissions trajectory suggests this target will not be met.  The rapidly expanding transport sector is responsible for most of the increased emissions.  To diversify its transport fuel supply base and address its obligation to control greenhouse gas emissions, the EU introduced the bio-fuels directive in 2003, which set a target inclusion rate for bio-fuels within the transport fuel portfolio of each member state of 2% by 2005 and 5.75% by 2010.</P>
        <P>Ireland has responded with the bio-fuels mineral oil tax relief scheme which offers excise duty <Col N="662"/>relief on bio-fuels to selected bio-fuel providers.  One of the best submissions was made by Capway Bioenergy.  The Minister of State might explain, when he contributes, why the company was excluded.  Perhaps the Minister of State and his cohorts in Government have decided it is not necessary to address job creation in Limerick West because the outcome of the general election is predictable.  However, that is not so and the failure of this employment opportunity and the residual loss of more than 1,000 jobs will be visited on the Government parties in the general election in my constituency.  I do not understand why a response was not made to the lobbying by many people regarding this excellent proposal to create jobs and an environmentally friendly product in this area.</P>
        <P>Biodiesel has been produced on an industrial scale in the European Union since 1992, largely in response to positive signals from EU institutions in conjunction with supportive initiatives from member states.  Today there are approximately 120 plants inthe EU, providing almost 7 billion litres of biodiesel annually.  These plants are mainly located in Germany, Italy, Austria, France and Sweden.  We were anxious to join that group with a plant in Foynes in Limerick but the Government decided it should not be the case.  I look forward to the Minister of State explaining why west Limerick and Foynes should not be included, when many jobs would have been created.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to respond on behalf of the Government and I thank the Fine Gael Party for putting down the original motion.</P>
        <P>Having observed and listened to the debate over the past two nights it is blatantly obvious Fine Gael has nothing substantive to offer in terms of addressing Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions.  Its Members had no ideas, no policies, no silver bullets and nothing constructive to bring to the debate.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael is in good company on the Opposition benches.  The only useful thing we have heard from that side of the House in the past two nights was the belated acknowledgment by the Labour Party that purchases of carbon credits to supplement domestic emission reductions must be part of the overall response to our Kyoto Protocol commitments.  It is a bit late in the day for the Labour Party to wake up and get to grips with this fundamental issue but it is better late than never.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One thing that did surprise me was the downgrading of the climate change agenda by the Green Party.  It seems no longer to be a priority for it and its members did not even bother to turn up last night to hear the contributions of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche.  Their contri<Col N="663"/>bution tonight, as it has been on other occasions, involved tax, more tax and more tax and was compounded by the confusion emanating from the lips of Deputy Eamon Ryan, who engaged in deliberate obfuscation.  They cannot accept that the Government supports the EU&rsquo;s ambition for a 30% reduction in emissions from developed countries by 2020.  I suggest they read the strategy as that target is an integral part of it.  Sir Nicholas Stern pointed out, in his recent report on the economics of climate change, that economic growth and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive.  It is not a matter of economic competitiveness or greenhouse gas emission reduction &mdash; it is both.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before going any further I will address two specific points made by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd last night.  He called for the conversion of all public buildings to green energy.  The Government is already committed to significant emission reductions in the public sector and has included that commitment in its new strategy.  He also asked the House to support the introduction of a new system of annual, open and transparent reporting but the Government is already committed to strengthening reporting and review arrangements.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will co-ordinate an annual report which will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and presented to the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government, as stated in the strategy.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that Ireland is on course to meet its greenhouse gas emission commitments for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol.  The previous national climate change strategy, which the Government published in 2000, was hugely successful in reducing our overall level of emissions and in decoupling growth in emissions from economic growth.  The figures speak for themselves and Irish people can be very proud of our performance over the past six years or so.  While our economy grew by 150%, we managed to limit the growth in our greenhouse gas emissions to just 25%, an impressive performance by any standards.  The new strategy aims to build on that success by continuing the decoupling of emissions from economic growth and ensuring further reductions in actual greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors, including transport.  Not only will the policies in the new strategy reinforce our Kyoto compliance, they will initiate national preparations in anticipation of more demanding emission reduction targets in the period to 2020 and beyond.</P>
        <P>The Kyoto Protocol is only a first step for the international community in seeking to stabilise global greenhouse emissions at a safe level.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the international effort, under Kyoto in the first instance but also in the longer term, will be achieved without compromising competitiveness, economic growth or Irish <Col N="664"/>jobs.  Unlike the Opposition, we will not pull the plug on the economy or Irish jobs.  We will not tax Irish industry out of competitiveness and the Government will ensure we meet our commitments on a basis that is responsible, transparent and fully consistent with the provisions of the protocol itself.</P>
        <P>Both the new climate change strategy and the White Paper on energy are significant and ambitious policy documents.  They strengthen our energy sector and put Ireland on a path progressively to lower our greenhouse gas emissions in the period to 2020.  The European Union has been proactive in promoting a concerted international response to climate change.  It is a global problem that demands a global solution.  As a member of the EU Ireland supports that position and we are demonstrating that support by putting ourselves on a pathway to Kyoto compliance.</P>
        <P>On any assessment involving a fair range of parameters our performance on greenhouse gas emissions is better than any other EU member state.  I remind Deputy Eamon Ryan and others that other countries in Europe buy carbon credits, such as Spain, Belgium and Italy, as well as Japan.  It is part of the overall strategy, which is a sensible strategy for ensuring we do not in any way detract from the ongoing development of our economy and the creation of large numbers of jobs, which has been a feature of the economy over the past ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate.  There were some measured speeches, unlike that of the Minister of State.  If we reflect on what is happening we will see the time has now come to decouple the people from this Government because it has not done its job.  </P>
        <P>Ireland is not meeting its Kyoto targets.  Since the first climate change strategy was produced by the Government emissions have increased rather than decreased.  Notwithstanding the good work which was commenced by the initial climate change strategy the policy has now gone out of kilter.  One of the key reasons for that is the fact that emissions from transport are 160 times greater than in 1990.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy accept the figures showing a 165% growth in the economy but only a 25% growth in emissions?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>We should be heading towards 13% above the 1990 limit but we are at 25% and it is increasing as we speak.  Government policy has failed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will refer to the excellent work done in the recent report published by Urban Forum.  There is an increasing suburbanisation in Ireland and more and more people live outside our cities.  The population in Cork and Limerick declined by 3.2% and 2.7% respectively while their county areas grew.  The area directly outside Cork city grew by 11.4% and the area outside Limerick city by over 8%.  While more people live near our cit<Col N="665"/>ies the population within the cities is actually falling and our urban sprawl is now worse than Los Angeles.  The footprint of Dublin city is equal to that of Los Angeles but with a population a third the size.  Part of that is because of increasing reliance on motor cars, rather than public transport.  We are becoming a very car-dependent country.  The Urban Forum report stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">One of the consequences of Ireland&rsquo;s &rsquo;suburbanisation&rsquo; is the reality that for many &rsquo;city&rsquo; dwellers, they are as car dependent as their rural neighbours.  The average car in Ireland travels, on an annual basis, 24,400 km per year &mdash; 70% more than France or Germany, 50% more than Britain &mdash; and even 30% more than the USA.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The price of this rapid economic success and our fast increasing use of cars is that Ireland has become the fifth most oil-dependent country in the EU and the ninth in the world.  This is taking place at a time when oil is becoming an ever-scarcer resource.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While we have made great economic progress, we are burning up more fossil fuels by the way we live and through the Government failing to manage our population movements and our carbon footprints.  The Government is condemned for not dealing with the issue by failing to have proper planning and development and not doing enough to encourage public transport.  While I acknowledge improvements have been made in public transport, they have been inadequate.  The Government stands condemned on its lack of attention to this issue.</P>
        <P>I gave an example last night which I will repeat.  When Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats took office in 1997 we had no motorway between Drogheda and Dublin, and the Balbriggan bypass did not exist.  However, I could drive from my home in Drogheda to Leinster House during peak times in approximately an hour.  Now it takes at least an hour and a half and sometimes up to two hours when using my car, as I often need to do given other commitments I may have.  There are no park and ride facilities as one approaches the city from the north side.  There is no Government joined-up thinking on the issue.  We have no integrated policy whereby people who need to use their cars to get close to the city could then take public transport.  The Government has failed utterly in meeting the needs of the population by reducing the numbers stuck in traffic every day.  Despite some improvements with the opening of the Dublin port tunnel, once past the tunnel entrance drivers have the same problem again.  People recently told me they were more than half an hour in Gardiner Street.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a great admission coming from that side, given what Deputy Olivia Mitchell had been predicting for the tunnel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>However, we cannot all travel in bus lanes as the Minister of State can.  We need <Col N="666"/>to get people out of their cars and those that must be used need to be more efficient.  We need joined-up Government thinking.  On this most important area of transport the Government has completely failed and it is out of control.  The way the cities are growing is also out of control.  We do not have sustainable living.  Such sustainable living, with people living, working and having their recreation more or less all in the same area, represents the future for Ireland.  However, the Government has failed in this regard.</P>
        <P>I welcome that the emissions trading scheme is working.  I come from a town with two major industries, Premier Periclase and Irish Cement, which are heavy users of energy.  CRH needed to reconsider the future of the cement industry in Ireland when the emissions trading scheme was introduced.  This is an area in which emissions trading is working.  CRH has given a commitment to invest in a new state-of-the-art plant which will significantly reduce the carbon emissions from this industry in Drogheda in the future.  It is sustaining and driving economic success and vibrancy in my area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Whose policy is that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a European policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Would it be under the 2000 strategy?  I thank the Deputy for the compliment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not use unparliamentary language.  Let us cut to the chase.  EMT is a European-based scheme.  It has nothing to do with the Minister of State or me &mdash; although we support it.  The principle works and is good.  The issue is what we are doing with the rest of our activities.  What are we doing in our other businesses that do not form part of the emissions trading scheme?  In Government Fine Gael will address this issue in a way the present Government parties have failed to do in their ten years in office.</P>
        <P>We are talking about how to change our carbon footprint and reduce our carbon emissions with the benefit of reducing costs.  This needs to be driven locally.  We will give new statutory powers to local authorities for their administrative areas.  Counties may wish to join together as Limerick and Clare have already done on a voluntary basis.  They have defined a climate change strategy for their specific administrative area which means they consider all the activities outside the emissions trading scheme &mdash; industries, shops, hospitals, schools and homes.  They drill right down through every planning application that is made.  They consider the design, whether recyclable material is used and the thermal efficiency of homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the Deputy is reiterating the strategy the Government has announced and that Fine Gael would like to follow it.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="667"/>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister of State were making a reasonable point I would listen to him.  We have approximately eight such energy committees throughout the country.  They were initially funded by way of European grant.  Most of them now operate on a shoestring and do not know whether they will be in existence next year.  Their work has been ignored by the Government.  We will make sure that every county will have such a power by statute.  They will have the support services and the skilled people.  We will drive the agenda locally to reduce carbon emissions.  We will make sure, as the Government should be doing, that every school, hospital, small business and larger industry is required to outline their plan for the following two years, showing what they are doing to reduce their carbon footprint and how they will improve their energy efficiency.  We will ask them whether we can help them devise new schemes, show them what is international best practice and tell them how to do their job.  We will be on the ground doing the business.  That it is not happening at the moment shows the Government&rsquo;s abject failure.  It is interested in climate change now only because it is required to be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is postulating exactly what we are doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>A tide of opinion is pointing out to the Government that it has failed in every respect on its Kyoto targets.  It has been careless in the extreme in dealing with this issue.  It is no <Col N="668"/>longer a matter of care for them or for us; it is a matter of climate change in the world with things changing so radically and soon for all of us.  One of the arguments about climate change is that we must all get involved.  It is no longer a matter for the Government or the Opposition; it is a matter for every household and individual to make that change.  If we do not, we all know the catastrophic situation that will apply, although not initially to Ireland.  The experts tell us that we will experience benefits in that our winters will be warmer and our summers will be drier.  However, there will be changes in the west coast with considerably more rain, etc.</P>
        <P>While changes are coming here they will not be as radical initially they will be in places like Pakistan or India.  In reality poorer people will suffer most.  People who live in cities on river deltas or beside the sea will suffer very significantly.  There will be mass movement of perhaps millions of people in cities throughout the Third World in particular.  The climate will change so radically in Africa that it will transform the world and we need to play our part in it.  I accept the argument that 1 tonne of carbon dioxide removed in Africa is as good as 1 tonne removed from Ireland.  We are not doing enough and the tide is running out.  This Government has failed.  Our modern society has enjoyed high levels of growth but the Government has not kept pace in terms of reducing our carbon emissions.  It has betrayed the environment.  This Government and the speeches by its Ministers, particularly tonight, are a disgrace.</P>

	<P>I am satisfied that section 5 provides for the dis<Col N="670"/>solution of the old society and the establishment of the new one and that there is no discontinuity.  A similar situation is provided for in the Veterinary Practice Act and since Committee Stage, I have sought the views of the Attorney General in respect of this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(3) Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (2)(a)(ii)</i>, the Society&rsquo;s duty under that provision shall include determining and applying criteria for registration which require compliance with any codes of conduct drawn up for pharmacists and undertakings to comply with such codes.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments are grouped together and I note that further amendments are coming from the Minister.  Is it 4 April today?  These further amendments came in at 6 p.m today.  I have difficulty with the fact that we have amendments that have just been received by e-mail from the Minister at 6 p.m. today.  It causes a certain amount of difficulty in terms of speaking on amendments we <Col N="671"/>have tabled well on time.  It may well be that the Minister has dealt with some of the concerns, but I have a few general points to make.</P>
        <P>Due to the fact this legislation has been rushed through both Houses, it is extremely difficult to give it the time, attention and scrutiny it deserves.  We are all very conscious that the Bill has been surprisingly controversial because there was and continues to be full accord across this House in respect of its central thrust, which is about regulating the pharmacy sector, setting standards and protecting patients where a lacuna existed for a long time.  The point has been made that animals were better protected than humans in respect of this kind of service and that we need to put things right.  Despite the existence of common accord, a number of key issues are causing great concern from a number of different perspectives.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that, consequent to the points made on Second Stage in the Seanad, the Minister came up with amendments Nos. 63 and 64, which relate to potential conflicts of interest.  I welcome the fact she has made an effort in this regard.  I must again say I have concerns about the very strong likelihood that this legislation will be challenged in the courts and may prove to be defective because of the terrific speed with which it is being delivered.</P>
        <P>There are requirements in amendment No. 2 in respect of determining and applying criteria for registration which require compliance with any codes of conduct drawn up for pharmacists and undertakings to comply with such codes.  It touches on the concerns that were already expressed by myself and others on Committee Stage about potential conflicts of interest.</P>
        <P>We are witnessing a commercialisation of health care which is new to us and for which we are ill-prepared.  We should have a very robust licensing system in place for health facilities before we allow the kind of free-for-all that has developed, be it in the hospital sector or in primary care.  We have seen predators coming in who have no direct involvement in the provision of health care and who are out to make money out of health care in a way that we have not seen before.  It is very important there is strong regulation and robust legislation that can withstand any legal challenge.</P>
        <P>There are also medical practitioners who have a certain justification in complaining that the lavish tax breaks afforded to developers do not apply to general practitioners trying to improve their service and accommodation.  They have been attempting to develop primary care centres in a certain vacuum because of the failure of the Government to deliver a proper primary care strategy where all the pieces fit.  We have a model of 11 centres that have already been provided or are in the process of being provided.  I visited the excellent centre in Virginia, County Cavan.  That is a model which presents best practice for any<Col N="672"/>body looking at a primary care centre.  Not all primary care centres must be as developed as that.  We can have virtual ones as well, but it is a very good example of best practice.  However, it appears the Health Service Executive has no intention of including pharmacy within a primary care centre anywhere.  Why has the HSE taken a clear policy decision that pharmacy is not part of a primary care centre and that it does not form part of the programme of primary care which the executive itself has initiated?</P>
        <P>We are heading into a difficult area where money is being made and collocation is the source of this.  That leads to difficulties regarding conflicts of interest.  Codes of conduct, safeguards and productions must be robust and clearly defined in law.  The doctors made a point about the Medical Council guidelines, but that is a broad and insufficient safeguard for patients in the area of prescribing and dispensing drugs.  Unfortunately, we have bad examples on rare occasions from the past and present of inappropriate relationships between doctors and pharmacists that have been to the detriment of patients and patient care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister presents amendments so late in the day, we are never quite sure whether they will make a difference or whether they will mean another land-mine that explodes on the next Minister when somebody challenges it in the courts.  Cats and dogs remain better protected than patients in the Irish health care system, even after this debate.  We still have a long way to travel before patients are properly protected.</P>
        <P>The Minister seems to have got around some of the problems regarding beneficial interest.  I am not 100% sure whether it is fully sorted out, but that is what happens when we are flying through legislation on what could possibly be the second last day of the D&aacute;il.  The discussion about market rates is still up in the air.  I am not sure if the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland believes it can regulate this market to decide what is a true market rate for a pharmacy.  That may be impossible, but time will tell.</P>
        <P>We should have a joint council between the PSI and the Medical Council.  There is a great need for all these regulatory bodies to start talking to each other.  There is also a need for the Minister to correct much of the legislation involved.  She has done little to get the bodies talking to each other.  She will be aware of the international reports which show the percentage of pharmacists, doctors and health care professionals who have ended up with substance abuse habits.  They may abuse the drugs for sale themselves, or they may abuse their privilege and sell on those drugs to others.  I am not sure if the Minister has covered those issues in this Bill.  That is why I was hoping she would accept our view that there should be a joint council between the two bodies.</P><Col N="673"/>
        <P Just="Left">Ultimately, a patient safety authority is needed to protect patients, and when Fine Gael and the Labour Party published a policy document last year on a patient safety authority, I think the Minister recognised what we were talking about.  All of the regulatory bodies must talk to each other and some body must direct that, which should be the patient safety authority.  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland must come up with ethical guidelines on how doctors and pharmacists interact and work together.</P>
        <P>Let me focus on something in which the Minister believes and on which I support her to some extent, namely, prescribing by nurses.  I still have concerns about it and we must be careful on how we move on it.  We never defined quite clearly whether a nurse working in the health spa of a five-star hotel could prescribe drugs.  At what level can nurses prescribe?  Can they prescribe in a hospital or in a GP surgery?  The Minister wants the fitness to practise hearings in the Medical Council to take place in public, but the fitness to practise hearings for nurses at An Bord Altranais are never held in public.  We raised concerns about the structure of Health Information and Quality Authority and whether it will protect patients.  The Leas Cross scandal occurred relatively recently and I think time will tell how well known it was among senior management of the HSE and how nothing happened for quite some time.  The inquiry into Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital showed what can go wrong when the structures are not in place.</P>
        <P>Has the Bill taken the UK Shipman report into account?  That was far more comprehensive than anything we have ever done in this country.  There are concerns about what seems to be unusual prescribing of cyclomorph, which is a form of morphine that Harold Shipman used to murder his own patients.  Has the Minister taken the recommendations of this report on board?  We want to balance things.  We do not want to regulate excessively, but the Minister should have taken on board everything in that report when she was framing the Bill.  So much takes place that the potential for abuse is huge.</P>
        <P>The Minister and her colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il are pushing a private model that is not like the competitive private model of the Blackrock Clinic or the Beacon Clinic.  They are pushing a private model where the State takes up many services from the private sector.  Many of the abuses that have occurred worldwide are cases where the State has contracted a great number of services from the private sector.  When the Minister talks about abuses in the public system, she is actually talking about abuses that occur when the private model is mixed with the public model.</P>
      
        <P>Some public clinics have been closed down and the work has been transferred to private clinics.  It is quite possible that those private clinics will be pushing doctors and other health professionals to increase the work they do on patients from the <Col N="674"/>public system because the public system is paying for it.  The same checks and balances in regard to whether these investigations are even needed are often not in place in the public system.  VHI or BUPA, because they are private companies, will generally be careful about making sure they do not find themselves in a Deloitte &amp; Touche situation.  It would never happen that a private company would pay out &euro;165 million to consultants without having the foggiest notion what is going on.  This is what happened in regard to PPARS, however, with consultants being paid &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million without anybody knowing what was happening.  That would not happen in the private system because it has better checks and balances in place.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister&rsquo;s drive towards using the private system to pay for public services is not ideal.  The same difficulties may arise in respect of her co-location plan if effective governance structures are not in place and procedures are not properly defined.  Nothing about the HSE inspires confidence that this will happen.  The Minister has talked a good talk in rushing through this legislation.  However, for those of us who may have more intimate knowledge of how the health services work and who think the issues through more thoroughly, significant concerns remain which the Minister has not confronted.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister read the recent report in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> on the mental health tribunals that were set up under the auspices of the Mental Health Commission according to the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001.  I pointed out on Committee Stage that it is a good idea, of which I remain a strong supporter, that anybody who is admitted to hospital involuntarily should have an opportunity to have that involuntary admission independently reviewed by the Mental Health Commission.  Although the system has been operating for only six or seven months, however, the HSE has already raised major concerns with the Minister that it is not working well.</P>
        <P>One of the main problems is that it is turning into something of an adversarial system, in which lawyers are involved, rather than the advocacy process that was envisaged to allow patients have their involuntary admissions reviewed.  It was not established to provide an opportunity to sue doctors and blame people.  Rather, its purpose was to offer a second opinion and to advocate on behalf of these vulnerable patients.  Although it was only set up on 1 November 2006, it is already the subject of concern on the part of the Irish Medical Organisation and the HSE.  This was something that was planned for five years.</P>
        <P>The Minister can dismiss the points I have made but there is no denying the concerns that exist on this issue.  One of the best ways forward is to be found through my party&rsquo;s proposal to establish a patient safety organisation.  The Minister must kick into touch on these issues by offer<Col N="675"/>ing her full support to our position.  Health services are taking a strange direction.  Where there is potential for abuse, it usually occurs.  A small minority of people engage in such abuse and it is our duty to protect the majority.  We have a particular duty to protect patients in the public health care system.</P>
        <P>I expect the Minister will not accept many of the Opposition amendments.  I will withdraw my amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister agrees it would be helpful to have a crystal ball when drawing up legislation.  It is often difficult to foresee the long-term consequences of the legislation we enact in this House.  Some GPs maintain that the question of beneficial interests has not been settled and they have made representations to some of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues on this point.  They are of the strong view that five years hence, there will be undesirable consequences as a result of this legislation.  I cannot tell whether that is the case.  The Minister is strongly of the view that this issue has been dealt with thoroughly in the legislation.  These GPs contend, however, that it will have a hugely detrimental effect on the roll-out of the primary health care strategy.  I hope the Minister will consider what they have said.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers stated, as I did on Second Stage, that the role of the pharmacist must be greatly enhanced and thoroughly integrated into the primary health care system.  I fully support that view.  However, I have raised a particular concern with the Minister in regard to empowering nurses and pharmacists to prescribe medications.  This is the issue of antibiotic prescribing.  It seems there is no consistency across the board in this regard.</P>
        <P>How will we regulate and monitor the prescribing of antibiotics?  Are there graphs of data to indicate the practices of particular pharmacists?  Patients will invariably go to the pharmacy that is closest to their GP&rsquo;s surgery.  In Ringsend, for example, people go straight from the health centre to the nearby pharmacy to get their prescriptions.  It should be possible to ascertain quickly which GPs seem most inclined to prescribe antibiotics.  In fairness to the Minister, she raised this as an issue of concern at a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  What concerns me, however, is her assertion that it would take approximately 12 years to change the prevailing mindset in regard to antibiotic prescribing.  We must act quicker than that if we are to deal with the related problem of MRSA.  There is no doubt the two are related.</P>
        <P>I agree with other speakers that this could be the second last sitting day of this D&aacute;il.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her clarification.</P>
        <P>This is an issue I have raised with her previously.  I wish to ascertain how she intends empowering nurses and enhancing the role of pharmacists while more stringently regulating antibiotic prescribing.  The Ceann Comhairle is a doctor and I am sure he understands all of this issue.  I seek some indication from the Minister on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of the important points have been made by other speakers.  This is a complex issue.  This legislation will not put to bed all the concerns expressed by clearly conflicting sets of interests.  That reality will continue to present itself from time to time.  I am not sure, having tried to inform myself, there is necessarily a formula that will satisfy all of these competing interests.  I do not believe that is within any Minister&rsquo;s gift.  However, we have a responsibility to ensure that the regulations made under the Bill are both enforceable and enforced.  This includes, as many of these amendments refer to, areas <Col N="677"/>directly affecting codes of conduct.  This is very important.</P>
        <P>This Bill has presented a major challenge.  I have no doubt it should, of course, have been published a long time ago.  It is seriously overtime but I also have no doubt it presented a challenge to the Minister and her Department.  It certainly presented a challenge to the members of the various Opposition groupings in the House.  However, we have a responsibility to try to steer the best legislation possible that will help copperfasten public confidence in the pharmacy sector and not only in the obvious way in terms of the traditional family pharmacy presence, in each of our respective communities, that have given long and much appreciated and valuable service to their respective hinterlands but the network across the State where anyone and everyone could, at any time, have to access and avail of the service provided.  It is also concerned with the integrity of the sector.</P>
        <P>Deputy Twomey has indicated the withdrawal of one of the amendments presented in this grouping but I am not sure which one.  I am supportive of the broad thrust of the group of amendments as presented, to which the names of Deputy McManus and others have been appended.  I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say in response and how willing she is to accommodate the thoughtful preparation of amendments by several Deputies in preparation for this Stage.  I hope the approach will not be the traditional one of rejection, which we have heard so often.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I have read the amendments but I do not have the great knowledge that our previous speakers have shown.  Will the Minister tell us whether there will be a total ban on locating pharmacists in health centres?  I ask her to be clear about that because it is an issue that has arisen in different areas.  If the answer is that there is no ban, will pharmacists be charged a normal rent rather than a large amount of money for inclusion in the health centre?  Those are the issues about which I am concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there any chance that a pharmacy will be charged a large amount of money?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that pharmacists be charged normal rents if there is no ban on locating pharmacists in health centres.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy think they should be charged normal rents?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I have taken many points but these are the main ones about which I am concerned.  I am concerned about the development of the health service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>On Second Stage I gave broad support to the Bill.  It was obvious much work had gone into it even though the time to debate it was limited.  I share Deputy Gormley&rsquo;s concern about the crystal ball.  The amendment tabled in the Seanad seemed to satisfy the pharmacists but it produced another set of problems for general practitioners and the delivery of primary health care.  I met a few of them who said it was likely it would be delivered almost exclusively by the private sector if the current circumstances continue.  What they have said is that the private sector is likely to withdraw from it.  What is the vision for primary health care in ten years&rsquo; time if there is a disconnect between pharmacists and GPs?</P>
        <P>In my constituency a planning application for a medical centre, a pharmacy and a child care facility was lodged.  It was perceived there were objections from pharmacists in the area and in the end it was turned down.  The point made by Deputy McManus about the commercialisation of medicine is a valid one because we are beginning to see things we would not have seen before, essentially turf wars.  I wonder whether we are going the full circle.  In the past our health centres used to be called dispensaries.  When there was no commercialisation a range of different services was provided from them, albeit, at a much lower level.</P>
        <P>I cannot make a value judgment on who is right and who is wrong on this matter.  However, I am concerned about some of what has been said to me.  If there is no State investment in primary health care and the private sector withdraws how can the strategy be delivered?  That is the nub of the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank all the Deputies who have contributed to the debate.  I am very impressed with the great level of interest shown in the private sector from the Deputies opposite because I am usually attacked here.  In fact, there is a contradiction between the emphasis on commercialisation and private interests.</P>
        <P>To clarify an issue raised by Deputy Twomey, there is no question of a nurse being able to prescribe in a spa.  Nurses will be able to prescribe only in particular health care settings, for example, a palliative care nurse in a palliative care setting and so on.  There is no question of a nurse being able to prescribe in a spa, hotel or anything of that kind.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked about the current position regarding the legislation that has been presented to Brussels.  It had to go to Brussels and is due to <Col N="679"/>be cleared at the end of three months, which is up in two weeks&rsquo; time.  In conjunction with that, An Bord Altranais is arranging specific training for nurses.  The intention is that it will take effect later this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Will there be clear regulations as to where nurses can prescribe?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Has An Bord Altranais issued ethical guidelines on prescribing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It will do that.  That is a matter for the regulatory body.  As I said on Committee Stage, I regret the rushed nature of the debate and I accept it is rushed.  I accept also that the volume of legislation coming from my Department has been a challenge to the Department, the Parliamentary Counsel, Opposition spokespersons and others.  Three large Bills are going through the House and will be enacted before the election.  The reality is that this legislation has been a long time in gestation.  I gave a commitment and I wanted to honour it.  I put my officials and the parliamentary draftsman under enormous pressure to deliver on that commitment because if the legislation is not passed before the D&aacute;il is dissolved it all falls.  It would certainly be next year before we would have legislation in this area.  Effectively in the pharmacy sector, as far as the society is concerned, we do not have a fitness to practise regime.</P>
        <P>However, I must say to Deputy Gormley that I believe we will be back here on 24 April and for some time thereafter.  I look forward to coming back as Minister for Health and Children.  I know the Deputy told me he did not want to be the Minister, but I do.  I draw the attention of all spokespersons on health matters to an article that was given to me today entitled &ldquo;Global trends in healthcare&rdquo;.  It states that there is no country where people do not complain about their health system and where people are not calling for reform.  Everyone who is interested in being the Minister for Health and Children should note that the document states: &ldquo;Ministers of health anywhere in the globe must have done something bad in an earlier life or they would not be condemned to the ministry&rdquo;.  Perhaps Deputy Gormley had read that when he said he did not want to be the Minister.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to indicate that I will accept two amendments from Deputy McManus.  I already accepted some of her amendments on Committee Stage.  I assure the House that this is <Col N="680"/>not a political bias, as most people will understand.  It is just that they are good amendments and have been cleared legally. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a gender thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a gender thing either.  I hope I am big, brave and honest enough to accept good amendments from wherever they come.  I accepted quite a few in the Seanad or said I would have them checked.  The amendments introduced in the Seanad concerning conflicts of interest have caused a lot of interest from all kinds of people.  Deputies and Senators have spoken on them, which is the wonderful thing about this democracy.  If we all accept as an ethical principle that there should be no beneficial interest between prescribing and dispensing, the question arises as to how one can give legislative effect to that.  That is what we sought to do and we took the advice of the Attorney General.  In that respect, we did not prohibit co-location, other than that there have to be separate entrances for any new facilities.  We did not prohibit any landlord-tenancy arrangements, nor did we say it should be a planning issue.  I accept that much confusion and ambiguity have arisen.  That is why I am proposing two amendments, one of which is to say landlord and tenancy arrangements are not affected.  The other concerns a commercial relationship by way of an owner of a property renting.  I was asked by Deputy Sherlock, who did not answer it himself, about normal rent.  If one goes to the market and advertises a premises for rent, and if the person who makes the biggest bid is a pharmacist, that is not an issue.  That is normal.  It may be abnormal in the sense that a flower shop will pay less, I presume, than a pharmacy.  Everybody would pay more to be co-located with doctors but it was never envisaged in the primary care strategy that pharmacies and doctors would be located together for a very simple reason.  In an average town there is a number of pharmacies, but whatever about bringing a number of doctors together it would be a minefield to have four or five pharmacies in the one location.  I could not see that working very well.  Therefore, the normal landlord-tenancy relationship will not be affected by this legislation.  It was never intended that it would be affected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are giving the regulators, under the rubric of fitness to practise, power to ensure no unethical behaviour occurs.  That means nobody is prescribing to get a benefit from dispensing or <i>vice versa</i>, if it could happen.</P>
        <P>I am also proposing another amendment concerning partners, whether medical or pharmacy partners.  A valid point was made to me that if two people are in partnership and one is involved in unethical behaviour, but the other is not aware of that, it would be unfair that the latter person could be before a fitness to practise inquiry. <Col N="681"/> However, there will be a requirement on the other person if they become aware of the unethical behaviour to report it to the regulator within 21 days.  That is reasonable.  It was never intended, by virtue of a partnership, that the other person would be affected by the unethical behaviour of one of the partners.  That point was made to me and I felt it was a good idea to take it on board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That is the essence of the two amendments.  Landlord and tenancy arrangements are not affected, and where one partner is involved in unethical behaviour and the other is not aware of it, obviously it is not a fitness to practise issue for the latter, unless it can be shown they were aware and within 21 days did not report it to the regulator.</P>
        <P>I will not go into all the issues that were raised earlier but if I had a crystal ball I probably would not be here.  If I could predict all the things that were going to happen with the certainty of the crystal ball, I would probably decide to be somewhere else.  Legislation is always amended and inevitably legislation is tested in the courts.  Circumstances evolve and change and both the medical and pharmaceutical professions have changed.  I am a strong fan of encouraging people to invest in health care.  Professionals do well in any developed society.  I said this to solicitors a number of years ago when we were introducing the Personal Injury Assessment Board and many of them thought they would go out of business.  In any developed society of which I am aware, highly educated and highly skilled professionals always do well.  I believe in encouraging people to invest in new facilities.  We have many strategies &mdash; the buzz word &mdash; in the Department of Health and Children.  In fairness, I do not think anybody contradicts that fact that they were never all costed and put together.  If they were everybody would realise it would be an almost impossible task if the State was to fund it all.  The primary care strategy is essentially about bringing health care professionals together in a network working for patients.  It would not be possible for the State to pay for all the facilities.  If it did so it would be at the expense of something else.  We currently spend &euro;14 billion, a considerable sum, but it cannot do everything.</P>
        <P>I was a fan of tax incentives for general practitioners but it would have to have been cleared by the EU and that is why the idea has not been pursued.  If I thought it could be cleared by the EU I would have been keen to push the idea.  Perhaps that can be pursued in the new Government but it cannot be done at the moment because it could not happen without EU clearance.  There are more stringent rules at EU level concerning tax allowances than a couple of years ago.  That is why it is much more difficult and challenging to introduce tax breaks for worthy things like primary care facilities or health facilities generally.</P>

The Minister is saying here that representative bodies elect their representatives and the Minister cannot refuse to appoint them.  This seems like a clumsy and awkward way to provide for the exact same result.  Sometimes there is a sense that the Minister has a control requirement that results in these peculiar arrangements.

	<P>I wish to speak on amendments Nos. 5 and 6 as they are the same, as Deputy McManus says.  These amendments have been presented for consideration by this Minister <Col N="686"/>and other Ministers across a number of portfolios where appointments will be made to specific bodies, councils and so on. Gender equality is the objective.  We have dealt with recent legislation where this matter was addressed and we have yet to see a response that gives confidence that this Government will ensure we will have at least a 40% representation of both genders in State bodies, however the remaining 20% balance is distributed between the two.  It is very important that we endeavour to achieve these goals and I hope the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, in one of the last pieces of legislation she is likely to address substantively here in the House, will accede to Deputy McManus&rsquo;s appeal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Hopefully this is one of the last pieces of legislation I am likely to address substantively here in the House before the election, in any case.  </P>
        <P>As I said on Committee Stage, nine of the members are elected and, at the moment, 38% of the members of the society are women including two former presidents, the current vice-president and two former registrars.  In health care professional grades and professional positions in health care generally there is now a majority of female students.  This amendment is too prescriptive, especially when nine of the 21 members are elected.</P>
        <P>I am sure Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will take this in the spirit it is meant but half of the members of my party in this House are female while none of the members of his party in this House are female.  It is not always easy to get the desirable outcome.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly favour gender balance as I think it leads to more objective decision making but I think it is happening organically.  This amendment is too prescriptive.  I believe the issue in the future will be having a male presence of 40% in such societies.  If one looks at pharmacy students, medical students, therapy students and nursing students today one will hardly see a man in the room.</P>

	<P>It is a pity the Minister will not include the proposed provision in the legislation.  While I agree that co-decision making and gender balance tends to result in improved decision making, what matters most is not which gender is excluded or in a small minority but the gender imbalance.  The Minister is hopeful about the pharmacy sector and her hopes may be well-placed but she should not harbour illusions about achieving gender balance in the Oireachtas because it will take hundreds of years at the current rate.  This disturbing feature of parliamentary decision-making, in a country in which half the population is female, places an onus on Members to ensure the balance we want but may not live to see in the House is at least provided for in State boards and regulatory bodies.  We must also ensure it holds firm in the future, irrespective of the nature or composition of the sector in question.  It frequently occurs that those making decisions at senior level in predominately female sectors are predominately male.  A number of obvious examples come to mind.  Ensuring a balanced arrangement in a board or structure protects people of both genders.  I regret the Minister will not accept the amendment. </P>

One cannot make a direct analogy with the make-up of the respective political groupings in the House, although parties must consciously strive to achieve gender balance.

We should encourage and facilitate a greater balanced input by males and females and these amendments are constructed to achieve that end.  </P>

	<P>As someone who has held power and authority in the Chamber, has the Minister <Col N="688"/>considered the possibility of allocating a specific number of seats in the House under a list system?  The political and electoral systems are structured in such a way as to make it extremely difficult for those with young families to get elected.  No one is under any illusions about the amount of work needed to come through the system.  The political system militates against women reaching positions from which they could be elected to the House, albeit not deliberately.  Getting elected is difficult for everyone but particularly young women.  Perhaps we should introduce a list system under which Members of one or other gender would be selected if the House failed to reach a minimum gender balance.  Other European parliaments operate this system to good effect and a similar type of system could be helpful here.  A list system would allow seats to be distributed on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, the method used to appoint committee members and allocate speaking slots among the parties. </P>

	<P>Forcing solutions on democracies does not work.  To take teaching and nursing as examples, both professions are predominately female &mdash; 80% to 90% of nurses and teachers are, I believe, female &mdash; yet women frequently exclude themselves from positions as trade union representatives in these professions.  They do so for good reasons, including on family grounds, but they also make career choices for other reasons.  I would love to have more women Members but the Oireachtas and politics in general are not family friendly. </P>

This is not easy for men or women and much more could be done to make parliamentary structures more family friendly.  While such changes could encourage more women to become involved in politics, this is a major cultural issue.  We made significant strides in this regard in the 1980s but have slipped back since then.  Political representation is a wider issue than the pharmacy profession and not one for this debate.  </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 14, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) before drafting or giving effect to a code of conduct, consult with bodies which are representative of the pharmacy sector, and with any other person or body the Council considers appropriate,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The amendment proposes to introduce a requirement for consultation in drawing up codes of conduct.  A similar amendment proposed in the Seanad, which named the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, was withdrawn having been found to be flawed.  This amendment proposes that before drafting or giving effect to a code of conduct &mdash; such codes have a significant impact on those working in the sector &mdash; the board shall consult bodies which are representative of the pharmacy sector, and with any other person or body the council considers appropriate.</P>
        <P>Although the amendment is harmless, I presume the Minister does not propose to accept it.  It proposes a form of inclusion which is beneficial as it would ensure the process takes account of the views of those who work in the sector and will be required to comply with the code of conduct.  They will not make the decision on the code &mdash; the decision making process is clear &mdash; but will have some sense of ownership of the requirements imposed on them.  This would lead to greater responsibility, more engagement by professionals, enhanced understanding of what is required of them and possibly even better public awareness of the requirements and duties included in a code of conduct.  This kind of process is of benefit in itself but it would also ensure the code of conduct developed is the best one for patients.  In that sense, I hope an amendment such as this can be accepted by the Minister because it firmly sets the idea that when one is developing a code of conduct, the people must be engaged in that development.  It is not that they will necessarily determine the outcome but that they feed in and the system of any code will be more robust as a consequence of that kind of inclusion.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="690"/>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>This is fairly straightforward.  It raises some of the issues to which I referred regarding a joint council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Medical Council.  Nothing in the Bill suggests the body that regulates pharmacists must talk to the body that regulates doctors or <i>vice versa</i>.  Complaints can be made about either pharmacists or doctors but they are expected to go to their own regulatory body.</P>
        <P>Doctors now work closely with pharmacists, and practice nurses are becoming much more important within primary care and take a much greater role.  There are also more advanced nurse practitioners as well as physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists, all of whom will be working as teams within the community.  However, the regulations for all these practitioners state they must be boxed off and treated separately.  If there is a problem with a doctor, it goes to the Medical Council, while a problem with a pharmacist goes to the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.</P>
        <P>We need a mechanism whereby all the regulatory organisations are to some degree compelled to communicate on complaints that have been made.  If this mechanism were in place, it might prevent some of the concerns that have been expressed to the Minister.  There is a serious need in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The basis of the Fine Gael-Labour Party proposal for a patient safety authority was the establishment of some form of overarching body.  It seems amazing that the accountancy profession has such an overarching body &mdash; I think the Minister set it up &mdash; whereas patients do not.  As we are moving to this point, having to some degree forced the Minister to move to it, it is important we should go the full way and establish a patient safety authority that will compel the regulatory organisations to communicate better with each other.</P>
        <P>The amendment specifically states that the doctors&rsquo; and pharmacists&rsquo; representative bodies should also see the codes of ethics that have been drawn up for them, which would happen in any case.  That input will come, as we have seen with regard to other legislation.  However, legislation is needed to begin to force these regulatory bodies to communicate with each other.  While I do not suggest they should be compelled to do so, it should be natural that these organisations would talk to each other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the accounting profession, the supervisory body was established because there are different branches of accountancy which each has regulatory functions.  At the tribunals, the role of accountants in signing off on audited accounts was seriously questioned in many cases.  It could be argued that if the accountants had done their job, many of the tribunals would not have been necessary.  It was felt <Col N="691"/>by many that if one were part of the larger group of accountants, one would never be called before the regulatory body whereas if one was a smaller fish, one would be disciplined.  When that matter was examined &mdash; in my previous role, I established a group to consider the matter &mdash; there were two options, namely, State regulation, which I do not favour, or the establishment of a body that would supervise the regulators in accounting.  That is very different from what Deputy Twomey suggests in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The principle remains the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not in any way the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The same concerns have been expressed about patients.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of that was to supervise how the bodies operated.  The Deputy is not suggesting a supervisory body that will supervise how the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland or the Medical Council regulate.  He is suggesting that we have a body at the level of which the various regulatory bodies would meet.  These bodies have very separate functions.  One does not need to prescribe in law for people to talk to each other, for God&rsquo;s sake.  The Deputy and I can talk to each other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Sometimes it is needed because there is often not the required communication between regulatory organisations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Every time there is a problem in this country, people either call for more legislation or some other body.  Sometimes we simply need to make the bodies that exist work.  This proposal is too prescriptive and bureaucratic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not that difficult.  It can be done.  The Minister has set up a commission to investigate this matter, so she is not totally against the principle of what I suggest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We set up a group to consider whether we would have State regulation of accountants or whether we would do something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>These bodies must regulate in the public interest.  They are not representative bodies for either the doctors or the pharmacists.  They exist to regulate the profession in the public <Col N="692"/>interest and to support the profession.  They have very separate functions.  Perhaps some day we will have one regulatory body for all health care professions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I assumed the Minister had read our policy.  Maybe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy made this point on Committee Stage last week.  It would be extraordinarily bureaucratic, excessively prescriptive and unnecessary.  There is sufficient authority for the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Medical Council to engage with each other.  There is no difficulty with that.  If we begin legislating and formalising that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not trying to be unfair to the Deputy as I know he has been helpful but he raised this earlier and I did not agree to it.</P>
        <P>With regard to consulting, which was raised by Deputy McManus, of course this will happen.  Again, I do not believe we need to be prescriptive with regard to who one consults and when one consults them.  In fact, as with the Medical Practitioners Bill, there has been widespread consultation with pharmacy interests in the preparation of this Bill, which has been strengthened.  This is normal practice nowadays and is a good thing.  We do not need specifically to write it into the Bill for it to happen.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 10:</P><Col N="693"/>
        <P LI="1">In page 20, line 35, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment proposes to change the requirement on the Minister in regard to making regulations.  The Bill states: &ldquo;The Minister may, for the purposes of the health, safety and convenience of the public, make regulations about all or any of the following matters in respect of retail pharmacy businesses&rdquo;.  When one reads this, it raises the question that if there are health and safety issues, there must be an onus on the Minister to deal with them.  It is not a matter of choice so that if there are health and safety issues in the retail pharmacy business, the Minister might or might not deal with them by way of regulation.  That seems an irresponsible approach.  If these issues arise, the Minister shall make the regulations.  If they do not arise, the Minister will not do so.</P>
        <P>The danger is that the subsection could be interpreted as suggesting the choice is with the Minister whether to pay attention to health, safety and convenience of the public issues.  That is not good enough.  We are talking about patient safety.  This is a practical, immediate way to protect patients and to establish a certain requirement on the Minister to live up to his or her responsibility.  Ministers are very good at making everybody else live up to their responsibility but, in this instance, I would have thought it was more appropriate to be crystal clear on what must be done in regard to the health, safety and convenience to the public.  This point was raised by the hospital pharmacists, who feel it is vital from a patient safety point of view because it allows for the setting of standards both for practice and pharmacy premises and will ensure quality and safety of pharmacy service.  It must also apply to the practice of all pharmacists and their premises, including hospital pharmacists in hospital pharmacy departments.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Committee Stage is a bit of a blur now because of the amount of material covered in debate, but as I recall, the Minister indicated then that hospital pharmacies would not necessarily be subject to regulation because of their nature.  If we intend bringing in a regulatory framework which is significantly different from the current situation where there is practically no regulatory framework, let us do it right and let us get the responsibilities in place.  This is obviously a ministerial responsibility.</P>
        <P>There is no timeframe for the implementation of the regulations.  This is often an issue with legislation and regulations often take forever to materialise, despite being written into law.  However, they are at least written into law.  This morning I raised an issue relating to the tobacco legislation for which secondary legislation is required, but we are still waiting for it and nobody seems to know when we will get it.  That goes back a couple of years.</P><Col N="694"/>
        <P>It is not as if this amendment imposes an unrealistic or unfair requirement on the Minister.  It simply says that where there are issues of health safety or convenience for the public, the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; make regulations.  I urge the Minister to ensure the amendment is accepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McManus has explained the need for the amendment very well.  I hope the Minister will understand that when it comes to patient safety, there should be no leeway.  Protection of patients should not just be at the discretion of the Minister.  Rather, the Minister should be obliged to protect patients.  We have heard much during this debate about patient safety.  I hope the Minister understands from where we are coming on this.  She may argue that it is self-evident that if there was a problem, any responsible Minister would act to protect patients.  However, I would like to see it copperfastened and set down in law that the Minister must and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; act.  I see no major difficulty in that regard, but I am sure the Minister will have a reasonable explanation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support amendment No. 10 which proposes to delete the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I also support amendment No. 11.  I urge the Minister to support amendment No. 11 and ask her to note the substantial difference between the thrust of amendment No. 11 and that of amendments Nos. 7 and 8 which were discussed earlier and which spoke of the council.  They proposed the council should &ldquo;consult with bodies which are representative of the pharmacy sector, and with any other person or body the Minister considers appropriate&rdquo;.  However, in the case of amendment No. 11 it is the Minister rather than the council who is being urged to consult bodies which are representative of the pharmaceutical sector in determining new regulations.  He or she should also consult any other person or body the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must recognise there are a number of bodies which the Minister should consult on the introduction of new regulations.  Whoever is the incumbent at the time will have to make that determination because the amendment leaves it to his or her judgment as to who is considered appropriate.  In my view, those appropriate must include the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI, the Medical Council, An Bord Altranais and the Dental Council.</P>
        <P>I will go even further.  As a Deputy from the Border counties, I suggest good and best practice into the future, in line with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response to me on this issue last week, would mean we should look at these matters on an all-island basis and should have the maximum co-operation, consultation and cohesion in terms of the delivery of health care in all its dimensions.  This must include the areas of regulations, codes <Col N="695"/>of conduct etc. that will apply.  We need to pool our collective resources and experiences in order to arrive at the best formula.  In this instance, I believe there should be consultation with the appropriate counter bodies north of the Border.</P>
        <P>I understand the PSI has also encouraged this position and that it would like to see the maximum consultation taking place with the appropriate other bodies.  We need to recognise the importance of maximum consultation.  Regulation is very important.  We are aware the prescription and dispensing of drugs is a lucrative business.  While the majority of practitioners &mdash; general practitioners, medical doctors and dispensing pharmacists &mdash; operate and maintain the highest standards at all times, there is always a risk that some may fall prey to temptation.  The suggestion has been made here previously that some people in the sector see the public purse as a honey pot for over-prescription because of the lucrative return therefrom.</P>
        <P>Regulation is of significant importance.  We need to recognise that while there are competing aspects in the roles played by GPs and pharmacists, there are clearly more coinciding interests.  Therefore, the careful consideration of the standard of regulation is essential.  Amendment No. 11 is geared towards ensuring the best possible arrangement and formula for introducing new regulations into the future.  The crossover consultation is essential in this regard.  Any Minister in the position of this Minister would, in acting responsibly, wish to take this course.  Therefore, the amendment merits inclusion in the legislation and I commend it to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Deputies that consultation is the norm nowadays.  Not much can happen without consultation, but there are some areas where it does not happen.  We dealt with a health insurance risk equalisation Bill some time ago and there were reasons that there could not be consultation on that matter.  Generally speaking, however, apart from occasions when somebody could get an advantage through consultation, it is normal.  If we replace &ldquo;may&rdquo; with &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, the provision will be extremely prescriptive and put the Government into a straitjacket which may not be necessary.  If it is in the interest of patient safety, the Minister may do this but by inserting &ldquo;shall&rdquo; the Minister must do this in respect of a host of matters.  It may not be necessary to make regulations.  There might be a different way to deal with the matter. </P>
        <P>Primary legislation, and the courts recently, have ensured that Ministers cannot, through regulations or statutory instruments, set aside primary legislation and do things that it does not intend.  It is equally true that if one puts into primary legislation a requirement to do something one must do it for a host of situations in <Col N="696"/>which it might not be necessary.  I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s answer was very particular on the question of &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 11 is not as prescriptive because it states &ldquo;the Minister considers appropriate&rdquo;.  That leaves the door open to the Minister&rsquo;s judgment.  It is not as clearly defined as amendment No. 10.  Accordingly, the response does not suit the argument.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 11 relates to amendment No. 10 in using &ldquo;shall&rdquo; which makes the Minister do something and saying that, before doing so, the Minister should consult with the pharmacy sector.  Is that right? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I gave a recent example off the top of my head in which there was no consultation.  There may be times when one would not consult but the norm is to consult.  Good practice in the making of legislation and good business in the art of politics mean that people consult.  The great strength of this democracy is that we consult with people affected by legislation and listen to their views.  One does not have to agree with their views, or can dismiss those views, but at least one is aware of them so that one is informed in the making or amending of legislation of the perspective of those who have a view on it.</P>
        <P>This process is much more developed than it was when I first entered this House.  There is widespread consultation with interested parties on the making of law and regulations.  In this instance they may not necessarily all be from the pharmacy sector.  There could be others who have an interest in this legislation, for example, from the educational point of view, the Irish Medicines Board, or others who have a bearing on safety issues.  I ask the Deputies to accept in good faith that these things happen as a matter of routine but not to put us in a legislative straitjacket.</P>

        <P FLI="0">There is considerable concern about making sure that an unhealthy relationship is not created between a medical practitioner and a pharmacist.  This legislation is likely to be tested in the courts so it is important to make it as robust as possible.</P>
        <P>The Minister often says that she does not want to be prescriptive but there is a danger in that approach of becoming careless and leaving openings for clever lawyers to argue successfully positions that were never intended.  This amendment is quite prescriptive but it is important to consider it fairly, with a view to ensuring that its goal, which is to protect patients is achieved.</P>
        <P>No one can have had more than a cursory glance at the other amendments in the group which came in just before we started to speak on the Bill.  Some came in at 6 p.m. this evening when it was impossible to get legal advice.  They seem to be doing something other than I intend because they ensure that, for example, property relations are not included in any way and saying that the pharmacist is not guilty of professional misconduct and that these are protections of the pharmacist in respect of the legislation.  This is very unsatisfactory and it is difficult to be competent to judge these amendments when one has <Col N="699"/>not seen them before.  We are flying blind which is not a satisfactory way for parliament to scrutinise and process legislation.  I regret this because I believe in the ethical basis of this Bill.  This is important legislation which deserves a better and more competent Government that would have ensured it was brought in earlier.</P>
        <P>The Minister repeatedly tells us that we will be back for a week or so after Easter.  If that is the case, why are we dealing with this legislation at 10.20 p.m. with amendments that came in a couple of hours ago?  If the D&aacute;il is returning and there will be an Order of Business, the Pharmacy Bill deserves the space and time between Committee and Report Stages allowed for under the normal process.  The Ceann Comhairle laid down strong guidelines for a two-week period between the publication of a Bill and Committee Stage and a reasonable time between then and Report Stage.  We do not have that time.  If we are coming back after Easter, what is the Minister&rsquo;s excuse for unnecessarily rushing through this complex Bill which directly affects patients?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment, perhaps the most important we have reached.  It seeks to eliminate what in the worst cases would be corrupt relationships between pharmacists and general practitioners.  I have met the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland which has outlined some of its findings in pharmacy inspections.   Clearly, we should all be concerned at the evidence presented, especially relating to general practitioner direction of patients to specific pharmacies.  Such a relationship is inappropriate and can create enormous problems in communities.  Other worrying indicators of worst practice include the discovery of General Medical Service prescription pads in a pharmacy&rsquo;s controlled drugs safe.  More seriously, they found evidence of flagrant breaches in the management of controlled drugs.  For the second time this evening, the spectre of Harold Shipman enters our deliberations.  The PSI is 100% behind ensuring the highest standard of regulation is introduced in order that such practices are outlawed and the regulations are fully enforceable and enforced, which is hugely important.</P>
        <P>The major new factor in this issue is the primary care centres run privately with pharmacies <i>in situ</i>.  These are covered in later amendments relating to sections 63 and 64.  Those sections are absolutely necessary and the PSI points to the inappropriate relationship between pharmacists and the proprietors of such centres.  In some places, existing pharmacies have even been approached for &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money so that they would have a special place in the consideration for access to these prime locations.  It must be ensured that sight is not lost of the historic and important contribution the traditional family pharmacy has made to communities throughout <Col N="700"/>the State.  The Minister has made it clear she does not intend to outlaw the proposition of co-location, which is correct, but nevertheless there is a responsibility on every one of us to ensure, where abuses can arise, that special doctor-chemist arrangements do not apply or the super rents referred to earlier and other such practices. They cannot be tolerated.</P>

	<P>Deputy McManus referred to the late sitting.  Many people have worked since 7.30 a.m. or 8 a.m. today and I wish we had a longer period to debate the legislation.  However, there is a broad consensus and I do not detect great disagreement about the legislation, as everybody acknowledges the need for it.  I gave a commitment, which it was important to honour, to introduce the legislation this session, and that is what I have done.</P>
        <P>The conflict of interest issue arose in parts of the country and unethical behaviour resulted with prescribing doctors contaminated by a beneficial interest in a pharmacy.  Doctors, pharmacists, Members and the public accept that is undesirable and the pharmacy review group drew attention to the need to prohibit that practice.  To address this, I tabled amendments on Committee Stage in the Seanad because the Attorney General strongly advised that dealing with the conflict of interest issue by way of property related provisions would be unconstitutional and would be subject to a legal minefield that would be impossible to enforce.</P>
        <P>I stated when the Bill was published that my intention was to table amendments, which were being prepared by the Parliamentary Counsel.  However, the amendments caused confusion in that it was felt landlord and tenancy arrangement would be prohibited and, in one case, we were told the planning authorities might not grant planning approval and An Bord Plean&aacute;la could refuse an application on appeal for planning approval.  Clearly, the intention is not to interfere with normal landlord tenancy arrangements.  My intention is to give the regulatory bodies the power to ensure no unethical behaviour occurs among doctors or pharmacists.  Pharmacists can, therefore, own medical practices and <i>vice versa</i> and pharmacies can be collocated with medical practices.</P>
        <P>However, the issue in this section is prescription being affected by a beneficial interest in the profits of the pharmacy.  Once normal market conditions apply, the landlord puts up his sign, advertises his premises and the highest bidder secures it, whoever that may be.  If it happens to be a pharmacist, that is not an issue.  My attention was drawn to a scenario where in a partnership, one partner could act unethically without the other partner being aware of it.  Clearly, I do not want the other partner, who is innocent, involved in a fitness to practise inquiry and, therefore, I am introducing a provision to ensure that does <Col N="701"/>not arise.  Given all the circumstances, we have struck a fair balance.  We have given the appropriate power to the regulatory bodies, which will eventually be tested in court.  The test is a high legal bar.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and others mentioned private facilities.  General practice is a private enterprise and it is supported by the State through the General Medical Service scheme.  A retail pharmacy is a private enterprise which is heavily supported by the State&rsquo;s procurement of medication on behalf of the public.  I see nothing wrong with professionals engaging in private enterprise, and whether they make a good return for their efforts by way of salary or profit is not an issue, nor is it an issue for the majority of people.  The issue from a patient&rsquo;s perspective is quality of service.  The Bill has struck the right balance and the regulatory bodies have been appropriately empowered to examine ethical issues in the way the pharmacy review group intended and many Members and the public support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for allowing me to raise this matter.  I assume the Minister is not coming into the House to deal with it.  If anything symbolises the failure of this Government, it is the scandal of Kill national school.  After ten <Col N="702"/>years of this incompetent Government and four Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers for Education and Science, no progress has been achieved.</P>
        <P>Kill national school is still situated virtually on a traffic island in the middle of a motorway.  It is grossly overcrowded and there is a waiting list of children who cannot get a school place.  Mr. Tom Cunnane, the excellent principal, is besieged by angry parents and he is taking flak which should be directed at the Minister for Education and Science.  He is left carrying the can for the Government&rsquo;s repeated and long-standing failure to honour its undertakings to the people of Kill.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to Mr. Cunnane and his staff for doing an excellent job for the children of Kill despite the difficulties they face, which the Minister has failed to remove.  I know the Minister was acutely aware of the situation in Kill during the by-election in Kildare North and in case she has been distracted by other matters, I will refresh her memory.  The school was built in 1951 and caters for a population of 4,000.  It consists of the old building and numerous &mdash; at least ten &mdash; prefab classrooms.  It has no PE room, no staff room and very little usable playground.  In 2000, the Minister decided that a new school was to be built in the town.  Since then nothing has been done by the Minister to achieve that objective.</P>
        <P>Through the efforts of the principal, a local landowner and Kildare County Council, an agreement has now been reached on acquiring a site for a new school.  The site will be legally transferred to the Department of Education and Science very shortly.  On 1 March 2006, I raised this matter on the Adjournment and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, responded with a solemn undertaking to build the school ten months after acquiring the site.  She also said she would use the interim to establish the size of the school required and said, in September 2006, that a 32-class new school had been agreed.</P>
        <P>She has again reneged on her undertakings.  Her Department&rsquo;s website is now advertising for the new school and the following is taken from the expressions of interest notice:</P>
        <P LI="1">The project will entail the construction of a new primary school comprising between 24 and 32 classrooms plus associated ancillary accommodation and site works.  The new build accommodation will total somewhere between 3,600 sq. m. and 4,550 sq. m.  The definite scope of the project, i.e. the number of classrooms to be provided, will be decided by the client, namely the Minister, shortly.  Candidates should be aware that this accommodation is required by September 2009.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I was thunderstruck when I read that notice and could not believe that the Minister would mislead the House and the parents and teachers of Kill in such a barefaced manner.  Not only has she not decided on the size of the school, contradicting <Col N="703"/>what she told the D&aacute;il on 1 March 2006, she has now abandoned the ten-month building period and has pushed the project into 2009 or beyond.</P>
        <P>The Minister needs to explain herself to the House.  I call on her to stand by her early undertakings and her promises to Kill school and its people.  She must instruct her officials to act accordingly as nothing less will be acceptable.  Kill wants its school ten months after it gets the site, as she promised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, I will update the House on the proposed new primary school for Scoil Bhride in Kill, County Kildare.</P>
        <P>Last November, the Department announced details of 72 primary schools and eight post-primary schools that were given the go-ahead to proceed with major works such as new school building projects, extensions or refurbishments.  The proposed new primary school in Kill was one of those listed.  The first key step in the project is to appoint an architectural design team which will design and plan the works.  To that end, an advertisement seeking design team consultants for Kill was placed on the public procurement portal on Monday, 26 March 2007, with the closing date for the receipt of expressions of interests being Friday, 27 April.</P>
        <P>After these pre-qualification applications have been assessed by the school building section, further instructions will issue to all of the shortlisted candidates seeking further submissions so that phase two of the appointment process, the award stage, can commence.  I have been advised that the design team should be formally appointed in July.</P>
        <P>Officials from the school planning and building section of the Department have been in regular contact with representatives of the school authority since the November announcement and met with them again recently to discuss their interim accommodation needs.  This consultative approach is working well and the Department is satisfied that the co-operative approach of the school authority will ensure that all eligible pupils have access to a place next September.</P>
        <P>The Deputy makes reference to a D&aacute;il Adjournment Debate of 1 March 2006.  Initially, this project was identified as a possible generic repeat design, GRD, school and it is true that this build method can be delivered in a shorter timeframe than would be the case otherwise.  However, subsequent technical evaluations indicated that such a build type is not possible on this site.  An early construction start date in 2008, with an expected occupation date in 2009, is the new timeline to which the Department and the school authority will be working.  The Department will use whatever construction method is feasible that <Col N="704"/>will allow us to deliver this school on this site in the shortest possible time.</P>
        <P>Regarding the matter of the site acquisition, the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of the Department generally on the acquisition of sites for schools, has identified a suitable site for St. Brigid&rsquo;s national school in Kill.  Agreement on the site acquisition has been reached, subject to contract.  While draft contracts have been exchanged, I am advised that the conveyancing process continues to be delayed pending the outcome of a planning application by the vendor.</P>
        <P>I assure Deputy Stagg that the Department of Education and Science is fully committed to providing suitable facilities for Kill national school at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <sTitle>Turbary Rights.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I will share my time with Deputy Paul McGrath.  This is an extremely important issue which was raised at a meeting we both held with the IFA in Mullingar two or three weeks ago.  It has provoked strong responses from approximately 75 people with turbary rights in the geographical area covered by Carn Park and Crosswood Bogs in south Westmeath near Athlone and Mount Temple.</P>
        <P>The proposal is for special areas of conservation in accordance with the 1997 habitats regulations.  People who make these decisions seem to have very little understanding of their impact on turbary owners in such areas, who require bogland to harvest turf as a source of fuel for domestic use.  While these areas might have been proposed as SAC areas in December 2002, the people impacted on heard and saw nothing more until physical action was taken by officials of the Department on the turf bank.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Surely the Department uses the agreement between the Government and farming organisations, copies of which both Deputy Paul McGrath and I have, on the review of the implementation of the habitats regulations 1997, whereby it should notify affected persons in writing, explaining in clear language the scientific reasons for the designation, and hold follow-up discussions with them.  That is the least to be expected when turbary land, which people are using effectively, is to be confiscated and sterilised.</P>
        <P>Appendix C deals with the compensation for turf-cutting under the agreement and states that, in the case of raised bogs and where it is necessary to prohibit turf cutting in blanket bogs, save in exceptional circumstances, people will be allowed to continue domestic cutting on their plots for up to ten years.  After the ten-year period the Department would review whether there were particular circumstances under which domestic turf cutting could continue on raised bogs without damaging them.  Based upon a simple interpretation of this agreement, Deputy Paul <Col N="705"/>McGrath and I concluded that the 75 turbary owners based in Carn Park and Crosswood Bog should have until 2015 to continue utilising their bog areas for the purpose of harvesting turf for domestic consumption.</P>
        <P>It was the suddenness and the pre-emptory nature of the Minister&rsquo;s action that aroused the ire of the turbary owners in the area.  Why not have some consultation with the groups so severely impacted by these proposals?  Why could these people not be offered alternative areas in close proximity to allow them to harvest their turbary requirements?  Why has the agreement between the Government and the farming organisations, particularly the IFA, which included two meetings with the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, been totally disregarded in this important process?  I ask the Minister to revisit the decision and enter discussions in consultation with the affected people in this geographic area.  It is not too late to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing Deputy Penrose and me to raise this important issue.  As someone brought up in the city, the Minister of State will not fully appreciate the huge impact of taking away turbary rights from people in rural areas.  Many people in rural areas have had turf-cutting rights on bogs for generations and they guard this right very jealously.  Not only does it provide them with a source of fuel over the winter months, but it is also a great form of therapy.  Many people enjoy their long evenings spent in the bog.  I was brought up in a country area and spent many evenings in the bog.  While I did not appreciate it at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;my father ensured we were there and looking back we had some enjoyable times.  However, 75 people in south Westmeath with turbary rights are now being cut off and told they no longer have those rights.  Deputy Penrose and I recently attended an IFA meeting where we witnessed these people&rsquo;s anger.  We met greater anger from the IFA officials present who had negotiated with the Government on behalf of such farmers around the country who would be affected.  They gave us a copy of the document entitled &ldquo;Agreement between the Government and Farming Organisations on Review of Implementation of the Habitats Regulations 1997&rdquo;.  It outlined what was decided in the 2003 Sustaining Progress partnership agreement.  It stated that the designation process should &ldquo;be brought to completion as speedily as possible, while having full regard to the need for consultation with land owners and users, in order to meet legal obligations and to remove uncertainty for land owners and users&rdquo;.</P><Col N="706"/>
        <P>Deputy Penrose quoted from Appendix 3 of the document which, in respect of compensation for turf-cutters, under the heading of &ldquo;Additional incentive payment&rdquo; stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The following applies in the case of Raised Bogs and also applies where it is necessary to prohibit turf cutting in Blanket Bogs.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Save in exceptional circumstances, people will be allowed to continue domestic cutting on their plots for up to 10 years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The IFA official present who negotiated that agreement with the Government was very much of the opinion that this would mean the ten years up to 2015.  Deputy Penrose tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister, who stated these rights would cease next year and they would need to stop cutting then.  We need to resolve this issue.  The people who negotiated the agreement believed they had ten years from that point.  The Government is now interpreting it as a two-year deal, which is not satisfactory.  We need an interpretation on the matter.  I ask the Minister of State to talk to the farmers concerned.  Some compromise needs to be reached.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am answering on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Roche.  Carn Park and Crosswood Bog were designated as special areas of conservation in December 2002.  SACs are the prime wildlife conservation areas in the country.  They are important on both a European and national level, and must be protected for future generations.  Both these bogs comprise raised bog, which is a rare habitat in the EU and is becoming increasingly scarce and under threat in Ireland.  As Ireland has more than 60% of the total EU resource of raised bog, we have a special responsibility for its conservation at an international level.</P>
        <P>Although these bogs have been designated as SACs, turf cutting for domestic use only will be permitted on less sensitive areas of the bogs until the end of 2008, subject to the condition that so-called &ldquo;sausage machines&rdquo; are not used.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State know what they are?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy already made reference to my upbringing and I apologise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister of State was lucky.  He need not apologise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the impact the cessation of turf cutting at the end of 2008 will have on turbary right owners in these and other SAC designated bogs.  In view of that impact the previous Minister agreed in 1999 that domestic turf cutting could be permitted on less sensitive areas of bogs designated as SACs for a period of up to ten years.  This was to allow cutters the opportunity to make alternative arrangements for their <Col N="707"/>domestic heating supplies and as I have indicated it was also subject to the condition that so-called &ldquo;sausage machines&rdquo; could not be used.</P>
        <P>Regard for the impact on local turf cutters was also the reason my Department introduced the cessation of turf cutting scheme.  Under this scheme my Department purchases either freehold title or turbary rights in raised bogs in designated areas.  This approach ensures the survival of the bog and provides a financial resource for those availing of the scheme to purchase an alternative source of energy, including the purchase of non-designated bogs.</P>
        <P>My Department will purchase turbary rights at a cost of &euro;2,975 for the first acre or part thereof and &euro;2,550 for each subsequent acre.  Higher rates are available to those who sell full title.  A generous bonus scheme is also in place in recognition of the impact the cessation of turf cutting may have on those concerned.  I intend to keep this scheme open at least until the expiry of the ten-year derogation period.</P>
        <P>While turf cutting in areas designated as national heritage areas may continue until 2014, SACs such as Carn Park and Crosswood Bog are the prime conservation sites in the country, important at both EU and national level, and it would not be appropriate to allow a further extension of the period for ending turf cutting in these areas.</P>

Although Dingle is not in my constituency a number of individuals from Dingle have been in contact with me in the past two weeks regarding the uncertainty surrounding the signposting of their town, which continues to be a matter of grave concern among the vast majority of Dingle&rsquo;s inhabitants.</P>
        <P>A recent survey carried out by local businesses has shown that 84% of tourists who travelled to Dingle by car over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s holiday weekend experienced difficulty finding the town because of the omission of the name Dingle from signposts.  The survey was conducted in a number of local bed and breakfasts, restaurants, shops and pubs in the town.  Tourists were asked whether their visit was hampered by the omission of the word Dingle from the signposts, which, since the introduction of the place names order by Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, read only &ldquo;An Daingean&rdquo;.  Some 84 out of the 100 tourists surveyed said they had difficulty finding the town travelling by car and 95% said they knew the town only as Dingle not as An Daingean.  Some 94% indicated it would be more beneficial to visitors to the area if the names on the signposts were indicated in English and in Irish.  Some 93% indicated they preferred the name Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is.</P><Col N="708"/>
        <P>One visitor from Iceland said he and his companion wasted a considerable amount of time trying to find the town after a long journey and was very annoyed not to see signs to Dingle.  Mike Ekberg from Iceland stated: &ldquo;Our guidebook helped us to clarify that we were in Dingle.  Without this help we might have been lost.  In Kinsale and Kenmare, our inn keepers referred to this town as Dingle&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The survey came about following mounting frustration in the town owing to confusion being experienced in the town by tourists.  Local bed and breakfasts report that the past winter was the quietest they ever had and fear that casual trade, that is, those travelling by car without a set plan, is bypassing Dingle as the name can no longer be seen on any signpost in Kerry.  Locals point out that bilingual signposts are in place both inside and outside Gaeltacht areas in Cork, Galway, Mayo and Donegal, and they ask why Dingle is the only town to have had its name taped over.</P>
        <P>A total of 93% of local qualified electors in the area voted to return the bilingual names of Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is last October.  It is unfortunate that the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, is not present tonight, given that he is responsible for causing this confusion.  I hope the Minister of State will clarify, once and for all, what is the Government&rsquo;s real intention with regard to restoring Dingle&rsquo;s original names.</P>

	<P>I understand Deputy Deenihan&rsquo;s desire to raise an issue of particular interest to the people of the town and of the Corcha Dhuibhne Gaeltacht.  The Minister&rsquo;s placenames order of December 2004, issued under the Official Languages Act 2003 and covering in excess of 2,300 placenames, had the effect of changing the placename of Dingle to An Daingean.  Under the 2003 Act, there are three contexts only in which the use of the English language version is no longer permissible: Acts of the Oireachtas and statutory instruments; road and street signs erected by or on behalf of a local authority; prescribed maps produced by Ordnance Survey Ireland.</P>
        <P>As recognised by the Official Languages Act 2003, placenames are an important component of local identity.  Placenames orders give legal status to the Irish language placenames of Gaeltacht areas, but do so without preventing the continued use of the English language version by any private citizen.  On 20 October 2006, Kerry County Council conducted a plebiscite under the Local Government Act 1946 to ascertain whether the majority of the qualified electors in the non-municipal town of An Daingean consented to an application being made to the Government for an order changing the name of An Daingean to Dingle Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is.  Of the 1,222 electors, 1,005 gave their consent to Kerry County Council&rsquo;s proposal.  The county council then resolved to apply to the Government to make an <Col N="709"/>order under Statutory Instrument No. 77 of the Local Government Act 1946 to change the name to Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, which the Minister, Deputy Roche, received in November 2006.</P>
        <P>Kerry County Council conducted the plebiscite having previously been informed of the conclusion of the Attorney General, issued on 7 April 2006, that the local government code could not be used to change the name of a place subject to a placenames order, such as An Daingean.  In view of this advice, it is not legally possible to give effect to the plebiscite while An Daingean is subject to a placenames order.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Cu&iacute;v, has sought to resolve local concerns through regular visits and meetings with the local community and its elected representatives at which alternative and complementary approaches were considered.  He has indicated that tourist signs could use the English version of Dingle, provided that they are not erected by a local authority.  However, it is not within his powers under the Official Languages Act to declare a bilingual placename.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, has also recently met interest groups from the town and its hinterland and he is aware of the strength of local feeling on this issue.  Kerry County Council&rsquo;s plebiscite has articulated the views of the townspeople.  However people living in the wider area, who regard An Daingean as the capital of the Chorca Dhuibhne Gaeltacht, have expressed support for continuation of the official placename of An Daingean.</P>
        <P>This placename issue and its legal complexities are the subject of deliberations involving the relevant Ministers, Departments and the Attorney General.  The Government&rsquo;s position will be determined shortly having regard to all the factors involved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue.  Last Monday night I had the pleasure of attending a meeting of the Doolin Tourism Co-Operative Society at the community centre.  The members of that society are extremely angry.  The Minister will be aware that Doolin is not just a tourist attraction of national importance, but is renowned internationally.  It has been featured in <i>Time</i> magazine and is famous for its music, through Micho Russell, and its scenery, atmosphere and the friendliness of its people.  However, it does not have a proper sewerage scheme.</P>
        <P>It would be bad enough if this was the extent of the problem.  Unfortunately, however, every other piece of critical infrastructure gets long-fingered due to the fact that there is no sewerage scheme in place.  Clare County Council is refusing to put in place any critical infrastructure until it is in place.  I do not know if the Minister has ever had the pleasure of visiting the area.  If he has not, <Col N="710"/>I recommend that he do so.  Other Ministers have visited in recent times, including the Minister of State with responsibility for the marine, Deputy Browne, in the course of their electioneering.</P>
        <P>Doolin is situated at the edge of the Burren.  It attracts many walking tourists who spend a night or more in the village.  The village has four hotels, four hostels, 40 bed and breakfast establishments, two campsites or 120 self-catering units.  Visitors use Doolin as a base for visiting the new Cliffs of Moher interpretative centre or the Aran Islands.  Like many rural Irish villages, Doolin has an extended character.  It is a long village with commercial interests dotted from Fisher Street to the Roman Catholic church.  This necessitates much walking between different areas of the village.  However, with record traffic levels in recent years, it is uncomfortable and unsafe to walk through the village.</P>
        <P>Doolin has a limited number of footpaths, little public lighting and the road through the village is narrow.  Anybody who has driven through the village to access the ferry to the Aran Islands will remember how difficult this can be, particularly in the summer season.  There is not enough space for two vehicles to pass.  This makes it extremely uncomfortable for residents and tourists who are on foot.  It is, as was pointed out this week, a health and safety issue apart from anything else.</P>
        <P>This is a problem facing many such villages, not just in Clare but also nationally.  It is a problem for the people of Quilty, further down the coast, who lobbied for many years for a sewerage plant, pointing out that the village was dying because of the lack of this critical infrastructure.  Other villages on the Clare coast include Liscannor, Spanish Point, Carrigaholt and Labasheeda, all of which lack development and sewerage schemes.  It is true that in recent weeks schemes have been approved for Scariff, Feakle and Mullagh.  However, many other towns are affected by the lack of such facilities.  The Minister should heed what happened in Galway.  As a result of the infrastructure not being put in place, the city has a huge water pollution problem due to the sewerage plant at Oughterard.</P>
        <P>One of the best selling points of Doolin is the magnificent quality of the waters on the coast of Clare.  This is what attracts tourists to Doolin.  Approximately 2,500 travel through Doolin every day during the summer months.  That is a huge number for a small village with no critical infrastructure or sewerage scheme.  These tourists look out on the blue Atlantic not realising the problems being experienced by local people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand from Clare County Council that there is a delay with the Doolin scheme, which is coupled with Ballyvaughan and Corofin.  It relates to the council&rsquo;s application for a foreshore licence from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  However, as the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is the overall co-ordinator of <Col N="711"/>this application, I ask the Minister to fast track this process in the interests of tourism and the people of west Clare.  Doolin is the jewel of west Clare and it is wrong that one of the biggest tourist destinations in the county is so under-developed.  This shoddy service is not good enough.  Perhaps the Minister will outline the updated position and whether the foreshore licence issue can be resolved, so the people of Doolin can have a 21st century sewerage and<?oasys _jy ?>wastewater system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Doolin sewerage scheme, which is being advanced as a grouped project with schemes for Ballyvaughan and Corofin, is approved for funding in the Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2005 &mdash; 2007.  The estimated cost of the schemes is &euro;17.5 million, the vast bulk of which the Department will be funding.  Doolin is one of more than 20 schemes being put in place to provide modern water and wastewater services in almost 40 different areas of the county.  The overall value of this package is &euro;196 million and it will make a huge difference to environmental standards and development opportunities all over Clare.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Doolin-Ballyvaughan-Corofin project will provide new wastewater treatment plants for each of the three locations, as well as new and improved sewage collection networks.  The modern wastewater infrastructure being put in place will be able to cater for the current population, as well as having spare capacity to accommodate future needs.  It will play a major role in facilitating development and supporting the tourism sector, which is of paramount importance in these parts of Clare.</P>
        <P>High unit costs have been an issue with a number of sewerage schemes in Clare and have required careful fine-tuning to bring the costs down to a level where they could be justified in economic terms.  This was successfully achieved with the Feakle-Scarriff-Quilty scheme where the <Col N="712"/>Exchequer contribution has been agreed and the council is now in the process of inviting tenders for the collection systems.  It should soon also be able to go to tender for the treatment plants.</P>
        <P>The same issue of affordability has arisen with the Doolin-Ballyvaughan-Corofin project, although the costs in this case are much less severe and will be easier to resolve.  Clare County Council was asked by the Department to review the costings for the three areas and to make any necessary adjustments to the proposals to ensure that the most cost-effective solutions were being put forward for Exchequer funding.  The council&rsquo;s response is being examined in the Department and I expect it to be able to respond later this month.  I am optimistic that the response will be positive.</P>
        <P>I am also aware that the council has applied to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for foreshore licences for the Doolin and Ballyvaughan schemes where the discharges will be into the sea.  The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has consulted my Department&rsquo;s national parks and wildlife section, NPWS, because of the possible impact of the sea outfalls on special areas of conservation, SAC.  As part of this process, the council intends meeting NPWS shortly to discuss how best the SAC dimension can be dealt with and I hope these discussions will pave the way for early approval of the foreshore licences.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that the funding has been allocated for these schemes and it is now a matter of getting them through the planning and procurement stages as quickly as possible.  I will do everything I can to be of assistance in that regard.  Once the foreshore licences are in place, the council will be able to prepare contract documents and then move on to tender stage.  I understand Deputy Pat Breen&rsquo;s desire to see the works starting as quickly as possible and I look forward to and hope we can expect early progress in that direction.</P>

	<P>I am firmly committed to ensuring that judicial resources are adequate to the demands placed on them.  Since 2002, the number of judges sitting in the High, Circuit and District Courts has increased from 108 to 125, an increase of 17 judicial posts.  In addition, the Courts and Court Officers (Amendment) Act 2007 provides for a further 14 judges &mdash; 6 Judges of the District Court, 4 ordinary Judges of the Circuit Court and 4 ordinary Judges of the High Court.  The additional judges are being appointed to deal with delays and generally speed up the judicial process.  </P>
        <P>In accordance with section 16(2) of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, I have requested the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to furnish me with nominations for these new posts.  When these new judges are appointed shortly, it will mean that the number of additional judges sitting in Court since 2002 is 31.  I should add that additional staff for the Courts Service have been sanctioned to ensure optimum use of the new judges.</P><Col N="714"/>
        <P>In 2002, in the Central Criminal Court &mdash; where the most serious cases are heard &mdash; the waiting time between return for trial and trial was 18 months.  By comparison, as of 31 December 2006, the waiting time for the hearing of cases was six months.  These improvements can be attributed to the decision of the President of the High Court to assign four judges to the Central Criminal Court on an ongoing basis and to the very active management of the court list.</P>
        <P>The strict application by the Court of its own &lsquo;ground rules&rsquo; with regard to adjournments and the continuing good case management and careful scheduling of cases have all contributed to the significant reduction in waiting times and the optimum efficient use of the judicial and other resources allocated to the Court.  All cases currently before the Central Criminal Court have dates fixed earlier than the end of June 2007.  I am informed that 2006 is the sixth year in a row when the number of completed cases exceeded the number of new cases returned for trial to the Central Criminal Court.</P>
        <P>The situation in the Circuit and District Courts varies according to location.  While some venues are in a position to schedule cases for the next sittings, others are experiencing delays due to a variety of factors.  The Presidents of each of these courts have, at their disposal, unassigned judges who can be used, <i>inter alia</i>, to assist permanently assigned judges where pressure of work demands.  I believe that the additional judges to be provided to the Circuit and District Courts will greatly assist in reducing delays in those courts and I will continue to keep the situation under review.</P>

	<P>The total number of applications received for Asylum from 1992 to 28 February 2007 is 73,245.</P>
        <P>In regard to Leave to Remain, I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to applications for Leave to Remain in the State made pursuant to Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended.</P>
        <P>An application for Leave to Remain in the State in these circumstances arises where a non-national is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3 (3) (a) of the Immigration Act, 1999.  A person served with such a notice of intent to deport is afforded three options, viz. to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of a Deportation Order; or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why a Deportation Order should not be made and why temporary Leave to Remain in the State be granted instead.</P>
        <P>Leave to remain, outside that granted on the grounds of parentage of an Irish born child or marriage to an Irish or EU national, is considered in the context of deciding whether or not to deport a non-national.</P>
        <P>In determining whether to make a deportation order or grant temporary leave to remain in the State, I must have regard to the eleven factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 (Prohibition of <Col N="716"/>Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.</P>
        <P>Temporary leave to remain is considered in every case regardless of whether representations are made by, or on behalf of, the persons concerned.  Statistics are not maintained in a way which distinguishes between those who have made an application for leave to remain and those who have not.  Moreover, it must be borne in mind that many of those who failed the asylum process, and who did not opt to return voluntarily or consent to deportation, nonetheless left the State before a decision to deport or grant leave to remain was made.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 25. </P>
        <P>Section 62 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 was enacted for the purpose of specifically prohibiting a person who is or was a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or of its civilian staff, from disclosing information obtained in the course of his or her duties.  The section provides stiff penalties, fines up to &euro;75,000 and/or up to 7 years imprisonment for conviction on indictment, for persons who contravene its provisions and receive any gift, consideration or advantage as an inducement to disclose any information.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that this provision in its original draft form attracted a considerable degree of public controversy during its passage through the Oireachtas on the grounds that it would be unnecessarily restrictive.  However I am satisfied that the provision as enacted struck the right balance and I know that the great majority of members of the force would instinctively cohere with its fundamental policy aspect.</P>
        <P>The section came into force on 1 August 2005 and to date there have been no proceedings commenced.  In addition to section 62 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, former Garda&iacute; are also governed by the provisions of the Official Secrets Act and the Data Protection Act.</P><Col N="717"/>
        <P>At an operational level, I understand from the Garda Authorities that members&rsquo; log-on accounts for the Garda Information System (PULSE/GNIB/FCPS) are disabled upon their retirement.  This ensures that they cannot access any of the Garda IT systems.</P>
        <P>As an organisation the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes its responsibility for the control of the information it possesses about individuals very seriously.  Where allegations of unauthorised disclosure are made the Commissioner will not hesitate to take the appropriate action.</P>

	<P>In May of last year I launched the new Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy &amp; Strategy &mdash; Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons.  This new policy clearly set out the steps required to tackle the supply of drugs into prisons, provide adequate treatment services to those who are addicted to drugs and ensure that developments in the prisons were linked into the community.  Since then significant progress has been achieved in implementing this plan. </P>
        <P>In line with my policy the Irish Prison Service has intensified its focus on preventing illicit drugs being brought into prisons.  The traditional means of effecting supply reduction &mdash; staff vigilance, physical searches and supervision of persons entering prisons &mdash; continues to be reinforced by means of improved facilities and procedures.  Specific measures which have been taken include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />New prison visiting arrangements which involve greater control over the number and identity of visitors, and enhanced supervision of such visits.  As a result only identified and known persons are allowed to have visits with prisoners, reducing the likelihood of visitors attempting to pass drugs, and of prisoners being coerced into receiving visits from persons not known to them to facilitate the passing of drugs.</P>

This has resulted in arrest, prosecution and imprisonment of persons attempting to convey drugs into prisons.</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Improved technology for searching of cells and prison property which has resulted in <Col N="718"/>the improved detection and seizure of contraband.</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A tender for 24 Addiction Counsellors to cover all Prisons has been awarded to Merchants Quay Ireland and Counsellors are already coming on stream.

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the concern expressed by the author of new research into the operation of Family Law Courts (details supplied) that the high number of lay litigants in contested family law cases should give rise to the cost of legal representation for those who need it; if he will take steps to deal with this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I understand that the Deputy is referring to an article in the inaugural edition of the Courts Service Report &lsquo;Family Law Matters&rsquo; published in February 2007.  The article, based on an interview with the manager of the Dublin Circuit Family Law Office, speculated that there has been a huge rise in lay litigants in family law cases over the past few years due perhaps to the costs of legal representation.</P>
        <P>There is a number of factors which may lead people to undertake their own litigation, particularly where the divorce is uncontested.  Greater access to information, including free information provided by the Courts Service, allows litigants to make informed decisions as to whether or not to seek further legal advice or representation.  With consent divorces representing a significant proportion of all divorces, many of the potentially contentious issues will already have been settled in advance of divorce proceedings, often by prior judicial separation or following mediation.</P>
        <P>It would be a matter of concern if lay litigants were acting on their own behalf, not because they have freely chosen to do so having regard to all their circumstances, but because they were financially precluded from seeking legal assistance.  But it is important to differentiate between the situation of lay litigants making a free and informed choice to save money by representing themselves in straightforward and uncontested proceedings, and the spectre the Deputy raises of vulnerable people being unable to obtain vital legal advice and assistance.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the Legal Aid Scheme provides effective access to legal advice and representation to persons on lower incomes. The Civil Legal Aid Regulations, which I made in 2006, both simplified the means test rules for qualifying for legal aid and substantially increased the disposable income limits &mdash; from &euro;13,000 to &euro;18,000 &mdash; and the deductible allowances, including for dependents, childcare and accommodation. Given the significant increase in the Legal Aid Scheme thresholds, enabling more <Col N="720"/>people to qualify for assistance, and given also that many divorces are uncontested and settled by consent, I do not believe that the increase in the number of lay litigants is in itself a cause for concern.</P>

        <QRef>[12913/07]</QRef>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>On 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000.  The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is reached. </P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner is proceeding with the recruitment and training of 1,500 members of the Garda reserve.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are intakes to the Garda College every 4-6 weeks.  The total personnel strength of the Garda Reserve including trainees was 123 at 29th March 2007.</P>
        <P>The first group of 36 Garda Reserves completed their training and were formally attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 15th December 2006.  They have been deployed in Dublin (Store Street and Pearse Street), Cork (Anglesea Street), Galway City and Sligo.</P>
        <P>The second group commenced training in the Garda College at Templemore on 20th January 2007.  This group consists of 52 Garda Reserve trainees who will be deployed in Blanchardstown, Santry, Dun Laoghaire, Tallaght, Limerick, Clare, Sligo, Galway and Kerry.  It is expected that they will be attested in May.</P>
        <P>Training for the third group of 35 Reserve trainees commenced on 3rd March 2007 and it is expected that they will be attested in June.  It is also expected that further groups of Reserve trainees will commence training on a monthly basis.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the next intake will be on 28th April 2007.  Further interviews were held in recent weeks for applicants throughout the country and interviews have now taken place in each of the 26 counties.  Applicants will continue to be interviewed on a rolling basis over the coming weeks and months.  By June of this year three groups of trainees will have been attested, i.e. 123 Reserve members.</P>
        <P>With regard to civilianisation, I am informed that there is currently a campaign underway to recruit 300 civilian support staff into An Garda <Col N="721"/>S&iacute;och&aacute;na to release Garda&iacute; who are employed on clerical duties to operational duties.  This process is well underway and interviews are currently being held by the Public Appointments Service to recruit these Clerical Officers.  Since the beginning of 2007, 93 Clerical Officers have been appointed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A further 46 have been offered a Clerical Officer post.  Preparations are at an advanced stage to commence the recruitment of a civilian Chief Administration Officer in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at a grade equivalent to Deputy Commissioner.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also in the process of recruiting senior civilian managers as Head of Media and Public Relations, Directors of Strategy, Human Resources and Information Technology.  A dedicated Human Resource Directorate has been established within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to serve the needs of the 2000 clerical, administrative, professional, technical and industrial civilian staff already working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to promote an extensive programme of civilianisation.</P>
        <P>Significant progress is being made on recruitment to a range of key specialised civilian posts, including:</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />31 posts in the Garda Telecommunications area;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />28 staff for the Professional Standards Unit, comprising statisticians, analysts and administrative staff;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />10 posts in the new Internal Audit Unit;</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />14 additional teaching/training posts in the Garda College in Templemore; and</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />29 posts for the new civilian Crime Analysis Service.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">The foregoing is in addition to the establishment of the Garda Informations Services Centre which employs over 160 civilians doing work which was previously done by operational Gardai.  The success of the incident reporting and data quality review facilities available at the GISC encouraged the Garda authorities to seek opportunities for the devolution of further tasks to the Centre.  One such initiative involves the reporting of the outcome of court cases to the GISC, which allows Garda&iacute; to remain operational following completion of their court attendances.  The call-taking function of Garda Traffic Watch has already transferred from six Regional Garda Communication Centres to the GISC.  Under a further initiative, the logging of driving licence and insurance particulars, a function formerly carried out by Garda&iacute; and civilian personnel in the Fixed Charge Processing System, is now undertaken at the GISC.  All of these initiatives are contributing significantly to the release of Garda resources for visible, frontline policing across our communities.  It is proposed to carry out a review of the GISC in the summer of 2007 and the outcome of this evaluation will inform future projects.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 54 and 83 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the incident referred to by the Deputies is under investigation under the direction of a Superintendent and when it is completed an investigation file will be submitted to the Law Officers.  As the investigation is still ongoing, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on it at this time.</P>
        <P>I am also informed that it is not the policy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for official spokespersons to comment on the character of an individual.

        <P>I will make a Commencement Order shortly to enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to commence taking complaints and undertaking investigations from 9 May 2007.  From that date the Ombudsman Commission will be required to investigate any complaint concerning the death of, or serious harm to, a person as a result of Garda operations or while in the custody and care of An  Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Under section 102(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may in the public interest request the Ombudsman Commission to investigate any matter where it appears that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may have committed an offence or behaved in a way that would justify disciplinary proceedings.  In addition, under section 102(4) the Ombudsman Commission may in the public interest decide to investigate any such matter, even where no complaint has been made.</P>
        <P>It may be that on its own initiative the Ombudsman Commission may on its establishment decide to investigate this matter or, if needs <Col N="724"/>be, I will consider using my own powers to refer the matter to them.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that an intoxyliser evidential breath testing instrument is installed and operational in Harcourt Terrace Garda station since 21 December, 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Disability Strategy was launched by the Government in September 2004 and underpins the participation of people with disabilities in Irish society by building on existing policy and legislation.  The implementation of the Strategy is the agreed focus of disability policy under the Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016.  My Department is responsible for the provision of the framework for the implementation of the Strategy including cross-Departmental coordination and reports to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion on progress of the Strategy.  The Minister of State at my Department, Frank Fahey, T.D., has acted with special responsibility for disability issues.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that key elements of the Strategy include the Disability Act, 2005 and Sectoral Plans for service provision for people with disabilities. The Disability Act is the cornerstone of the National Disability Strategy and my Department played a lead role in its development and enactment.  All sections of the Disability Act have been commenced, with the exception of Part 2  (Assessment of Needs, Service Statements and Redress).  Arrangements in relation to the implementation of Part 2 are set out in the sectoral plan of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>Under the Act, six Government Departments were required to draw up plans in key sectors including transport, built infrastructure, housing, training and employment, health and social welfare provision.  My Department acted as co-ordinator for the purpose of the Sectoral plans and presented the Plans to the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval; they were published by the Government in December, 2006.  Each of the relevant Departments has provided its own targets and costings for the implementation of the Sectoral Plans.</P>
        <P>All public bodies, subject to certain considerations, must meet a number of requirements with regard to accessibility under the Act.  These accessibility provisions are now supported by the new Code of Practice on Accessibility of Public Services and Information Provided by Public <Col N="725"/>Bodies which I signed into law and launched in July, 2006.  The Code of Practice was developed by the National Disability Authority (NDA) in consultation with my Department.  The Act also gives statutory effect to the 3% employment target for people with disabilities in the public sector.  My Department has a key role in relation to the implementation of these provisions while progress achieved by public bodies in this regard is being monitored by the NDA.  Again, under the Act, a Centre for Excellence in Universal Design has recently been established within the NDA with the support of my Department. The Centre has an important role in contributing to the development and promotion of standards in universal design.  A budgetary provision of &euro;450,000 has been allocated for the Centre for 2007.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of Towards 2016, I established the National Disability Strategy Stakeholder Monitoring Group at the end of last year to monitor progress on the overall implementation of the National Disability Strategy.  The Group comprises representatives of stakeholder groups, senior officials and the NDA while my Department also serves as secretariat to the Group.</P>
        <P>The National Disability Authority is concerned with the implementation of important aspects of the Strategy and works closely with my Department to meet relevant objectives.  The funding provision for the NDA for 2007 is &euro;6.3 million.</P>
        <P>The roll-out of the Strategy has been accompanied by a significant increase in the level of investment to expand the range of services and supports available to persons with disabilities.  In particular, the Government is committed to a five-year, multi-annual Investment Programme to run until 2009 worth &euro;900 million, targeted at high priority disability support services.</P>
        <P>In addition to ensuring the delivery of the key objectives of the National Disability Strategy, my Department has a role in several important functions that are complementary to the Strategy.  My Department had a lead role in relation to the negotiation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which was adopted by a UN General Assembly in December 2006.  Ireland was in the first group of countries to sign the Convention last week.  My Department also has a lead role in relation to the ratification process.</P>
        <P>My Department also funds certain accessible transport services for people with disabilities, promoted an independent living support programme and provides financial support to People with Disabilities in Ireland (PwDI).  The total funding allocation for these initiatives amounts to &euro;3.2 million in 2007.  My Department also continues to fund the Enhancing Disabilities Services Programme which I launched in 2005.  The Programme comprises a funding package of &euro;15 million over a five year period to support once-off projects which could demonstrate an innovative, efficient, collaborative and cost effective <Col N="726"/>approach to service provision for people with disabilities.  The funding allocation for this Programme for 2007 is &euro;3 million.</P>
        <P>In 2006, my Department undertook a number of awareness raising initiatives including funding two TV programmes and a National Information Day.  The funding allocation to continue such initiatives in 2007 is &euro;434,000.</P>
        <P>The Excellence through Accessibility Award was initiated to acknowledge public bodies that provide accessible services to people with disabilities.  The NDA, in consultation with my Department, issued guidelines and the first awards ceremony took place in September, 2006 at which four public bodies were presented with awards.</P>

	<P>I have been advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the Criminal Assets Bureau has sufficient financial and other resources available to it to operate effectively pursuant to its statutory remit.  The Bureau also continues to cooperate with law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions in order to fully achieve its objectives pursuant to its statutory remit.  The Bureau keeps the allocation of personnel under constant review in light of its workload and a Forensic Analyst and a Professional Accountant have recently been recruited.  The matter of resources is kept under constant review.</P>
        <P>With regard to the matter of using criminally acquired assets to fund otherwise legitimate businesses, any individuals in local communities who believe they can openly flaunt wealth or assets secured through illegal activities, including drug dealing, will by vigorously pursued by the Garda&iacute; either through the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 or through the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau under its statutory remit.  In addition to this, since 2004, an initiative has been in place whereby one member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from each Garda Division is trained as a profiler in respect of criminal assets.  This Initiative was developed by the Criminal Assets Bureau in conjunction with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  A Divisional Criminal Assets Profiler is now in place in each <Col N="727"/>of the 25 Garda Divisions and a full complement of Divisional Profilers is being maintained.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau has been at the forefront of the fight against organised crime, including drug trafficking, in this jurisdiction since its inception in 1996.  The significant successes that the Bureau continues to achieve by its operations demonstrates the effectiveness of its approach in pursuing illegally gotten gains.  The manner in which the Bureau operates has, in the eleven-year period of its operation, come to be viewed, both domestically and internationally, as a very successful model for targeting persons seeking to derive profits from criminal activities.</P>

        <P>I refer the Deputies to my answer to Question No. 60 of today&rsquo;s date.</P>
        <P>Following the submission to me in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, I decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 consequently <Col N="728"/>makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, I am pleased to note that the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics for the third and fourth quarters of 2006.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.  I have requested the CSO to provide the information sought by the Deputies directly to them.</P>

        <P FLI="0">As I set out in my answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s previous Questions there is no distinction in Immigration legislation between privately and publicly owned ports nor between airports and seaports.   Apart from the general application of the criminal law and its enforcement by an Garda Sioch&aacute;na and such general legal provisions applicable to an airport in the same way as to any other location, my role as regards the operation of such ports is in relation to immigration matters only. I have no function as regards the general operation of an airport, including its licensing or the approval of traffic volumes or air safety. Such matters are appropriate to the Department of Transport and the Irish Aviation Authority. There is also a central role for local authorities in respect of planning.</P>
        <P>Applications for approved port status in respect of private or publicly owned airports are considered in the context of overall Government policy in the airport sector and generally will fall to be considered once these policy aspects in regard to any particular area have been determined.</P>

        <Quest> the steps he has taken, other than producing more legislation amending his earlier legislation, in anticipation of the expected impact in summer 2007 from the 49% increase in poppy production in Afghanistan in Spring 2006. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12977/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As is reflected in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, recent international data from the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC) suggests that the level of heroin production, particularly in Afghanistan, has significantly increased in recent times. The UNODC also highlight that there is a significant surplus of heroin supply exceeding worldwide demand for the drug.  That Office continues to spearhead international efforts aimed at addressing what are, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, complex issues which give rise to the continued high levels of opium production in that region. Undoubtedly such production has a direct effect on the amount of heroin in circulation globally. </P><Col N="730"/>
        <P>So this problem is by no means unique to Ireland as drug misuse remains one of the most complex social ills faced worldwide . However we are responsible for what happens in our own jurisdiction and we must constantly strive to ensure that the measures and policies we have in place address the problem and are flexible enough to be able to respond to what is a global and dynamic issue.</P>
        <P>As I have said on the record on many occasions previously, while our drug law enforcement response is of course a vital feature of our overall response in addressing the issue we cannot just look at the issue from a supply reduction perspective only.  Rather, we must examine the drugs problem in the wider context in which it takes place and take cognisance of the fact that the demand for and the use of illegal drugs is what fuels the drugs trade. The measures that we have in place to address the problem must take account of this.</P>
        <P>The Government remains resolutely committed to tackling the problem through our National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008.  The National Strategy addresses the problem under pillar headings of education and prevention, supply reduction, treatment and rehabilitation and research and is firmly founded on the principle that drug misuse needs to be addressed in an integrated manner across these headings through a co-operative approach involving the statutory, community and voluntary treatment sectors.</P>
        <P>The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under the stewardship of my colleague and Minister of State Mr. Noel Ahern, T.D., is the lead Government Department in co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy.  My Department&rsquo;s remit in this area, while not exclusively, is primarily in the area of drug supply reduction, and drug law enforcement remains a key feature of the Government&rsquo;s drug policy framework.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that An Garda Sioch&aacute;na will continue to direct its drug law enforcement activities in a focused way  through intelligence driven operations at national, regional, divisional and district level co-ordinated by the Garda National Drugs Unit in conjunction with other specialist Garda units and local Garda management.  Underpinning this approach, An Garda Sioch&aacute;na will continue to invoke a number of broad strategic responses in addressing the issue. These include the following;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Identifying, targeting and dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks which supply and distribute illegal drugs within this state</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Conducting intelligence driven operations focusing on all aspects of the illicit drugs trade including commodity, logistics, distribution and financing.</P><Col N="731"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Working with other national and international law enforcement agencies on joint actions designed to reduce the availability of drugs and the proceeds derived from the drugs trade</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs within society.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">Significant drug seizures including the considerable increase in the amount of heroin continuing to be seized in recent times in this jurisdiction have been made as a result of this approach. Such measures will continue to be vigorously pursued by An Garda Sioch&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The record level of resources, both in financial and personnel terms, being made available to An Garda Sioch&aacute;na this year is proof of the Government&rsquo;s commitment and determination to ensure that the Garda authorities will continue to implement targeted, intelligence and high intensity operations against organised crime with a special focus on drugs crime.</P>
        <P>Furthermore we are ensuring that our law enforcement agencies have a strong legislative platform from which to operate in their work in tackling those involved in such criminal activity.</P>
        <P>Finally, I can assure the House that the policy of targeting those involved in organised crime including drug trafficking and the gun culture with which it is associated remains the Government&rsquo;s top policing priority.</P>

	<P>A 120 acre site at Corrstown was one of a number of sites selected for a detailed examination and rejected by the Mountjoy Complex Replacement Site Committee which consisted of officials of the IPS, the Dept of Justice Equality and Law Reform, one of the Commissioners for Public Works and an outside valuer.  The examination by consulting engineers led to its being rejected as being unsuitable for the development of a major prison complex.  The road access was  not acceptable for a prison <Col N="733"/>development, the shape of the site was not compatible with the intended campus layout and the land was undulating and would require considerable excavation to allow for necessary development.</P>
        <P>The purchase of a site that was not fit for purpose would not have represented value for the taxpayer&rsquo;s money regardless of the price paid.</P>
        <P>The spending approval measures applied in the case of the Thornton site have been scrutinised in detail, fully comply with Government guidelines and delivered an excellent site which will provide good long term value for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>No land that was suitable for a prison and which was nearer to Dublin was identified by the committee as available for purchase at a lesser price and no such land has, to the knowledge of the Department or the IPS changed hands at less than &euro;200,000 per acre since the purchase of Thornton.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Community policing is a central feature of the policing policy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Community Policing Units are established throughout the country, and members are encouraged to engage with the local communities where they are working.  Current policing policy is predicated on the prevention of public order offences; the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property; and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a quality policing service. In addition to the dedicated Community Policing Units, all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility to respond to community policing issues as they arise.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the number of personnel engaged in dedicated community policing on 29 March, 2007 was 521 (all ranks).</P>
        <P>The Garda Siochana Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee in each local authority administrative area, to provide a forum where a local authority and the senior Garda officers responsible for the policing of that area, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area.  Twenty two joint policing committees are being established by local authorities and the Garda Commissioner in a pilot phase, and I intend that following a time-limited and focused evaluation they will be estab<Col N="734"/>lished in all local authority areas by the end of 2007.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rely on the ongoing and active support of public to enable them to be at their most effective in their functions.  The joint policing committees have a central role in achieving this by mobilising the resources of the local authority, the community and individual residents.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na support and foster a number of crime prevention measures which have direct value for residents of local communities.  The Neighbourhood Watch Scheme which was established in 1985 by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a crime prevention measure for urban areas.  There are approximately 2,600 Neighbourhood Watch schemes in operation throughout the country.  Since its establishment, the Garda authorities have sought to encourage the active participation of the public in Neighbourhood Watch by encouraging and supporting communities to establish and maintain such initiatives.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been a strategic partner in driving and supporting Neighbourhood Watch through its Community Relations Section and local Garda management and has deployed Crime Prevention Officers and Liaison Gardai to assist schemes.  A strategic review of the Scheme by An Garda S&iacute;ochana is currently nearing completion.</P>
        <P>The Community Alert programme is a community based crime prevention initiative in rural communities which was set up by Muintir na T&iacute;re in association with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 1985.  It is a national movement with a network comprising of approximately 1,250 local Community Alert groups dedicated to improving the quality of life of people in rural communities who are vulnerable, in particular the elderly, by crime prevention, neighbourliness and self reliance, general community safety and well-being, accident prevention, promotion of personal safety, with an awareness of social inclusion.  My Department has for some time funded the work of Development Officers working to expand and strengthen Community Alert.</P>
        <P>I am strongly of the view that community organisations have, through their support and co-operation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na an important role to play in crime prevention and the promotion of community safety, and I very much support the work in  this area being carried out by Muintir na T&iacute;re through Community Alert.</P>
        <P>I recently determined priorities for the Garda Siochana for 2007 under section 20 of the Garda Siochana Act 2005.  These priorities include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />an increase in public confidence in law enforcement through significantly increased high visibility policing in the community;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />monitoring and improving response times to emergency calls while ensuring that per<Col N="735"/>sons reporting any crime are dealt with sympathetically and efficiently;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />using the civilianisation process and the outsourcing of appropriate services to increase the number of Gardai on operational duties; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />taking effective steps to protect vulnerable people living in isolated areas.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,178 following the attestation of 273 new members on 14 March, 2007.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258.  Furthermore, on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000.  The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met.  The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and its highest level ever.</P>
        <P>The Garda Reserve will supplement the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in policing local communities and will be a valuable additional support for them.  It will enhance its capacity to respond to emerging policing challenges and will reinforce its links with local communities.</P>

This legislation prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination in the areas of employment and access to goods and services on nine grounds; gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or membership of the Traveller community.</P>
        <P>Amendments to both these Acts were made in the Equality Act 2004 which gives effect in domestic law to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations as a member of the European Union to implement Community initiatives provided for under Council Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC, adopted under Article 13 of the EC Treaty, and Council Directive 2002/73/EC adopted under Article 141 of the treaty. These Directives, commonly known as the Equality Directives, provide for equal treatment on the grounds of gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation. There is, therefore, a broad legislative infrastructure in place under which discrimination can be dealt with.</P>
        <P>There are also in place effective institutional structures, in the shape of the Equality Authority and the Equality Tribunal, to ensure effective implementation of the statutes. At a general level within society, it is the role of the Equality Authority to promote the awareness of the overall equality framework, of which anti-racism measures are a constituent part.  The Authority  works at many levels and with many bodies towards the elimination of racial discrimination within society.  Furthermore, the Equality Tribunal is the main body for investigating  and mediating on cases of discrimination and harassment.</P>
        <P>Developing reasonable and common sense measures to accommodate cultural diversity in society and to combat racism are key ongoing priorities for the Government. Among the measures taken by the Government was the very successful &ldquo;Know Racism&rdquo; campaign which brought together representatives of Government, the Social Partners, Community, Voluntary and Farming sectors and key bodies such as the Equality Authority and the NCCRI and the Garda S&iacute;ochana to raise awareness of racism and promote respect for diversity. This work continues, for example, in campaigns like the Anti-Racism Workplace Week which runs every November and is organised by the Equality Authority.</P>
        <P>Arising from commitments given by the Government at the 2001 UN Conference Against Racism in Durban and reaffirmed in Sustaining Progress, the Taoiseach and I launched the National Action Plan Against Racism (NPAR) in January, 2005. The Plan provides strategic direction to combat racism and to develop a more inclusive, intercultural society in Ireland. The development of the Plan was preceded by a 12 month consultation process involving a wide <Col N="737"/>range of stakeholders, including Government, the social partners, NGO&rsquo;s including representatives of minority ethnic groups and the travelling community. There are five primary objectives underpinning the NPAR:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Effective protection and redress against racism, including a focus on discrimination, threatening behaviour and incitement to hatred</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Economic inclusion and equality of opportunity, Including focus on employment, the workplace and poverty</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Accommodating diversity in service provision, including a focus on common outcomes, education, health, social services and childcare, accommodation and the administration of justice</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Recognition and awareness of diversity, including a focus on awareness raising, the media and the arts, sport and tourism</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Full participation in Irish society, including a focus on the political level, the policy level and the community level.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">In relation to specific measures taken under the NPAR, I would refer the Deputy to my replies to  Question No. 79 of 7 December, 2006 and  Question No. 34 of 22 February, 2007.</P>
        <P>The NPAR has received international recognition drawing praise from the United Nations Committee for the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (UNCERD) in its Concluding Observations on Ireland&rsquo;s national report on the implementation of the UNCERD.</P>
        <P>The National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism (NCCRI) was established in July 1998. The NCCRI is an independent body and is funded by my Department.  The Committee provides a forum for Government departments, agencies and non-governmental organisations to develop a constructive dialogue on issues which arise in relation to opposing discrimination in our society.  Its overall aim is to provide an ongoing structure to develop programmes and actions aimed at developing an integrated approach to anti-discrimination issues, particularly racism and to act in a policy advisory role to the Government. The NCCRI works proactively with Government in this area and has been a key partner in the development of the National Action Plan against Racism.</P>
        <P>The Director of the NCCRI and Chief Executive of the Equality Authority are both members of the Strategic Monitoring Group for the NPAR.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the policies and strategies in place are effective and take into account the considerable economic, social and cultural change that we have undergone and will continue to experience in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is generally acknowledged that the reasons behind the gender pay gap are  varied and complex.  Consequently the Government has adopted a multifaceted approach across a number of areas in order to address the closure of the pay gap.</P>
        <P>The Consultative Group on Male / Female Wage Differentials, set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, was chaired by my Department and reported to Government in November 2003 on actions required to address the gender pay gap. Their research found that increased labour market participation by women was an important step in reducing the pay gap.   The report contained a number of recommendations addressing a wide range of Government policies including:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />taxation</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />statutory minimum wages</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />education and training and</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the development of family friendly policies.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">We have acted on these recommendations and the indications are that Ireland has made considerable progress in relation to the gender pay gap with a significant narrowing of the gap in recent years.  Recently published Eurostat figures indicate the Irish gender pay gap to be 9%, which is well below the EU average of 15%. It compares <Col N="739"/>well with many other countries including Germany (22%), the United Kingdom (20%) and Sweden (16%).  While Eurostat note that the statistical survey from which the figures are extracted &mdash;Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) &mdash;  are provisional and subject to further quality assessment, it is informative to note that the Irish gender pay gap has, according to Eurostat, fallen from 22% since 1999.</P>
        <P>The recent reductions in the gap are attributable to a number of factors including;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the introduction and regular revision of the National Minimum Wage</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the implementation of legislative provisions</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the introduction of the Equal Opportunities Child-care Programme</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />part-individualisation of the taxation system</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />increases in child benefit payments and</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the continued strength of the Irish economy and the underlying strong demand for labour.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">My  Department has provided funding of over &euro;25m, under the Equality for Women Measure (EWM) in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, to more than 100 organisations for the delivery of positive action projects for women in their communities, in work, in decision making areas, in education and in training.  The projects have included proposals aimed at addressing the glass ceiling (the barrier to career advancement) and horizontal segregation in the labour force.</P>
        <P>To build on the work already done, funding of over &euro;126 million is being provided under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 for measures to improve gender equality.  The aim is to continue to address the need for measures to improve equality between men and women and to tackle educational and social barriers to women entering and progressing within the workforce with particular focus on disadvantaged women.</P>
        <P>This multifaceted response which the Government is taking in addressing the gender pay gap will be developed further in the National Women&rsquo;s Strategy which I expect to publish very shortly. The Strategy&rsquo;s development was overseen by an Inter-Departmental Committee of Senior Officials, under the chairmanship of my Department and was the subject of a consultation process with the social partners. One of the Strategy&rsquo;s main objectives will be to reduce the gender pay gap.</P>
        <P>With regard to research on this subject, I can inform the Deputy that other than the Consultative Group on Male/Female Wage Differentials, my Department has commissioned the ESRI to undertake a number of pieces of research on the <Col N="740"/>gender pay gap.  The first study in 1994 quantified for the first time the size of the gap across the whole economy. A further ESRI study in 2001, entitled &lsquo;How Unequal&rsquo;, focussed on quantifying the gender pay gap at national level in Ireland and identified how it relates to patterns of labour market participation. The latest ESRI research, entitled &ldquo;Degrees of Equality : Gender Pay Differentials among Recent Graduates&rdquo;, published in 2005, examined the gender pay gap among male and female graduates who had left third level education in 2001.  The study suggested a need to focus on the processes of early career integration and career choices.</P>
        <P>In an international context, my Department represents Ireland on a number of EU committees relating to gender matters which play an important role in researching the causes of the gender pay gap and in advising on measures to reduce it.  In this regard, my Department led an EU project in 2001 &ndash; 2002 along with Northern Ireland, Sweden and Finland. Ireland&rsquo;s research, conducted by Indecon International Economic Consultants, described in detail the extent of the gender pay gap and gender segregation in the IT, Electrical and Electronic, Retail, Food, and Local Government sectors of the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will realise, the work of the Government and my Department in this complex matter has produced considerable success and I expect that with a continued focus on addressing the component causes of the gender pay gap we will continue to reduce it in the coming years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Prison Service Psychology Service is currently at its highest ever level of staffing, with 16 posts filled. This represents nearly a 100% increase in the number of psychologists working in the IPS since 2002.  A significant factor in this increase has been the broadening of the recruitment base of the service, to allow for the recruitment of counselling and forensic psychologists, as well as clinical psychologists, to the IPS.</P>
        <P>Historically however, the Irish Prison Service has encountered great difficulty in filling psy<Col N="742"/>chology posts in certain geographical areas.  One of these is the midlands area.  Neither the recruitment competition undertaken by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) in June 2006, nor the subsequent competition, undertaken by the Prison Service in September 2006, seeking to recruit a psychologist to work on a contract basis, were successful in filling a post in the midlands area.</P>
        <P>Given this situation, the Prison Service has had to consider alternative means of enhancing psychology service provision to the Midlands Prison.  With this in mind, a Clinical Psychologist, who has recently taken up a post in Limerick Prison, will be providing an outreach service to the Midlands Prison commencing later this month. This will support the psychologist currently operating in the prison.</P>
        <P>The experience of Midlands Prison is indicative of the tight labour market for psychologists in which the Prison Service continues to operate. In the market for psychologists the Prison Service is in competition with other public bodies when trying to attract recruits. Prison presents a very challenging environment to work in and understandably many psychologists prefer to work in less stressful settings. In light of the failure of both general and contract recruitment efforts for services to this particular prison the Director General of the Irish Prison Service is now considering alternative approaches for improving service levels there.</P>

	<P>A 120 acre site at Corrstown was one of a number of sites selected for a detailed examination and rejected by the Mountjoy Complex Replacement Site Committee which consisted of officials of the IPS, the Dept of Justice Equality and Law Reform, one of the Commissioners for Public Works and an outside valuer.   The examination by consulting engineers led to its being rejected as being unsuitable for the development of a major prison complex.  The road access was  not acceptable for a prison development, the shape of the site was not compatible with the intended campus layout and the land was undulating and would require consider<Col N="743"/>able excavation to allow for necessary development.</P>
        <P>The Committee concluded  the purchase of a site, that was not fit for purpose, would not have represented value for the taxpayer&rsquo;s money regardless of the price paid.  The Thornton site in contrast is an excellent site which provides good value for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>No land that was suitable for a prison and which was nearer to Dublin was identified by the committee as available for purchase at a lesser price and no such land has, to the knowledge of the Department or the IPS changed hands at less than &euro;200,000 per acre since the purchase of Thornton.</P>

        <P>The dossier has been carefully considered by officials in my Department. As part of that consideration it was forwarded to the Garda authorities for examination and report.  The Garda authorities have now completed their examination and submitted a report to my Department.</P>
        <P>I have considered this matter in the light of the report and the recent verdict of an inquest jury. As a consequence, I have asked Mr Patrick Gageby SC to conduct a review of the Garda files in this case, and he has agreed to do so.</P>
        <P>Discussions are currently taking place between officials of my Department and Mr Gageby and the legal representatives of the person referred to on the terms of reference of the review. I expect to finalise the terms shortly and the review to get underway soon thereafter. I will be requesting a report as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,178 following the attestation of 273 new members on Wednesday 14 <Col N="745"/>March, 2007. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258. Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that a total of 3,440 recruits have been attested to the Force since  6 June, 2002.  2,031 members (all ranks) have resigned, retired or otherwise left An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since 6 June 2002.</P>

	<P>The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment have previously set out the Government&rsquo;s position in this matter in reply to previous Parliamentary Questions.  The Government believes that it is not appropriate at this time for Ireland to become party to this UN Convention.</P>
        <P>The Convention is a broad instrument covering many different fields and would require a significant commitment across Government Departments to implement legislation which would reflect the Convention&rsquo;s nuances on legal and illegal workers. The Convention covers such areas as authorisation to stay and to work, education, training and integration, family reunification, social security, transfer of income and taxation, housing, health and medical care and electoral matters.</P>
        <P>My own Department is concerned that a significant portion of this UN Convention does not distinguish between legal and illegal, or documented and undocumented migrants.  In effect the Convention obliges countries to provide entitlements to workers about whom they have no information and who have entered a state illegally.  I would have grave concerns as to the effect of this provision on encouraging illegal immigration into this State, in spite of the perceived safeguard in Article 68.  I would suggest to the Deputy that it is highly significant that no EU Member State has yet signed or ratified the Convention.  Its provisions for combating illegal immigration, which effectively amount to only one article, are largely untested.</P>
        <P>My Department is also mindful of the common travel arrangements with the UK and Ireland&rsquo;s position within the EU.    In respect of the Common Travel Area, we would have serious concerns about entering into a largely untested international migration treaty which could have possible negative effects on illegal immigration flows between the two jurisdictions.   Similarly we could not conceivably enter into a migration treaty to which none of our EU partners are party.   Such an action may prejudice our position on participation in future EU migration policy initiatives, in particular those which may deal with illegal immigration.</P><Col N="747"/>
        <P>The rights of legal migrant workers and their families are already comprehensively protected by existing legislation, the Constitution and existing international treaties to which the State is already party.  I am not aware of any significant human rights deficit affecting migrant workers in Ireland which requires remedy by ratification of this UN Convention.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that Garda policing arrangements at Shannon Airport in 2006 cost approximately &euro;3.85 million, a figure which includes normal salaries.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is statutorily required to provide policing services for the State with the aim of preserving public order and protecting life and property.  In this regard, Garda resources are allocated by the Commissioner, according to, inter alia, assessed threat, so it is the latter which ultimately determines the associated costs.  In this context, the continuance of the ongoing policing arrangements at Shannon Airport are considered essential for the integrity of the airport itself and of both its employees and clients.  In the circumstances, I do not accept the premise of the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  Accordingly, I remain satisfied that Garda policing arrangements at Shannon Airport continue to be both necessary and appropriate.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate Review of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Practices and Procedures for Barricade Incidents.  The review makes a significant contribution towards the enhancement of the capacity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to manage barricade incidents. In particular, it affords an opportunity to learn from the experience of the shooting at Abbeylara so that such deaths can, to the extent humanly possible, be avoided in the future.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has also welcomed the report, and has already established an implementation group, headed by an Assistant Commissioner, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
        <P>The report acknowledges that considerable progress has been made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the Abbeylara incident in 2000. Indeed, significant developments are currently under way on key issues in the report. In relation to digital radio, for example, implementation of the new digital radio service has already commenced and the preferred bidder is now installing the service in a large area in North Dublin to demonstrate the performance of the system. Over 2,500 protective vests, providing ballistic and anti-stab protection, have been issued to Garda&iacute; in recent months. Distribution is continuing and every Garda will have this protection by the middle of this year. On tactical firearms training, 250 acres of land have been purchased near the Garda College at Templemore for this and other training purposes. A firing range will also be built as part of the new Forensic Science Laboratory at Garda Headquarters.</P>
        <P>In the past week I secured Department of Finance sanction for the Commissioner to advertise for state-of-the-art modular live firing ranges that can be delivered within months.  I understand that the Commissioner is drawing up urgent plans for a firing range at the major site recently acquired near Templemore for the new Garda centre of excellence.</P>
        <P>The Garda Inspectorate recommended that a second tier response capability should be established for rapid deployment to critical incidents in regional areas pending the arrival and full deployment of the ERU.  In this respect the Commissioner had already moved to form Regional Primary Response Teams for this purpose in each of the regions outside Dublin.  These teams will be drawn from the existing Regional Public <Col N="749"/>Order Units and the Garda&iacute; involved will receive additional relevant training to fulfil this role.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations on less lethal weapons, I have authorised the Commissioner to add Conductive Electric Devices (sometimes referred to as the brand name &lsquo;TASER&rsquo;) to the less lethal weapons already available to the ERU for use where necessary to avoid the use of firearms.  I have also authorised the availability to the new Regional Primary Response Teams of the three less lethal weapons already available, that is bean bag shot, pepper spray and pepper spray shot.</P>
        <P>The Inspectorate recommended that pepper spray should be made available to all Garda&iacute; on operational duty and the Garda Commissioner is currently assessing the operational case for such availability.</P>
        <P>These and other developments will substantially develop the capacity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respond to barricade incidents, but clearly the questions raised by the Abbeylara incident require the comprehensive implementation of all of the recommendations of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate. The Garda Commissioner has committed himself to this, and implementation is under way.</P>

	<P>The new Digital Radio Service for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently being implemented. This is a nationwide system that will be used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and by the other emergency services.  It will enable instant and secure communications not only between Garda members but also with the emergency services, and where necessary with the PSNI.  It will also provide Garda&iacute; with a key safety feature &ndash; the ability to summon assistance at the push of a button and identify the location of that person.</P>
        <P>Following the completion of the Garda pilot which confirmed that a specific technology being tested &mdash; Tetra &mdash; was suitable for the Force, the Garda Authorities prepared a detailed business case with various procurement options for nationwide deployment of a digital radio system for the Force.  In consultation with the Department of Finance it was decided to both broaden the scope of the project to include the other emergency services and also to procure the service by way of an outsourced service provision model.  I believe the approach adopted of using the outsourced service provision model is the best approach in ensuring value for money for the project as it has the effect of spreading the cost across the various Government organisations. Once these decisions were taken, specifications of requirements covering all emergency services were drawn up including specification of the functionality required, detailed coverage required including in-building <Col N="751"/>and outdoor coverage, vehicular and sea and air support coverage.  A tender competition in accordance with EU procurement law was then carried out and a preferred bidder &mdash; Tetra Ireland &mdash; has been selected.</P>
        <P>I am on record as saying that the process has taken  much longer than I would have liked.  However, I think the Deputy will agree that a service providing Garda&iacute; and other emergency services with critical support, sometimes in life or death situations, is important to get right.  The process of implementation is now underway and while the exact timeframe for rollout will be subject to contract negotiations and successful completion of an initial phase of the project, it will be completed within a 2 year timeframe.  Indications from the preferred bidder are that rollout will be achieved in a shorter timeframe and as the rollout progresses and radio coverage is available, Garda Divisions will migrate onto the new service.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to Court awards and out of court settlements in actions taken against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of assault, unlawful arrest or other breaches of citizens&rsquo; rights is set out in the following table in this answer.</P>
        <P>As of 31st December, 2003, there were approximately 750 civil actions taken against <Col N="752"/>members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on hand.  A detailed breakdown of these actions in the form of the number of allegations of assault, unlawful arrest and other breaches of citizens&rsquo; rights is not readily available.  However, a database introduced in 2002 for the purposes of recording civil actions taken against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, indicates that in 2003 &mdash; the first complete year for which a detailed breakdown is available &mdash; of the 142 actions initiated or received in that year by my Department, there were 34 cases of alleged assault recorded and 38 cases of alleged unlawful arrest recorded.  The remaining 70 cases recorded included allegations of defamation and harassment.  In 2004, 127 actions were initiated/received.  They included 40 cases of alleged assault and 26 cases of alleged unlawful arrest.  In 2005, 109 actions were initiated/received.  They include 46 cases of alleged assault and 18 cases of alleged unlawful arrest. In 2006, 139 actions were initiated/received. They included 46 cases of alleged assault and 24 cases of alleged unlawful arrest.  In 2007 to date, 38 actions have been initiated/received which includes 11 cases of alleged assault and 6 cases of unlawful arrest.</P>
        <P>Civil actions may be taken by the general public against the State for compensation for alleged wrongs and personal injuries inflicted on them by Garda members in the performance of their duties. Since the introduction of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 the plaintiff no longer needs to name the individual garda in question.  The highest percentage of these types of civil actions against An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in relation to assault and unlawful arrest.  The majority of these cases have been settled for less than &euro;25,500.  Settlement of cases takes place on the advice of the Chief State Solicitor, the Attorney General and State Counsel.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner has informed me that incidents which result in claims against the State in respect of the actions of Garda&iacute; are examined as appropriate with a view to identifying and implementing operational strategies to eliminate or reduce similar claims in the future.  The Garda Commissioner has also informed me that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Discipline) Regulations 1989 are invoked in appropriate cases where the actions of individual Garda members come into question.</P><Col N="751"/>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy &amp; Strategy &mdash; Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons &mdash; will see existing drug treatment programmes, including the provision of methadone maintenance programmes where this is clinically indicated, being expanded and enhanced.  This expansion will involve the allocation of a range of dedicated staff, including addiction counsellors, to support these various programmes.  In 2007 it is envisaged that an extra &euro;2,000,000 will be allocated to support these developments.</P>
        <P>Those who have begun to tackle addiction prior to imprisonment will continue to receive support during their time in prison. For those who enter prison with addiction problems, the time spent in prison is an opportunity to deal decisively with both their addiction and offending behaviour. For a number of years it has been Irish Prison Service Healthcare policy, in consultation and liaison with community treatment agencies, that people entering prison on a recognised methadone maintenance programme, should continue on such treatment while remaining in prison, as long as this remains a clinically indi<Col N="756"/>cated course.  As outlined above the policy currently being rolled out envisages further development in the range of therapeutic avenues available to prisoners to address their substance misuse. Specific developments include:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A tender for 24 Addiction Counsellors to cover all Prisons has been awarded to Merchants Quay Ireland and Counsellors are already coming on stream. This will, in conjunction with other developments, lead to an increase of nearly 1000 hours per week of prisoner access to addiction counselling.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />7 Nurse Officers and 5 Prison Officers have been allocated to Dedicated Drug Treatment Teams in prisons with significant needs; this will improve service quality in prisons which receive a large number of prisoner committals with addictions.</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Dormant Accounts Fund has provided funding for 4 community groups to provide addiction counselling and support to prisoners while in prison and on release in the community, this will build on their success in becoming drug free in prison when the prisoner returns to the community.</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Additional Consultant in Addiction and Registrars Prisons Sessions have been established and resourced, significantly improving the quality, coordination and availability of drug treatment in prisons.</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A Consultant led Infectious Disease Service has been contracted from St James&rsquo; Hospital to provide treatments to prisoners who suffer from these disease. It is hoped to expand this service to other sites, and a</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Tender for Dedicated Drug Treatment Pharmacy Services will issue this month, again supporting improved quality and availability of treatment services.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The policy envisages a multifaceted approach towards tackling the problems associated with substance misuse in the prison environment. There is particular focus on the need to assist prisoners who indicate a serious desire to tackle their drug problem and the policy states that appropriate treatment for substance misuse related problems should be available regardless of where a prisoner is located.</P>
        <P>I have obtained significant extra resources to facilitate this and the policy is in the process of being rolled out on a phased basis.  While it is intended that any treatment which is clinically indicated as being appropriate and necessary should be available to prisoners this provision will require the coordinated input and co-operation of various agencies, both internal and external.  In particular it will require the co-operation of relevant community agencies to ensure the continuity of such treatment on release.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Community Policing is a central feature of current policing policy and members of Community policing units are encouraged to engage with the local communities where they are assigned. Current policing policy is predicated on the prevention of public order offences; the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a quality policing service.  All Garda&iacute; have a responsibility, inter alia, to be involved in Community Policing issues as they arise.   I am informed by the Garda authorities that the total strength (all ranks) of dedicated Community Garda&iacute; as at  29 March 2007 was 521, i.e. 4% of the overall strength of the Force. The total personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as at 29 March 2007 was 13,172.  This represents a percentage of 3.95% of the total strength of the Force.</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that it is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.  Garda Personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that all incidents of crime involving firearms are subject to a rigorous investigation.  The identification of all evidence available is a key element of the investigation and prosecution process.  I am assured that all resources necessary, including national specialist units, are deployed in the investigation process.</P>
        <P>When such an investigation is completed an investigation file is prepared for consideration by the Law Officers who direct what charges, if any, are to be preferred against those suspected of being involved in the commission of the crime.  Every effort is made to ensure that all suspected offenders are prosecuted but prosecutions can only be taken where the evidence sustains the taking of a prosecution.</P>
        <P>All killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. While the term &ldquo;gangland murders&rdquo; tends to be widely used in the media in referring to the nature of certain unlawful killings and speculation in this respect is understandable, it does not reflect the manner in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na classifies crime or particular offences.  Caution is necessary in ascribing particular motives to any particular incident as, potentially, this might jeopardise the procedures which need to be followed for the proper investigation and prosecution of offences.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil is central to the strategy of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating serious crime and in particular murder.  The Operation, which commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in May, 2005 and was subsequently extended nationwide at my request, has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high-profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.  Notable improvements have been achieved in the recorded number of incidents of crime being targeted by the Operation.  In particular, I am pleased to note the increase of 34% in detections of possession of firearms in the fourth quarter of 2006 which I believe has contributed to the reduction of 3.4% in discharges of firearms.  I believe that Operation Anvil has also contributed to the increase in that quarter of detections of offences of possession of drugs for sale or supply, which is closely associated with many murders using firearms.</P>
        <P>Under the Operation, 74 arrests have been made in connection with murder and 914 in con<Col N="759"/>nection with serious assaults. There have been 643 firearms seized or recovered and 26,497 searches for drugs.</P>
        <P>The personnel strength of the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation has been augmented to address the problem of organised criminal activity.  Enforcement by the Unit has resulted in arrests, seizure of firearms and substantial quantities of drugs and the disruption of criminal activities.</P>
        <P>On 19 December last, the Government agreed my proposals for an unprecedented package of measures which includes:</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A further increase of 1,000 in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to bring the total to 15,000 over the next three years;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A proportionate increase in the targeted strength of the Garda Reserve from 900 to 1500;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Sanction for 300 additional civilian administrative support posts for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The recruitment of the seven senior civilian posts recommended by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and Senator Maurice Hayes;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An increase in the retirement age for Garda&iacute;, Sergeants and Inspectors from 57 to 60;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Increased staffing for the Forensic Science Laboratory, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Courts Service;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />No limit on funds available for the Witness Protection Programme.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">As a result of the Criminal Justice Bill 2007 which is currently before the Oireachtas the law enforcement agencies will be in a much better position to ensure that those involved in gun crime will be made accountable for their actions.</P>
        <P>I would also like to inform the Deputy that I regularly meet the Garda Commissioner regarding all policing matters in order to keep the measures and resources for tackling crime under continued review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Very significant progress has been made since November 2006 with regard to the implementation of the recom<Col N="760"/>mendations contained in the report referred to by the Deputy.  I can confirm that an additional Deputy Commissioner was appointed in charge of Strategy and Change Management on the 17th January 2007 and preparations are at an advanced stage to commence the recruitment of a civilian Chief Administration Officer in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at a grade equivalent to Deputy Commissioner.  The positions of Assistant Commissioner &mdash; Professional Standards Unit and Assistant Commissioner &mdash; Strategy will be filled in the near future once the interview process has been completed.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also in the process of recruiting senior civilian managers as Head of Media and Public Relations and Directors of Change Management, Human Resources and Information Technology.  A model of succession planning for senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also being developed as recommended.</P>
        <P>A dedicated Human Resource Directorate has been established within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to serve the needs of the 2,000 clerical, administrative, professional, technical and industrial staff already working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to promote an extensive programme of civilianisation.</P>
        <P>In addition to these measures, significant progress is being made on recruitment to a range of key specialised civilian posts.  Candidates have been short-listed for interview for 31 new civilian posts in the Garda Telecommunications area and candidates have been invited to interview for the three senior posts for the new civilian Crime Analysis Service, which will have a complement of 29 Analysts.</P>
        <P>There is currently a campaign underway to recruit 300 civilian support staff into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to release Gardai who are employed on clerical administrative duties to operational duties.  This process is well underway and interviews are currently being held by the Public Appointments Service to recruit these Clerical Officers.  Since the beginning of 2007, 93 Clerical Officers have been appointed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A further 46 have been offered a Clerical Officer post.</P>
        <P>On foot of the recommendations contained in this report a new organisational structure has been designed for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a transition process to enable the implementation of the new organisational structure has commenced.</P>
        <P>The report also recommends a proposed new senior management structure of three Deputy Commissioners (one of whom would be a civilian).  Another report produced by the Advisory Group on Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Management recommended the creation of a Board of Management chaired by the Commissioner with three Deputy Commissioners (one of whom would also be a civilian). I have addressed these recommendations in the drafting of the Criminal Justice Bill 2007, which is currently before the House. <Col N="761"/>Section 38 of the Bill inserts a new Chapter 3A into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to provide for the establishment and functions of a such a Board, i.e, a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Executive Management Board.  The Board will consist of executive members and three non-executive members.  The executive members will be the Garda Commissioner as chairperson, the Deputy Garda Commissioners and a member of the civilian staff of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at a grade equivalent to that of a Deputy Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The three non-executive members will be appointed by the Government on the nomination of the Minister.  They will be persons with expertise in the strategic and financial management of organisations, the management of their human resources or their planning and review functions, or persons with other relevant experience.  The non-executive members will serve in an advisory capacity, providing advice in relation to annual policing plans, budgetary matters, allocation of resources, technology and equipment, setting of targets, training, development and leadership and other related matters.</P>
        <P>The function of the Board will be to keep under review the performance by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its functions and the arrangements and strategies in place to support and enhance the performance of those functions.  The Board will also keep under review the corporate governance arrangements and structures within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the arrangements for recruitment, training and development and the mechanisms for the measurement of performance and accountability.</P>
        <P>The Board will supply reports on the performance of its functions at six-monthly intervals to the Minister and they will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>The retention of and access to telecommunications traffic and location data are governed by the provisions of Part 7 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005.  It is not the practice and it would be contrary to the public interest to dis<Col N="762"/>close the details of data access requests, including their number or the types of offences to which they relate.</P>
        <P>I do not accept &mdash; and, in fact, categorically reject &mdash; any suggestion that the provisions of the 2005 Act are being improperly used or that innocent persons have reason to fear for their privacy by virtue of the operation of that Act.</P>
        <P>It is important to bear in mind that requests by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for access to call data &mdash; and I emphasise that this does not involve access to the content of telephone calls &mdash; are made in the context of investigations into criminal activity.  In this regard, Part 7 of the 2005 Act provides that data access requests to telecommunications service providers may only be made for the purposes of:</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of crime; or</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the safeguarding of the security of the State.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na makes such requests only where these conditions apply.  Furthermore, these requests are filtered by senior Garda officers before the telecommunications service providers are requested to disclose the data; not all requests by investigating Garda&iacute; result in requests to the telecommunications service providers.  It should also be noted that Garda investigations into murders, gun-related crime, so-called &rsquo;tiger&rsquo; kidnappings and drug-related crime tend to generate large volumes of requests, as do investigations into nuisance, obscene or threatening telephone calls.</P>
        <P>Finally, Part 7 of the 2005 Act introduced for the first time robust accountability arrangements and counter-balancing safeguards to protect personal data.  These arrangements include a statutory complaints procedure overseen by a Judge of the Circuit Court, as well as a statutory oversight procedure overseen by a Judge of the High Court.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 119 together.</P><Col N="763"/>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner is proceeding with the recruitment and training of 1,500 members of the Garda Reserve.  The first group of 36 Garda Reserve members completed their training and were formally attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 15th December 2006.  They have been deployed in Dublin (Store Street and Pearse Street), Cork (Anglesea Street), Galway City and Sligo.</P>
        <P>The second group commenced training in the Garda College at Templemore on 20th January 2007.  This group consists of 52 trainees who will be deployed in Blanchardstown, Santry, Dun Laoghaire, Tallaght, Limerick, Clare, Sligo, Galway and Kerry.  It is expected that they will be attested in May.</P>
        <P>Training for the third group of 35 trainees commenced on 3rd March 2007 and it is expected that they will be attested in June.  It is also expected that further groups of Reserve trainees will commence training on a monthly basis.  By June of this year there will be three groups of trainees who will have been attested, consisting of up to 123 members.</P>
        <P>Further interviews were held in recent weeks for applicants throughout the country and interviews have now taken place in each of the 26 counties.  Further interviews will take place over the coming weeks and months.</P>
        <P>As the nature of the Reserve is that participation is purely voluntary, I cannot definitively say what any particular future monthly intake of volunteers will be, or exactly when the overall target of 1,500 members will be met.  Garda Reserve trainees have work, family and other commitments which they will have to balance with their service with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is offering maximum flexibility in this regard to accommodate those who wish to put themselves forward for service.</P>
        <P>While I am satisfied with the progress being made in the recruitment and training of Reserve members, I consider that the process of initial recruitment can be made more effective with a local dimension.  In that context, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to involve local Garda Superintendents directly in local recruitment arrangements to attract suitable candidates from the local community.  This will assist in ensuring that the 1,500 target is reached as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner has recently appointed a Chief Superintendent to oversee the Garda Reserve on a full-time basis.  A Superintendent has also been appointed to this area.  I will of course, in conjunction with the Commissioner, keep all procedures relating to the Garda Reserve under review to ensure that target figure of 1,500 is reached as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been advised by the Garda Authorities that to date, a total of 15 complaints have been received at Kells Garda Station in relation to the operation of a People in Profit System (PIPS).  The Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation is assisting in the investigation of these complaints.  Gardai have made enquiries with the Malaysian Authorities and are awaiting a response.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has received in excess of 25 complaints from members of the public relating to fraudulent withdrawals from their bank accounts, offences which are committed using a technique known as &ldquo;phishing&rdquo;, a term used to describe the theft or attempted theft of personal information using e-mail and bogus web sites.  It is a relatively recent phenomenon.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is working with the Banking Industry to counteract this phenomenon.  All the Banks offering on-line banking services have posted warning notices on their websites to the effect that this activity is occurring and that members of the public should not respond to any request relating to their personal banking security details.</P>
        <P>A High-Tech Crime forum has been established with all relevant stakeholders including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Financial Services Industry and the Banking Sector.  This Forum facilitates the rapid dissemination of information related to &ldquo;phishing&rdquo; and other methods being used to compromise banking services.  Victims of &ldquo;phishing&rdquo; are advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the industry to report any such activity immediately to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  Every assistance to recover monies is given by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to injured parties and their representatives.</P>
        <P>Garda investigations to date have resulted in a number of persons being prosecuted for theft offences related to &ldquo;phishing&rdquo; incidents in which the proceeds of fraudulent withdrawals have been transferred to an apparently legitimate account which has been used to facilitate the withdrawal of the stolen funds.  A number of other similar investigations are ongoing.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, has participated in a number of initiatives by various Government Departments and the Financial Institutions which have as their primary aim the raising of public awareness of this type of criminality.  These include:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A website entitled &lsquo;Safecard&rsquo;, which was launched in partnership with the Irish Pay<Col N="765"/>ment Services Organisation.  This website addresses many issues around payment card fraud, in particular the issue of identity theft.  The Garda website (www.garda.ie) also provides advice to members of the public on how to avoid this type of criminal activity.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The &lsquo;MakeITSecure&rsquo; Programme, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources which, inter alia, produced advice booklets including one on identity theft, for the public and which have been distributed to every Garda Station.</P>

	<P>The Government is fully aware of and views with concern the increased prevalence of cocaine usage in recent times in Ireland as is identified in the recent joint report by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and the National Drugs Strategy Team.</P>
        <P>Efforts to tackle the problem are broadly based under the Government&rsquo;s National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 and include measures aimed at both supply and demand reduction, including awareness initiatives.</P>
        <P>This Department&rsquo;s remit under the Strategy, although not exclusively, is primarily in relation to drug supply reduction.</P>
        <P>This increasing use of cocaine is, of course, a matter of concern and the Garda authorities have taken a number of measures to address the problem on the supply reduction side.</P>
        <P>The Garda National Drugs Unit and local drugs units conduct intelligence-driven operations to target individuals suspected of involvement in the distribution of cocaine.</P>
        <P>Drug units and community policing personnel are engaged in intelligence gathering on individuals and groups suspected of involvement in the sale and distribution of the drug. There is also targeted patrolling by uniform and plain-clothes personnel of problem areas in order to detect and disrupt persons involved in such activity.</P>
        <P>Garda strategies for dealing with drug offences are designed to undermine the activities of organised criminal networks involved in the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs.</P>
        <P>These strategies include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />gathering intelligence on individuals and organisations involved in the distribution of <Col N="766"/>drugs (including the support structures underpinning this activity);</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />conducting targeted operations on criminal networks based on intelligence gathered;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />working in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies both within and outside the jurisdiction to address the national as well as international aspects of drug trafficking and distribution.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">National units, such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation all have specific roles in reducing drug supply and seizing the ill-gotten gains of drug traffickers. All of these units operate under the direction of the Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services.</P>
        <P>These strategies continue to result in operational successes as evidenced by the ongoing high levels of drugs being seized by the Gardai. The trafficking and distribution of all illicit drugs, including cocaine, at local, national and international levels is constantly monitored by the Garda&iacute;.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 70 together.</P>
        <P>I cannot comment on individual cases. However, the following are my general remarks on sentencing.</P>
        <P>The question of consistency in sentencing and the appropriateness of sentences in particular cases is undoubtedly an issue which raises concerns from time to time.   The Courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  As the Deputies will be aware the traditional approach to sentencing is for the Oireachtas to lay down the maximum penalty appropriate to a particular offence and for the courts having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum. This approach reflects the doctrine of the separation of powers. The Executive lays down the possible punishment range but it is for the Courts to decide the punishment to be applied to the <Col N="767"/>offender taking account of the seriousness of the crime and all the circumstances of the case and of the offender.  There is a small number of situations, however, where statute has intervened to create exceptions to this approach. To add to those exceptions I have provided in the Criminal Justice Bill 2007 for mandatory minimum sentences of at least three quarters of the maximum sentence permissible under the law where a person who has been convicted of a &ldquo;scheduled offence&rdquo; (a list of specified offences typically associated with organised crime) re-offends within 7 years of release from prison. In order for this provision to apply the conviction for the first offence must have been on indictment and must have attracted a sentence of at least 5 years imprisonment. Where the second offence carries a potential maximum of life imprisonment, a sentence of at least 10 years must be imposed.</P>
        <P>During my Second Stage speech on the Criminal Justice Bill, I made my views on sentencing clear to the House.  My preference lies in the development of an effective sentencing jurisprudence from the courts themselves and I reiterate my strong view that collectively and individually the independence of the judiciary is an important value which is enhanced rather than damaged by collective measures taken by the judiciary to ensure consistency, rationality and coherence in sentencing.</P>
        <P>As regards consistency in sentencing, the Deputy should be aware that section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 makes provision for meetings of District Court Judges to discuss, inter alia, the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court and the general level of fines and penalties. While there is no similar statutory provision in the case of other Courts, it is understood they hold similar meetings.</P>
        <P>For my part, the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995 enables me, as Minister, to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the judiciary.  In this regard, funds are made available to the Judicial Studies Institute, which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training.  I understand that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the Institute in the context of its training programme.</P>
        <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission in 1996 in a Report which specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines. Their Report pointed out a number of differences of opinion among members of the Commission in relation to some of the recommendations in the Report which tends to underline the obvious complexities which arise in relation to sentencing policy.</P>
        <P>I should also mention that under the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, the Director of Public Prosecutions may, where it appears to him that a sen<Col N="768"/>tence imposed on indictment is unduly lenient, apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review the sentence. The issue of extending the power to the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal against lenient sentences in serious cases before the District Court was referred by the Attorney General to the Law Reform Commission for consideration. The Law Reform Commission report of November 2006 recommends that it is not appropriate to confer such a power at this time but noted that this is a matter which should be kept under review.</P>
        <P>A very significant step in the area of sentencing was the decision by the Board of the Courts Service to establish a Steering Committee to plan for and provide a sentencing information system.  The Committee, which is composed of four members of the Judiciary and an academic expert, reviewed systems of this nature around the world and decided to establish a pilot project in the Circuit Court in Dublin.   I understand that two researchers have begun to collect and collate information on sentencing outcomes in cases on indictment in designated courts in accordance with criteria specified by the Committee.</P>
        <P>The objectives of the project are to:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />identify criteria and other information employed by the judiciary in sentencing for particular offence types in criminal proceedings,</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />record and retrieve such information in individual cases,</P>
   <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />design and develop a database to store the information retrieved and enable its retrieval in accordance with various search criteria,</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />share or disseminate the information, utilising information and communications technology, via a judges&rsquo; intranet or other means, and</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />assemble appropriate material on sentencing for a benchbook and website.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0" Just="Left">The work of the committee is still under way and I look forward to seeing the outcome of the research.  It is right that we have a systemic form of information as a reference point for Judges.</P>

        <Quest> the situation with arrivals from Bulgaria and Romania, including the number of people who have arrived from each country; if data is being collected on the purpose and dispersal of these new arrivals; and the procedures in place to integrate these new arrivals and the services that are available to them. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to arrivals since 1 January 2007 when Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union.  In terms of immigration procedures and controls, all European Union citizens coming to Ireland, including Bulgarian and Romanian nationals, are covered by the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No.2) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 656 of 2006).  Those Regulations transposed into Irish law the European Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.</P><Col N="770"/>
        <P>In summary, the Regulations mean that visa requirements will no longer apply to Bulgarian and Romanian nationals and they will be able to enter the State on production of their passport and/or national identity card and they may reside here for up to 3 months without conditions.  That is the situation which applies to all EU citizens.  After 3 months, any EU citizen in the State must be either;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />in lawful employment or</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />self-employed; or</P>
  <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />enrolled on a course of study or vocational training and have comprehensive sickness insurance; or,</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be self-sufficient and have comprehensive sickness insurance.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">The only restriction on Bulgarian and Romanian nationals, in contrast with other EU citizens, is that in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s decision of 24 October 2006 they continue to require employment permits in order to participate in the Irish labour market unless they were already granted the right to work here for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer and availed of that right, or are otherwise exempt.</P>
        <P>The Regulations do not provide for the registration of EU citizens with the immigration authorities i.e. the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service or the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  Consequently, data are not available on the number of Bulgarian and Romanian nationals, or other EU citizens, arriving in the State.</P>
        <P>In terms of integration and services, it should be noted that Bulgarian and Romanian nationals are present in the State on the same basis as other EU citizens, apart from the labour market restriction.  EU citizens to whom the Free Movement Regulations apply can carry on in a self-employed capacity, any business, trade or profession,  have access to training and education in the State and are generally entitled to receive the same medical care and services on a like basis with Irish citizens.</P>

	<P>As in all countries, integration policy is constantly being developed and updated in line with changing demographics and the emerging challenges of multicultural societies.  Building on the integration frameworks set out in the National Action Plan against Racism, integration policy is now being further developed to ensure that these challenges are fully met.</P>
        <P>The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of which the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is a part, has intensified its policy development process and is involved in a range of ongoing strategic studies geared to informing policy development in this area.</P>
        <P>These initiatives are being reinforced by a series of stakeholder dialogues taking place throughout this year.  The first of these took place last February  with a major conference on integration policy in Dublin Castle attended by a wide variety of Irish stakeholders and international experts.</P>
        <P>In March of this year, the Government approved the establishment of a cross-Departmental group chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach to assist the INIS in carrying out a review of existing integration policy and to provide an initial assessment of future policy options.  The group has already had its inaugural meeting  and it is expected that an initial report will be submitted to Government within the next two months.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of cars in the Garda fleet at present is 1,631.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Garda Fleet Management Section to develop policies which will ensure that vehicles are maintained in a proper roadworthy condition.  The policy for maintenance of the fleet is, where feasible, to use main dealers for a particular make.  This will ensure, as far as is possible, that the maintenance of the vehicle complies with standards set by the manufacturers.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that the standard of servicing, cost and value for money are kept under constant review.  A request for tenders for the maintenance of the Garda fleet is currently in the final stages of preparation and it is expected that tenders will be invited in the next couple of months.</P>
        <P>The Garda Fleet is currently undergoing a major investment programme and an expansion in specific areas which will target organised crime, public order and traffic in particular.  The total spend for 2006 on the purchase of 1,378 new vehicles to upgrade the fleet was &euro;27.45 million resulting in the renewal of over half of the entire Garda fleet in just a single year. Further investment is planned for this year including the purchase of cars and additional motorbikes which will make a significant contribution to traffic law enforcement.</P>

	<P>Very significant progress has been made since November 2006 with regard to the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report referred to by the Deputy.  I can confirm that an additional Deputy Commissioner was appointed in charge of Strategy and Change Management on the 17th January 2007 and preparations are at an advanced stage to commence the recruitment of a civilian Chief Administration Officer in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at a grade equivalent to Deputy Commissioner.</P>

        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also in the process of recruiting senior civilian managers as Head of Media and Public Relations and Directors of Change Management, Human Resources and Information Technology.  A model of succession planning for senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also being developed as recommended.</P>
        <P>A dedicated Human Resource Directorate has been established within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to serve the needs of the 2,000 clerical, administrative, professional, technical and industrial staff already working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to promote an extensive programme of civilianisation.</P>
        <P>In addition to these measures, significant progress is being made on recruitment to a range of key specialised civilian posts.  Candidates have been short-listed for interview for 31 new civilian posts in the Garda Telecommunications area and <Col N="775"/>candidates have been invited to interview for the three senior posts for the new civilian Crime Analysis Service, which will have a complement of 29 Analysts.</P>
        <P>There is currently a campaign under way to recruit 300 civilian support staff into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to release garda&iacute; who are employed on clerical duties to operational duties.  This process is well under way and interviews are currently being held by the Public Appointments Service to recruit these Clerical Officers.  Since the beginning of 2007, 93 Clerical Officers have been appointed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A further 46 have been offered a Clerical Officer post.</P>
        <P>The report also recommends the creation of a Board of Management chaired by the Commissioner with three Deputy Commissioners (one of whom would be a civilian).  Section 38 of the Criminal Justice Bill 2007, which is currently before the House, inserts a new Chapter 3A into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to provide for the establishment and functions of such a Board, i.e, a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Executive Management Board.  The Board will consist of executive members and three non-executive members.  The executive members will be the Garda Commissioner as chairperson, the Deputy Garda Commissioners and a member of the civilian staff of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at a grade equivalent to that of a Deputy Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The three non-executive members will be appointed by the Government on the nomination of the Minister.  They will be persons with expertise in the strategic and financial management of organisations, the management of their human resources or their planning and review functions, or persons with other relevant experience.  The non-executive members will serve in an advisory capacity, providing advice in relation to annual policing plans, budgetary matters, allocation of resources, technology and equipment, setting of targets, training, development and leadership and other related matters.</P>
        <P>The function of the Board will be to keep under review the performance by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its functions and the arrangements and strategies in place to support and enhance the performance of those functions.  The Board will also keep under review the corporate governance arrangements and structures within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the arrangements for recruitment, training and development and the mechanisms for the measurement of performance and accountability.  The Board will supply reports on the performance of its functions at six-monthly intervals to the Minister and they will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 provides for the making of regulations specifying particulars which are adequate to enable the licensee and the licensed premises concerned to be identified to be affixed to containers in which alcohol is sold for consumption off licensed premises.</P>
        <P>While the labelling of containers in which alcohol is sold with a view to combatting under-age consumption is an attractive idea, significant challenges would need to be overcome in order to render it effective in practice. These challenges arise under two headings.</P>
        <P>Firstly, practical difficulties will be encountered where several individual containers are packaged together for sale, e.g. an enclosed six-pack of bottles; a plastic-wrapped tray of cans; or a nailed wooden box containing bottles of wine.  This raises the important issue of whether the label should be attached at the point of sale or earlier in the supply/ distribution chain.  Attaching labels at an early stage would be simpler but this would create logistical difficulties for importers and distributors and lead in turn to increased  distribution costs.  Moreover, in the case of imports from EU countries, such additional labelling requirements could be regarded as infringing internal market rules relating to free movement of goods.</P>
        <P>Also, it would be naive to overlook the possibility of labels being removed, or rendered non-legible, after sale.  The possible transfer of the contents from a labelled container to another unmarked container cannot be ruled out either.</P>
        <P>Secondly, from an enforcement perspective it is clear that possession by an underage person of a labelled container does not in itself constitute proof that the alcohol in the container had been illegally supplied to that person by the licensee whose particulars appear on the container.  It may have been taken from the family home or have been sold to a person over the age of 18 in good faith before being passed on to the underage person.  Indeed, a labelled container may have passed through several hands before finding its way into the hands of an underage person.</P>
        <P>Issues relating to the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container were raised during consultations on implementation of section 22 of the 2003 Act and the matter was subsequently raised with the Office of the Attorney General.  The Attorney General&rsquo;s Office has expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of possession of a labelled container and doubt is, therefore, cast on the utility of any regulations that might be made under section 22 of the 2003 Act.</P>
        <P>One option that could possibly be considered in the context of future legislation would be a presumption that any alcohol container found in the possession of an underage person had been <Col N="777"/>purchased by that person from the licensee identified on the container until the contrary was proved.  However, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office has also advised that such a proposal would raise serious constitutional issues and would run the significant risk of being found to be inconsistent with Article 38 of the Constitution.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?><P>For these reasons, I do not, as I have already stated on a number of occasions, intend to make regulations under section 22 of the 2003 Act at this time.  I will, however, give serious consideration in the context of future legislation to any reasonable and workable proposal that would deal with this matter without giving rise to the difficulties that I have already outlined.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.</P>
        <P>I published the Report of the Commission of Investigation into the Dean Lyons case on 1 September 2006.  I sent a copy of the Report to the Garda Commissioner for his consideration.  An Assistant Commissioner has been appointed to assess the impact of the recommendations of the report for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a view to recommending remedial action where necessary.  This assessment is ongoing and a report is expected to be submitted shortly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also sent a copy to the Expert Group which I established in the light of concerns arising from the Dean Lyons case. The Group will be reporting to me on the adequacy of Garda training, protocols, regulations and procedures, in assessing the fitness of persons to be interviewed and on the recording of any bona fide reservations of an individual member of a Garda investigation team as to the truthfulness or accuracy of self-incriminating statements.  The work of the Expert Group is still ongoing. I have already stated publicly that I will publish the report of the Group.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 85 together.</P>
        <P>The average annual salary of lawyers in the Office of the Director of Public is currently approximately &euro;81,210.  The current average salary of other staff is approximately &euro;36,870.  I propose to circulate with the official report tables which detail all salary scales of professionally qualified legal grades, i.e. solicitors and barristers, within the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  All points on the scales are shown, including the starting points.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has asked for details in respect of the Office of the Chief Prosecution Solicitor.  It would be more correct to refer to the Solicitors Division of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Chief Prosecution Solicitor leads the Solicitors Division. I can inform the Deputy that the average annual salary of lawyers in the Solicitors Division of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is currently approximately &euro;71,290.  The current average salary of other staff in the Solicitors Division is approximately &euro;35,910.  The running costs of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the period sought were as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0">The running costs of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions are calculated on a whole Office basis and are not apportioned across the three Divisions of the Office separately.  I am therefore not in a position to give figures for the running costs for the Solicitors Division or either for the other two Divisions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86, 91 and 92 together.</P>
        <P>The process of structured dialogue between the Government and the churches, faith communities and non-confessional organisations in Ireland was inaugurated with a gathering of dialogue partners at Dublin Castle on 26 February, 2007.  This will soon be followed a series of bilateral meetings with the dialogue partners.</P>
        <P>I believe that we have a political and civic culture in Ireland that, while holding no institution or individual above the law, respects the place of religious belief and practice.  It will be open to all partners as the dialogue continues to express their views on subjects of mutual interest and to bring forward proposals for change.  I am aware from the preliminary consultations with bodies on the dialogue process that the issues raised by the Deputy are likely to be of interest to partners in the process.</P>
        <P>The secretariat for the dialogue process will be provided by my Department, but it is not envisaged that this process should in any way displace the existing relationships between Departments of State and the dialogue partners nor diminish the responsibility, in the first instance, of Ministers with regard to issues arising in relation to their assigned functions.  If the issues suggested by the Deputy should arise, they will be addressed through the appropriate channels.  Similarly, the detailed aspects of the issues raised by the Deputy should be addressed to the relevant Ministers.</P>

        <Quest> the circumstances in which legislation promoted by his Department was approved that continues to allow for separate provision to be made in law for citizens on grounds of religious faith or lack of religious faith; if he has satisfied himself that adequate effort was made in statute law revision measures promoted by his Department to remove from statute law separate arrangements for persons by reference to their religious identity, for example, references to Jews, Quakers, Moravians, Christians, Catholics, and so on. </Quest>
        <QRef>[13323/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Statute Law Revision Bill 2007 is currently before the Oireachtas.  The Bill will repeal more than 3,000 statutes enacted before 6 December, 1922.  Included in the statutes for repeal are many statutes which differentiate between people on the basis of their religion.</P>
        <P>This Bill is a statute law revision measure. As such, it repeals only statutes which are appropriate for repeal, namely, those statutes which have ceased to have legal effect or which are obsolete.  Statutes which have some continuing legal effect may not be repealed by statute law revision measures.  The current Bill will retain in force more than 1,000 statutes which have (or may have) some continuing legal effect.</P>
        <P>A small number of the Acts which will be retained relate to particular religions.  The majority of these are statutes relating to the Church of Ireland which date from a time when that was the established church in Ireland.  These statutes are being retained because they may have some continuing effect on matters such as <Col N="790"/>the administration of particular churches, or of particular trusts, or of parish boundaries which relate to land ownership.  In consultation with the Church of Ireland, these have been selected for retention until alternative arrangements may be made for such matters.</P>
        <P>Other retained statutes which refer to named religions are statutes which were enacted at certain points in time to overcome religious discrimination which had previously affected those religions.  These include laws making arrangements for validating marriages of people of certain faiths and providing for the giving of evidence by people whose faiths did not permit the making of traditional-form oaths.  These various statutes will all be repealed in due course, but only in the context of more wide-ranging repeal and re-enactment measures relating to the relevant areas of law, such as oaths and marriages.</P>
        <P>The Government, at my request, has agreed that all of the statutes which will be retained in force by the current Bill will be proposed for repeal in subsequent legislation.  That subsequent legislation must first replace with modern legislation those statutes which have continuing legal effect.  My ultimate objective is to repeal all legislation enacted before Ireland achieved independence.</P>

	<P>A Detective Superintendent from outside the relevant Garda Division was appointed immediately after the incident to carry out a detailed investigation into all the circumstances surrounding the person in question&rsquo;s arrest, detention and removal to hospital. The Garda authorities submitted a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions on the matter and furnished a copy to me also. The Director issued instructions that no prosecution should ensue.</P>
        <P>An inquest into this tragic death is ongoing at present.  As a Coroner&rsquo;s Inquest is an independent inquisitorial process, I am not in a position to comment on the length of time the case is taking.  As I stated previously, when the inquest has been completed and a verdict returned I will consider the matter further.  A Civil Action has been initiated by the family and this is currently being dealt with by my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Missing Persons Bureau attached to Garda Headquarters is responsible for data relating to missing persons.  The District Officer (Superintendent) in the area where the person has been reported missing takes direct responsibility for all issues connected with the investigation in relation to the missing person.</P>
        <P>Where any young person under 18 years of age is reported missing the Juvenile Liaison Officer for the area in which the young person resides is notified as soon as possible.  The Juvenile Liaison Officer will on receipt of such information immediately communicate any information which he/she believes may be of benefit in tracing such missing persons.</P>
        <P>Where the missing person is traced the Juvenile Liaison Officer will, unless otherwise directed, visit that young person and their parents, guard<Col N="792"/>ians or other responsible adults and offer appropriate assistance.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities are currently engaged with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in developing a protocol on handling cases where children who are the responsibility of the HSE are reported missing.  It is the aim that this protocol will minimise the risk of harm to children when they are missing.and reduce the number of reports of children missing annually.</P>
        <P>The calculation of the amount of Garda time employed in the search for and return of children who have been reported missing from the custody of the HSE would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources.  However I am assured that the Garda authorities are satisfied that adequate resources are available for the investigation and monitoring of incidents where such persons are reported missing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that three types of less lethal weapons are currently available for use by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Emergency Response Unit.  These are bean bag shot, OC pepper spray and OC pepper spray shot.</P>
        <P>I announced yesterday that I have authorised the addition of Conductive Electric Devices to the range of less lethal weapons available to the ERU.  These devices are sometimes referred to by the brand name &ldquo;TASER&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Following the establishment by the Garda Commissioner of regional primary response teams in each Garda region outside Dublin to act as initial responders to critical incidents pending the deployment of the ERU, I have authorised the deployment to these regional teams of the three less lethal weapons already available to the ERU &ndash; bean bag shot, OC spray and OC spray shot.  These new regional teams will be drawn from the regional Public Order Units and will receive additional specialist training.</P>
        <P>The function of these less lethal weapons is for use in circumstances where necessary to avoid the use of firearms.  The use of firearms is permitted only to repel serious attacks on Garda&iacute;, members of the public or property, or in the arrest or re-arrest of persons involved in serious offences.  Strict conditions are laid down, including a requirement in all cases that all other means of <Col N="793"/>achieving the purpose in question have been exhausted, before firearms may be used.  The test which currently applies to the use of less lethal weapons that their use is necessary to avoid the use of firearms is, therefore, a high one.</P>
        <P>Less lethal devices are not routinely carried by the Garda members authorised to use them as their deployment is intended for critical incidents.  I do not propose for Garda operational reasons to disclose the number of less lethal devices available to the Garda&iacute; but I am advised by Garda management that sufficient stocks are available and requirements are constantly reviewed to take account of operational needs.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,178 following the attestation of 273 new members on Wednesday 14 March, 2007. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258. Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new <Col N="794"/>recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006.</P>
        <P>Community Policing is a central feature of current policing policy and members of Community policing units are encouraged to engage with the local communities where they are assigned. Current policing policy is predicated on the prevention of public order offences; the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a quality policing service.  All Garda&iacute; have a responsibility, inter alia, to be involved in Community Policing issues as they arise.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?><P>Garda management state that the total personnel strength (all ranks) of Community policing on 29 March 2007 was 521.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of Community Garda&iacute; who live in the communities they serve is not readily available and can only be obtained by the disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources.</P>

Access to the GIS is currently available in over 320 locations.</P>
        <P>All Garda&iacute; have access to internal email via the GIS.  Access to external email is available to all Garda&iacute; from the rank of Inspector upwards.  External email is also made available to Sergeants, Garda&iacute; and civilian staff as operational needs require. I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that a pilot exercise is currently underway to assess how best to maximise the use and facilities of email by the Force.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of costs, the Garda authorities inform me that because email was delivered as part of the overall infrastructure underpinning the Garda information systems, the specific cost for delivery of email is not available.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that there are 26 dogs attached to the Garda Dog Unit, 13 of which are general purpose search dogs.  The remaining dogs perform specialised search functions related to searches for drugs, firearms and explosives, tactical searches and victim recovery.  Although the Garda Dog Unit is primarily based in the Dublin Metropolitan Region it has a national remit and regularly conducts searches in other Garda Divisions.</P>
        <P>The cost of running the Garda Dog Unit in 2006 was approximately &euro;1.43 million.  The total personnel strength of the Garda Dog Unit as at 30 March 2007 was 16, comprising two sergeants and 14 Garda&iacute;.  There are no civilian personnel are attached to the Garda Dog Unit at present.</P>
        <P>In addition, a pilot project has been established in the Cork City Division and in the Limerick Division, with a view to full regional expansion of the unit.  At present one Garda and two dogs are allocated on a pilot basis to each of these Divisions.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,178 following the attestation of 273 new members on Wednesday 14 March, 2007. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258. Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into <Col N="799"/>the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006.</P>
        <P>The total personnel strength (all ranks) of the Garda Water Unit as at the 30 March 2007 was three (3) Sergeants and fifteen (15) Garda&iacute;.  There are no civilian personnel attached to the Garda Water Unit.</P>
        <P>Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</P>
        <P>The cost of running the Garda Water Unit in 2006 was approximately &euro;1.78 million.</P>

        <Quest> when it is expected that there will be a general reform of the courts system in line with An Agreed Programme for Government Between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats 2002. </Quest>
        <QRef>[13189/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The reform of the courts system referred to in the Agreed Programme for Government is well underway.  In this regard, I am happy to acknowledge the remarkable development of the courts system since the creation of the Courts Service less than ten years ago.</P>
        <P>Notable achievements include the great progress in improving the overall stock of Courthouses around the country.  Many of our county town courthouses have been refurbished and other major upgrading works have been completed in places such as Cork, Limerick, Dundalk and Castlebar.  Approval has been given to the Court Service to proceed with nine &ldquo;greenfield&rdquo; court projects, by way of Public Private Partnership (PPP), as part of a new envelope of &euro;50m for such projects. Construction will begin later this year on a new Criminal Courts Complex for <?oasys _dc28- ?>Dublin, which will also be developed as a PPP project.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>The increasing workload of the courts demand the provision of adequate judicial numbers.   Since 2002, the number of judges sitting in the High, Circuit and District Courts has increased from 108 to 125, an increase of 17 judicial posts. In addition, the Courts and Court Officers (Amendment) Act 2007 provides for a further 14 judges &mdash; 6 Judges of the District Court, 4 ordinary Judges of the Circuit Court and 4 ordinary Judges of the High Court.  I am confident that the additional judicial resources provided for in the new legislation will have a positive impact on <Col N="800"/>delays and generally speed up the judicial process.</P>
        <P>Another notable example of the ongoing reform of the courts was the establishment of the Commercial Division of the High Court, which has its own list based on a  general value threshold of &euro;1m.  The scope of the commercial list includes business transactions of a very wide variety where the value of the claim is &euro;1m or more.  Also included are judicial review cases which relate to major commercial matters.  Once entered, cases take 8-9 weeks to reach the hearing date, and are concluded in an average of 11 weeks.</P>
        <P>I might also mention the important initiative to tackle the so-called compensation culture in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 and the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.</P>
        <P>Specific mention is made in the Agreed Programme for Government to weekend and night courts.  At present, the District Court in Dublin sits each Saturday and on Bank Holidays.  Provincial District Courts sit outside of normal hours at weekends and at night to deal with emergency matters, as required.  Experience of the operation of court sittings continues to be reviewed.  This is being done in conjunction with legislative measures aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the courts.</P>
        <P>The issue of merging the criminal jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the Central Criminal Court was examined by the Working Group on the Jurisdiction of the Courts established by the Courts Service (the Fennelly Report). They recommended the retention of the Central Criminal Court and the Circuit Criminal Court as separate jurisdictions. There have been significant improvements in relation to delays in cases coming to trial in the Central Criminal Court. In 2003, the average waiting time for a trial in the Central Criminal Court was 18 months. Since then, the average waiting time has been halved and significantly, the Central Criminal Court now sits outside Dublin, where required. The issue will be kept under review in light of the changing circumstances.</P>
        <P>Finally, I should add that a Group has been established to consider the question of a general Court of Appeal.  The Group is reviewing and considering the necessity for a general Court of Appeal for the purposes of processing certain categories of appeals from the High Court. The Group will also make such other recommendations as are appropriate for the purposes of ensuring greater efficiencies in the practices and procedures of the Superior Courts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Prison Service places strong emphasis on the provision of vocational training for prisoners.  Training activities are chosen to give as much employment as possible for those in prison and to give opportunities to acquire skills which will help them secure employment on their release. The Work and Training programme covers the services necessary for the smooth operation of the prison such as catering and laundry, as well as workshops covering metalwork, printing, computers, Braille, woodwork, construction, clothing manufacture, craft, farming, horticulture, indexing, <Col N="802"/>painting and decorating, upholstery, baking, electronics etc.  The programme provides work and training opportunities for prisoners whilst ensuring a high quality of service delivery within the prison. Where appropriate, training is arranged outside the prison environment with external providers and community organisations such as PACE. In this way courses which cannot be made available within the prisons, such as heavy goods vehicle licence courses, can be undertaken by prisoners prior to release giving them the skills to move directly into  employment on release. Community assistance programmes and community project work are also carried out.</P>
        <P>The Proposal for Organisational Change agreed with the Prison Officers Association provides for a significant shift of resources into vocational training programmes. This involves the provision of dedicated new staffing and funding for the expansion of work training in the prison system, which will result in an increase in the number of authorised work training staff posts from c. 215 to c. 250. Since the conclusion of the Agreement, progress has been made in filling Industrial Manager and Industrial Supervisor posts.  Competitions are also ongoing to complete the complement of work and training personnel in all institutions.</P>
        <P>During 2006, new workshops and activities were developed in a number of institutions and a refurbishment and equipment replacement programme was implemented in other workshops. Approximately &euro;2m was spent in 2006 on structural works on the kitchens and laundries in a number of institutions which will facilitate the delivery of accredited training to prisoners.</P>
        <P>E-College, a F&Aacute;S distance learning delivery programme has been piloted in the Training Unit and is currently being extended to St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  STEPS, a group motivational developmental programme, has been run for a second time in Wheatfield prison.  BREAKTHROUGH, another group motivational programme, has recently been delivered in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  A three year national apprenticeship professional cookery course commenced in Castlerea Prison in January 2007.</P>
        <P>&euro;250,000 has been secured from the Dormant Accounts Fund in 2006 for employability support projects.  Under this initiative, two Business in the Community Ireland (BITC) Training and Employment Officers (TEO) will provide full-time information and career guidance and a dedicated training, education and employment placement service to prisoners in the Mountjoy and Midlands campuses. The two TEOs will take up their positions shortly.  An EQUAL project is also being funded to develop a self-employment programme which will equip prisoners with the necessary information and skills to set up their own business.</P>

	<P>Community Policing is a central feature of current policing policy and members of Community policing units are encouraged to engage with the local communities where they are assigned. Current policing policy is predicated on the prevention of public order offences; the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a quality policing service.  All Garda&iacute; have a responsibility, inter alia, to be involved in Community Policing issues as they arise.   I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength engaged in dedicated Community Policing on 29 March, 2007 was 521 (all ranks).</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that it is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.  Garda Personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.

	<P>Information relating to those prisoners with the lowest levels of educational accomplishment on committal in each of the years 2002 to date in 2007 are set out in the table below.  These figures are based on prisoners&rsquo; self report information which is recorded in relation to each prisoner on their committal. Following on from this each student coming into the Prison Education Centre will have an individual interview to assess his/her educational needs and interests. Those with literacy difficulties are prioritised and slotted into class almost immediately. Given the stigma often attached to literacy problems and low levels of educational attainment, it is not possible to state definitively the level of literacy in the prison population as many prisoners are unwilling to come forward and share such information. Every effort is made to publicise education and literacy classes and encourage as many prisoners as possible to avail of them.</P><Col N="803"/>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that non EU citizens studying at Irish universities have been asked to withdraw their children from State schools; the legislation that governs this decision; the reason established practice has been changed; and his views on whether this is an acceptable way to treat what are in many cases highly qualified post graduate students and researchers attending universities here and paying the full economic cost. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the main principles of Ireland&rsquo;s immigration system is that persons coming to Ireland should not be an undue burden on the resources of the State.</P>
        <P>In line with this general principle, the established policy in relation to the attendance of overseas students in Irish primary and second level schools is that visas should only be granted to those who are attending fee paying schools on the basis that to do otherwise would give rise to additional demands on the State.   For students coming from countries that are not visa required, the position must be consistent with that for visa applicants in that students should only be granted residence permits where they are attending fee paying schools.</P><Col N="806"/>
        <P>The child of an adult student attending an Irish university would be present in the State as a dependant of that parent.  That parent would be expected to have sufficient resources to provide for him/herself and any family members while they are in the State.  If the child were to be permitted to attend State schools it would be in conflict with the condition of self-sufficiency.  The fact that a parent is attending university and paying the costs of that course of study should not in itself permit their child to access State education services.</P>
        <P>This policy has not changed in recent times.</P>
        <P>In terms of legislation, the basic tenet that a foreign national and any accompanying dependants, should not be an undue burden on the State is reflected in section 4 of the Immigration Act 2004 where it is included as one of the reasons why an immigration officer might refuse a person permission to land or be in the State.  That provision was stated in the Aliens Order 1946.</P>
        <P>I do not have the details of the specific cases to which the Deputy may be referring but I am generally aware that cases are coming to light of overseas children being placed in state schools in circumstances where this would be contrary to general immigration policy.   I have scope, however, to make exceptions to the general policy where it is justified and individual cases can be looked at on their merits, taking account the potential disruption to the education of the parent and child of a negative decision.</P>
        <P>A review of the general policy in this area is now underway.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am proposing  a number of amendments to the law on bail in the Criminal Justice Bill 2007 which is currently before this House.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the bail system operates under a general presumption in favour of granting bail, on the basis that the person is innocent before the law until proven guilty.</P>
        <P>Two statutes are particularly relevant to the operation of the arrangements for bail.  The Bail Act 1997 amended the bail regime generally and gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution.  Section 2(1) of the Act provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  For this purpose a serious offence is defined as one which caries a penalty of at least 5 years imprisonment  on conviction and which is listed in the Schedule to the Act (e.g. murder, manslaughter, sexual offences, drug offences).  The Act was brought fully into operation on 15 May 2000.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail shall be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence.</P>
        <P>Part 2 of the Criminal Justice Bill 2007, currently before this House, introduces several initiatives designed to improve the operation of the bail system and to provide the prosecution authorities with more opportunity to oppose bail <Col N="808"/>applications where there is considered to be a likelihood of the applicant offending while on bail. Section 6 provides that the applicant for bail may be required to provide a statement on his or her assets and income, as well as details of criminal convictions (including convictions for any offences committed while previously on bail) and previous bail applications. Section 7 provides that a Chief Superintendent may give his or her opinion that the applicant, if given bail, is likely to commit a serious offence and that the application should therefore be refused.  Sections 11 to 13 provide that a person granted bail may be subject to electronic monitoring if the bail is conditional on the person being or not being in certain places at certain specified times.  Section 19 provides the prosecution with a right of appeal against the grant of bail or in respect of any conditions attaching to bail, where it is granted. Such a right is not currently available to the prosecution.  This section also allows the High Court to transfer bail applications to the Circuit Court in cases where the case is triable by the Circuit Court.</P>
        <P>The net effect of the changes being introduced by Part 2 of the Criminal Justice Bill 2007 is that the prosecution authorities will be in a position to mount a more effective challenge to bail applications where there is a likelihood of the applicant committing serious offences if given bail. These changes will help redress the balance while respecting the general presumption referred to at the outset.</P>
        <P>The numbers of headline offences, by group, committed by persons on bail have been featured in the Garda Annual Report since 2004, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  2004 was the first year information relating to the offences committed by persons on bail was published.  Comparable statistics for years prior to 2004 are not readily available and would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources to extract the data from manual records.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that there has been extensive contact with the Stardust Victims Committee in recent years, leading to their lodging a comprehensive submission last July in which they set out their concerns regarding the original inquiry.  This was followed up by a meeting on 18 September last at <Col N="809"/>which the Taoiseach and I, together with senior officials and the Director of the Forensic Science Laboratory, met with representatives of the Victims Committee.  The purpose of the meeting was to hear from the Committee in person on their detailed submission so as to properly inform the analysis of its contents.   The meeting concluded with an indication by the Committee that it would follow up with some final observations, which could be added to the material already under examination.</P>
        <P>The extent of the detail and the complexity of the issues, however, were such that the examination of the technical and legal questions arising required more time than was originally anticipated.    This examination concluded in December and a considered written response issued to the Committee&rsquo;s solicitor on the 15th of that month.   This correspondence informed the Committee that their submissions has received very careful attention but that the analysis and advice available to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste remained that new material had not been presented which would justify the holding of another inquiry or which would have led to a different conclusion had it been available at the time of the original inquiry.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this position, and taking into account the evident and sincere concerns of the families in question, the Committee&rsquo;s solicitor was also informed that the Taoiseach would be willing to arrange for an external and independent examination of the Committee&rsquo;s submission by an eminent legal person.  The precise arrangements and mechanisms of this examination are currently the subject of discussions with the Committee&rsquo;s solicitor.  All of the relevant information will be put before the person in question for consideration and a full opportunity will be provided to the Victim&rsquo;s Committee to present and explain the points made in their submission.</P>
        <P>Rather than continue to debate the details of that submission, or the advice received by me with respect to its merits, I believe it is now preferable to allow these issues be explored in the forthcoming independent examination.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Operation Anvil commenced in the Garda Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) on 17 May, 2005.  It is an intelligence led policing initiative, the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static check <Col N="810"/>points by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  The Operation remains in place and is on-going in the DMR.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil is central to the strategy of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating serious crime and in particular murder.  The Operation has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high-profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.  Notable improvements have been achieved in the recorded number of incidents of crime being targeted by the Operation.  In particular, crime statistics for the fourth quarter of 2006 showed an increase of 34% in detections of possession of firearms which contributed to the reduction of 3.4% in discharges of firearms. Operation Anvil has also contributed to the increase in that quarter of detections of offences of possession of drugs for sale or supply which is closely associated with many murders using firearms.</P>
        <P>The most recent figures available to me, up to 27 March, 2007, show the massive effect which Operation Anvil has been having since its inception in May 2005. In the Dublin Metropolitan Region there have been 3,971 arrests for serious crimes, comprising of 74 arrests for murder, 2,042 arrests for burglary, 941 arrests for robbery and 914 arrests for serious assaults. There have also been 2,279 arrests for theft offences. In addition 30,330 searches have been carried out, comprising 26,497 for drugs, 2,290 for thefts and 1,543 for firearms. Also 643 firearms have been seized and there have been 10,520 seizures under Section 41 of the Road Traffic Act. 54,526 checkpoints have been carried out and property to the value of &euro;17.2m has been recovered.</P>
        <P>I am sure that all members of the House will join me in commending An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their success in this regard.</P>
        <P>While the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to Dublin, I should mention that Operation Anvil was extended nationwide during 2006 and consists of a series of special operations, proposed by each Regional Assistant Commissioner, which are designed to focus on areas where there is a high incidence of crime.</P>
        <P>The Operation outside the DMR is significantly different from that in the DMR, in that initiatives have a short time-focus and are designed to address the particular needs of specific areas. A number of operations have been completed, while further operations are on-going. The methodologies utilised in doing this vary from area to area and from time to time, commensurate with the assessed need. For these reasons there is no comparable system in place for the systematic collation of statistical data in these Garda Regions.</P><Col N="811"/>
        <P>Operation Anvil is, of course, only one element of the unprecedented resources being made available in the fight against crime.</P>
        <P>I have made it clear to the Garda Commissioner that Operation Anvil will continue to be funded to the extent and as long as the Commissioner considers that it is necessary to do so and it is fulfilling its objectives.</P>
        <P>The table below shows the successes of Operation Anvil.</P>

	<P>On 2 May 2006, I launched the Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy &amp; Strategy, entitled Keeping Drugs out of Prison. This policy fulfils the commitment in the Programme for Government to publish the plan to end all heroin use in Irish prisons as well as my own commitment to achieve a drug-free prison <Col N="812"/>system. The implementation of this Policy &amp; Strategy has seen an intensification of efforts in the prison system to eliminate the availability of illicit drugs within prisons.</P>
        <P>It has provided for a range of new measures aimed at eliminating the supply of drugs into prisons, notably: enhanced visit security, the introduction of passive drug detection dogs and mandatory drug testing.  At the same time, it has provided for continued investment in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population and meeting prisoners&rsquo; treatment and rehabilitative needs.</P>
        <P>The intended introduction of mandatory drug testing across the prison system will provide a more accurate indication of the extent of drug abuse amongst prisoners. Deliberations are at an advanced stage in relation to the provision of this service.</P>

        <P>I should point out that prior to 1997, each application was assigned a registration number, a record of which was then manually entered into ledgers. Some such registration numbers were subsequently cancelled or the applicant assigned a different number and this may result in minor discrepancies in the data provided.</P><Col N="815"/>

        <P FLI="0">In regard to Leave to Remain, I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to applications for Leave to Remain in the State made pursuant to Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended.</P>
        <P>An application for Leave to Remain in the State in these circumstances arises where a non-national is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3 (3) (a) of the Immigration Act, 1999. A person served with such a notice of intent to deport is afforded three options, viz. to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of a Deportation Order; or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why a Deportation Order should not be made and why temporary Leave to Remain in the State be granted instead.</P>
        <P>Leave to remain, outside that granted on the grounds of parentage of an Irish born child or marriage to an Irish or EU national, is considered in the context of deciding whether or not to deport a non-national.</P>
        <P>In determining whether to make a deportation order or grant temporary leave to remain in the State, I must have regard to the eleven factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.</P>
        <P>Temporary leave to remain is considered in every case regardless of whether representations are made by, or on behalf of, the persons concerned. Statistics are not maintained in a way which distinguishes between those who have made an application for leave to remain and those who have not. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that many of those who failed the asylum process, and who did not opt to return voluntarily or consent to deportation, nonetheless left the State before a decision to deport or grant leave to remain was made.</P><Col N="818"/>

	<P>Garda Youth Diversion Projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved (or further involved) in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development and promote civic responsibility.  The Garda Youth Diversion Projects are funded by my Department and administered through the Community Relations Section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is my intention to ensure that 100 projects will be established nationwide before the end of 2007.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner brings forward proposals to me for the establishment of new Garda Youth Diversion Projects following periodic assessment of applications received from community groups etc.  The locations for new Projects are selected on the basis of factors including an increase in the level of juvenile crime in the area and the number of young people referred to the Juvenile Diversion Programme. Should an application be received for a Garda Youth Diversion Project in the Lucan area it will be given due consideration by the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as part of its contribution to the Europol Organised Crime Report which was recently <Col N="820"/>refined to become the Organised Crime Threat Assessment (OCTA), undertakes an annual assessment of organised crime in Ireland.  The most recent assessment was completed in November 2006.</P>
        <P>This analysis concludes that the nature of organised crime gangs continues to be the same as in previous years.  There are two categories of organised crime groups operating in this jurisdiction.  The first category consists of individuals/groups that are well established and tightly structured involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences.  The second category involves groups whose activities are characterised by less cohesive group structures and criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland.</P>
        <P>Because of the relative fluid nature of those involved in serious/organised crime in Ireland it is not possible to easily place them in a particular group and therefore it is not possible to provide an accurate and definitive number for the various groups operating here.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau, under the Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services, works closely with other national units and senior investigating officers in all Garda Divisions to ensure, wherever possible, that assets derived from criminal activity, including drug-related crime, are subject to post-conviction confiscation, pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act 1993, civil restraint pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996-2005 and the relevant Revenue and Social Welfare legislation.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue with intelligence-led operations against selected targets to combat the criminal activities of these groups.</P>
        <P>In relation to the resources available to the Garda&iacute;, I wish to inform the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has never been better resourced than it is now.  The personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,178 following the attestation of 273 new members on Wednesday 14 March 2007.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476, or over 23% in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training on 14 March 2007 was 14,258.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, on 19 December 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000.  The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, which represents an 11% increase on 2006.</P>
        <P>Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda <Col N="821"/>resources, and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</P>

	<P>With the huge increase  in Garda resources facilitated by this Government, I am satisfied that it has enabled a major investment by the Force in technology to meet the challenges of modern society.</P>
        <P>This year an unprecedented level of resources is being invested in technology for the Garda&iacute; to assist them in the exercise of all their functions. The capital allocation for Information Technology and Communications alone for 2007 amounts to &euro;44 million.  This coupled with the significant level of funding already invested in technology over the past number of years enabled a large number of important initiatives in the area of IT and telecommunications to be undertaken.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have set-out their targets in the fight against crime in their Corporate Strategy and Annual Policing Plan for 2007.  In the area of technology this is underpinned by their Information and Communications Technology Plan. Implementation of a number of major systems identified in the plan is already well underway.   Chief among these is the provision of a new National Digital Radio Service which will provide the force with not only secure radio communications but also access to mobile data such as photographs etc.   Other projects currently underway include a Major Incidents System which will involve the capture of all incident information, exhibit tracking as well as supporting incident room management.  A new Automated Number Plate recognition system (ANPR) is also being developed.  Other systems under development include a new Automated Fingerprint Information System (AFIS), an automated Ballistics Identification System (ABIS) and Financial Management Systems as well as significant investment in the continued support and maintenance of existing systems.</P>
        <P>The above mentioned investment is just one element of the Government&rsquo;s overall commitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including increasing  the strength of the Force to 15,000, a major programme of civilianisation and an increase in the overall Garda budget to over &euro;1.4 billion in 2007.  This unprecedented investment in resources by this Government provides a firm platform to take <Col N="822"/>on the challenges of policing in a modern diverse society.</P>

The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258. Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006.</P>
        <P>The national population in 1996 was 3,626,087 while the Garda strength was 10,285. This established a ratio of 1 Garda member for every 335 persons. If the population increased to 4.5 m by 2012, a Garda strength of 13,433 would be required to maintain this 335:1 ratio.  Under the current Garda recruitment programme approved by the Government, the strength of the Force will have increased to 15000 by 2012. Based on a population assumption of 4.5 million, this represents a ratio of 1 Garda for every 300 persons.</P><Col N="823"/>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Central Statistics Office are presently examining the 2006 Census of Population figures in relation to Small Area Population Statistics (SAPS). It is not expected that these SAPS figures will be available until October 2007. It is therefore not possible to provide an accurate ratio of the extent to which the deployment of Garda&iacute; in terms of ratio to the population has improved in line with demographic trends at present.</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that it is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.  Garda Personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that as part of their contribution to the Europol Organised Crime Report, which was recently refined to become the Organised Crime Threat Assessment (OCTA), An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na undertakes an annual assessment of organised crime in Ireland.  The most recent assessment was completed in November 2006.</P>
        <P>The analysis concludes that the nature of organised crime gangs continues to be the same as in previous years.  There are two categories of organised crime groups operating in this jurisdiction.  The first category consists of individuals/groups that are well established and tightly structured involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences. The second category involves groups whose activities are characterised by criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland.</P>
        <P>However, because of the relatively fluid nature of those involved in serious/organised crime in Ireland, it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate as to those crimes committed by such groupings.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue with intelligence-led operations against selected targets to combat the criminal activities of these groups.</P>

	<P>Following the submission to me in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, I decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, I am pleased to note that the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics for the third and fourth quar<Col N="826"/>ters of 2006.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.  I have requested the CSO to provide the information sought by the Deputy directly to him.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 140 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,178 following the attestation of 273 new members on Wednesday 14 March, 2007. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258. Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of the Carlow/Kildare Division on 31 December 1997 and on 2 April 2007 was 281 and 390 (all ranks) respectively. This represents an increase of 109 (or 38.7%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.</P>
        <P>The national population in 1996 was 3,626,087 while the Garda strength was 10,285. This established a ratio of 1 Garda member for every 335 <Col N="827"/>persons. If the population increased to 4.5 m by 2012, a Garda strength of 13,433 would be required to maintain this 335:1 ratio.  Under the current Garda recruitment programme approved by the Government, the strength of the force will have increased to 15,000 by 2012. Based on a population assumption of 4.5 million, this represents a ratio of 1 Garda for every 300 persons.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Central Statistics Office are presently examining the 2006 Census of Population figures in relation to Small Area Population Statistics (SAPS). It is not expected that these SAPS figures will be available until October 2007. It is therefore not possible to provide an accurate ratio of the extent to which the deployment of Garda&iacute; in terms of ratio to the population has improved in line with demographic trends at present.</P>
        <P>I should also add that it is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.  Garda Personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</P>

	<P>I launched the Community-based CCTV Scheme in June 2005, in response to a demonstrated demand from local communities across Ireland for the provision of CCTV systems.  The Scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems.</P>
        <P>The Scheme offers both pre-development grants of up to &euro;5,000 to enable qualifying applicants to investigate the need for CCTV in their area and to complete a detailed proposal, and substantial grants of up to &euro;100,000 from my Department to install a CCTV system in their area.  In addition, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs provides successful applicants from RAPID areas with a further grant to a possible maximum of &euro;100,000.  Pobal has been engaged to administer the Scheme on behalf of this Department and it carries out thorough assessments of all applications received.</P>
        <P>The first round of the Scheme concluded in September 2005 and 24 successful groups received Stage 1 grants totalling &euro;115,665 with payments being made in 2006.  Pobal invited all groups who received Stage 1 grants to submit Stage 2 proposals by 31st January 2007.  Twenty of these groups submitted proposals and I announced in recent days that eleven groups had been approved to receive grants totalling in excess of &euro;1 million from my Department, to be matched in RAPID areas by funding in the order of &euro;960,000 provided by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The final amounts of funding involved for each project will be determined subject to the finalisation of contracts for each scheme.</P>
        <P>Three proposed projects in the Tallaght area are included in the eleven groups that have been approved for grants from my Department.  They are:</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Jobstown Community Development Group, Tallaght,</P><Col N="830"/>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Getting Tallaght Working Ltd., T/A Partas in Killinarden, and</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Getting Tallaght Working Ltd., T/A Partas in Brookfield &amp; Fettercairn.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As these three areas are RAPID areas, the projects will be entitled to seek matching funding from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P>The approval for funding now enables these Community groups in the Tallaght area and, indeed, groups in the other areas of the country involved to install and operate their own CCTV systems under the guidance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Local Authorities.  Pobal will continue to monitor progress on behalf of the Department as these projects are implemented.</P>
        <P>Community-based CCTV schemes are an important and effective way for local people and organisations to work together in partnership with the Garda&iacute; and local authorities to help make local communities safer.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in <Col N="834"/>specific terms, they are not in a position to state whether tax relief would be available in respect of rent paid to a voluntary housing association such as &ldquo;Cl&uacute;id&rdquo; or &rsquo;Respond&rsquo; without knowing the precise details of the tenancy and/or other arrangement entered into by the individual concerned. </P>
        <P>In general terms, Section 473 TCA 1997 provides tax relief at the standard rate of tax (currently 20%) to individuals who pay for <Col N="835"/>private rented accommodation that is used as their sole or main residence.  The maximum tax relief available is as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) for married persons jointly assessed to tax and widowed persons&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(i)  if aged under 55, the maximum relief is &euro;3,600@20% = &euro;720</P>
        <P LI="2">(ii) if aged 55 or over &euro;7,200@20% = &euro;1,440</P>
        <P LI="1">(b) for single individuals&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(i)  if aged under 55, &euro;1,800 @ 20% = &euro;360</P>
        <P LI="2">(ii) if aged 55 or over &euro;3,600 @ 20% = &euro;720</P>
        <P FLI="0">However, the relief is not available in respect of rent paid on: a tenancy for a freehold estate or interest, or a tenancy for a definite period of 50 years or more; tenancies held from local authorities, Government Departments or the Office of Public Works, and tenancies in relation to which exists an agreement that the rent paid may be treated as consideration or part consideration for the purchase or future purchase of the property.</P>
        <P>In addition, the term &lsquo;rent&rsquo; does not include payment that relates to the provision of goods and services nor does it include any right or benefit other than the bare right to use, occupy and enjoy residential premises.  Also, the term &rsquo;rent&rsquo; does not include payments that qualify for right of reimbursement or subsidy from a third party.</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in relation to the case giving rise to the Deputy&rsquo;s query, on receipt of the details of the individual&rsquo;s tenancy and/or other arrangement with the housing association, they will examine the matter and determine whether or not relief for rent paid is due.</P>
        <P>If there is an entitlement to the rent relief, such entitlement is claimed by way of completion of a form Rent 1 (which is available from the Revenue website www.revenue.).</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that an Inland Revenue Affidavit was received in the case of the named estate. So that the amount of Probate Tax liability can be established, a Probate Tax Form [form PT1] was requested from the Solicitor on 15th February 2007 but this has not yet been returned. It is not possible to determine the liability to Probate Tax until Form PT1 is received.</P><Col N="836"/>
        <P>In addition insufficient information is available to determine whether there is a Capital Acquisitions Tax liability in respect of the beneficiaries or any other tax liability in respect of the estate.  No request has been received to waive liability.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, a sum of &euro;75m for revenue purposes was provided to the Health Service Executive for Disability Services in the 2007 Budget.  This sum incorporates the 2007 element of the Government&rsquo;s multi-annual investment programme for the National Disability Strategy.  This Strategy is committed to enhancing the level and range of multi-disciplinary support services to adults and children with an intellectual, physical and sensory disability and those with autism.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <Quest> the number of patients currently awaiting orthopaedic appointments at Kerry General Hospital; the consultant rheumatology patient ratio; the number of patients on waiting lists for neurology, urology, ophthalmology and plastic surgery consultation; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Statutory responsibility for the collation, management and publication of data on waiting times for surgical procedures rests with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  My Department has, therefore, asked the Chief Executive of the NTPF to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the information requested on neurology, urology, ophthalmology and plastic surgery waiting lists.</P>
        <P>As the NTPF would not be in a position to comment on the consultant rheumatology patient ratio at Kerry General Hospital (KGH), my Department requested the information from the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The HSE has advised that a visiting consultant Rheumatologist <Col N="837"/>attends KGH on one day per month and typically sees eight new patients per session. In 2006, there were 546 Rheumatology out-patient consultations at KGH of which 47 were new patients. At present, there is no in-patient Rheumatology service in Kerry. Patients requiring in-patient treatment are referred as appropriate to Cork University Hospital.</P><Col N="838"/>
        <P>The following table sets out the waiting list for both Orthopaedic Out-patient and In-patient waiting times and for Out-patient Rheumatology consultations at KGH as at end February, 2007.  KGH is working closely with the NTPF towards reducing waiting times for both in-patient and out-patient services.</P><Col N="837"/>

The Government has accepted the Report as the basis for the future development of our mental health services. </P>
        <P>Implementation of the individual recommendations of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, is a matter primarily for the HSE.  In July 2006, the HSE established an implementation group to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; a reality.</P>
        <P>The HSE has informed my Department that it is currently examining how best to give effect to the recommendation contained in &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; to establish a National Mental Health Service Directorate.

	<P>The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, which was launched in January 2006, provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health services for a seven to ten year period.  &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; recommends that a National Service User Executive be established to inform the HSE, the Mental Health Commission, inter alia, on issues relating to service user involvement and participation in planning, delivering, evaluating and monitoring services.  The interim National Service User Executive (iNSUE) was established on 31 January 2007.  </P><Col N="839"/>
        <P>The Health Service Executive proposes to replace the interim NSUE with a substantive NSUE before the end of this year.  The interim group will design the structure and format, constitution and standing orders and set out a programme of work.</P>
        <P>In July 2006, the Health Service Executive established &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; implementation group to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; a reality.  There are two service user and carer organisation representatives on the implementation group.</P>

        <P FLI="0">There are a number of contextual factors which must be taken into account in interpreting these data.</P>
        <P>The Health Strategy Quality &amp; Fairness committed to making improvements in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes eligible for the medical card and to give priority to families with children. In November, 2004 I set out my priorities for new health initiatives in 2005 including the provision of medical cards to an additional 30,000 people and GP visit cards to 200,000 people. Funding of &euro;60 million was provided to the HSE for these measures. The two initiatives were intended to assist those on low and moderate incomes in accessing GP services and to help remove disincentives to people taking up work or progressing to better paying work.  Following the enactment of the necessary legislation and the conclusion of <Col N="840"/>negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation, the first GP visit cards were issued by the HSE in November, 2005.</P>
        <P>Taking holders of medical cards and GP visit cards together, some 1.287m persons (30.39% of the national population) now have access to general practitioner services free of charge.</P>
        <P>In recent years there have been significant improvements to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed. Since the start of 2005, the income guidelines used in the assessment of medical card applications have increased by a cumulative<?oasys _jy ?>29%. Other significant changes in 2005 mean that, on a standardised basis nationally, assessment is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child-care and travel to <Col N="841"/>work. Initially the GP visit card guidelines were 25% higher than the medical card guidelines however in June, 2006 I agreed with the HSE to further increase the income guidelines for GP visit cards and they are now 50% higher than those used for medical cards.</P>
        <P>The HSE (and before 2005 the health boards) have undertaken a substantial programme of work in recent years to improve data quality in the GMS client database. For example, in 2003 and 2004, work carried out by the health boards led to a deletion of approximately 104,000 inappropriate entries where, for example, there were duplicate entries for the same person, the expiry date on the card had passed, the person had moved away or was deceased. This exercise did not involve any reduction in the actual number of people who held medical cards but rather resulted in a more accurate picture of the number of individuals in receipt of GP services under the GMS Scheme.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.  As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division <Col N="845"/>of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the<?oasys _jy ?>Deputy.</P>

	<P>There is no provision whereby the HSE may seek to sell the home of a person in long stay care.  The Deputy will be aware that at present, some individuals find it necessary to sell their home in order to pay for long-term care.  However, I recently announced a Nursing Home Support Scheme, to be implemented from 2008, under which there will no need for individuals to take this course of action.  The new scheme will ensure that no-one has to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for their care costs.</P>
        <P>Under the new scheme individuals will make an immediate contribution towards the cost of their care amounting to up to 80% of their disposable income.  Depending on the amount of disposable income a person has, there will also be a deferred charge of up to 5% of their assets per annum.  The charge is deferred because it will not have to be met during a person&rsquo;s lifetime.  In the case of the principal private residence it will be capped at 15%.  Finally, for individuals whose spouse and certain dependants are living in the residence, the charge will be further deferred during their lifetime.  The Health Service Executive has responsibility for provision of long-term care and the information sought by the Deputy relates to matters within the area of responsibility of the Executive. My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive <Col N="847"/>to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>A joint Health Service Executive/Department of Health and Children Transition Group was established to advance the development of the national tertiary paediatric hospital.   The next stage of the process, which is being overseen by the Transition Group, involves the preparation of a high level framework brief for the new hospital.  The brief is being developed for the Transition Group by Rawlinson Kelly &amp; Whittlestone Ltd (RKW), an established UK-based health care planning company.  RKW will be advising on a range of issues which will help to inform the design of the new hospital.  They will be advising, for example, on the preferred model of care, on the core services to be delivered at the new hospital, and on the additional range of services to be provided outside of the main hospital through the urgent / ambulatory care service, taking account of international best practice in the planning of children&rsquo;s hospital services.  RKW&rsquo;s report is expected to be completed this month.</P>
        <P>The Transition Group is also at an advanced stage of drafting the Statutory Instrument which will establish the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on a legal basis.  The draft proposals have been sent to the relevant parties for comment.  The Board, which will be chaired by Mr Philip Lynch, will be responsible for designing, building and equipping the new hospital in accordance with the high level framework brief currently being prepared.</P>

	<P>Evidence based population screening programmes are an essential element of the National Cancer Control Strategy which I published last June.  As the Deputy is aware, on 1 January this year, I established a National Cancer Screening Service Board which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme, both of which will be rolled out nationally this year.  The total allocation to the new Service in 2007 is &euro;33m.  This is a 71% increase on the 2006 allocation to the Programmes and includes an additional &euro;8m for BreastCheck and an additional &euro;5m for the Irish Cervical Screening Programme.  The Service will also advise on the implementation of a national colorectal screening programme.</P>
        <P>The Irish Cervical Screening Programme Phase One currently offers free cervical screening to women aged between 25 and 60 years in the Mid-Western Region.  The National Programme will provide screening every three years for women aged 25-44 years and screening every five years for women aged 45-60 years.  Under the National Breast Screening Programme, screening is offered free of charge to all women in the Eastern, North Eastern, Midland and parts of the South Eastern areas in the 50-64 age group.</P>
        <P>When the national roll-out of the BreastCheck programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered at national level, consideration will be given to including older women and thereby continuing the screening of women in the programme who have reached 65 years of age.  Any woman irrespective of her age or residence who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 &mdash; 2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006 &mdash; 2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>
        <P>As part of the process of closing the EOCP, the final date for reaching contract stage, for Groups applying for funding under this programme, was 31 December 2006.  As the Deputy will be aware, the EOCP is co-funded by the European Union and timescales agreed with the Commission must be observed as financial penalties will accrue to the State if they are not.  The Group in question submitted an EOCP staffing grant application to <Col N="851"/>Pobal, which is engaged to assess EOCP and NCIP grants on behalf of my Office,  in October 2006.  Final information required to complete the assessment was received by Pobal from the Group on 6 December 2006.</P>
        <P>As it was not possible at that stage for the application to be brought through the assessment and appraisal process and to contract stage by 31 December 2006, it was recommended by the Programme Appraisal Committee that the Group&rsquo;s application under that Programme be declined and that the application be considered in the context of the forthcoming NCIP staffing grant scheme.  The Secretary General of the Department concurred with this recommendation.</P>
        <P>In certain circumstances, including where an application is linked to a previous EOCP capital grant, applications for staffing grant assistance are continuing to be considered under the EOCP and, subject to the outcome of a review in each case, the applicants will be advised of the position as soon as possible.  In the case of other Groups such as that referred to by the Deputy, which have been declined staffing grant funding under the EOCP as a result of being unable to meet the contractual deadlines of that Programme, and whose applications were not linked to a previous EOCP capital grant, the review of their applications for staffing grant funding will be undertaken as soon as the details of the new NCIP staffing grant scheme are announced.  In each case, the review will be undertaken as quickly as possible to facilitate the Group concerned.  Officials in my Office will be in contact with the Group in due course to inform them of the outcome of that review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 188 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband by private sector companies is a matter for the companies themselves operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in over 120 towns and cities.  These MANs will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.  My Department has also provided grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme.</P>
        <P>However, despite Government and private investment in broadband I am aware that there are still some parts of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  A Steering Committee comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently finalising the proposed National Broadband Scheme, which will aim to provide broadband to these unserved areas. The scheme when it is fully rolled out, should ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in unserved areas including rural areas are met. Work on the design of an appropriate public tender is underway. Indicative maps are being prepared to help inform the tendering process.</P>

	<P>The Handbook on Oil Supply Disruption Contingency Measures will be published and placed on the Department&rsquo;s website by the end of April. The Handbook was compiled by officials of my Department in consultation with the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), the Irish Petroleum Industry Association (IPIA) and other Departments. </P>
        <P>As a member of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Ireland is obliged to maintain contingency arrangements for dealing with oil supply disruptions. The purpose of the Handbook is to clearly set out the legislation and national and international procedures, which underpin and inform decisions in the event of an oil supply disruption. The Handbook will be regularly reviewed and updated.</P>
        <P>There are legislative measures in place to deal with an oil supply disruption. Ireland would respond to an oil supply disruption by either the drawdown of NORA stocks or by the use of demand restraint measures or a combination of both. Under the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts 1971 and 1982, the Government may make an order empowering the Minister to provide for the regulation or control of the acquisition, supply, distribution or marketing of specified types of fuels, for the maintenance of certain types of fuels and to provide for the control, regulation, restriction or prohibition of the import or the export of specified types of fuels. The National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 provides for Ministerial powers to authorise the draw down of NORA stocks in the event of an oil supply crisis.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 to 193, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>A variety of conservation measures have been adopted for the protection of wild salmon stocks in the River Shannon.</P>
        <P>The Shannon Fisheries Region (Prohibition of Angling with Rod and Line) Bye-law No. C.S.289, 2007 prohibits angling for all species of fish in a section of the Lower River Shannon from Plassey Bridge to Thomond Bridge during the period commencing 1 March to 30 September.</P>
        <P>This bye-law was introduced at the request of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, which advised me that wide scale illegal fishing takes place in this area.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the Shannon Fisheries Board considers that it would be problematic to implement a management system to protect wild salmon that would be complied with in this area during this season. In the circumstances, permitting angling for any species would adversely impact of wild salmon stocks.</P>
        <P>The Board will keep this measure under review for the current season in the context of the longer term adjustments to the salmon management regime on the River Shannon.</P>

There are now 16 members on the Board, 8 male and 8 female.</P>
        <P>The Development Education Advisory Committee (DEAC) was set up in 2003 to offer policy advice on development education and on ways to increase knowledge and understanding of development issues in Ireland.

        <P>The Fondation Irlandaise, which formally administers the Irish College in Paris, is managed by an Administration Council and a Board of Management comprising French and Irish nominees. A total of 16 Irish appointments were made to the Administration Council and Board of Management during the period in question, 11 male and 5 female.</P>
        <P>The Ireland &mdash; United States Commission for Educational Exchange (the Fulbright Commission) finances study, research, teaching and other educational activities between Ireland and the United States of America.

	<P>The majority of visa applications from Belarus are those relating to travel to Ireland of Chernobyl Children&rsquo;s groups. Following my meeting in Minsk in 2005 with various interested NGOs, arrangements were put in place by the Embassy in Moscow to ensure that the introduction of a visa requirement for the groups would not create obstacles for children&rsquo;s travel. These arrangements, which include processing within 1 week by the Visa Office in Moscow of applications which arrive by courier from Minsk and the issue of gratis visas, are operating satisfactorily and there is no impediment to children&rsquo;s travel. The staff of the Visa Office in Moscow has recently been increased to deal with the additional applications. There is no requirement for the children to travel to Moscow concerning their applications which are forwarded to the Embassy and returned through a courier arrangement. </P>
        <P>Otherwise, visa applications from people living in Belarus can be lodged at the Irish Embassy, Moscow either in person, by courier, or lodged by a third party on behalf of an applicant. Most applications are lodged in the latter way.</P>

The Agency promotes the County as part of an integrated region with access to a population of approx.140,000, as well as the expanded population of the Mid-West and South-West regions.  Based on the strengths of the region, IDA is particularly targeting the ICT (incl. software), and Globally Traded Business sectors.</P>
        <P>A sectoral focus that is built on regional strengths and supported by the third level sector is key to creating &lsquo;pull&rsquo; factors for attracting investment to the region.  The Strategic Competitiveness Programme that is operated by IDA is designed to help consolidate and grow client companies existing operations in the region by achieving substantial productivity improvements or the addition of new business functions such as R&amp;D, marketing, logistics management, shared service centres and customer or technical support activities.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2006, there were eighteen IDA assisted companies in County Kerry employing 1,785 people in a variety of industries such as Pharmaceuticals, Engineering and Consumer Products.</P>
        <P>In addition, IDA Ireland is engaged with the Kerry Employment Action Team  and the newly formed inter-agency Expert Group on Kerry to plan for the County&rsquo;s future economic growth.  Both groups are focussed on how Kerry can best position itself in the context of the National Spatial Strategy through its response to the National Development Plan.</P>
        <P>IDA also works in close cooperation with Shannon Development, in the development of the Kerry Technology Park (KTP). The Park provides state-of-the-art accommodation and facilities for both indigenous industry and foreign investors.</P><Col N="862"/>
        <P>Furthermore, IDA Ireland works with the Institute of Technology, Tralee in developing the skill-sets necessary to attract high value-added employment to the County and to encourage greater interaction with industry on areas of research and development.  The Agency also works closely with F&Aacute;S to provide guidance in developing the skill-sets needed by those in the workforce.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the policies and strategies in place will deliver the best results in terms of investment and jobs for the people of the Region.</P>

	<P>Appointments to State boards are as follow:</P>
	<P><i>National Competitiveness Council</i></P>
<P>The terms of reference of the NCC stipulates that four Members shall retire on May 31 each year, therefore, 4 new appointments will be made soon after this date.</P>

        <P>Apart from the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks the terms of appointment of the Members of both Boards are due to expire on 12 April 2007. Four appointments to each Board will then be made.</P><Col N="866"/>

       <P el="13"><i>Forf&aacute;s</i></P>

	<P>While I have no direct function in relation to the matter raised by the Deputy, I understand that the High Court appointed a provisional liquidator to the company concerned on the 23rd of March 2007. The liquidator is an officer of the Court and will report back to the Court. </P>
        <P>Under the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, liquidators have certain duties to report to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. For example, where a company is insolvent, liquidators are obliged to provide a report to the Director on the conduct of the company&rsquo;s directors. They are further obliged to make application to the High Court for the restriction of each of the company&rsquo;s directors unless specifically relieved of that obligation by the Director of Corporate Enforcement. The Director is independent in the performance of his statutory duties.</P>

	<P>My Department is required to relocate 250 posts to Carlow under the Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation Programme and this is planned to occur by the end of 2009.  </P>
        <P>In order to accommodate staff who wish to move earlier than the projected building completion date of late 2009, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, are progressing an earlier move to Carlow. The OPW have advised my Department that negotiations on the procurement of interim accommodation to facilitate an advance move are nearing completion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This advance move option will allow for the movement of approximately 100 decentralising staff to Carlow during the second quarter of 2007. I can confirm that the full complement of Clerical Officers required for the interim move in June 2007 has been selected in accordance with the decentralisation staffing protocols, as agreed by the Department of Finance and the staff unions. Under these protocols, Ms Carthy&rsquo;s seniority in the Clerical Officer grade was not sufficient to deem her eligible for selection as part of the advance party to Carlow.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that Ms Carthy will form part of the staffing complement required for the substantive move to Carlow scheduled to take place in 2009.</P>

	<P>The Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006-2013 contains a significant number of clear quantitative goals, progress towards attainment of which will be regularly tracked.  Notable examples of these include the commitment to double our annual output of Science, Engineering and Technology PhDs to 997 by 2013; to increase the annual output of Humanities and Social Sciences PhDs from 187 in 2003 to 315 by 2013; to grow the number of Principal Investigators by 350 by 2013 and postdoctoral researchers by 1,050; to grow annual Business Investment in R &amp; D by almost 150% to &euro;2.5bn by 2013; to grow the number of indigenous companies with R&amp;D activity over &euro;100,000 from 462 in 2003  to 1050 by 2013; to grow the number of indigenous companies with R&amp;D activity over &euro;2,000,000 from 21 in 2003  to 100 by 2013; to grow the number of foreign affiliate companies performing significant R&amp;D from 60 in 2003 to 150 by 2013.</P>
        <P>Progress against these headline indicators will be closely monitored by the Interdepartmental Committee on STI, chaired by my Department which reports to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation. I can assure the Deputy that a more comprehensive set of indicators for the measurement of the efficiency and effectiveness of our substantial investment under the Government&rsquo;s Strategy for Science Technology &amp; Innovation 2006-13 is currently being developed under the aegis of the Interdepartmental Committee.  This will address both the quantitative and qualitative goals of the Strategy.</P>
        <P>Within this overall approach, specific value for money reviews will also take place. This year specific reviews will be carried out on Science Foundation Ireland and the Discover Science and Engineering awareness programme.  The overall measurement process will also be informed by the Expenditure Review of Spending on Science &amp; Technology, which took place in 2004.</P>

	<P>The management of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s industrial property portfolio, including the purchase and disposal of property, is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency as part of the statutory responsibility assigned to it by the Oireachtas and not a matter in which I have a function.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by IDA Ireland that, in 1998, the Agency sold 1.3152 Hectares, on a leasehold basis, to Ballymote Community Enterprise Ltd.  In October, 2006 the Ballymote Community Enterprise Ltd. requested that IDA sell the freehold interest to them.</P>
        <P>IDA policy for land sales is to obtain market value when disposing of property assets and part of this process involves seeking an independent valuation by a national accredited valuer.  Accordingly, the Agency obtained a freehold valuation of these lands from Savills HOK and, on 27 March last, the Agency informed Ballymote Community Enterprise Ltd, through their solicitor, Johnson &amp; Johnson, of this valuation.  IDA Ireland is awaiting a reply from Ballymote Community Enterprise Ltd.</P>
        <P>The Agency has indicated to me that if the Community Enterprise is unhappy with the valuation quoted, they are welcome to seek their own valuation from valuers with nationwide valuation experience for comparison purposes and revert to IDA on the matter.</P>

	<P>I have recently announced the implementation of the all Ireland free travel scheme which commenced on 2 April and enables pensioners resident here and in Northern Ireland to travel free of charge on all eligible transport services on the island.  Implementation of a single travel pass for all-Ireland free travel, acceptable in both jurisdictions, will require the completion of the Integrated Ticketing project being developed under the auspices of the Department of Transport and subsequent integration with the ticketing systems in operation in Northern Ireland. My Department has on-going engagement with these bodies and projects. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Pending development of the integrated ticket system, my Department has engaged with the Department of Regional Development and Translink, the main transport authority in Northern Ireland, to put in place an interim scheme to permit senior residents of both jurisdictions to avail of free travel within the other jurisdiction.  As part of this scheme residents of this jurisdiction wishing to travel in the North will be required to use a travel card similar to smart pass as used by their Northern Ireland counterparts. Customers need to apply for the travel pass in person and to supply photographs for authentication at their local Social Welfare Office which is considered the most appropriate location for this service.  This is a once off transaction for customers availing of this scheme, but the level of applications will be kept under review to determine if there is a need at some future point to alter the policy.</P>

	<P>A special pension for the self-employed was introduced in 1999 to enable people who were over age 56 at the time of the introduction of PRSI for the self-employed in 1988, and who could not therefore meet the standard qualifying conditions, to receive a contributory pension. To qualify, a person must have been age 56 or over on 6 April 1988, started paying social insurance contributions as a self-employed person on or after this date and have at least 260 full-rate social insurance contributions paid on a <Col N="873"/>compulsory basis since first starting to pay social insurance contributions as a self-employed person. The personal rate and increases for a qualified adult and a qualified child are paid at 50% of the standard maximum rate.  I consider that the special arrangements introduced in 1999 are a reasonable response to the position in which those who qualify found themselves when they reached retirement and that the pension being paid represents good value for the contributions made.</P>

	<P>The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme which was introduced in, and took effect from, 1994.  Government policy in that, within the existing contributory and non-contributory pension system, as many people as possible qualify for payments in their own right.  In this regard measures have been taken over the last 10 years to provide pensions for people who did not qualify including the easing of qualifying conditions for contributory pensions, the introduction of special measures such as the pre-53 pension and improvements to the means test for non-contributory pensions.</P>
        <P>Many of those who were homemakers prior to 1994 are being paid as qualified adults on their spouses&rsquo; pension. Since 2002 it has been open to couples to opt for the qualified adult portion of the pension to be paid directly to the spouse or partner. The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007, provided that, from September, separate payments will be made generally in all cases unless the couple decide otherwise.  It is estimated that these changes will mean that an additional 4,000 spouses will receive separate payments each year.  Qualified adults who do not wish to receive a separate payment will continue to be facilitated.</P>
        <P>The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is being reviewed in the context of the forthcoming Green Paper on pensions.  Decisions in relation to the homemakers scheme, and the position of older people in general who do not at present qualify for any support under the social welfare pensions system, will be made in the context of the framework for long-term policy which will be developed after the publication of the Green Paper.</P>

	<P>I recently announced the arrangements for a new Rural Transport Programme (RTP). This new Programme builds on the success of the pilot Rural Transport Initiative (2000-2006) and puts it on a permanent mainstreamed basis. Thirty-four community transport groups throughout the country are currently being funded under the RTP to address the particular transport needs of their rural areas. Two of these groups &mdash; Bealach and the South East Galway RTI &mdash; are operational in County Galway.</P>
        <P>Pobal, which administers the Rural Transport Programme on behalf of my Department, will work closely with the existing groups to maximise the impact of the increased funding through, among other things, increased service provision and wider area coverage as well as ensuring continued value for money.</P>
        <P>The bottom-up approach in the pilot phase of the RTI demonstrated the effectiveness of the community and voluntary initiative and involvement in the provision of rural transport services. The new Rural Transport Programme will build on that concept. Consequently, the main drivers of community rural transport will be the local communities themselves. Therefore, existing rural transport groups proposing to expand their services or local community groups considering setting up of a new scheme should make contact with Pobal at Holbrook House, Holles Street, Dublin 2 (www.pobal.ie).</P>

That responsibility relates in particular to the speed at which vehicles are driven, even where the speed is less than the prevailing speed limit.</P>
        <P>The proposal presented in association with the Deputy&rsquo;s question will be considered by my Department in the context of the review of the Traffic Signs Manual, acting on the advice of the National Roads Authority and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

        <P>Kerry County Council held a plebiscite in October 2006 in the non-municipal town of An Daingean and subsequently made a submission to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government requesting that the Government make an Order under the Local Government Act 1946 to change the name of the town to Dingle Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is.  However, it is not within my power under the Official Languages Act to declare an English language or a bilingual placename as proposed in the question put to the local plebiscite and this was made clear to the County Council at all times.</P>

	<P>CL&Aacute;R provides 100% funding specifically for flashing amber safety lights at all primary schools in CL&Aacute;R areas that do not already have such lights.  This measure does not fund the installation of electronic speed limits signs.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department provides funding for a wide range of community projects, through a number of schemes and programmes. Each of the schemes and grant programmes operated by my Department are governed by rules and eligibility criteria, which projects have to meet in order to qualify for funding.</P>
        <P>With regard to the specific project referred to by the Deputy, elements of such a project may be eligible for funding under my Department&rsquo;s Programme of Grants for Locally Based Community and Voluntary Organisations, or the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme.  Detailed information in respect of these programmes can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.pobail.ie.</P>

	<P>I understand that the project the Deputy refers to relates to the development of facilities on an estate where the original house on the estate has been retained and restored.</P>
        <P>My Department has no funding available at present for such a project, however there may be funding available for rural tourism projects under the draft Rural Development Programme 2007-13, which is at present under discussion with the European Commission.

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payments Scheme National Reserve under Categories A and D.    Category A caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died prior to the 16 May, 2005 and who had leased out his/her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000 to 2002.</P>
        <P>Category D caters for farmers who inherited or purchased land and who commenced farming <Col N="941"/>after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.</P>
        <P>The person named has been deemed successful under both categories. However, it should be noted that the rules governing the Single Payment Scheme stipulate that an applicant who is found to be eligible under more than one category may only receive an allocation of entitlements under whichever category is most beneficial to him.</P>
        <P>In this instance Category D is more financially beneficial and an allocation has been made to the person named.  A formal letter outlining my Department&rsquo;s decision has also issued to him.</P>

	<P>Funding was allocated to the Life Centre, Pearse Square in December 2006 through the Fund for the Development of Targeted Educational Responses to Certain Children at Risk (CAR Fund) to provide a programme for young people between the ages of 12 and 16 who are out of the mainstream school system.</P>
        <P>The objective of the Fund is to develop preventative and supportive programmes, which are targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion. A key focus of the initiative is the empowerment of local communities to develop innovative and flexible programmes that address identified needs of intended participants.</P>
        <P>The Life Centre is also being supported by my Department through an annual allocation of VEC teaching hours. A review of allocations to VECs under the Co-Operation Hours with Other Institutions is currently being undertaken by my Department and the needs of the Life Centre will be considered in the context of this review.</P>
        <P>Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central to DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, which is being <Col N="942"/>implemented at present in 873 schools comprising 670 primary schools (338 urban/town schools and 332 rural schools) and 203 second-level schools. A key objective of this action plan is to enhance integration and partnership working, both within the education sector itself and between all other relevant Government departments, agencies, organisations and groups. Under DEIS, my Department, through the network of ten regional offices is enhancing its capacity to work in partnership with locally based agencies and individuals promoting social inclusion measures.</P>
        <P>Measures under DEIS range from pre-school interventions, supports for tackling children&rsquo;s literacy problems, reduced pupil teacher ratios, increased capitation grants, measures to tackle early school leaving and strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community.</P>
        <P>A key component of my Department&rsquo;s strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving is the School Completion Programme. This programme was implemented to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and in line with current thinking favours an integrated cross-community and cross-sectoral approach based on the development of local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people aged 4-18, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. The programme is funded on a multi-annual basis under the National Development Plan (NDP) with assistance from the European Social Fund (ESF).</P>
        <P>Increased access will be provided to the inner city second level and urban/town primary schools in the School Support Programme to provide a range of academic and non-academic supports based in-school, after school, out-of-school and during holiday time, based on best practices identified through the School Completion Programme (SCP).</P>

        <Quest> if a decision has been made on staffing numbers for 2007 and 2008 for a school (details supplied) in a disadvantaged area of County Tipperary; and if she will ensure that there will be no reduction to the staffing levels at the school. </Quest>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by <Col N="943"/>reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</P>
        <P>Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2005 was 85 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0023/2006), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006/07 school year is a Principal and 3 mainstream class teachers. The school is also the base school for 1 Schools Support Programme Rural Co-Ordinator which is shared with 4 other schools.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 73 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which will be issued to all primary schools shortly, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 2 mainstream class teachers. The school will also be the base school for 1 Schools Support Programme Rural Co-Ordinator which is shared with 4 other schools.</P>
        <P>Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Hard copies of this circular will issue to primary schools as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that the first meeting of the Appeal Board will be held in May, 2007. Further meetings will be held in July and October, 2007. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 11 May, 22 June and 12 October respectively.</P>
        <P>Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application <Col N="944"/>form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent Appeal Board.</P>

	<P>The Higher Education &amp; Training Awards Council (HETAC) is to decentralise to Edenderry. The overall number of posts involved is in the region of 32.  HETAC has produced an implementation report for the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) and recruitment takes place on the basis that the body will decentralise.</P><Col N="945"/>
        <P>I understand that OPW has acquired a site for the proposed decentralisation to Edenderry which includes HETAC.</P>
        <P>HETAC is a public service body rather than a civil body service body. Most of the staff employed in such bodies are not civil servants. In their most recent report to the Minister for Finance the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) outline the issues facing bodies in making arrangements for the deployment in Dublin for those members of staff who do not wish to decentralise. The DIG states in its report that it is of the view that resolution of this issue &ldquo;is central to the overall implementation process in the State Agencies&rdquo;. The DIG also states in the report that it has requested the Department of Finance to pursue directly with ICTU proposals for getting central discussions underway on the full range of industrial relations issues relating to the decentralisation of State agencies.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, icluding those with autism, receive an education appropriate to their needs, preferably through the primary and post primary school network.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools, a view that is supported by the findings of the Task Force Report on Autism. My Department supports a multi-skills approach in regard to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods are available e.g. Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), ABA (Applied Behavioural Analysis), Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).</P>
        <P>In this regard my Department has established:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />186 special classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools;</P>
   <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />5 special classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />18 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum;</P><Col N="946"/>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />14 Stand alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodologies on a pilot basis &mdash; 2 of these facilities have yet to be established.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">Estimated costs associated with the provision of applied behavioural analysis would be subject to the particular circumstances involved.   However, the critical determinant of the preferred approach outlined above is its capacity to meet the needs of all the children attending the school rather than cost.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 to 248, inclusive, 250 and 251 together.</P>
        <P>A decision was taken by the Trustees of the school to which the Deputy refers that it will close in June 2007.  This decision was taken because, in line with demographic changes in the area, the school has experienced a steady decline in enrolments in recent years.</P>
        <P>Current enrolments in feeder primary schools indicate that this decline will continue. In fact, a general decline in enrolments in the area where the school is located has resulted in considerable spare capacity at post primary level.  Coupled with the decline in enrolments, the Department was also concerned about the ability of the school in question to offer a broad and balanced curriculum given the relatively small number of pupils enrolled.</P>
        <P>In all of the circumstances, at its meetings with the Trustees, the Department concurred with the Trustees decision to close the school.  In line with the correct protocol, it is a matter for the Trustees to follow through the relevant issues with its Board of Management and parent body.</P>
        <P>When it closes, ownership of the school property, which is currently vested in the trustees, will revert to the Department. In the period leading up to the closure, the Department will consider all available options with regard to its future use, including the sports hall.</P>
        <P>Given the extent of spare capacity at post primary level in the general area, the Department does not envisage any difficulty in the residue of <Col N="949"/>pupils securing alternative places. Normally a closing school assists its pupils to secure places in the event of any difficulty arising.</P>
        <P>In relation to the responsibility for records management and data protection within a school, this lies with the Board of Management of the school in accordance with legislation governing the National Archives and Data Protection.  School records including registers, roll books, daily report books are not Departmental records and as such are the sole responsibility of the Board of Management of the school.  Records which need to be kept may be sent by the school to the National Archives.  As schools keep records of personal data for pupils and staff, they must comply with the Data Protection Legislation. An advisory notice was sent to schools by the Department in 2003 reminding them of their obligations under the Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2003 and advising that a written data protection policy be put in place.  &ldquo;A Guide for Data Controllers&rdquo;, issued by the Data Protection Commissioner which sets out the requirements for data controllers, was sent to schools with this advisory notice.  Records of staff employed by the school that are paid by the Department are held in the Department for a period not exceeding 80 years.  This is to facilitate the calculation of salary for pension purposes.</P>
        <P>With regard to the computers themselves, if these were supplied by the Department, then they remain Department property to be used as the Department determines.  If they were supplied by local fundraising then the Board of Management can determine what to do with them.</P>
        <P>In relation to a refund of monies to the Trustees, it is unclear what type of payments the Deputy might have in mind, however, I can confirm the question has not arisen in the Department.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the terms of Towards 2016, my Department is actively engaged with the education partners to agree new arrangements in relation to the redeployment of teachers.  The new arrangements will provide for redeployment of all teachers within an agreed dis<Col N="950"/>tance on terms to be agreed. When the Department sought to include this matter in Towards 2016 it was particularly mindful of the situation of teacher&rsquo;s in schools like the one in question where no redeployment scheme existed. Under Towards 2016 it has been agreed with the teacher unions that the operation of the revised arrangements will ensure that all teachers who are surplus because of school closure as in the case of the school referred to by the Deputy are redeployed to meet the subject/course requirements of other schools. The timeline set in the agreement for conclusion of the discussions was deliberately aimed at ensuring that a new redeployment scheme would be in place this year. Intensive discussions are continuing with the teacher unions to that end. In addition to this, as an exceptional matter in the current year, staff in the school referred to by the Deputy have been given the option to apply for early retirement and a number of teachers have made such an application.  These applications are currently being considered in my Department.</P>

	<P>Under DEIS, (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, which is currently being implemented by my Department, 80 additional posts have been allocated in order to extend Home School Community Liaison services to all 338 urban/town primary and 203 second level schools participating in DEIS that do not currently have a HSCL service, in addition to the 370 local coordinators already in place.  To facilitate local HSCL co-ordinators working with the families of disadvantaged children, for the first time posts are being shared across the two sectors &mdash; primary and post-primary level. I have also given a commitment to schools not selected to participate in DEIS but already in the HSCL Scheme, that they will continue to receive HSCL services after 2006/2007.  HSCL services will be provided to some 652 schools in total (282 second level and 370 primary schools) for the duration of the DEIS Action Plan.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year. Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2005 was 83 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0023/2006), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006/07 school year is a Principal and 3 mainstream class teachers.  The school in question is currently the base school for two shared learning support/resource teacher (LS/RT) posts. According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2006 was 72 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which will be issued to all primary schools shortly, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 2 mainstream class teachers. The school in question is currently the base school for two shared learning support/resource teacher (LS/RT) posts. One of these posts was allocated under the general allocation system and this post will remain unchanged for the 2007/2008 school year. The second post may remain in the school for the 2007/2008 school year if there are sufficient hours in the school(s) to warrant its retention, based on the criteria outlined in my Department&rsquo;s circular 0036/2006. </P>
        <P>A circular will issue to all primary schools shortly in relation to LS/RT arrangements for the 2007/2008 school year. Schools will be required, where appropriate, to submit the necessary information to my Department in relation to their position for September 2007 and when this information is received from the school in question, the matter will be considered further. Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected <Col N="953"/>enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn. It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Hard copies of this circular will issue to primary schools as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that the first meeting of the Appeal Board will be held in May, 2007. Further meetings will be held in July and October, 2007. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 11 May, 22 June and 12 October respectively. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department&rsquo;s website. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent Appeal Board.</P>

	<P>The school referred to by the Deputy applied and was approved for funding under the devolved Permanent Accommodation Scheme for 2007.  The Permanent Accommodation Scheme (PAS) was originally introduced in 2003 <Col N="954"/>on a pilot basis and due to the positive feedback from schools was extended to cover more schools in subsequent years.</P>
        <P>The Scheme is not structured on the basis that the Department funding must be supplemented by local fundraising. It does however allow a school to supplement the funding from local resources if they so wish. Clearly where a school has a known level of resources apart from the Department funding or knows its capacity to raise additional resources it is open to that school to extend the scope of works to include additional facilities.  A school does not have to accept the invitation to participate in a devolved scheme and instead be considered for inclusion in the mainstream school building programme in line with the project&rsquo;s priority band rating.</P>
        <P>I increased funding for the PAS in 2006 by an average of 20%. This increase follows-on from an increase of up to 25% in 2005.  The feedback has in general been very positive, the number of schools participating has increased year on year and many schools are anxious to be included. In order to maintain this momentum I approved over 140 additional schools to participate in this scheme in 2007.</P>
        <P>The school has very recently forwarded correspondence to the School Building Section of my Department regarding increased funding for the project. The matter will be reviewed and a decision will be conveyed to school management as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 to 265, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. The Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with Section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission of a pupil to the school.</P>
        <P>Currently, under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of this Department. Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and where an appeal is upheld the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.  Otherwise, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that there is considerable pressure for school places in the Dublin 15 area in general.   Adding to this pressure is the fact that a number of parents have enrolled their children in more than one school.  This has the result of inflating the number of children apparently seeking places.  Officials in School Planning Section of my Department are constantly liaising with school principals in the area with a view to ensuring that all eligible pupils seeking places for 2007 will have access to them.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My Department has provided a range of supports and guidance to schools in the implementation of child protection policy.  Child protection guidelines and procedures, based on Children First &ndash; the Department of Health &amp; Children&rsquo;s national guidelines, have been issued to all primary and post-primary schools. These guidelines make very clear the reporting and investigation mechanisms to be followed in cases of suspected child abuse wherever they occur and the lead role of the HSE in dealing with such cases. The Department has provided an extensive in-service training programme for school principals and teachers to assist them in dealing with child protection issues and in implementing these guidelines. An area of my Department&rsquo;s website (www.education.ie) has been specifically designated to the subject of child protection.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</P>
        <P>Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2005 was 116 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0023/2006), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006/07 school year is a Principal and 4 mainstream class teachers.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 109 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which will be issued to all primary schools shortly, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 3 mainstream class teachers.</P>
        <P>Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) <Col N="960"/>which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Hard copies of this circular will issue to primary schools as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that the first meeting of the Appeal Board will be held in May 2007. Further meetings will be held in July and October 2007. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 11 May, 22 June and 12 October respectively. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent Appeal Board.</P>

        <QRef>[13334/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the document referred to by the Deputy. My commitment and that of this Government to ongoing improvements in higher education is clearly demonstrated by a range of policy developments and funding programmes, including those which encourage wider access to further and third level education.</P>
        <P>Higher education in Ireland has come through a period of major expansion. Almost 45,000 new third level places have been created since this Government took Office in 1997 and there are now some 168,000 students in the system. The most recent participation study confirms the continuing trend. It shows that the national admission rate was 55% in 2004 &ndash; up from 44% in 1998. Overall investment in the sector on a per annum basis has more than doubled over that period. This stands at some &euro;1.9 billion for the current year.</P>
        <P>There are clear indications that the increased investment of resources in this area over the last decade and more is now paying dividends and that targets for participation in higher education that were set in the 2001 Report of the Action Group on Access to Higher Education and the last National Development Plan 2000-2006 have been reached. For example, participation by <Col N="961"/>mature entrants to full-time higher education has grown from 4.5% in 1998 to almost 10% in 2006.  Surveys conducted by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) also indicate that access to higher education by young people from under-represented socio-economic groups continues to improve. For example, in 2004, between 33% and 40% of young people nationally from the semi-skilled and unskilled socio-economic groups went on to study in higher education compared to only 23% in 1998. New targets for participation will be developed in 2007, linked to the implementation of the National Development Plan 2007-2013.</P>
        <P>Major improvements have been made by this Government in both the income limits for eligibility and the actual grant levels for third level student support. This includes the introduction of the special rate of maintenance grant. The higher rate of this grant is now at a record level of nearly &euro;6,000 for the 2006/07 academic year &mdash; compared to just over &euro;2,000 in 1996/97. The allocation for student support schemes in this current year is in excess of &euro;241m.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may already be aware, I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students in higher education which will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administrative system. The scheme, which will be underpinned by a new Student Support Bill, will facilitate consistency of application, improved client accessibility and ensure timely delivery of grants to those who need them most. The Student Support Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation. This, together with my commitment to ongoing improvements in the student support schemes, including increasing the rates of grant and the income limits for eligibility as resources permit, will continue to build on our achievements in this area.</P>
        <P>With regard to higher education infrastructure, the NDP 2007-2013 provides for an investment of &euro;1.975 billion in modernising campus facilities. This level of investment reflects the significance the Government attaches to infrastructure requirements in the sector. In relation to student accommodation, a special tax incentive was introduced to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in Section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999.  The purpose of the relief was to increase the supply of quality accommodation for third level students. The scheme has been very successful in this respect.  According to the Indecon Report on the Review of Property-based Tax Incentive Schemes published by the Department of Finance in February 2006, concerns now exist about over-supply of accommodation in the student accommodation sector.</P>
        <P>Having regard to developments in the PLC sector, including the McIver Report, negotiations are currently ongoing between the management <Col N="962"/>and the unions. Concrete prioritised proposals in relation to PLC provision and focused in particular on the larger providers are currently being prepared. Provision has been included in the 2007 estimates for this purpose. It is important to emphasise that the arrangements for the PLC sector will be determined in the light of resources available and the implications for other areas of education. Further negotiations have been arranged for after Easter. All parties continue to be positively engaged in the process.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 272 and 273 together.</P>
        <P>The Boards of Management of primary schools are required to comply with The Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure which are revised periodically and agreed through discussions involving representatives of the primary management bodies, the INTO and the National Parents Council &mdash; Primary and my Department. Those procedures require each board to put in place comprehensive insurance cover to safeguard the school, the Board and the Trustees.</P>
        <P>While members of Boards have a corporate responsibility to ensure that procedures are in place within the school to keep their pupils safe, they are not personally liable for claims against the school. The Education Act specifically protects individual members from being sued. My Department has confirmed with the primary management bodies that the schools that they represent have appropriate insurance cover. In addition, the head of the Catholic Primary School Managers Association has also publicly reassured board members that they are protected by insurance.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Vocational Educational Committees taking over the running of primary schools, I announced on the 17 February 2007, that a new additional model of Primary school patronage would be introduced on a pilot basis at a school to be built in Diswellstown, Co Dublin. This model will provide an additional patronage option and is not intended to serve as a replacement of the existing patron models.  My Department has begun a process of consultation with the relevant education partners to explore the detailed implementation measures that will be needed to be put in place prior to the opening of the proposed new school.</P>

	<P>I can confirm to the Deputy that the school to which he refers applied to the Department for additional accommodation under the Permanent Accommodation Scheme for 2007.  Given the type and extent of accommodation required, it was agreed with the school authority <Col N="964"/>that the scope of its project was not suitable for consideration under this Scheme.  The project is now being considered for progress by the traditional method of delivery under the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  In the meantime, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that approval has been given for a temporary classroom to meet the schools immediate needs.</P>

        <?oasys _cl11.9- ?><P FLI="0">The Irish Red Cross Society is not a State Board but a charitable autonomous body run by the Central Council through its Executive Commit<Col N="965"/>tee.  The Central Council of the Irish Red Cross Society consists of members elected by the various Society Areas throughout the country and of members nominated by Government.  It is statutorily prescribed that not less than one third of the total membership of the Central Council of the Red Cross Society are nominated by the Government to serve for a three year period.  The period covered by the question encompasses 3 such periods.</P>
        <P>For the period ended 30/4/03, the Government nominated 17 members to the Central Council (13 Male, 4 Female).  For the period ended 30/4/06, the Government nominated 17 members to the Central Council (11 Male, 6 Female). For the period ending 30/4/09, the Government nominated 17 members to the Central Council (10 Male, 7 Female). A Male member subsequently resigned on 7 December 2006 and was replaced by a Female member on 31 January 2007 making the current gender breakdown of the Government Nominees to the Central Council 9 Males &amp; 8 Females.</P>

	<P>In July 2004, the Government approved reduced fees for all legal <Col N="966"/>representation at Tribunals established from September 2004, and for existing Tribunals that ran over various termination dates set in the light of consultations between the Attorney General and the relevant Chairpersons.  The completion date agreed in respect of the Planning Tribunal was 31 March 2007.</P>
        <P>In December 2006, the Chairman of the Planning Tribunal, on his own initiative, wrote to me to the effect that:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Tribunal&rsquo;s public hearings would not be completed by 31 March 2007 principally due to a number of legal challenges which had delayed the work of the Tribunal;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />it was now anticipated that public hearings in relation to the remaining modules which the Tribunal intends to conduct will extend until the end of 2007 and possibly into the first months of 2008; and</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />requesting that the existing fee scales for its internal legal team would continue to apply for 2007.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In the course of subsequent correspondence, a meeting I had with the Chairman on 6 March, and a meeting of officials and Tribunal staff on 12 March, the Tribunal provided further information on the timescale and projected costs of its remaining work.  At its meeting on 27 March, Government noted the information provided, agreed that my consultations with the Tribunal would continue and that in the meantime, the existing rates for the Tribunal&rsquo;s legal team would continue to apply.</P>

	<P>Some &euro;2.54 billion was provided in both current and capital funding by my Department for local authority services and capital programmes in 2006. Of this a net sum of &euro;7 million was not drawn down by the end of the year: this has been included in the Department&rsquo;s overall capital carryover of &euro;20 million into 2007 under the Multi-Annual Capital Investment Framework. It is not administratively feasible to disaggregate the underspend of &euro;7 million to specific projects or to individual local authorities.</P>

        <Quest> if the report on Guidelines for Local Authorities on Minimising the Risk of Cryptosporidium in Water Supplies dating from 1998 is generally available; if it has been updated; if it is based on current standard European Union standards; if reports on its implementation have been regularly transmitted to his Department from local authorities; and if, in view of the situation which Galway faces he will provide an urgent reply. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1998, my Department circulated detailed guidelines to local authorities on minimising the risk of cryptosporidium in water supplies.  The guidelines were prepared in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the Environmental Protection Agency and circulated to local authorities.   They provided advice to local authorities on preventing cryptosporidium entering water supply systems and covered all aspects of water supply management, including source protection, monitoring, treatment processes, storage and distribution as well as responding to an outbreak.</P><Col N="972"/>
        <P>In September 2004, the EPA produced a handbook for local authorities on implementation of the Drinking Water Regulations 2000.  This updated and elaborated on the Department&rsquo;s earlier guidelines by including a cryptosporidium risk assessment methodology and further guidance on monitoring for cryptosporidium in light of the outcome of individual risk assessments.  In November 2004, the National Disease Surveillance Centre (now the Health Protection Surveillance Centre) also published a report on waterborne cryptosporidiosis.</P>
        <P>The handbook and report were circulated by the EPA to all local authorities who were requested to prepare risk assessments for each water source and supply, using the updated methodology and are available on the EPA website.  Almost 400 such risk assessments were carried out and transmitted to the EPA.</P>
        <P>The above guidance documents set out best practice in relation to the management of cryptosporidium.  EU requirements in relation to the monitoring of drinking water for clostridium perfringens &ndash; an indicator of possible cryptosporidium contamination &ndash; are set out in the EU Drinking Water Directive 98/83/EC of 3 November 1998, which was given effect in Irish law by the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations, 2000.  These Regulations were replaced and updated by the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations, 2007 that I brought into force on 8 March last.  The 2007 Regulations give the Environmental Protection Agency additional supervisory and enforcement powers in relation to monitoring and standards of all water supplies.  The Agency now has powers to ensure that any failure to comply with quality standards is immediately investigated and that an appropriate remedial action plan is put in place and implemented.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 and 284 together.</P>
        <P>The Galway City Water Supply Scheme was included in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2002 &ndash; 2004, published on 16 April 2002, as a scheme to advance through planning.  The scheme has retained its approved status in subsequent iterations of the Programme. These were published on 13 August 2003, 7 May 2004 and 16 December 2005. My Department is awaiting the submission of a Brief by the City Council for the appointment of consultants<?oasys _jy ?>to prepare a Preliminary Report for the<?oasys _jy ?>scheme.</P>
        <P>I visited Galway last Friday to meet the local authorities and the Health Services Executive and to assist in promoting the earliest possible solution to the current difficulties.   As a result, a range of short, medium and longer term measures have been agreed with a view to satisfactory drinking water supplies being restored as soon as possible. It was agreed that the two local authorities would work to reduce the impact on householders arising from the current problems. I have also offered Government logistical assistance to the Council if this is required.</P>
        <P>In particular, these measures include an increased supply from the Tuam Regional Scheme which will allow the old Terryland plant to be decommissioned; the installation of an interim package treatment plant and the completion of the substantive upgrading project in Terryland.  Appropriate resources, including over &euro;48m in capital funding, have been pledged for this purpose.</P>

	<P>Management of their public drinking water supplies is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.  The results of monitoring of individual water supplies are forwarded by local authorities to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on being required to do so by the Agency under section 58 <Col N="974"/>of the Environmental Protection Act 1992.  Information on the quality of drinking water supplies is included in a report prepared annually by the EPA.  The latest relevant EPA report The Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland &mdash; A Report for the Year 2005 is available in the Oireachtas Library. </P>
