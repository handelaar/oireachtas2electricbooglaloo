      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 32.  I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  As Deputy Bannon is not present, I call Deputy Byrne.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the imminent withdrawal of methadone provision by pharmacies which will result in a crisis for almost 5,000 recovering addicts and their families throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the threatened withdrawal of pharmacies from the methadone scheme on Monday next and the withdrawal of all GMS services to elderly and vulnerable pensioners from 1 December; I ask the Minister to intervene by calling for an independent impact assessment and I call on the Irish Pharmaceutical Union to withdraw its threat of action and on the HSE to defer the proposed changes pending the outcome of that assessment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the decision of the HSE to withdraw funding for new bed facilities at the Hamilton Park Nursing Home in Balrothery, Balbriggan, on 3 October last, when citizens, including a senior constituent who is a stroke patient and currently in the National Rehabilitation Hospital, have been arbitrarily deprived of much-needed care and treatment at the Balrothery nursing home; and if the Minister will make a statement on this and other arbitrary health cuts by HSE senior management.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the continuing damaging impact of cuts imposed by the Health Service Executive including the freezing of funding for community care packages, resulting in hospitals being unable to discharge patients and a consequent inability to admit patients as in the case of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</P>

	<P>It is not on the list.  I will check with my office regarding the time at which the matter was submitted.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 11, statements on the establishment of committees, and No. 3, Fines Bill 2007 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 11 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply: the statements of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the statements of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="771"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one proposal to put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 11 agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>My party has long held the view that victims of crime should be given full information in respect of cases as they proceed.  In light of the comments of Mr. Justice Carney in respect of a particular case, will the T&aacute;naiste indicate if any legislative change is envisaged in order to ensure that the victims of crime will be kept fully apprised of the progress of cases?  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, in a number of sexual abuse cases, victims were informed by their abusers that those cases might not proceed to court or that the DPP might not be taking them forward.  Has the Government decided to react to Mr. Justice Carney&rsquo;s comments by instigating a legislative change which would ensure that victims will be kept fully apprised of the facts relating to cases as they proceed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is normal practice that we do not make comments in the House in respect of members of the Judiciary.  However, the T&aacute;naiste may reply to the question on legislative change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it, legislative change is not being advocated in respect of the lecture given last evening in Cork.  The subject of the lecture was the issue of procedures within the court system.  Such procedures are, in all circumstances, a matter for the courts.  We should maintain the separation of powers between the Legislature and the Judiciary as regards the internal workings of the courts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the T&aacute;naiste aware that unless action is taken quite soon, it is likely that the entire Aer Lingus fleet will be grounded in the next week or so as a result of the threat by management to lock the pilots out?  We may find ourselves in a position where not only are there no services out of Shannon, there might be no services out of Ireland.  In light of the gravity of the situation, has the Government considered asking the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to use section 38 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, which was introduced &mdash; in a previous capacity &mdash; by the Taoiseach to allow the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission or some other body or person to bring the two parties together?  Does the T&aacute;naiste agree it is time to knock heads together before Aer Lingus passengers suffer and damage is done to the country&rsquo;s reputation as a place to do business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not strictly within the limits of the Order of Business.  We are confined to asking questions about either promised debates or promised legislation.  Does the T&aacute;naiste wish to comment?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="772"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I only wish to say that the Taoiseach addressed this matter in the House last Tuesday when the leader of Deputy Burton&rsquo;s party asked this question.  He was of the view that it should be possible for both parties to come together and try to resolve whatever differences exist between them in the interests of proceeding in an orderly fashion.  Obviously, the industrial relations machinery remains available at all times to parties who are finding difficulties in resolving disputes to seek its assistance where that is required or appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that things have moved on in this dispute since the Taoiseach spoke earlier in the week, that we are now effectively facing a management lock-out of the pilots and that some efforts should be made to bring the parties together before serious damage is done to the economy, passengers and our reputation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton might think of another way of raising this issue during the course of the day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste agree to a debate in the House on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business has been set.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Order of Business has been set for today by the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has signalled its intent to set aside the funding provisions contained in the equal opportunities child care programme for community-provided child care services, which will have a clear effect, particularly in the area of low-income families and those already struggling to meet demands.  There is legislation promised in the Government&rsquo;s programme of legislation that is intended to address low-income families in particular and those receiving lone parent payments.  I am speaking specifically about the social welfare lone parent and other low income families reform Bill.  In light of what is now signalled and its intended implementation in 2008, is there any prospect of the Government bringing forward that legislation that can address some of those who will be directly affected, although I emphasise clearly that not everyone will be affected?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill referred to by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is to give effect to the proposals arising from the Government&rsquo;s discussion paper, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents, which will provide for the introduction of a new means-tested payment for lone parents and other families on low incomes and will replace the one-parent family payment.  That is not due for publication until next year.  The Minister of State at <Col N="773"/>the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brendan Smith, continues to discharge his responsibilities in respect of the child care issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the recent report by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which is a prestigious committee of the Council of Europe, and considering that this is the third successive occasion over the last six years or so that the same committee has condemned the conditions in Irish prisons and a number of Garda stations and that three prisons &mdash; Mountjoy Prison, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and Limerick Prison &mdash; were not fit for human accommodation, how does the Government intend to respond to these infringements in terms of human rights and rehabilitation?  Does the Government intend to put the Prison Service on a statutory footing so we can have some accountability in the area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there promised legislation in that area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am not aware of any promised legislation.  In his response to that report, the chief executive of the Prison Service pointed out during the course of the week that it is intended by the end of 2010 with the capital programme in place to address some of the issues which have been raised perennially and which are historic features of the prison system.  There is a significant capital programme under way in that respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the many difficulties families and individuals find themselves in regarding nursing home care and its cost, will the T&aacute;naiste advise us as to when the Nursing Home Support Scheme Bill will be dealt with in this House?</P>
        <P>In light of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and bluetongue virus in the UK, is there any indication when there will be a full discussion in this House of animal health issues under the Animal Health Bill?</P>
        <P>In respect of the Health (Provision of Information) Bill, many people lack information on the current situation in respect of MRSA.  This Bill might clarify that situation and help to bring it to a head.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three pieces of legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I understand the first piece of legislation will be taken in the House during this session, while the second and third pieces of legislation referred to by the Deputy are due for next year.  I am sure there will be other opportunities in the meantime to discuss the state of agriculture in respect of the Estimates over the coming weeks.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="774"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste make available time next week in the House to discuss two reports published this morning which are a damning indictment of the Government&rsquo;s failure to provide adequate child care supports and facilities?  One report was produced by the Health Information and Quality Authority, while the other was commissioned by the Office of the Minister for Children.  The first report says that over 100 children, who would be better cared for through fosterage, are in residential care due to the mismanagement of the HSE.  The second report says there are no real services available to provide assistance to children who are the victims of domestic violence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is a debate promised on either of those matters?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Discussion of any of these reports is a matter for the Whips.  In respect of fosterage, there has been a significant investment by the Government in making this more widely available as an option for troubled children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of that, is the T&aacute;naiste not aware that this report says there are over 100 children under 12 years of age inappropriately living in residential care due to the negligence and failure of the management within the HSE?  That is a serious issue and discussion of the possible constitutional amendments relating to children&rsquo;s rights should not distract from the Government&rsquo;s basic obligation to provide essential children&rsquo;s services.  It is a disgrace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the T&aacute;naiste consider a Supplementary Estimate for the HSE and the Department of Health and Children, even at this late stage?  He made a decision a few months ago in respect of the budget for 2008 as he was trying to run a tight ship, which is having a huge impact on all our constituents.  Virtually everyone in the Chamber has heard about very serious cases involving stroke patients and other people with serious illnesses who do not have facilities because of a decision this Minister took a few months ago.  He is changing the Estimates system, perhaps correctly, so we can have a proper discussion of, for example, the Estimate for 2009 next year.  I presume that is what the T&aacute;naiste means.  Is it not time, even at this late stage in this term, to consider some sort of Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Health and Children?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is a Supplementary Estimate promised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to speak on the same issue.  I also wish to speak on another issue, although I am not sure if I can raise it now or later.  I called last week for a Supplementary Esti<Col N="775"/>mate in respect of this issue.  Every day, we receive new information&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot deal with it now.  It is either promised or not promised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Rehabilitation Hospital cannot take in new patients because it cannot discharge patients.  It is an extremely serious issue.  The HSE is very new.  There is a strong case to be made for&mdash;&mdash;  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Deputy would use another method and put down a Special Notice Question if it is that important but we cannot debate it now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>We need an answer from the Minister for Finance because patients are suffering on a daily basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no Supplementary Estimate promised.  The point to be made about all this is that, in the context of resource allocation and reform of the health services, if we want to have sustainable improvements, we must work within the budgetary guidelines we have.  If we do not do so, given the economic scenario of the next few years, we will put at risk many of the real improvements that have been made in the last decade and which can be sustained if we manage the situation properly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Reform the administration.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there any such promised legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>To be frank, I have no idea how it will be dealt with.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>

	<P>It will be in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I can see the Minister is anxious to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</P>
        <P>In view of the seriousness of the crime situation and the vagueness of the proposals in the criminal justice (money laundering) Bill, will it be brought forward as a matter of urgency instead of being published next year?  Will the Bill be affected by the Government&rsquo;s proposal to opt out of certain provisions of the proposed EU reform treaty?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 18 Bills on the Order Paper, some of which will be dealt with in this session and others which will be published.  The Bill in question will be published some time next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the opt-out from certain EU provisions in the proposed reform treaty?  Will it affect this Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware that the money laundering Bill has any relevance to that particular matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the student support Bill, this morning over 2,000 students received notification of an upgrade of their leaving certificate results.  This has serious consequences for those students and their places on third level courses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question relevant to the Order of Business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Will the Minister review the current system whereby one in five students&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>All week I have been attempting to get a matter raised on the Adjourn<Col N="777"/>ment concerning community pharmacists.  It was ruled out again this morning.  I want to raise it under the pharmacy No. 2 Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps today would be a good day for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue concerns a unilateral decision by the HSE which is threatening pharmacy services to medical card patients.  Has the Minister any comments to make on the issue?  They are threatening to withdraw services&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate to the Order of Business but there are other ways in which it can be raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The pharmacy No. 2 Bill proposes to implement the pharmacy review group&rsquo;s recommendations.  Unilateral decisions, without any negotiations with representatives of the pharmacists, should be a matter of concern to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>I am trying to establish which Minister is responsible for inland fisheries.  Originally, I believed it was the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy John Browne.  I now understand it is Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Is that the case and, if so, why is he responsible for inland fisheries?</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Having been Chief Whip for the past three years, I am a firm believer in the value of the committee system to the workings of the Oireachtas.  I believe it is an excellent committee system, of which all Members can be proud.  However, we need to build on and strengthen our system, a view shared in this House.</P>
        <P>In the early 1990s, the then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, introduced the new committee system which has evolved over time into a <Col N="779"/>dynamic structure of sectoral committees and which has proved a great asset to democracy.  At the time, he said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The new committee system being introduced is probably the greatest single change in the way the House conducts its business since the foundation of the State.  The potential for each Deputy to influence legislation and spending by Departments should not be underestimated.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Committees now constitute a major part of the Oireachtas framework.  The structure of the existing system allows for a more flexible and transparent approach to scrutiny outside of the more formal platforms of the D&aacute;il and Seanad Chambers.  Members of committees avail of the opportunity the system gives to engage publicly on many issues.  It also offers the opportunity to improve access by the public to the Houses and their committees, as we all have observed through the hearing of evidence and presentations from witnesses.</P>
        <P>To take one example of how committees have helped shape public policy, I point to the work of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution in the run up to the referendum on the right to life of the unborn.  Debates on this issue previously had been characterised by bitterness and divisiveness.  However, as a result of the committee&rsquo;s intervention, a public platform was provided, where all opinions were expressed in a calm, professional environment.  The ensuing debate was grounded on a more rounded view of the issues and a greater appreciation of the concerns of the various interests taking part.</P>
        <P>A further example of the impact of a vigorous committee in action was the follow-up to the DIRT inquiry by the Committee of Public Accounts.  In that regard I pay tribute to the late Mr. Jim Mitchell who was a driving force in that inquiry and in following up the implementation of the many recommendations that followed.  Many of those recommendations have had a lasting influence on how we conduct business today, not least of which was the establishment of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Committees are an invaluable tool for the Houses of the Oireachtas and the scale of their role can be seen from the fact that, last year alone, there were 531 committee meetings, 191 reports were published and 1,215 witnesses gave evidence.  Committees sit more hours than the D&aacute;il and Seanad put together.</P>
        <P>Informed by today&rsquo;s statements, I intend to move as soon as possible to put down the resolutions re-establishing the sectoral committees and the standing committees so that their work can resume.</P>
     
        <P>In addition to the sectoral and standing committees in the previous D&aacute;il, the Government proposes a new committee on the constitutional amendment regarding children.  The Committee <Col N="780"/>on Children will be addressed later by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, who has been developing proposals in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on the Constitution is to formally become a Joint Committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and there is to be an amalgamation of the Joint Services Committee and Members Services Committee, to be known as the Joint Administration Committee.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to establish a Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  This is a reflection of the transformed political context on the island of Ireland following the successful restoration of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement earlier this year.  As I have indicated, I believe an excellent system is already in place.  However, there is always room for improvement, and following recent consultations I am happy to announce the strengthening and enhancement of the committee system as follows.</P>
        <P>I will deal first with parliamentary scrutiny of EU legislative proposals and the oversight role.  Further enhancements are proposed for the Sub-Committee an EU Scrutiny and more direct engagement with committees on EU related matters.  National Parliaments can only have an effective influence on EU policy if they scrutinise and react to EU proposals at the earliest possible stage in the policymaking process.  Therefore a timely, efficient and co-ordinated system of EU scrutiny is desirable.</P>
        <P>Co-operation between the Government and the Joint Committee on European Affairs on matters relating to EU scrutiny ensures timely availability of EU proposals and other relevant information to the committee.  However, as was highlighted in its last annual report, the increasing volume of legislative proposals emanating from the EU institutions has placed a considerable burden on the committee and the sectoral committees in carrying out EU scrutiny work.  Additional staffing, training and advisory supports will be put in place within the committee secretariat to assist the Joint Committee on European Affairs, its Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny and the sectoral committees to achieve and maintain the highest standards in quantity, quality and timeliness of their scrutiny and oversight of EU policymaking in Ireland and in Europe.  In this regard, the Joint Committee on European Affairs will have a stronger co-ordinating and facilitating role in the scrutiny of proposals which have been referred to sectoral committees for detailed scrutiny.</P>
        <P>The Sub-Committee on EU Scrutiny will have the power to report directly to the D&aacute;il and Seanad on the outcomes of oversight and scrutiny.  It is anticipated that there will be more meaningful committee engagement with Ministers, Department officials and wider interest groups.  The consequent benefits should raise public awareness of ongoing European issues and <Col N="781"/>fully use available opportunities to influence policymakers in Ireland and in Europe.  For example, the terms of reference of sectoral committees will include the power to request the presence of the relevant Minister to attend before the committee and provide oral briefings in advance of Council meetings.  This will enable committees to make their views known in advance of Council meetings.</P>
        <P>I now turn to the development of the Estimates and expenditure process.  The introduction of a range of reforms by the Minister for Finance over the past two years, together with the recently announced introduction of the unified budget with effect from 5 December next, combine to give Oireachtas committees a greater opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny of the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending by each Department.  In an effort to give maximum effect to the opportunities presented by these reforms, it is intended that specific provision will be made in orders of reference of committees to place greater emphasis on such issues as annual output statements, value for money and policy reviews in particular.  Committees should be afforded an opportunity to formally examine departmental expenditure on a quarterly basis, with a view to having a more informed debate during the Estimates process.  The publication of other documents such as the Pre-Budget Outlook and the Stability Programme Update will also enable the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, for instance, to engage with the Minister for Finance on the economic and fiscal background to the budget.</P>
        <P>As regards the mechanism for tracking interdepartmental issues such as children, integration, innovation and the elderly, a number of Ministers of State have specific responsibilities which cut across several Departments.  A parliamentary oversight mechanism will be required to ensure that policy issues do not fall between committees and to avoid conflict concerning ownership and responsibility.  It is intended to assign responsibility to a committee to take the lead on an issue with a procedure to allow other interested committees to contribute.  I feel strongly that the effectiveness of any committee depends to a large extent on the dynamism of the Chairman and that of its members.  It is crucial that Members fully engage with committees in this D&aacute;il to maximise their value.</P>
        <P>In the last D&aacute;il, with the co-operation of my colleague, Deputy Noel Dempsey, then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, we pioneered the e-consultation process with a pilot project on the Broadcasting Bill.  The aim was to revolutionise the manner in which Parliament, Government and the ordinary citizen interact.  I want to take the opportunity to thank the Minister and members of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for their work in this area.  It was intended to be a genuine consultation process <Col N="782"/>that would test the readiness of Parliament to work more closely with the general public by using new technologies and interactive communications.  I intend to further promote e-consultation as a way of improving the transparency of the workings of the Parliament and to give wider access because this should not be seen as a means of slowing up legislation, but rather of creating a modern and more efficient system.</P>
        <P>We should be using this technology to better engage with the public, individuals, not just lobby groups, and where appropriate, young people.  I plan to look at how this e-consultation process can be used for the benefit of teachers and students so that young people can gain a better understanding of the workings of the Oireachtas and get involved.  It is imperative that we tackle the disconnect between the Oireachtas and the public head on and, in particular, that we try to engage young people through modern technology.</P>
        <P>I want to take the opportunity to refer briefly to the question of D&aacute;il reform, while we are debating the whole issue of committees.  The issue of D&aacute;il reform has arisen with every Government for the past decade.  This particular Government has tried to reach agreement on a package of reforms which would be acceptable to all parties.  The changes I endeavoured to introduce during the life of the last D&aacute;il included the Order of Business.  The following was proposed: the Order of Business would be dealt with exclusively by the party whips, whose responsibility it is to address these issues in the first instance; each week&rsquo;s business and, where appropriate, time allocations would be determined in advance by a motion that the Chief Whip would move on the preceding Thursday &mdash; provided that he or she might move an urgent motion on any particular sitting day to give effect to variations required by changed circumstances; and the Chief Whip would conduct a special weekly session in the House during which he or she would answer questions about the taking of business that had been promised, including legislation, the making of secondary legislation, arrangements for sittings and when Bills or other documents on the Order Paper would be circulated.</P>
        <P>The following was proposed concerning Leaders&rsquo; Questions and questions to the Government: to have a short period of notice to facilitate greater depth in responses as a result of more focused briefing and in order to ensure that the appropriate Minister was there; to enable Ministers to respond, at the request of the Taoiseach, where issues raised were more suitable for answer by the responsible Minister, who might have been more immediately and comprehensively engaged with the issue; extending the facility to Thursdays on the basis that the relevant Ministers, excluding the Taoiseach, would be available; and the Taoiseach would continue to be present on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, but only the responsible Ministers would be present on Thursdays.</P><Col N="783"/>
        <P>As regards Adjournment debates and current issues, it was proposed to improve the means for raising topical issues by introducing a new current issues time, to be held at an earlier time which would give greater prominence to them within the daily D&aacute;il schedule.  This would replace the Adjournment debate procedure and it was proposed to increase from four to six the number of issues that could be raised.  The time allocated to each would be reduced to three minutes, with three minutes for replies.</P>
        <P>It was proposed to discontinue the practice of reading out Standing Order 32 notices each day and matters sought to be raised would be noted by the Ceann Comhairle and placed on the record of the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>As regards sitting times, the time available currently in the D&aacute;il for legislation is 11.25 hours per week.  This could be increased to 15 hours, with some modest adjustment of sitting times.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated, we have already undertaken e-consultation on a Bill as a pilot project and plan to build on that progress.  Unfortunately, a package for D&aacute;il reform has not yet been agreed.  Discussions in the past have proved fruitless due to the continued pre-occupation of the Opposition with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attendance in the D&aacute;il on Thursday mornings, in addition to his Leaders&rsquo; Questions and Order of Business on Wednesdays.  This is in spite of the fact that most other Prime Ministers in Europe do not attend their respective Parliaments as often as the Taoiseach who answers questions for over three hours a week, compared with the British Prime Minister, for example, who gives just 30 minutes a week.</P>
        <P>However, I am anxious that this Government continues its commitment to change, and to play a constructive part in exploring with all parties, opportunities for improving procedures so the House operates in a manner which reflects the wishes of the people.  I wanted to touch on that today because it is closely connected to committee procedures.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, I should like to return to the issue of the formation of the committee system of the 30th D&aacute;il.  I want to emphasise that I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak on these matters.  I thank Deputy Michael D. Higgins of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, who asked for this debate.  It is important and I look forward to hearing the rest of the contributions throughout the day.</P>
        <P>I want to compliment the staff in the Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly the committee secretariat, for all the work they are doing.  I would also like to thank my colleague, Deputy Cowen, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, for providing the necessary resources for some 20 additional research staff to be engaged by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  This signals the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development of a vig<Col N="784"/>orous Oireachtas committee system backed by dedicated support staff and resources.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a fundamental principle involved in this debate which is that D&aacute;il committees are such and are not extensions of Government and the tool of the Executive.  They are there for a specific purpose.  D&aacute;il committees have different roles and responsibilities, depending on the way they are set up.  I expect Members from all sides who will contribute to this debate will give their views on the relevance of committees and how they could be made more relevant and effective.  Committees are instruments of the D&aacute;il which is the complement of all elected representatives, from whatever party or none, sent here by the people.  D&aacute;il committees should reflect that proportion in membership and management.</P>
        <P>I have long held the belief that we do not do justice to the people who serve on committees or to the issues they debate and research.  From a technological point of view, there is no reason we should not have an Oireachtas channel separate from any other.  It could broadcast the D&aacute;il, Seanad and relevant committees and there would be no need for a commentary.  The people are entitled to see democracy in action.  It would be a public service which could be properly promoted in advance.  There would always be somebody who would wish to watch it.</P>
        <P>Over the years I have seen many Deputies attend committee meetings in the bowels of this building but the work and contribution they have made, whether valid or not, is never heard of again.  In 2007, when one can switch on a computer in Auckland, New Zealand, and watch the proceedings of the D&aacute;il, we should able to broadcast D&aacute;il, Seanad and relevant committee proceedings on television.  It would be available to schools and others.  There would be little cost involved and it would be a public service.</P>
        <P>The way we have hived off work to committees is not the way it should be done.  They have been badly serviced in terms of the facilities available to public servants who attend to them.  For example, during the rumpus over the summer about the landing slots moving from Shannon to Belfast, it was brought to my attention that the Oireachtas Committee on Transport, which was chaired by former Deputy Ellis, had sought legal advice on the Heathrow slots.  As I was interested in the debate, I sought that legal advice.  When my office contacted the relevant secretariat of that committee, it was told it could not have that information because the committee was not in session.</P><Col N="785"/>
        <P>As we all know, transcripts of the forensic examinations of Des O&rsquo;Neill at the tribunal are available two hours later.  When one looks for information from, or transcripts of, committees, one cannot get them because we have not serviced them.  That is fundamental to anything which happens here, that is, one must provide proper facilities for committees.  Material should be available by way of CD, DVD or whatever.  It should be possible to download it from the Internet so that people who have an interest in these matters can follow them.</P>
        <P>This is not the first time we have had such a debate in the House.  As Deputies Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, Shatter and Higgins know, this matter has been raised on umpteen occasions over the past 30 years.  However, political will is required in terms of implementation.  I remember former Deputy John Bruton in his document, A Democratic Revolution, made certain projections on how things could improve.  A start was made in that regard.</P>
        <P>I take the Minister of State&rsquo;s point about the improvement of facilities for the Sub-committee on EU Scrutiny.  If we had debate on opt-ins or opt-outs of the legislative framework and the technicalities involved, it might save people a lot of hassle.  The important point emerging from all of this is that the EU reform treaty must be passed by the people and that requires full information.  When people do not have information, they feel left out.</P>
        <P>Members sent to the House want to be able to be seen to represent their people.  That is why there is always a reluctance to attend committee sessions for three or four hours which might be completely irrelevant and the work of which members know will never be seen again.</P>
        <P>For example, there is a role for committees interviewing some of the appointees for chairpersons or members of some State boards.  I do not mean there should be an inquisition but members of committees should be able to interview and understand the range of competencies a person might have to offer.</P>
        <P>I refer to the committee about which the Minister of State spoke in respect of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement which everybody supports.  This was originally deemed to be a committee on Northern Ireland and it was to have participation by, and the support of, all the parties in the North.  We need to tease out the terms of reference proposed for that committee a little more.  In a way, it is ironic that we are talking about giving rights to MPs, who do not attend the House of Commons, to sit in a committee room here and debate issues.  However, I fully support the work which must be done to ensure the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State made some comments on D&aacute;il reform.  As far as I am concerned, this party will participate in discussions which will lead to real and relevant D&aacute;il reform.  When we have all <Col N="786"/>left this Chamber, we should have at least put in place a base which will work in the interests of the people.  From a Government point of view, people will say one cannot do that because one is giving oneself a stick with which to beat oneself if it becomes too accessible.  The Taoiseach should be in the House on Thursday mornings.  This is a small country and politicians are accessible to the people.  That is a fundamental element but it is not the only one.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I like what the Minister of State said about Adjournment debates.  At the end of an Adjournment debate, one should be able to ask a Minister two questions such as whether he or she will meet a deputation from Carrigaline or whether the Department will report in a fortnight rather than have the bland statement on which one has no comeback.</P>
        <P>I would like to participate in D&aacute;il reform in terms of bringing about real and effective change.  I want to see the committee system operate effectively and properly resourced.  I would also like to see the promotion of an Oireachtas channel so that the public is aware of what is happening in the D&aacute;il, Seanad and relevant committees.  I have sent a letter to the Minister of State on this party&rsquo;s increased membership of the D&aacute;il and how that should be reflected in the membership of committees and how they are run.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and thank the Minister of State for facilitating it.  He spoke about the effectiveness of the committee system and instanced two cases in which it is effective.  However, most reports from committees are ignored by the Government.  I refer to two reports which demonstrate this point.  In July of last year, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which I was a member, produced a report with 33 recommendations on how to deal with the issue of suicide.  Some 28 of those recommendations were to be implemented immediately.  Today none of them has been introduced.  Four of them were cost neutral but have not been introduced.  We had a full debate one Thursday during which Members from all sides welcomed and supported the recommendations, yet, more than 12 months later, they have been ignored.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One recommendation states: &ldquo;Have the National Office for Suicide Prevention, the HSE National Hospitals Office and the Primary, Community &amp; Continuing Care Directorate review, improve and standardise pre-discharge and transfer planning from or between mental health service settings&rdquo;.  This was ignored although it was cost neutral.  Another recommendation states: &ldquo;Recommendations from the Inspector of Mental Health Services must be implemented within a 5-year period of his/her report or a resignation from either the Inspector on a point of principle or the Minster with responsibility for Mental Health Services because of the failure to support the <Col N="787"/>Inspectorate as a matter of course.&rdquo;  This, too, is cost neutral but it was ignored despite the fact that the then Minister for Health and Children spoke and accepted all the recommendations and committed herself and the Government to their implementation.</P>
        <P>Let me refer to a report on the public orthodontic service produced by the Joint Committee on Health and Children, on which it spent considerable time and for which it interviewed many people, including many from the Department of Health and Children.  The report,  published in May 2005, contained three controversial recommendations, yet the committee members were convinced they were necessary to ensure an adequate service for children requiring orthodontic treatment.  I understand that staff within the Department totally frustrated the recommendations of the committee, even though the Minister for Health and Children accepted them in the House.</P>
        <P>The two comprehensive reports, on which the joint committee spent much time and which would have a considerable impact on the well-being of children in one case and all the community in the other, were ignored.  This is very frustrating for the committee members who devoted much time to them.  There were high profile launches for both reports and discussions in the D&aacute;il on foot of which the recommendations were accepted, yet they were not implemented.</P>
        <P>I certainly welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s acceptance that there should be reform.  The proposals put forward by Fine Gael and the Labour Party during the last election campaign would complement his proposals.  The commitment made during the campaign still stands and the Opposition&rsquo;s proposals would greatly enhance the workings of the D&aacute;il.  They included the Minister of State&rsquo;s proposal on the Adjournment debate.  Having a Minister of State replying in respect of three of the four issues raised during an Adjournment debate and having civil servants anticipating the cases presented is hardly good enough.  It is extremely frustrating to make a strong case about an issue only to have a Minister or Minister of State read a script pre-written by the responsible Department, which script he or she might not have read.  It is soul-destroying, yet we persist with this method.</P>
        <P>I hope the difficulties we have been experiencing with committees can be resolved very quickly.  I assure the Minister of State that we will help in every way on this side of the House.  I am sure he understands that we have a strong point to make, as stated by Deputy Kenny in his contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome the opportunity to make some preliminary remarks on the committee system, which remarks are but a small part of the debate we desperately need to have on parliamentary reform.  The amount of time allocated for this debate, while <Col N="788"/>welcome as a beginning, is totally insufficient to address the crisis of parliamentarism with which we are dealing.  In this regard, when I consider my reflections on the literature that has been written on parliamentary reform since I first became a Member of the Oireachtas in 1973, I note that nearly every single article refers to the evolution of the committee system as a vital part of parliamentary reform.  This is an issue to which I will return.</P>
        <P>I will justify my remarks by saying that there is a decline in parliamentary power in parliaments in Europe generally and in those across the world.  This raises a considerable issue.  In some respects, one is tempted to describe some parliamentary processes as a managed illusion; however, it is an illusion without which we could not live.  We need to see, at least in formal shape, the possibility of democracy and accountability, but we do not get that.</P>
        <P>In the time allocated to me, I can say but a few words on this matter.  I am in favour of change but do not necessarily agree that all changes have been automatically good.  When I first became a Member of the D&aacute;il there were distinguished contributions that were capable of teasing out legislation and dealing with issues comprehensively, sometimes not limited by time.  The confinement of speeches to 20 minutes and the sharing of time by Members, combined with the arrival of press offices, meant that small, inefficient and partially cut and pasted regurgitations of the Minister&rsquo;s speech and the main spokesperson&rsquo;s speech on the Opposition side served as a substitute for what was previously vital political rhetoric.  I use the term &ldquo;rhetoric&rdquo; in the Greek sense, that is, the important sense of dealing with substantial issues.</P>
        <P>I cannot address all these issues because of the time limitations imposed on me today and I hope the Chief Whip, who is a generous man, will want to return to the D&aacute;il and offer a full day, for example, to address more fundamental parliamentary reform.  In the meantime, he may encourage members of the media, none of whom is present, to turn up.</P>
        <P>Let me address some of the more specific points.  Speaking as one who worked as a political scientist for a very long time, I do not have to waste my time issuing a whole lot of caveats.  Nothing I have to say is a reflection on any particular person or the staff of the House, whose duties and dedication I, like everybody else, appreciate deeply.  However, an issue of accountability arises in respect of the relationships of the public, through elections, to Parliament, of Parliament to the Executive, and of both the Parliament and Executive to the public in terms of policy.</P>
        <P>Let me give an example of the extreme position that now obtains in respect of accountability, bearing in mind the powers given to a range of unaccountable quangos and semi-State bodies.  This transfer of powers goes against the advice of <Col N="789"/>a former Attorney General, who, while speaking in a private capacity to the UCD Law Society, suggested that Ministers, under the Constitution, should give to any body acting in the name of the people a policy envelope, which policy would remain accountable in the Parliament.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I asked a question of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who, as I understood from the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech, was a glowing advocate of the committee system.  I asked the Minister for Transport, who had answered a previous question that acknowledged the social role of CIE, the procedures by which CIE has calculated such assets it considers surplus to public transport requirements in general, and the procedures that were used to establish the regional integrated public transport needs that might be served at Ceannt Station in Galway city in view of the public interest in the policy issues that arise.  It was a policy issue to say that CIE would have to sell its property to install the extra platform rather than that it be provided under the national development plan through Transport 21.  The Minister&rsquo;s reply stated: &ldquo;This is a day-to-day operational matter for CIE and not one in which I have any role&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I refer the House to Question No. 301 of Tuesday, 9 October 2007, ref: 22426/07.  One must place this alongside the suggestion that the Government has no responsibility in regard to Aer Lingus or the implications and fallout of HSE actions on health.  A gulf is opening up between the genuine concerns of the public, the policy division that has emerged between Parliament, the Executive through the Cabinet and Ministers with delegated responsibilities under the Constitution, and these quangos that are unaccountable.</P>
        <P>I want to address some specific issues but, as I have said, I can only glance at them.  I would like to have been back in the time of the late Professor John Maurice Kelly and others and I could have discussed the question of democracy and parliament.  I am a pessimist about what is happening.  While I welcome the technical innovations and capacities and facilities being provided in this House, there is a serious ideological error happening in that there is an assumption that one can substitute technical improvements for fundamental debate concerning what parliament should be about.  I will come back to this in a moment, lest I run out of time.</P>
        <P>I have given examples across other Departments in regard to transport and health.  The National Roads Authority is the same.  I could give an example from the area with which I am most familiar, namely, the foreign affairs committee which is a special case of unaccountability.  I describe it as the triple deficit because here again we do not debate issues.  Next week the Taoiseach will sign the European treaty and the day after he will tell us how he got on.  The issue is that in regard to the different pillars of the European Union, some decisions are taken in intergovern<Col N="790"/>mental consultation, the IGC process.  There is a real deficit concerning what is being decided in Europe &mdash; in some cases decisions are not even made by parliamentarians.  The European Union has more accountability than the foreign affairs committee of any one of the composing countries in terms of some information.  It has a limited access to information in regard to intelligence and security.  This was brought to the fore during the preparations for the illegal war in Iraq.</P>
        <P>In 1986 I proposed the establishment of a foreign affairs committee.  The Labour Party and university Senators voted in favour of it in the Seanad.  Former Senator Jim Dooge of Fine Gael described it as organised distrust rather than delegated confidence in regard to the Executive, and Fine Gael voted against the proposal.  Fianna F&aacute;il abstained.  Seven years later, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs was established.  In November 2003, ten years after it was established, I questioned what I was doing on a foreign affairs committee, what we were doing in Parliament discussing foreign affairs if we discover that at an informal meeting which has no constitutional or legal basis, the political wing of Hamas is being added to a proscribed list on the basis of information that has not been presented to any Parliament.  My reaction to all of this was one of horror.</P>
        <P>When I raised that issue in November 2003 I was referring to the fact the Irish representatives on the Committee of Permanent Representatives in Brussels, COREPER, had conducted preparatory work on the drawing up of names of persons, groups or entities for inclusion on a proscribed list.  The permanent representatives had formed their own sub-committee known as the clearing house, and that mechanism was not reported to anybody.  Excluding Hamas from talks in 1993 was very significant.  There is an almost identical reality in regard to the response to the elections that took place in Palestine.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is a gross example of non-accountability.</P>
        <P>There is no reference to the different powers of the European affairs and foreign affairs committees.  The European affairs committee can occasionally be briefed, but not on intelligence matters.  The foreign affairs committee is not briefed.  Does any Member feel that when we eventually formed that foreign affairs committee in 1993 it had any autonomy?  I would pose the following questions regarding these committees.  What is their role and function?  How many of the committees described by the Minister are autonomous?  How many are independent?  How many have the right to initiate legislation?  How many have the power of amendment?  How many have the power of scrutiny?  How many are limited to scrutiny?  In regard to the European affairs and foreign affairs committees, does scrutiny include issues of security?  Do issues of security include being briefed on intelligence?  What is the relationship of committees, their different roles <Col N="791"/>and functions having been specified, to the plenary session?</P>
        <P>I raised the issue of the war in Iraq on the Order of Business and was almost out of order when I asked the Taoiseach whether or not the Government was in favour of pre-emption.  I never really got an answer.  When Deputy Michael Kitt and I eventually went to Iraq, three or four weeks before the war broke out, it was only after every single obstacle had been placed in our way, including some that were rather pathetic.  We were told we would not be able to get insurance and we said we would get it ourselves.  Then we were told the person from the committee who would accompany us would not be able to get insurance.  When I said we were going anyway, the difficulty with the insurance was suddenly solved.  That kind of nonsense indicated more than anything the absolute price to be paid for the absence of autonomy.  Will the foreign affairs committee be run as an arm of the Executive from Iveagh House, or will it be an independent committee?</P>
        <P>I have the greatest respect for people who go before the people, who get votes and get elected.  I do not believe parliamentary reform can be reduced to somehow or other beefing up the Members, telling them what to read, what research journals to read and where to get them.  Those provisions are welcome.  However, the people who are elected are representing what is very often the feeling of the people.  People want a general health service.  If there are to be cuts in the health service they do not want patients to suffer.  They want public transport.  They do not want CIE selling off its property by stealth.  On the issue of war, 100,000 people went out onto the streets one Saturday and we could not get a debate in this House.</P>
        <P>Other issues arise, some of which I will list.  They arise in regard to the role and function of committees in terms of initiation, amendment and scrutiny of legislation.  The D&aacute;il should be able to debate their formal authority better.  There is the political will.  In terms of cross-parliamentary analysis of this issue, the question is asked as to why the Australian Parliament does not get the reforms people like me are looking for.  It is because the Labour Party in Australia often saw itself as likely to be in Government and oppositions did not want to concede anything they might have to live with when they themselves were in Government.  We are past that point.  What we need now is a robust parliamentarism.</P>
        <P>Other Deputies have mentioned the hard work put into committee work and the absence of any media attention to it.  There is a kind of new fashionable illiteracy in which people will not have to read background economics, history, politics, culture or do comparative work so as to be able to judge a parliamentary performance in terms of its proposals and the value of the different proposals.  There is an idea that one can sub<Col N="792"/>stitute gossip which fits nicely with ten-minute slots so that one gets reduced meaningless speeches, media neglect and so on.  I wish the Minister well in his hubris and his optimism when he describes his excitement when he reflects on Deputy Noel Dempsey&rsquo;s historic innovation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Other things are important.  Why should the committees be governed by the availability of limited amounts of time or even such basic things as a room?  How often have chairmen had to tell members that they must finish by 4 p.m. because somebody else had the room booked for a meeting?  Time and availability of space govern the agenda.  The capacity of the committee system is dependent on staff and resources.  If a member of a committee raises an urgent issue, how valuable is it if the minutes of that committee are available three months later?</P><P Just="Left">I totally agree with the proposals for a public service channel that would cover the proceedings of the D&aacute;il and committees.  We do not need the proceedings to be edited in some smart aleck way, such as, &ldquo;members were back again in the D&aacute;il today&rdquo;.  If I wanted to go down that road, I would say the media were missing again today when we were discussing the work of the committees and they will be missing from the committees.  It is disgraceful that there is such a low attendance, and limited time when discussing a matter as fundamental as the genuine public desire to have not just technical access but real political accountability.</P>
        <P>The Government will be thanked if it gives to Parliament what it should never have lost.  It is up to the Government and Opposition to take back from quangos and unaccountable entities, such as the NRA, the HSE, or HSA the accountability the public wants vested in Parliament.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The committee system is of major importance to the work of the Oireachtas and an essential element in proper democratic representation for the people who elect the members.  It is amazing they are of such relatively recent origin and that it took the Oireachtas so long to see the vital role committee work plays in representative government.  We are all aware that very often far more detailed and constructive work is done in committee than here in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  Committees are vital to legislative work and allow for real and constructive input to the Committee Stage of Bills.  Too often Governments adopt a rigid approach and refuse to take on board valid and often non-controversial amendments from Opposition Deputies, solely on the basis that the Opposition tabled them.  This is not always the case and where there is real engagement across all parties, very valuable work can be done.  It is long overdue that we dispensed with the ridiculous rule &mdash; I emphasise this &mdash; that amendments tabled by Opposition Deputies may not lead to a charge on <Col N="793"/>the Exchequer.  This rule hampers real engagement on much legislation and makes a nonsense, for example, of the annual passage of the finance Bill.</P>
        <P>It is disgraceful that no Oireachtas committees have been formed since the general election four months ago.  The D&aacute;il and Seanad did not return until the end of September.  No committee work was done in August or September because the committees were not in place.  In my view this brings the D&aacute;il and Seanad into disrepute.  It must be stated clearly that every Deputy and Senator should have the right to a place on an Oireachtas committee.  Obviously all Members cannot serve on the committee of his or her choice.  However, in order to fulfil his or her role as a public representative comprehensively, it must be accepted and not seen as a concession that every Members should have access to the committee system.  It is totally unacceptable that committee places are divvied out by the larger parties and that smaller parties such as Sinn F&eacute;in and Independents must depend on the larger parties giving up places allocated to them to become a member of a committee.  This must change and each member and the sector of the electorate he or she represents must be given due and equal recognition in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is not the case currently, as the Minister of State knows only too well, as he and I have addressed it repeatedly since the general election in May.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government closely guards its majority on committees and its power to nominate committee chairpersons.  The position of chairperson should be shared out and rotated on a yearly or two yearly basis.  The positions of chairpersons should not be doled out as goodies for Government backbenchers and disappointed aspirants to ministerial office.  While the Government jealously guards its committee places, it is not so vigilant about ensuring its members fully participate in committee work.  I found that while Opposition Members have good attendance records, they are faced with one or two representatives at meetings from the Government side who are in to keep the side up.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The media have a major responsibility to reflect the importance of committee work, which is something they have failed to do.  Starving the work of Deputies and Senators of the important oxygen of media attention has ill served the very important work that I know the committee system addresses in Parliament.  It is important the media take on board that they have a responsibility to adequately and properly inform the electorate of the extent of the work of Deputies and Senators in these Houses.  I encourage the reporters and their editors, including the broadcast media, to take a greater interest in and accept the validity of the case for more and greater attention to the work of committees.  Perhaps RTE might consider extending &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; rather than cutting the already inadequate attention that some Members receive.</P><Col N="794"/>

	<P Just="Left">I refer to a matter which the Minister signalled in his address, the committee on children.  The situation seems to move and change not only by the day but by the hour.  I have kept abreast of the feedback at Whips' meetings and yet today we learn the Government proposes an entirely new committee regarding children from that signalled in the missive circulated at a previous Whips' meeting.  It is proposed to have a committee on the constitutional amendment regarding children quite separate from the committee the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, is involved in arranging.  I have no problem with that but the Minister must accept that the drip drip approach is not a good way to do business.  This makes it very difficult for parties to plan and in our case how we will divide our time and attention when there will clearly be a much greater number of opportunities arising from these committees.  I welcome the subtext of the Chief Whip&rsquo;s announcement, that the committee on children, which had been signalled earlier, will be a substantive committee rather than a stand-alone address of the proposal to amend the Constitution.  This is in line with an argument I presented to the Taoiseach yesterday.  I further argued for a specific Question Time for the Minister of State with responsibility for children, independent of questions to the Minister for Health and Children where matters pertaining to children are rarely addressed, given the extent of concern and the import of all health issues currently.</P>

	<P>Children are a very important part of our society and the House must address issues concerning them.  The case for this is self-standing.</P>
        <P>I welcome the establishment of the committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  There is no indication yet of the intent of the commencement of this committee.  When will the committee be constituted?  Have Members of Parliament from north of the Border signalled their acceptance of the opportunity to participate?  I hope there will be a willingness to participate by all political views north of the Border.</P>
        <P>In my first five years in the House I served on the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government and during the previous D&aacute;il on the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  I express my appreciation of the committee secretariats and of the support staff <Col N="795"/>who serviced committees during the ten years of my experience.  In every way they were hugely accommodating and helpful.  I record my thanks to them and I am sure I reflect the thanks and appreciation of all Members.</P>

	<P>The record of committee engagements needs to be speeded up and, if possible, its publication brought into line with the Official Report of the D&aacute;il.  This aspect of committee work does not serve the appreciation by the media and public of the importance of committees.  If an increase in staff is necessary to speed up the preparation of the transcripts of all committee meetings I encourage that.  Committee transcripts should be in line with the speedy availability of those of the D&aacute;il and Seanad and committee reports should not be relegated to a later time.  All reports should be done within the same time arrangements.  If additional staff are required that must be addressed.  I express my appreciation of the work of staff who compile the reports of all such engagements.</P>
        <P>There is value in committees hearing evidence from delegations.  In my experience it is often valuable to invite representatives of State agencies, non-governmental organisations and civic society to committees.  The Houses will better address their work by continual contact and engagement with these voices.  This work is important and underscores the importance of Parliament to people.  In that regard, the work of committees should be expanded.  I am not averse to specific time being allocated for it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must be aware of resource issues.  The Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service has had to curtail meetings because of the unavailability of rooms.</P>

	<P>In 2007, it is bizarre that the Parliament must order the time it allows for committees to sit and Members to do their work on the basis of the constraints of space.  I urge the Chief Whip to address these serious deficiencies so that we can have a better opportunity to play our part to the full.  Welcome developments took place in 2000 but we are only a handful of years from that and it is obvious there was insufficient planning for the future needs of the Houses.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the establishment of committees at the earliest opportunity.  While all Members cannot access their committees of choice, I hope my party colleagues and I, now smaller in number, will be accommodated by the larger blocs.  Government has a responsibility in this.  It should not act only in the interest of perpetuating its own majority position but look to its responsibility to ensure access to all elected <Col N="796"/>voices.  Our mandates are the equal of any other in this Chamber.  We have the right to access committees in order to perform our role to the best of our ability.  It is a sad reflection on the arrangements in the House that one must engage in negotiation, barter and begging to have a chance to play one&rsquo;s part.  That is not what was expected by the electorate which made us their choice, either in first position or with high preferences, in the recent election.  The electorate deserves, as do their elected voices, the apportionment of equal opportunity to all representatives in this House.  I hope that will be the case in the future.  I look forward to participating in committee work in the new D&aacute;il for whatever time lies ahead.</P>

	<P>With the agreement of the House, I wish to share time with Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the committee system at the commencement of the D&aacute;il.  This is an appropriate time to debate this subject and we should do so at the commencement of every D&aacute;il.  I compliment the Chief Whip on the series of proposals he has outlined, specifically the provision of enhanced research facilities and resources to committees.  Proposals relating to European matters will be seen as very significant.  I had the honour last year of chairing the committee on child protection, a special committee established to deal specifically with an issue of national importance that convulsed the House, if not the nation, in terms of the gravity of issues with which it dealt.  There is enormous scope for the House to deal with these types of complex issues through the committee system.  In other words, we should remain open to the possibility of establishing special purpose committees.  Another committee which comes to mind in this regard is the one established last year to address the complex and difficult issue involving a judge of the Circuit Court.  While I may be biased, both committees were considered particularly effective in proposing solutions and bringing about resolutions to these difficulties outside of the hothouse atmosphere that sometimes pertains in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</P>
        <P>I welcome the innovations introduced by the Minister of State.  I welcome in particular that the All-Party Committee on the Constitution will become a Joint Oireachtas committee.  I could never understand why that committee met in a different venue and under different terms from standard committees. I also welcome the proposal to establish a joint committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and a joint committee on the constitutional amendment regarding children.</P>
        <P>The proposals in respect of EU scrutiny are important.  The volume of material coming from Europe is unwieldy.  No Deputy, regardless of his or her experience or expertise, could be expected to deal with the volume and complexity of <Col N="797"/>material coming from Europe.  The proposed committee will require enormous resources and staff to deal with those issues.  I believe the Minister of State&rsquo;s proposals go some way towards addressing this issue.</P>
        <P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins identified the staffing of committees in general as one of the most crucial issues.  A committee not properly staffed cannot operate effectively.  In this regard, I noticed last year &mdash; this may have been peculiar to the committees of which I was a member &mdash; a great deal of turnover of committee clerks.  This, in my view, gave rise to a great deal of disruption of the work of the committees.  I do not know whether this was widespread.  However, I believe that in so far as it is possible a clerk assigned to a committee should serve with that committee for the entire tenure of the D&aacute;il or, at least, a large part of it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The proposals in respect of research assistants are also important.  Members are often faced in committees by a plethora of advisers accompanying a Minister providing him or her with the most up-to-date specialist information whereas they, be it on the Opposition or Government side, simply do not have that level of expertise.  I draw the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention to the overly complex issue of financing of rapporteurs which I believe should be streamlined.  Many of the rapporteur-based reports were good.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kenny at the outset made the point that committees should be seen as an instrument of the D&aacute;il and should reflect its work.  At the same time, the argument was made that there should be more committee chairmanship positions for Opposition Members.  Surely, if the committee system is to mirror the D&aacute;il, which is chaired for the most part by Government, the proposed system for Government chairmanship of committees to drive and direct those committees is an appropriate way to proceed.</P>
        <P>I welcome this debate and the reforms proposed by the Minister of State.  I look forward to the rest of the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to point out that it was 16 October 2002 that the order for the formation of the new committees came before the D&aacute;il.  </P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Higgins, having served as Chairman of the Joint and Select Committees on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources during the previous D&aacute;il, that a shortage of staff arose on numerous occasions because of the pressures on them.  I must acknowledge that the staff of my committees, which included Ronan Lenihan and others, were excellent.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will consider whether four committee rooms will be sufficient to service the proposed 21 committees.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that being told a room had to be vacated at a particular time disrupted the business of the sitting committee.  I also had the honour of chairing the Working Group of Com<Col N="798"/>mittee Chairman and of visiting the UK with Mr. Art O&rsquo;Leary to view the system there.  I noted during that visit that there was one PR person for every seven committees.  Our committee system is mirrored on the UK system and it is important a public relations person is appointed to serve a designate number of committees.  This would allow committees to operate effectively in terms of getting their message out prior to a meeting or, in respect of the issuing of a report.</P>
        <P>Committees perform invaluable work and they make an invaluable contribution to the democratic process.  All debates in the committee system are held in public session.  The current committee system adds value to the process by invigilating with the Department which it mirrors, the stakeholders and, the public.  The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources produced 11 reports in five years.  These related to public policies which had a major impact on people.  These reports were published following full consultation with the stakeholders, the public, the relevant Department and Minister.  The committee examined the issues, commented and made recommendations and built a roadmap for policymakers to consider and follow.  I am happy to say that a substantial number of the recommendations made in the 11 reports produced by the committee which I chaired for five years, were taken on board by the Department.  I am glad our work was not in vain.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All of the reports were agreed by consensus.  All parties were fully committed to the process in which they engaged as a committee.  It is only fair to say that this committee was considered to have been one of the most active of the Twenty-Ninth D&aacute;il.  The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources published three reports on broadband, one of which, published in 2004, included 12 recommendations.  However, we were not happy that the Government was following up on these recommendations and later published another report which included 35 further recommendations.  The third report, published prior to the end of the Twenty-Ninth D&aacute;il, included two recommendations which meant that Government, stakeholders and others had taken note of what we had to say.  There has been phenomenal growth in the roll out of broadband during the past 12 months.</P>
        <P>This is but one area of activity in which the joint committee was involved.  The committee also discussed salmon drift netting and produced a report which laid the foundations for the Department&rsquo;s report which was accepted by Government and is currently being implemented.  It also produced a report on non-ionising radiation from mobile phone handsets and masts, the recommendations of which, I am pleased to put on the record of the House, were accepted by the Department which established an implementation group to follow through on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe the committee system has a major role to play in the workings of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I <Col N="799"/>welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s earlier announcement that the committees will be beefed up in terms of staff numbers and so on.  I believe this will be helpful.  I hope the Minister of State will take on board some of the suggestions made in my short contribution.</P>

	<P>The success or otherwise of this debate will depend on whether the Minister of State and the Government as a whole are prepared to recognise that the time has come for a clear separation of powers between the Executive and this Chamber.  Their terms of reference immediately indicate the thinking behind the formation of committees.  There is a fear on the part of Government of losing control.  I do not refer to backbenchers on the Government side because we are all Members of the D&aacute;il but the Executive has a job to do and this Parliament has a job to do.  For example, one of the conditions of committees is that a joint committee shall refrain from inquiring into, in public session, or publishing confidential information regarding any such matter if so requested by the body concerned or by the Minister.  This means a Minister can tell a committee of Parliament it cannot debate a matter in public.  He can tell it not to publish information.  If ever there was an example of the control of Government and the Executive over committees it is reflected in that condition, which applies to the terms of reference of all committees.  I object to that.</P>
        <P>The first thing we should do is review the terms of reference of all committees but it will depend on whether the Executive is prepared to release control over committees and leave it to the D&aacute;il and Seanad to act in a responsible fashion to assist the Executive in the formation of legislation.  The original intention was for heads of Bills to be sent to committees by Cabinet for consideration and that was a very good idea.  The object of the exercise was to invite witnesses to debate those heads.  The results would then be returned, via the D&aacute;il, to the Executive.  I see nothing wrong with that system but, as things stand, we empty this Chamber of real work by sending off Bills on Committee Stage to committees when, in many instances, they should be debated in the House.</P>
        <P>If we let the committee system operate in a correct fashion we would not need to be concerned about there being a majority on all Stages in committee.  Committee meetings should not be about votes.  The only reason for a Government majority on a committee is the fear of losing a vote on Committee Stage of a Bill.  Why should a finance Bill be buried in a committee, with nobody knowing what is happening?  It is not reported, which is also the case with social welfare Bills.  I spent five years outside this House and I was appalled not to have a clue what was in finance Bills.</P><Col N="800"/>
        <P>This is a real problem, which is why, with Deputy Kenny, leader of Fine Gael, and Deputy Higgins, I have advocated for a long time that proceedings of both Houses and committees should be aired live on our broadcasting station.  Television is a feature of the present generation and if we want to communicate with people we should have our own channel to broadcast on a daily basis, with its schedule published in newspapers so that people will know what time certain debates take place and what is happening in a committee.  One can flick a button to watch and listen and one does not even need a commentary.  I watch BBC Parliament on occasions and during the summer months, when the Parliament is in recess, much of the committee work is replayed, in which there are some very interesting debates.  One gets the advantage of hearing outside experts advise parliamentarians on various issues, and there is no reason it cannot happen here.  It is simply a question of the will to do it.</P>
        <P>I believe we are creating committees for the sake of creating committees.  There is a real fear that they will be seen as more jobs for the boys.  I want real committees and do not see why we need another three.  I accept that many of the proposals in the Chief Whip&rsquo;s speech this morning relate to important matters but we do not necessarily need a separate committee to discuss them.  The present committee structure could achieve that.  Mention has been made of insufficient space and staff but if we increase the number of committees to 21 or 22 there will be less space for the existing committees and more staff will be required.  It will also add to the potential for talking shops.</P>
        <P>There is no reason for the Government to feel it has to chair every committee.  If one accepts the separation of powers between the Executive and Parliament, the chairs of committees should be allocated on the basis of proportionality, depending on the strength of each party in the D&aacute;il.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s point that every party should have the opportunity to be represented on a committee.  We live in a democracy and many countries would give their right arm for the freedoms we have.  We rightly fight the cause of people such as those in Burma who are trying to rid themselves of dictatorship, but we are going in the opposite direction by allowing Government to take over more and more in respect of the operation of our democracy.  Government has a job to do and so does Parliament.  It is time all of us, irrespective of our party, thought this way.</P>
        <P>On the subject of D&aacute;il reform, one of the most important instruments in any parliamentary democracy is the power to ask a parliamentary question and receive a comprehensive reply.  Question Time in this Parliament is now an utter joke.  There are 50 or 60 questions to a particular Minister on the Order Paper every day but everybody knows that, after Priority Questions, we are lucky if more than five are answered and that is <Col N="801"/>utterly wrong.  I know from my time as a Minister, as will other Members who have served in government, that if a Department sees a question at No. 20 on the Order Paper it knows the quality of the reply can be lower than if it were at No. 1, given the fact that it will not be reached.  The Minister does not even have to brief himself, or herself, on the topic.</P>
        <P>We have a lottery system but I suggest that, instead of that lottery taking place a few days before the questions are to be asked, they be given to the Ceann Comhairle to deal with.  In the morning, before he comes into the Chamber, he would draw the questions and the order in which they are to be asked, but he would not tell any Member.  If I had submitted a question, I would come into the House because there was a chance it would have been drawn as No. 1, No. 2 or No. 3.  Most important, the quality of the reply would be the same for each question because nobody would know whether it was to be selected for answer.  The system would be very simple and would attract more Deputies into the Chamber at Question Time.</P>
        <P>We should also restrict the time allocated to each question.  A Minister should not be allowed to spend five minutes replying while the person asking the question only has 30 seconds.  This is a vital change which would not adversely affect any of us.  It will only benefit those of us who ask a parliamentary question.  I ask the Minister of State to give the suggestion serious consideration as it is a disgrace that people turn on their television to see only two or three people in the Chamber at Question Time, because we know our question will not be reached.  He must find a way of attracting people to the House because this is a theatre and it is where the action takes place.  This is where the public forms its impression of how we are doing our jobs.  People do not realise that we slave in committees.  As we run from one committee to another, we ask ourselves why we are doing it.  Do we need 21 committees?</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak during this debate.  I have served in this House for five years without having had the honour or privilege of being a Chairman of a committee.  During the last D&aacute;il, I served on the Committee of Public Accounts, the Joint Committee on Education and Science and the Joint Committee on Child Protection.  While each of those three committees worked very hard, the public understanding of their work was limited.  It is incumbent on all of us to take the appropriate steps to ensure that the real work done by Oireachtas committees is recognised and appreci<Col N="802"/>ated.  It is a matter of D&aacute;il reform.  When one is trawling through detailed figures with a witness at the Committee of Public Accounts, it is impossible to keep one&rsquo;s train of thought after the committee meeting has been disrupted by a division in this Chamber.  It is also unfair on witnesses.  We need to change the structures.</P>
        <P>The work of the Committee of Public Accounts often makes the newspapers, particularly when it relates to a headline issue, because the committee has a certain profile.  I would like to mention a somewhat disturbing aspect of the committee&rsquo;s work.  The committee tackles various questions in a structured manner &mdash; it does not just highlight the issues of the day.  It pursues various matters by making specific recommendations to the relevant Department or organisation, and subsequently in a minute to the Minister for Finance.  In most cases, the recommendations made by the committee are acted on.  The media does not seem to notice when the committee&rsquo;s cycle of work on a given issue is completed.  The newspapers prefer to publish glamorous headlines about amounts of money which have been squandered than to reflect the real work of the committee.  They do not follow through on the detailed work of the Committee of Public Accounts, which is a pity.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Barrett&rsquo;s comments about the composition of the various committees.  I wonder whether he would be making those recommendations and suggestions if he were speaking from this side of the House and his party were in government.  I would like to make that point having listened to those comments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The D&aacute;il should retain the ability to establish at short notice certain sub-committees in addition to those committees which have been listed by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt.  Such sub-committees were established by the last D&aacute;il to deal with certain issues.  I listened carefully to Deputy Peter Power, who chaired the Joint Committee on Child Protection, which was established by the last D&aacute;il when a major issue arose.  The members of the committee, who represented all sides of the House, dealt with the issue in a professional manner.  The committee&rsquo;s final report reflected the collective thoughts of its members, rather then the individual policies of the Government, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party or Fine Gael.  The manner in which the various strands of the issue were teased out in detail was an example of real committee work.  That the members of the committee were not necessarily concerned about party lines showed that committees can come together to solve problems within tightly defined timeframes.  The Joint Committee on Child Protection&rsquo;s work, which was done over the summer months, was completed within a short and well defined period of time.  It is a good example.  We must retain the ability to restructure our systems by establishing a special committee of that nature <Col N="803"/>at short notice when issues of significant national importance arise.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about the membership of committees.  One often sees many empty seats in the committee rooms where meetings are taking place and when Deputies have an opportunity to attend.  In the vast majority of cases, any Member of the House who is interested in the topic being discussed by a committee is entitled to attend the relevant meeting.  It is soul-destroying to hear Deputies frequently calling for a D&aacute;il debate on an issue that has been discussed in some detail at committee level during a debate to which any Deputy could have contributed.  If we are serious about the committee system, it is incumbent on all of us to use the forum presented at committee level to debate the issues we want to see addressed in detail.</P>
        <P>I heard the Sinn F&eacute;in Leader in this House, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, suggest a week or two ago that the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be debated in this Chamber.  I do not have a problem with that proposal as long as we understand that it would detract from the work of the Committee of Public Accounts, which is charged with going through such reports in forensic detail.  If we debate the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s reports here, we will be suggesting that the role of the Committee of Public Accounts is somehow second rate.  It would be as if we were saying that we are happy to debate it in the House and to allow the committee to do what it wants thereafter.  If we are serious about the committees, we should leave them to deal with those issues which are rightfully and properly their responsibility.  A Deputy is entitled to attend a meeting of almost any committee, regardless of whether he or she is a member of the committee in question.  I accept that the position is somewhat different in the case of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Any Member of this House can express his or her views at almost any committee meeting.  We need to put our beliefs into practice by making the committees work.  The system is not working if we try to reconsider in this House issues which have been debated at committee meetings with lots of empty seats.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few brief words on the establishment of the Oireachtas committees.  Previous speakers have commented on the effectiveness or otherwise of the committees.  The committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas are responsible for reflecting on the issues appertaining to their various remits.  There is scope for the committees to do far more exploratory work with parties who are interested in specific issues.  It should be borne in mind that we are talking about committees of elected Members of the Oireachtas.  Some Deputies have mentioned that the Oireachtas has devolved a great deal of power to unelected <Col N="804"/>organisations which now make decisions relating to Government and State policy.  As a result of this process, which started a long time ago, such bodies are no longer accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Members of the Oireachtas are often frustrated when they contact these groups.  I recently highlighted the case of Pobal, which has said that when Members of the Oireachtas contact it, it cannot give information to third parties.  These organisations should be asked to account for their work to Oireachtas committees.</P>
        <P>Each of the Oireachtas committees has done a great deal of work during my two previous terms as a Deputy.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Education and Science in the last D&aacute;il, I was in charge of a group of people who worked intensely on the issue of adult literacy and had started to examine school boundaries when the general election was called.  There is scope within the committee structure to ask the relevant stakeholders to attend meetings to tease out various issues so members can identify shortcomings and shortfalls.  As Members of the Oireachtas, we should use the committees to a much greater extent, by producing reports for the attention of Departments, for example.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers mentioned that reports which they worked on were considered and implemented by the various Departments.  I am sure that if we were to re-evaluate all the reports which have been published by Oireachtas committees over the years, we would find that they include many good policies and statements.  On reflection, however, it may transpire that many of the recommendations of those reports were not implemented by the relevant Departments, which belittles the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The essence of our democracy, in the first instance, is the election of Members of the Oireachtas.  As parliamentarians, when we produce reports as members of committees, we are mirroring the views of the people we represent.  Democracy dictates that as policy-makers, we should have a greater ability to ensure that the reports we produce are considered.  There should be some system whereby Departments are obliged to implement such reports as Government policy and then as State policy.</P>
        <P>This might be one of the shortcomings of the committee system.  There is scope for more work to be carried out by committees.  Certain organisations should be held accountable to the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who are ultimately accountable to the people.  We are the elected representatives of the people and as such should have a say.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>As someone who was absent from this House for five years, what I find most depressing is that nothing has changed.  I listened and read with some interest the speech delivered by the Government Chief Whip.  The proposals described as relating to D&aacute;il reform do nothing other than tinker around the edges, deal<Col N="805"/>ing with mechanics and procedures as opposed to substance.  I have reached the conclusion that we are rapidly becoming a dysfunctional democracy as a consequence of one party, Fianna F&aacute;il, having dominated Government for the past ten years.  This House is no longer regarded by the Government or the main Government party as truly a parliament or a legislative assembly.  It is seen as something to be controlled, to be organised and, in so far as possible, something to be politically neutered.  The best way to describe the current function of Government backbenchers in the eyes of the Government is simply &ldquo;lobby fodder&rdquo;.  They are seen as individuals whose support is necessary to keep Ministers in office.</P>
        <P>When dealing with the Opposition an attempt has been made by the Government of the past ten years to ensure that the Opposition ceases to act, behave or exercise a role as legislators but instead becomes simply a protest movement.  As the Government sees it, the role of the Opposition is to raise issues and questions but never to be allowed play a meaningful role in the legislative process.  This is having an extraordinarily bad impact on politics.  It is undermining democratic principle and it is holding Members of this House up to disrepute in the eyes of the general public.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The statistics relating to legislation are extraordinary.  I researched the number of Private Members&rsquo; Bills which had been introduced in both Houses of the Oireachtas in the period beginning 1 January 2002 to date and the number which had succeeded in being enacted into law.  A total of 70 Private Members&rsquo; Bills were published during that period by various Members of this House on behalf of their parties or by Independent Senators in the other House.  Of the 70 Bills published, 69 have gone no further than initial debate.  They have been blocked and stopped as early as possible from making any real legislative progress. Many of them have been to do with issues that badly needed legislation or required public debate and where reform was required.  There is an absolute need to recognise that Members of this House have a role to play in the legislative process.  It is very disappointing that in the proposals suggested for D&aacute;il reform, no special place is being given to the enactment of Bills of an important nature dealing with issues that need to be addressed but which Government does not have the time to address.  It should be open not only to Opposition parties but to backbench Deputies to publish legislation on issues of importance and it should not be regarded as a form of betrayal of the party if a backbencher from a Government party does so.  Legislation is enacted in other parliaments as a result of this system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In my past life in the D&aacute;il I published a large number of Private Members&rsquo; Bills and was successful in having a small number of those enacted and many others adopted by Government.  However, I regret that the clock seems to have <Col N="806"/>been turned back in that area rather than forward.</P>
        <P>I agree with previous speakers on the subject of D&aacute;il questions.  It is a sterile ritual dance located within a timeframe that undermines all concepts of accountability.  A specific time is allocated and the Minister gives a reply.  The Minister knows that the Opposition Deputy might succeed in asking one or two brief supplementary questions but the time is talked out.  There is no real concept of accountability and D&aacute;il questions have become largely a meaningless exercise outside Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  There is a need to reform the way D&aacute;il questions are being dealt with to ensure that a D&aacute;il question can truly make a Minister accountable and issues can be adequately explored.  The general public will be subject to more tribunals being created because it is only within tribunals, with lawyers asking questions, that real answers are given on issues of public importance if the system is not changed in that area.  This would undermine democracy.</P>
        <P>On my return to this House I am astonished to discover that a Member cannot get answers to serious questions about the running of the health service.  The HSE is an extra-parliamentary quango that operates within its own sphere and carries out about 75% to 80% of the functions that were formerly the functions of the Department of Health and Children.  The Minister&rsquo;s answer to most D&aacute;il questions is that it is not her responsibility but rather that of the HSE.  The HSE has a parliamentary office that may eventually send a written reply to a question.  However, the way to achieve parliamentary accountability for service failures is not with the initial reply but with the capacity to pursue questioning and the capacity to force Ministers, who are often reluctant, to give the full story of where things have gone wrong or what new action is required to be taken.  Receiving written responses from a huge, over-bureaucratic quango that cannot be furnished with a supplementary question or reply to same is an utter and complete waste of time and an undermining of the function of this House.</P>
        <P>The tyranny of the whipping system needs to be examined.  I agree this is easy to say from the Opposition benches.  The whipping system has turned Government backbenchers into what could best be described as parliamentary and legislative eunuchs.  They can talk about issues but they dare not do anything.  What happened in the case of the Shannon issue is a classic example.  There is a need to give and allow Government backbenchers a real parliamentary role as well as appreciating that Members of the House on the Opposition side should pay a real legislative role.  There is a need to take off the shackles.  It should be possible for Government backbenchers to support a Government of a particular complexion while legitimately proposing amendments to legislation or bringing forward new legislation or being critical of and voting against the Government on issues that are not fundamental to the <Col N="807"/>Government&rsquo;s survival.  There is a need to re-appraise our political ethics but there is an utter failure to do so because Government is comfortable with maintaining the current system.</P>
        <P>Many of the proposed reforms are simply about mechanics rather than substance.  The Ceann Comhairle has spoken of the need to provide greater information to the public about how our parliamentary system works.  He has committed himself, &ldquo;to encouraging further reform and modernisation of parliamentary services for Oireachtas Members and the public&rdquo;.  He cites a three-year strategic work programme.  However, this will not transform the public&rsquo;s view.  We need to transform our political ethics to allow Members of this House to play a real and true legislative function and to date there has been an abject failure to do so.</P>
        <P>The committees are seen as playthings of Government as a means of handing out political Smarties and Dolly Mixture gifts of chairmanships.  We required that in the Northern Ireland Assembly the committees and their officers would reflect the proportionality of the different parties.  It is a system that applies in many European parliaments.  The reason Government wants to appoint Chairs of committees is not to ensure that committees work properly but rather to ensure the Government of the day controls the committee system.  This was admitted by one of the Fianna F&aacute;il speakers.  The committees should be an arm of Parliament and not an arm of Government.  They should initiate legislation.  They should hold debate which is critical of Government and should not play the role of an arm of Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the dying days of the Twenty-Eight D&aacute;il, before the 2002 general election, a Private Members&rsquo; Bill passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Instead of it automatically being dealt with on Committee Stage in the relevant Oireachtas committee, the role of the Government-appointed chairman was to ensure it was never rostered.  It was never heard of again but disappeared into some type of parliamentary vacuum.  That is not good enough.</P>
        <P>Committees should be given a real role.  Let us establish a committee system in which the chairmanship of a committee is not about the support the Taoiseach of the day gets from backbenchers as a result of them being paid an extra &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000 per year on being appointed chairman or vice-chairman of a committee.  It is not about the Opposition parties sharing in the largesse.  It is about the committees and the officers of committees truly reflecting the proportionality of party and independent representation in the House and exercising a parliamentary function free of the control of Government.</P>
        <P>If we do not fundamentally reform how our Parliament operates, it will continue to be viewed cynically by the general public and seen as incapable of responding to issues of national <Col N="808"/>importance in the expected way.  Committees will remain largely the same talking shops &mdash; let us not pretend otherwise &mdash; in which Opposition and backbench Deputies engage, on occasion, in political-personal psychotherapy with each other about issues, knowing that the Government will, by and large, take absolutely no notice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>In the words of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, this is the national Parliament of Ireland.  It is in this Parliament&rsquo;s power to conduct its business as it wishes.  It is all very well to claim there are various limitations on the committees but in my time as a Member of the Oireachtas, both as a Senator and as a Deputy, I have never seen a member of the Government attempt to limit, direct or stifle the business of a committee.  On the contrary, I have seen Ministers made accountable and uncomfortable when brought before committees to explain a particular action or to defend a policy.</P>
        <P>I can give specific examples.  During the past five years I had the privilege of being a member of both the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The latter committee dealt with the issue of nuclear non-proliferation and Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.  Unanimity would be required in that group if the USA and India were to conclude a new nuclear arrangement, and Ireland would have a voice in that.  The committee had lengthy debates with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on that issue.  Similarly, on many occasions prior to and after EU Council meetings, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs were invited to meetings of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and were subject to rigorous scrutiny.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That leads to one of the main topics I wish to discuss, the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny.  In the Twenty-Ninth D&aacute;il approximately 2,183 draft EU legislative measures, comprising proposals or notices, were dealt with by the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny.  I was disappointed at the lack of media interest in that committee, given that it dealt with some of the most important new legislation due to be brought before the D&aacute;il.  That is not to blame the media.  Perhaps it was due to how the sub-committee&rsquo;s business was conducted and to the fact that much of it involved extremely technical information.  Nevertheless, there was hardly a peep on television, radio or in the print media about 2,183 draft EU legislative measures.  That is a serious issue because these measures are of immense relevance to the people.  They might not affect people this year or next year but they could five years hence.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Chief Whip and the Opposition will agree that we must seriously strengthen the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny.  I was delighted to hear the Minister tell the House that <Col N="809"/>the Government is committed to provide extra resources in terms of research, management and so forth for that committee.  In the past five years it had a very small staff, who did a brilliant job.  However, that situation was unacceptable.  Members should note that under the proposed new European Union reform treaty the role of national parliaments in scrutinising EU legislation is to be significantly strengthened.  That treaty might be signed by the Government in a few weeks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The mandate in the treaty provides for a strengthened role for national parliaments.  There will be an eight-week period in which national parliaments can offer a reasoned opinion on whether a Commission proposal respects the principle of subsidiarity.  If a proposal is contested by more than half of the Union&rsquo;s national parliaments, it will have to be re-examined and can be blocked by the Council of Ministers or the European Parliament.  The reform treaty will contain a protocol on the role of national parliaments.  The protocol, which was in the draft constitutional treaty, will require all Commission proposals to be forwarded directly to the national parliaments at the same time as they are sent to the Council and European Parliament.  The protocol also provides for interparliamentary co-operation within the Union, including meetings of parliamentary committees dealing with EU affairs.</P>
        <P>If the reform treaty becomes law, there will be an extraordinary new responsibility and opportunity for this Parliament to scrutinise EU legislation, to have dialogue with other national parliaments about proposed legislation and to initiate a new framework of discussion, debate and scrutiny of European matters.  More thought will have to be given by this Parliament to how we will participate in the new process envisaged by the reform treaty.</P>
        <P>I fundamentally disagree with many of the points made by the last speaker.  This is not a dysfunctional Parliament.  There are many mechanisms in the D&aacute;il to raise matters of national importance.  Last night, an important debate took place on the fire services arising out of events that took place only two weeks ago.  To claim that this Parliament is not capable of responding is simply incorrect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, I agree that far more resources must be allocated to staffing committees.  If a Member of the House wishes to draft legislation, it is extremely difficult to do so, given the technical complexities of modern law, both Irish and European.  There is no resource available to a Member of the House if he or she wishes to draft a Bill.  There is a legal adviser for the D&aacute;il who does an excellent job, but there is no team that a Member of the House can approach to seek help in drafting legislation or advice on the technical requirements of legislation.  There could be a greater role for ordinary Members and for committees in initiating legislation.  We have gone too far in following the UK model, where all legislation appears <Col N="810"/>to emanate from government.  In the United States, far more legislation originates from the floor of Congress, although it may be vetoed by the President.  Congress sees itself more as an initiator of legislation as opposed to the Executive arm initiating legislation.</P>
        <P>A new and welcome development is mobile phone technology whereby anybody can dial 01 6184000 and listen to proceedings in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with another number available for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I wish to publicise this because I am not sure whether the public are aware of it.  I hope I am allowed do so.</P>
        <P>This Chamber and the Seanad Chamber both have cameras.</P>

	<P>Cameras also record every committee.  It should not be beyond the bounds of possibility for all of these channels to be available on television so interested people can watch the committees discussing European affairs, housing or the environment.  This would greatly strengthen the committees.  The technology also exists for all of these channels to be viewed on mobile telephones.  Why not open it up and make proceedings, apart from those which are confidential and private, available through television to every citizen of the country?  The technology exists and the Chief Whip should examine this matter.</P>
        <P>I thank the Chief Whip for his speech.  More must be done but we have excellent committees and a strong D&aacute;il and we should not talk down our democracy which is in a healthy state.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to reflect on the number of appointments to be made and the context in which the committee system is structured.  The Constitution provides for 15 Members of Government.  We have 20 Ministers of State which is an extraordinary number.  If we ever have a pub quiz in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann the tie-breaker for members of the Government should be to name the Ministers of State and for the absolute clincher to also state what they are supposed to do.  Not even members of the Government who work with them know what they do apart from seven or eight important jobs.</P>
        <P>The Government proposes to increase the number of committees by three.  The list of 21 committees we will have does not include the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  We will have an extraordinary structure whereby each of the 21 committees will have at least three remunerated appointments.  In some cases the number is more but for the most part it is three. <Col N="811"/> The chairman, vice-chairman and convenor of each committee receive a stipend, and the total cost is approximately &euro;30,000 per committee.</P>
        <P>In addition we will have to find staff for the extra committees.  Unlike the HSE, an embargo probably does not apply to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  From my experience of being a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which are both serviced by excellent staff, I believe most committees have approximately two staff and various people are allocated to translate and transcribe records from time to time and for the hours the committee operates.</P>
        <P>The new committee structure will mean 63 paid posts, the lion&rsquo;s share of which will go to the Government with a smaller share going to Fine Gael and a tiny share going to the Labour Party.  This is called a &ldquo;payroll vote&rdquo; and one wonders what it is for.  Is it to make the Government Deputies who receive the stipends work harder?  I work with people in Government all the time on committees and I know how hard many of them work.  This is not about them.  It is about the designs of the Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>Several weeks ago when the motion of confidence in the Taoiseach was put to the House I found the reply of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, interesting.  While the power was draining away from the Taoiseach, when Deputy Cowen spoke to the thrill of the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenches one could feel in the atmosphere that this was their man speaking and the paradigm of power had shifted.  He stated he valued loyalty above all else and fair dues.  Is the loyalty in this &ldquo;payroll vote&rdquo; to be purchased at the taxpayers&rsquo; expense?  Many Fianna F&aacute;il people of great talent have been overlooked in recent years.  Committee appointments are a way of rewarding and keeping people quiescent and if they are made chairmen they may live to fight another day.  It is hard on people who put a great deal of effort into the D&aacute;il not to get preferment when their party is in power.  All of us are aware of this difficulty.</P>
        <P>According to the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report, in recent years approximately 450 quangos have been created.  These bodies, such as the HSE, barely report to the D&aacute;il.  I do not know where they are in the reforms suggested by the Chief Whip.  People from the HSE are not accountable, least of all to the people in the D&aacute;il or in committee and this is the worst of all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Joan Burton for sharing time.  I read the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution with interest and aspects of it are well worth noting.  I am interested to see how we might expand and enhance the issue of e-consultation to introduce a level of public involvement in the work of the committees.  It was done with the Committee on European Affairs when <Col N="812"/>we held the week on European affairs, raised European issues in the D&aacute;il and devoted our time entirely to them.  It was extremely useful.</P>
        <P>I welcome the establishment of the joint committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is overdue and can only be beneficial.  I am somewhat perplexed by the committee on the constitutional amendment regarding children considering we will also have a committee on children which surely could do the work proposed for the committee on the constitutional amendment.  It could deal with its broader work when the constitutional amendment has been dealt with and it seems an unnecessary replication.</P>
        <P>I am glad to see the establishment of a joint administrative committee through linking the Joint Services Committee and the Sub-Committee on Members&rsquo; Services.  I also welcome the further enhancement of the work of the European affairs committee which is clearly necessary in terms of resources, staffing, advisory work and training due to the enormous amount of scrutiny required for the extra legislative proposals coming from Europe.</P>
        <P>My problem with this is that much of it will be wasted because of the committees&rsquo; lack of real power.  Every Member of the House should have the right to be on a committee.  Why should any Member whether part of a large, small or no group be denied membership of committees?  Unless one is a member of a large group one will not be made a member of any committee.  This is wrong.  The committee system should be integral for every Member and should be re-examined.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Perhaps I can give an example of the committee of which I was a member, the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  Five months have passed since the election and that committee has not been established &mdash; the position is similar with all other committees.  In the coming weeks and months we will face probably the biggest single legislative decision that will be taken in the five years of this Government, namely, the reform treaty.  The Government will nail its colours to the mast by the end of next week on where it stands on the substantive proposals in that treaty without as yet a full commitment to debate in the House prior to that decision.  There is no opportunity for the committee to scrutinise the proposals in advance because it has not been set up.  Ireland is the only country in the EU that will put that matter to the people by way of a referendum without prior consultation with the people.  The Taoiseach has given a confused commitment to a debate without saying it will definitely take place next week.  I hope it takes place next week but it should have been part and parcel of the committee system so that it could have been debated properly.</P>
        <P>The enhanced resources that will be given to the European affairs committee are being given in such a way that, while welcome, it is like clos<Col N="813"/>ing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  One of the last items of legislation passed in the last D&aacute;il was European affairs legislation that transferred proper legislative scrutiny in this House to the line Minister.  From now legislation coming from Europe will be subject to a rubber stamp by way of a ministerial order.  The relevant Minister will look at it and, unless it is of major character, will stamp it into domestic legislation and place it in the Library.  If nobody objects within three weeks it will be the law of this country.  We are being given extra resources but already the deal will be done and we will have had very little control over it.</P>
        <P>We need to look carefully at the role of the committee system and how its powers can be enhanced.  We have an extremely strong Executive but we have a weak committee system in terms of real power.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to refer to a couple of items raised by Deputy Costello, including the question of e-consultation.  I agree this is a matter that should be developed.  In this regard I commend the Chief Whip, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Tom Kitt, for pioneering the e-consultation process in the Broadcasting Bill, with the co-operation of the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the good work of Deputy Noel O&rsquo;Flynn, committee chairman, and his staff.  The Chief Whip, Deputy Tom Kitt, has set out a commitment to further promote e-consultation with a view to improving the transparency of the workings of this Parliament, giving greater access to all people, in particular, students and teachers, and widening it as an educational tool so that people are more educated in our workings.</P>
        <P>Deputy Costello said everyone should be members of committees, but it would be totally unwieldy to have 165 people going to a committee room to vote on each amendment to a Bill.  Having said that, every Member is entitled to attend committee meetings and to contribute at those meetings in whatever way they wish to do so.  Certainly in the justice committee, Members of the D&aacute;il who were not members of the committee regularly attended and contributed in a positive way to the proceedings of the committee.  I understand also that Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett mentioned that the heads of Bills are not discussed at committees.  Deputy Barrett was away from the House for a few years and certainly in the last D&aacute;il the heads of a number of Bills, including the Criminal Justice Bill and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, were given to all members of the justice committee for discussion before the Bill was published.  The heads were given on the basis that the committee would contribute and suggest amendments, even at that stage, before the Bill was published.</P>
        <P>Why is there a need for committees?  Committees are very effective and allow us to carry on <Col N="814"/>the legislative work we have been elected to do.  More often than not in the D&aacute;il, the debate is between Ministers and the Front Bench spokespersons of the various parties.  Certainly at committees every member is allowed, entitled and enabled to contribute positively to the legislation that is going through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It also provides opportunities for Members to get stuck into the job of legislation and reports related to the committee of which they are members.  It also allows backbench Members to shine in particular areas whereas that opportunity is not provided in the Houses.</P>
        <P>I was very honoured to be appointed by the Taoiseach to the Committee of Public Accounts when I became a Member in 1997 and as chairman of the justice committee in 2000.  Not everybody got that opportunity but certainly it made a difference in the way I was able to work in the D&aacute;il and get things done and in the way my electorate perceived me as a legislator and a positive influence in developing the laws of the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the Committee of Public Accounts people were brought to account in terms of the DIRT inquiry whereas they cannot be brought to account here.  The Chief Whip, Deputy Tom Kitt, referred to the great work done by the late Jim Mitchell as chairman.  I was fortunate to have been a member of the DIRT inquiry.  It was memorable to see on television, bankers brought to book publicly and made answerable for what had happened in their institutions.  The Chief Whip also mentioned the new method of looking at Estimates and output statements.  This was developed at the Committee of Public Accounts by its members.</P>
        <P>One of the big items that must be addressed again is a public inquiry into matters of great public interest.  Unfortunately, as a result of the Abbeylara inquiry in the Twenty-eighth D&aacute;il, a difficulty has arisen in relation to the limitations that have been put on Members by the Constitution and the courts.  Since then, certainly in the justice committee, there have been a number of inquiries and hearings: the Barron inquiries into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the Dublin bombings, the murder of Seamus Ludlow and the bombings in Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk.  These were four separate inquiries.  The first day of the hearings on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings when the victims came and told their stories was one of the most telling days ever in Leinster House.  That happened through the committee system.  It was very worthwhile not only for the country, but particularly for the people who were affected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The committee covering the justice brief met 317 times in the lifetime of the last D&aacute;il and completed a considerable amount of business.  One issue it addressed, as do other committees, was EU scrutiny.  One of the strands that wove its way through the justice, home affairs and criminal justice discussions was the question of civil law versus common law.  We have recently had ques<Col N="815"/>tions during Leaders' Questions and at Question Time on opting in or out of certain justice and home affairs issues.  This matter can and should be discussed at committee.  It is done best in that setting as it gets the total attention of all the members of the committee.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Garda Commissioner, who was unseen around Leinster House for many years, has become very amenable to the justice committee.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill was improved dramatically following discussions at the committee.  The Garda Commissioner now appears regularly before the committee.</P>
        <P>The issue of international crime is continually to the forefront, particularly regarding drugs.  The issue of the international arrest warrant and of evidence being gathered in one country and used in another&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The committee system presents an opportunity for individual Members to delve into areas of particular interest to them.  This has been used by members of the Opposition.  I refer to excellent reports on restorative justice, child care and community policing that were prepared by Opposition Members.  They gave rise to excellent reviews in the media and highlighted and improved the profile of the rapporteurs in those matters.</P>
        <P>The Disability Bill was improved because of the committees.  All the interested parties who were affected or who represented people who would be directly affected by the Bill appeared before the committee and said their piece in the presence of senior civil servants and the Minister.  They were listened to, the Bill was amended and improvements came about as a result.  It had a very positive effect.  A number of committees have similar results that could be enunciated and I commend the establishment of all the committees outlined.  I look forward to them being very successful for the benefit not only of this House, but also of all citizens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome today&rsquo;s debate.  It is important, before the committees are established, to have an opportunity at plenary session to raise some of these issues.  I welcome what the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, had to say in his opening remarks, which I read in detail.  I wish to take up the issue Deputy Ardagh referred to in the course of his contribution.  It is fair to say that the high point of the Oireachtas committee system since it was introduced in a comprehensive way in the 1990s was the DIRT <Col N="816"/>inquiry report, commissioned by the then chairperson, former Deputy Jim Mitchell, and his colleagues.  Deputy Ardagh was also a member of that committee.  The reason it was a high point was that it managed to capture the public&rsquo;s imagination.  For the first time in a long time politicians were able to take direct responsibility for something that had gone wrong away from the tribunals and the senior counsels, and without the grotesque sums of money that we are pouring into the inquiry system.  It was possible because the issue of public concern effectively did not involve a direct clash between Government and Opposition.</P>
        <P>That model had limitations placed on it by the Abbeylara ruling.  Sooner rather than later we will need to return to the Supreme Court decision on the Abbeylara inquiry.  If we are serious about instituting inquiries within the House which are of public concern, we must ensure that our powers are such that we can draw specific conclusions either on individuals or on facts.  The limitations caused by the Abbeylara ruling have never really been revisited by this House or the other House in terms in how we might change the way in which the committee system operates.  That model of instituting inquiries of public concern by experienced parliamentarians is the most successful model and is one we need to replicate.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a number of proposals which would greatly help the proceedings in this House.  On becoming British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown instituted a number of reforms in the House of Commons as a means of trying to get over what was seen to be a very restrictive ten years under the former Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, whose presidential style did not lend itself to ensuring the Parliament was given all the powers it should have had.  The Government could introduce one reform tomorrow.  If the Government wants to make any major statement of public importance on an issue or a policy initiative, it makes that policy announcement at a press conference in Government Buildings.  No parliament in the world would accept that position.</P>
        <P>I suggest to the Chief Whip that when the Government or individual Ministers choose to make major public policy announcements, they should do so here on the floor of the House.  Thursday afternoon could be given over to specific announcements by the Government on a new policy area.  The media would be invited and they would attend.  We should allow an opportunity for the Opposition to make a statement on the policy announcement.  I do not even object to the notion that some contents of the announcement might be leaked the night before provided that the announcement is made in the House rather than at a press conference in Government Buildings with none of us present.</P>
        <P>It completely demeans Parliament to have a Minister make major policy announcement outside the House.  Ministers would not get away with that in the House of Commons or in many <Col N="817"/>other parliaments in the world.  If we are really serious about doing something about parliamentary accountability, let those statements be made in the House.  The Minister, the Opposition and the media should be here.  The only reason for the media not to attend here is that the statement has already been made at a press conference.  It is completely demeaning to the notion of parliamentary accountability and is a matter to which we need to return.</P>
        <P>Another reform would be to give additional power to our Speaker.  At the moment at Question Time, probably the most important time in the week in terms of grilling the Minister, making sure he or she knows his or her brief and making sure that issues are raised, the Ceann Comhairle does not have the power to direct the Minister to answer a question with the result that we get these Gettysburg-type addresses by Ministers following the format of two minutes, three minutes and two minutes again, which do not answer the questions posed.  At no stage can the Ceann Comhairle intervene to tell the Minister he or she is not answering the question the Deputy has raised.  Let us institute that reform rather than letting the Ceann Comhairle be more than happy to allow this game to continue as the mini speeches that are all written by civil servants are read into the record of the House.</P>
        <P>Another reform should be introduced to address the issue of the many quangos established in recent years.  Deputy Burton has stated 400 different agencies have been given various powers, thus providing another opportunity for Ministers to avoid answering a straight question.  Had many of the relevant questions been posed and answered honestly 15 years ago, the beef tribunal would never have happened.  Many of the tribunals currently sitting may not have been established if Parliament had demanded straight answers from the relevant Ministers, who were accountable to this House.  That reform could be made at relatively small pain to the Executive.</P>
        <P>If one ever wanted to see jobbery in action, one need look no further than our committee system, which ensures the Government backbenches are kept quiet.  It is the greatest scandal in the House that in excess of 50 Members are put on the payroll to serve on a committee.  They do so as a means of keeping in with the Government and the Government is happy because it keeps these Members on side.  However, someone must cry &ldquo;halt&rdquo; to this.   The winner takes all principle whereby all these positions are given to the Government parties is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>With regard to the number of committees, I am totally opposed to the establishment of a joint committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  That is a plenary matter for the House and it should not be hived off to a committee.  This is an international agreement between two sovereign states and the political parties in Northern Ireland.  For what purpose is the Government suggesting the committee should <Col N="818"/>sit?  If the Government was serious, I would have no difficulty supporting a North-South parliamentary tier, as provided for in the Agreement.  It would be good if parliamentarians in the Assembly and the Oireachtas could put Ministers through hoops.  Currently, there is no parliamentary accountability for the decisions taken by the North-South Ministerial Council and the actions that follow.  A North-South parliamentary tier is needed, which would at least ensure the Executive would have to reply to questions about actions taken in our name on a North-South basis.</P>
        <P>Will the Chief Whip consider the establishment of a committee that would review Government appointments to major public posts?  A committee should be set up where Members of both Houses could put appointees through their paces before they take up a position.  A hearing should take place to ensure the person is suitable rather than being plucked from obscurity to take up these highly paid posts.  In America, individuals who take up significant government jobs must go through a hearing system.  It would be good for the person to account for whether he or she is qualified for the post at a public session of a committee of the House and to take questions from Members of both Houses.  That would be useful and it would provide added value to the committee system.</P>

	<P>I was almost tempted to give the previous speaker a few minutes of my time.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I compliment my friend and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, on his clear efforts in this regard.  Many Members will have been impressed by his contribution, which was very accommodating.  It was good that he acknowledged the contribution made to the establishment of the committee system by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, when he served as Minister for the Environment.  The debate gives an opportunity to pay tribute to the staff of the Oireachtas who service the Houses and the committees in such a professional way and I am grateful to them for their efforts in that regard.</P>
        <P>I normally do not rise to Opposition comments but a number of contributions by Opposition Members have been entertaining.  Deputy Shatter made a comparison between Government backbenchers and eunuchs.  I do not mean to be flippant but when I was first elected five years ago to replace my predecessor, former Deputy Chris Flood, many people said I would have a comfortable experience if I sat on the Opposition benches and was able to ask questions about everything and raise issues on every subject under the then Standing Order 31 and so on, but I was, and still am, quite happy to sit on the Government benches.  Life might be different and more comfortable on the Opposition benches.</P>

	<P>That is kind of the Deputy.  One of his more famous colleagues told me prior to the election that I would make a very good Opposition Deputy but it is not something I would like to do.  I am very comfortable on the Government benches.  Perhaps some colleagues have been on the Opposition benches too long to understand what is like to be a Government backbencher but I have spoken out on issues of concern to my community.  I have not been afraid to raise issues or make radical points.  However, the myth persists that Government backbenchers should troop through the Opposition lobbies during divisions which is a nonsense.  The public does not believe that should happen anymore.  It is unhelpful to the debate that every now and then Opposition Members say Government Deputies should vote against the Government.  That is a nonsense and I will never do that.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers referred to the image of the Parliament and the work done in the House.  RTE does its best with &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; and other programmes cover the business of the House.  However, much of our proceedings is not covered, particularly committee work.  I agree with colleagues who said the Chief Whip&rsquo;s office should redouble its efforts to interest the media in the work of the committees.  Many important issues are raised by committees and good work is done, which deserves more coverage.  Constituents will always say they were watching television and there were only two or three Members in the House during a debate, which creates a different image.</P>
        <P>I have sympathy for Deputy Brian Hayes.  The Minister of State has expressed his interest in scheduling a slot to discuss current issues in the House and this also relates to the ability of Government Deputies to raise issues.  Very few Government Deputies raise issues under Standing Order 32 and the relevancy of these issues is a subject for debate.  For examples, I could raise issues on every street in Tallaght every day under Standing Order 32 but where would that get me?  I have sympathy with the notion that we change our system somewhat.</P>
        <P>We all welcome the opportunity given to us by the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office to seek Adjournment debates.  When debates are granted, the Minister will come into the House with a prepared script, which is needed to provide information, but the debates do not work.  I have pressed many issues on behalf of my constituents on the Adjournment.  When I am bored I watch the television coverage of the House of Commons, for example, during Prime Minister&rsquo;s Question Time.  I watched it yesterday and it was riveting television.  The coverage is also <Col N="820"/>interesting on other occasions.  The speaker calls for contributions from the floor and members of all parties stand and are called by him or her.  I am not sure exactly how the process works but it seems to be some type of rotation system.  This means that Government MPs also have an opportunity to raise issues in this quick-fire way.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to be too radical but some variation of this procedure would assist parliamentary business and would be helpful for all Members.  Government Deputies are always in the position of being somewhat constrained while their colleagues on the Opposition benches can raise all types of issues.  We are obliged to find ways to get around this and I, for example, approach the Taoiseach and Ministers on a regular basis.  I strongly support reform of D&aacute;il procedures along the lines the Minister of State has indicated to make it easier for Members to ask questions about current issues.  I hope I offend nobody in saying that most of us are agreed that the Adjournment debate has become somewhat dated and that a different system is required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the past five years I had the honour of being a member of the Oireachtas Committees on Social and Family Affairs and Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights and, more recently, Government Whip on the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  The work of these committees sometimes goes unnoticed.  Deputy Ardagh, the excellent Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, has spoken about the volume of good work done by that committee, with particular reference to the restorative justice report.  This was a radical project that was piloted in Tallaght and in the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor&rsquo;s, constituency in Nenagh.  It showed how an Oireachtas committee could work well and in an innovative way.</P>
        <P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children has also gained in importance in recent times.  Like Deputy Naughten, I have a lengthy record of service on the former health board in my area.  My views on recent changes in this area are on the record and I will not say something different today.  Under the old health board system, our questions were answered and politicians from all parties were given notice of current and potential issues.  That no longer happens.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children has played a crucial role for Members in filling some of the gaps in information.  It has, for instance, been able to summon Professor Brendan Drumm and other officials and has facilitated progress on all sides.</P>
        <P>Life in the Chamber generally requires one to be part of the political game.  At committee level, however, the relationships between Members from different parties are such that valuable work is regularly done.  This is why I object to criticism of the committee system.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, is conceding that changes could be made for the benefit of the <Col N="821"/>system.  I hope he continues on the road on which he has embarked.  He has great support, including from Members on the other side of the House, even though they must play the game as they see fit.  The Minister of State is on the right track and I wish him well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the debate on this important matter.  It is helpful that we have an opportunity to discuss the issues before any final decisions are made.  It is a pity this was not formerly structured into the agenda for the House at the beginning of a session.  I acknowledge the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal for this debate.  However, I ask the Minister of State to agree to a second debate on the issue of D&aacute;il reform other than that specifically dealing with committees.</P>
        <P>Some seven years ago, in autumn 2000, the Joint Committee on Education and Science produced a report on science and technology, which was drafted by myself and Mr. John Bruton.  One of the proposals we put forward was that there should be a specific Oireachtas committee to deal with science and technology.  I understand we are the only country in the EU that does not have a parliamentary forum to deal specifically with this area.  An <i>ad hoc</i> committee of Oireachtas Members was established during the last D&aacute;il by Science Foundation Ireland but this did not involve any formal Oireachtas structure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I urge the Minister of State and the Taoiseach, prior to finalising any decisions on the new committee system, to give serious consideration to such a forum for discussing issues of science and technology.  The Taoiseach, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other Ministers have pointed out <i>ad nauseam</i> that we must upskill the workforce if our economy is to continue to thrive.  Investment in science and technology and research and development is vital in this regard.  In fairness to the Government, it has, in the past five years, recognised this as a fundamental cornerstone of the future development of the economy.  Following a lack of action in this area, significant funding has been ring-fenced for this purpose in the past five years.</P>
        <P>However, there is no formalised Oireachtas structure for supervising and monitoring efforts in this area.  Each D&aacute;il committee has a role to play in this regard but there must be a dedicated committee to oversee activities.  The rainbow Government included a Minister of State, who sat at Cabinet, with specific responsibility for this agenda.  We considered it an extremely important issue.  If we are to ensure our economy remains strong in the medium to long term, the Government must recognise that science and technology will be the cornerstone of industrial development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a significant problem within our education system in that many young people do not continue with science subjects after they complete their junior certificate.  Recent data on the State examinations show that pass rates in science <Col N="822"/>subjects have fallen back at both ordinary and higher level, as have participation rates.  We must put science and technology on the political agenda and in the public domain through the establishment of a dedicated Oireachtas committee.  There is a significant advantage in doing so in that the majority of its members will not come from a science or technology background.  This will force the scientific community, for the first time, to communicate to ordinary individuals what their objectives are, the activities they are undertaking and the ultimate goal of the research in which they are engaged.  If they are obliged to attend regular meetings of a dedicated Oireachtas committee, they will have to come up with means of communicating that information to the public in general.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From time to time, we in this House scratch at the surface of the debate surrounding genetic engineering and biotechnology.  There is major controversy regarding the ever-changing position of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on these issues.  This is an area that could be dealt with by a dedicated Oireachtas committee.  The issue of human genetic engineering encompasses the question of how to deal with embryos.  We have perhaps the most liberal laws in the world in terms of the treatment of embryos.  None of this has been formally debated by the Oireachtas.  A certain amount has been done by the Joint Committee on Health and Children and those issues could be thrashed out.</P>
        <P>One of the bigger problems we have is a lack of public awareness of science and scientific opportunities.  There is innate fear in the public mind of new technology.  We remember the debate on the erection of mobile telephone masts some years ago, when Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke was the Minister and Deputy Stagg was the spokesperson on the Labour side.  We were dragged around the country and brought before public meetings where alleged scientific experts threw out information, none of which could be validated.  They declared themselves experts and were paid by local community groups to make presentations.  If we had one committee to deal with such matters, the truth could come out, warts and all.  People could debate the issues with the full facts available.  Sadly, this is not happening with the current structure.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to consider this before a final decision is made on the structure of committees.  This is now the only Parliament in Europe without a specific committee dealing with those issues.  Such a committee has been set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis with a number of Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad participating in the process facilitated by Science Foundation Ireland, but it should be put on a formal structure, with meetings held in the public domain rather than behind closed doors, which is the case now.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss the handling of European legislation by Oireachtas committees.  If any of us put hand on heart, we would call what goes on at <Col N="823"/>these meetings a farce, with important European legislation being rubber-stamped.  This happens because of a lack of resources to deal with such legislation and difficulty with timing in physically accommodating committees.</P>
        <P>It is appalling to think that large volumes of European legislation coming through the committee structure are not being teased out.  It is easy enough for some committees to deal with these matters because they do not have many rules and regulations from Brussels to consider, but others must examine a significant amount.</P>
        <P>I sat on two separate committees in the lifetime of the last D&aacute;il.  The transport committee had adequate time to deal with European legislation because the volume of rules and regulations coming from Brussels to be considered by that committee was manageable.  Deputy Johnny Brady was the chairman of the agriculture committee and can verify the volumes of legislation the committee had to consider.  We had quite a heavy workload regardless of this but no additional resources were provided to deal specifically with European legislation.  It is wrong to state the committee structure is currently dealing with European legislation when it is not.  Action should be taken to ensure European legislation is examined in more detail.</P>
        <P>Oireachtas committees do valuable work in producing reports.  I mentioned the Joint Committee on Education and Science&rsquo;s role with science and technology and I was involved in a report by that committee on school transport.  It dealt with the bus tragedy in County Meath and thankfully the Minister for Education and Science is beginning to implement recommendations, eight years after the report was published.  These recommendations are particularly relevant when one considers the Meath tragedy and others.</P>
        <P>The committees should have the opportunity to produce reports and these reports should bring action from the Government.  At least, the Government should report back, indicating why it is implementing or not implementing recommendations.</P>

	<P>We have an excellent committee system, of which we can all be very proud.  As with anything else in life, there are elements which can be approved.</P>
        <P>I thank the Chief Whip, Deputy Tom Kitt, who is in charge of all committees.  He does remarkable work in setting them up and organising them.  It is not an easy job and I can imagine the hardship and stress he must go through.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy Johnny Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no better man than the Minister of State to oversee the work.</P>
        <P>I compliment the members of the last Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food on their work over the past five years.  Deputy Naughten is gone now but he was the Fine Gael spokesperson, with Deputy Upton being the Labour Party spokesperson.  They were a very easy pair to work with and they worked in the best interests of agriculture and food every time they got up to speak.  I was lucky the committee had such an excellent group of people.  Former Deputy Ollie Wilkinson, who unfortunately did not return to this D&aacute;il, did an enormous amount of work on a report on early farm retirement.  As chairman, I was very lucky to have three different clerks over that period who were excellent staff.  I thank the Minister and Ministers of State, as well as officials who came to discuss various issues over that time.</P>
        <P>The main areas where I seek an improvement in committees are in making the process more open, encouraging committees to be more flexible and innovative and improving the image and understanding of committees in the general community.  Committees now constitute a major part of the Oireachtas framework.  The structure of the existing system allows for a more flexible and transparent approach to scrutiny outside the more formal platforms of the D&aacute;il and Seanad Chambers.</P>
        <P>Public access to the political process has been greatly increased thanks to the committee system.  Committees are an invaluable tool for the Houses of the Oireachtas and statistics reveal the importance of their role.  Last year there were 531 committee meetings, 191 published reports and 1,215 witnesses gave evidence.  It is interesting that committees sit more hours than the D&aacute;il and Seanad combined.</P>
        <P>If people are to contribute to a committee inquiry they must know that the process is being conducted fairly and honestly, their contribution is being considered seriously and the process leads to an end result they can see.  A report in Australia into the system of committees drew some interesting conclusions, some of which we could perhaps take on board here.  For example, the House should formalise procedures for interaction with witnesses by a resolution setting out the rights and obligations of witnesses and com<Col N="825"/>mittee members.  Summary information about the procedures should be made widely available and provided as a matter of course to those giving evidence to a committee.</P>
        <P>A committee should be empowered to authorise some or all of its members to give regular briefings to the press about progress and to publish, with the approval of the chairman, a summary report prior to the tabling of the full report in the House.  Improved opportunities should be made to debate committee reports and Government responses to them, and the House, through Standing Orders, should impose a requirement on the Government to respond to committee reports within four months.  The committees should publish such Government responses as are tabled on their website.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in thanking the Chief Whip and Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, for organising and facilitating this debate.  I approach this debate slightly differently from previous speakers in that I was involved with a group which made a presentation to an Oireachtas committee before I became a Deputy.  The group to which I refer made a presentation on the reform of the rules relating to gas connections in small towns.  Our appearance before the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources was facilitated by its then Chairman, Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn, and Senator MacSharry.  We were able to make our case in a coherent manner and we were challenged by Members in respect of it.  This ensured that our case had to be perfect and what we said provoked a major change in Government policy which has allowed many smaller towns to be connected to gas supplies.</P>
        <P>My experience at the time showed me how the committee system can work, particularly when individual committees are given specific briefs and engage with organisations and people making cases, be they related to economic or other matters.  The interaction between the delegation of which I was a member and members of the committee was a welcome surprise and represents the way forward.</P>
        <P>I note the wariness of many long-serving Members regarding committees.  I watched the contributions of previous speakers on the monitor and I thought it ironic that the wariness to which I refer seems to be most pronounced among those who may have taken a break from the proceedings of the House during the past five years.  These people have returned and are stating that nothing has changed.  We must engage in a process to make things change.</P>
        <P>I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Johnny Brady and others stated in respect of introducing reforms.  The key point is that we must examine the legal basis of the committees so that we can avoid issues which get in the way of what they are trying to do.  I refer, for example, to the work carried out in respect of the Curtin <Col N="826"/>report and the report into the Abbeylara shooting.  I do not know whether it is a job for the Minister of State or the Ceann Comhairle but an examination should be carried out into the legal basis on which we establish committees to ensure that the issues they consider in the public interest can be investigated without fear of their work being blocked by legal action.  If a constitutional change is required, we should use as a deadline for completing the examination to which I refer the two referendums due to take place next year in order that we can strengthen the legal basis of the committees and thereby underscore the legal standing of the work of the Houses.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers made many proposals regarding the profile of committees and some stated that no one pays attention to what we are doing.  There was a great deal of comment about the lack of media participation.  If one looks around the Chamber and, with respect to Members opposite, takes account of the hullabaloo and disagreement regarding committees, there is not necessarily a queue of people lining up to listen to or participate in a debate on those committees.</P>
        <P>I would be wary of Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s proposals regarding Oireachtas television.  There are already enough people lining up to have a go at the proceedings of the House and the work we do here without giving them what would be the inevitably low viewership figures for such a television channel to support their case.  Comments were made to the effect that the state of democracy and the level of accountability in this country are declining.  However, the ultimate measure of the state of democracy is the turnout at a general election.  We have bucked the trend in this regard and more people are participating in the process of electing Members to the Houses.  I would be wary of establishing a dedicated TV station because on each occasion it emerged, the ratings would be used as a stick to beat us in respect of the work we do.</P>
        <P>I share other Members frustration regarding the unaccountability of certain bodies but I do not wish to become involved in a debate on who did or did not establish such bodies.  I receive letters once a week from the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office to the effect that I cannot table certain questions because the matters in question are relevant to particular bodies.  The committee structure must be reviewed in order that representatives of organisations such as the HSE, the NRA etc. can be summoned to appear on a regular basis.  When it is up and running, I hope the health committee will invite the management of the HSE to appear forthwith in order that we might investigate what is happening in respect of the health service.</P>
        <P>Deputy Brian Hayes and others referred to jobs for the boys and for Government backbenchers.  Do I take it from their comments that members of the Opposition are no longer seeking additional positions as chairmen and vice chair<Col N="827"/>men of committees because they are not interested in those jobs but are rather only concerned with the actual work of committees?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>If the answer to my question is yes, we should get the arguments regarding particular bodies out of the way, get the committees up and running and get down to the work the people elected us to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the House that this debate was arranged on foot of a demand made by my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  I thank the Government for acceding to that demand.</P>
        <P>Deputy Calleary made a thoughtful contribution but when he has served for a period in the House, he will realise the importance of media coverage.  I will discuss that matter further in a moment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Michael D. Higgins dealt with the issue of accountability and the need therefor.  He referred to the power of the people, through this Parliament, in our democratic republic and the right and duty of these Houses to ensure that the Executive is scrutinised and kept accountable.  The Deputy also referred to the absolute necessity to ensure that committees are not seen or used as the instruments of the Executive.  He argued eloquently against the democratic deficit created by the transfer of power from the people, as represented in this Parliament, to a clatter of quangos &mdash; 450 of which, as another speaker stated, were established in the past five years &mdash; composed of faceless, unknown and unaccountable people.  The Deputy further argued that neither Ministers nor this Parliament have the right to deprive citizens of their powers and rights as enshrined in the people&rsquo;s Constitution.  I strongly support the arguments made by Deputy Michael D. Higgins in this regard.</P>
        <P>It must be unique in the history of humanity that a group of individuals &mdash; namely, this Parliament and its Executive &mdash; entrusted with power by the people has, on a voluntary basis, divested itself of this power and thereby disempowered the people.  I am not a great historian but I am aware that wars were fought to protect such power.  However, our Parliament and its Executive seems to have surrendered it without firing a shot.  However, there may be light at the end of the tunnel in that regard.  I refer to the recent statement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the effect that rule by quango is not the way in which any country should be ruled.  I hope this is a signal that the Government is giving serious consideration to reclaiming for the people the rights that <Col N="828"/>were given away when the quangos were established.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment now on the nuts and bolts issues relating to the committees, namely, how they are formed, how they are constituted and how they operate.  The Government Chief Whip sent me and others the Government&rsquo;s proposals for the establishment of the committees, joint and select.  These require the setting up of a total of 21 committees, comprising the 18 existing committees and three new ones.  The Government&rsquo;s proposals require that every Fianna F&aacute;il backbencher, including Deputy Calleary, will serve as a committee chairman, vice chairman or convenor.  These are all paid positions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterKellyFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a great idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking here not just about membership of committees but about paid positions to be taken up by Government backbenchers, who will have to double up on their workloads to fill the places.  No one will be left out.  Like &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; under Gay Byrne&rsquo;s stewardship, there will be something for everyone in the audience.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be something for Fine Gael and the Labour Party as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>We are elected to this House on the basis of proportional representation.  On two occasions Fianna F&aacute;il tried to do away with that system but the people gave it their answer on both occasions.  If the committees are to be truly representative of the make-up of the House, their membership should accurately reflect the numbers in the groups and parties in the D&aacute;il.  Fine Gael has argued in favour of this approach in so far as the positions of chairmen, vice chairmen and convenors are concerned.  However, that argument, which is entirely valid in so far as it goes, must also be applied to the membership of the committees.  The application of this proportional principle would change the proposed membership and officership of the committees from that envisaged under the grab-all proposal put forward by the Minister of State on the Government&rsquo;s behalf.</P>
        <P>I will be specific and comment on the position of the Labour Party because others are well able to speak for themselves.  If the proportional principle to which I refer is applied, Labour Party Members would be entitled to two chairmanships, two vice chairmanships and two convenorships.  We would take those jobs and we would do them well.  What is on offer at present &mdash; one or possibly one chairmanship, possibly two vice chairmanships and no convenorships &mdash; falls below our representational entitlement.  The Labour Party would also be entitled to 23 of the Opposition places on the proposed committees as opposed to the 16 places on offer from the Government.  I say to Fine Gael that if the proportional principle <Col N="829"/>case is applied in the case of officers, it should also be applied to the membership of the committees.  I wrote to the Government Chief Whip outlining the Labour Party&rsquo;s position and I would welcome further discussion on the matter before it is finalised.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I also add my voice to others in the House in seeking proper facilities for the committees to allow them to do their work effectively.  I expect Government spokespersons and backbenchers to praise the committees and say how wonderful they are.  The Government is doing less of that and is, I believe, examining how they can be improved.  In particular, since the appointments to the committees have not been made, I expect Government backbenchers to be generous in their praise of the Government Chief Whip, who will be keeping an eye on them to see what they are saying and what committees or positions might be fit for them.  They will all get a position under the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt&rsquo;s proposal.</P>
        <P>In this day and age, it should be possible for a committee of this House to produce its minutes &mdash; a record of its proceedings &mdash; in a time period shorter than three months.  The lowliest town council in the country can produce its minutes in a week.  Most councils post their minutes on the Internet within hours of proceedings but it takes up to three months to produce the minutes in this House, with all its technical backup and resources.</P>
        <P>It is only a matter of reorganising the resources we are applying to the committees.  I do not attend committees very often because that is not my particular job in the House but when I do, I notice a glass box behind the Chairman.  There is a group of people sitting inside this glass box and I do not know what they do.  I could not see them do anything while I was there except look at us.  I think they have something to do with the recording but I thought machines like that were automatic nowadays and would record regardless of whether people looked at them.  There seems to be a group of between two and three people sitting there.  Perhaps if that particular resource was applied to actually recording and producing the minutes, we would have them in a shorter period of time than three months.</P>
        <P>I strongly suggest to the Government that we have a dedicated television channel similar to C-SPAN in the US which would broadcast the proceedings of this House and its committees and would also cover local authorities and other public service areas.  This proposal has been on the agenda for a long time.  When he was Chief Whip of the Workers&rsquo; Party a long time ago, Deputy Pat Rabbitte was the first person I heard propose this measure.  It was not rejected then and should not be rejected now and I believe the Government is seriously considering it.  We should act on this proposal.  We are already filming the proceedings, which is the main cost.  I believe we have also been allocated 60 television <Col N="830"/>slots through the satellite system for Ireland Incorporated.  The Government is entitled to and may have reserved three of these for D&aacute;il proceedings.  This is a very good idea and should be acted on quickly and put into the public domain.</P>
        <P>Reference has been made to the lower viewership.  I accept that there is a lower viewership if one puts on the proceedings at 1.30 a.m. for insomniacs or people who come in from the pub and cannot sleep very well.  That is about all they can see because of the time at which proceedings are broadcast.  There is high viewership of the morning coverage of Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  Members know from their electorate that if they are included in any way in this, their electorate will see it and tell them so.</P>
        <P>My last point is related to the proposal for a C-SPAN channel.  The media in this House represents the entire media.  I believe there are 60 journalists assigned to the House on a full-time or part-time basis but they are certainly here all the time.  If their organisations &mdash; I am not blaming the individual reporters in the House &mdash; do not see fit to cover the proceedings of this House, we should take that into our own hands.  We have the power and capacity to do so and should do so forthwith.  The Gallery is evidence of a lack of interest when we are debating as serious a subject as this.</P>

	<P>I am proud to have served on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs from 2002 to 2007 and to have been a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  Over the years, a number of initiatives have been taken with regard to committees.  The number of committees has increased, their role and remit has been extended and they now bring before them far more external bodies.  The committee system has expanded since its beginning in 1984 when only a few committees existed.</P>
        <P>Committees play an important role as they advise on a wide range of legislative, social, economic and financial business.  As well as this, committees also process the legislation and the examination of Government expenditure.  In recent years, the setting up of a well organised system of joint committees has resulted in Deputies having additional opportunities to participate to an even greater extent in specialised parliamentary work in the areas of foreign affairs, European affairs, the Irish language &mdash; as Gaeilge, State enterprise, women&rsquo;s rights, family matters, sustainable development and small business and services.  Any Member who believes that committees are only debating chambers is incorrect in his or her assertion.</P><Col N="831"/>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, of which I was a member, discussed many and varied topics.  They ranged from issues such as the National Gallery of Ireland to a discussion on rural development strategy.  In order for committees to perform their role effectively, it is important for Members, individually and collectively, to keep in touch with community views and the effects on people of legislative and Government action.</P>
        <P>There should be effective promotion of the work of committees.  One of the main reasons there should be a better connection between the community and the work of committees is the desire to produce better inquiries and reports which encompass the views of those affected by Government activity as well as those of specialist groups.  The second aim is to draw people more into the practical workings of the democratic processes to help them understand the role and value of the parliamentary institutions in society.</P>
        <P>One of the key tasks of Members of Parliament is to feed into the parliamentary process the opinions and needs of the community they represent.  Their very jobs depend on their ability to hear, understand and interpret the views of the electorate.  In order to produce the best possible analysis and recommendations, committees need to encompass not only the views of experts but those of the wider community.</P>
        <P>Committees now constitute a major part of the Oireachtas framework.  The structure of the existing system allows for a more flexible and transparent approach to scrutiny outside of the more formal platforms of the D&aacute;il and Seanad Chambers.  Members of committees avail of the opportunity that the committee system gives to them to engage publicly on many issues.  It also offers the opportunity to improve access by the public to the Houses and committees.  People need to understand that the D&aacute;il is there to work for them and to help them re-engage with the democratic processes.  The work of committees can play an important part in this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BobbyAylward"><NameTxt>Deputy Bobby Aylward</NameTxt>
	<P>The committee system which operates in this House is an integral feature of our work as politicians and legislators.  As I understand it, the system has proved to be worthy and productive and is now regarded as a valuable and constructive aspect of our parliamentary activity.  However, like all systems, its operations require regular attention and review.  Useful reforms and adaptations must be implemented to lend greater efficiency to accommodate change.  In order to promote and facilitate the meaningful role of the system, we must adopt modern practices in our approach to our work and constantly reassess and update the manner in which we deliver the fruits of our collective endeavours.  Our parliamentary democracy must keep up with the rapid pace of change and we <Col N="832"/>must evolve practical systems which reflect that pace and are sensitive to an ever-increasing volume of work.</P>
        <P>The new proposals represent a welcome and enlightened approach to how the House can do its business more effectively.  I am impressed with the recommendations to enhance our methods for parliamentary scrutiny of EU legislative proposals and the role we play in the oversight of such proposals.  A plethora of complex issues emanates from EU institutions and their impact is pervasive.  I am pleased to note the proposals improve the existing systems through the provision of additional personnel, together with other support structures in training and expertise.  The expansion of the committee secretariat is a welcome development.  The increased support and advisory services will be beneficial to the deliberations of the committee and will enable it to respond in a timely way to the intensity of its role.</P>
        <P>The proposal to lend greater thoroughness to the remit of the committee on European scrutiny must be endorsed.  It is critical that this committee has the appropriate access to the interaction with the relevant Ministers and departmental officials.  The substantive input of this committee is essential and its role and function will be greatly enhanced through active ongoing dialogue.  It is also important to ensure the participation of all stakeholders and interest groups.  They must be afforded an adequate opportunity to represent their views fully.  Any proposal which facilitates access is positive from the point of view of inclusiveness.</P>
        <P>There is a sense that the public is not interested in EU affairs.  If anything, the public can be apathetic where awareness of EU matters is concerned.  The issues often appear remote and inconsequential when they are not.  Any efforts on the part of the committee to stimulate interest and increase awareness of EU affairs must be encouraged.  Any initiative on the part of the committee to improve the dissemination of information is also welcome.  Public information will educate the public and will result in informed debate on the issues which have a bearing on our lives.  The public needs to know and understand the practical implications of various EU measures.  Efforts to promote public understanding will have a concrete effect and will encourage our citizens to avail of every opportunity to make their views and concerns known to Members.  This is the essence of democracy.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to introduce an ongoing monitoring role to the sub-committee on European scrutiny.  It is imperative that deadlines are met by Oireachtas sectorial committees.  Any system which improves overall efficiency must be positive.  In that context, I welcome the proposals to expand the e-consultation programme and to apply modern technology to our systems of work.  It is important we utilise all resources available to us and to develop and improve the overall con<Col N="833"/>sultation process.  This will foster a better and more meaningful interface with the public.</P>
        <P>By embracing new concepts and modern communication means, we can fulfil our role as legislators by inviting as many people as possible to contribute to our ongoing committee work.  By making access to information available on-line and in a user-friendly fashion, we are promoting positive interaction.  We are stimulating useful dialogue and upholding the democratic ideal of representation.  This will be a valuable service to the public which has the right to take an active part in consultation and policy formulation processes.  By enabling interested parties to contribute easily and on-line is a pragmatic suggestion and deserves to be explored further and developed.  It serves all our interests to receive a comprehensive view of public opinion on matters of policy and emerging issues.</P>
        <P>I support any measures which seek to involve all citizens in the decision-making process.  The workings of the D&aacute;il and Seanad can often appear obscure to the wider public.  Any initiative which leads to transparency in the democratic process and seeks to engage with the public in a tangible way must be encouraged.  These proposals are enlightened and I hope they will have far-reaching consequences in how the committees will function and how the public will be engaged in the process.  These innovative proposals will enhance the parliamentary process and ensure our work is both meaningful and effective.</P>

	<P>I am glad we are finally having this welcome and important debate, one for which I have waited for over five years.  My impression on first entering the House was that one felt one was speaking to oneself most of the time.  The system is antiquated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As long as the Deputy is not referring to Members in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not say that about Members.</P>
        <P>When school groups, such as the one in the Visitors Gallery, attend Leinster House, Members explain to them how the House operates and how difficult it is to raise matters.  Having been on Offaly County Council, I found it easier to raise matters affecting the county there than here in the D&aacute;il.  The Laois-Offaly constituency could be under siege but, with respect to the Ceann Comhairle as it would not be his fault, I cannot raise it in the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, would not allow such a siege to occur.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have to go through the farcical situation of raising the matter under Standing Order 32, which I know would be disallowed.  I cannot remember one matter under <Col N="834"/>that Standing Order being accepted in the past five years.  Members will still raise them because it is the only way of getting a particular issue on the record.</P>
        <P>The other avenue for raising matters is through the Adjournment debate.  Members can only raise issues of the day or those which affect their constituencies.  The arrangement is wholly inadequate.  Each Member has five minutes to raise the matter and a Minister, often not the relevant one, gives a prepared reply.  No matter what a Member says, the Minister will read out this prepared answer regardless.  I appreciate it was the same when the Opposition was on the other side of the House.  However, it is not a good system and must be changed.  There is no arrangement for teasing out an issue.  The Adjournment debate should be arranged along the same lines as Priority Questions, where a Member can raise a matter, ask the relevant Minister questions on it, with some toing and froing to tease out the issue.</P>
        <P>I welcome and support the Minister&rsquo;s decision to change the Adjournment to a format known as current issues time.  While increasing the number of matters allowed to six is welcome, the time allocation of three minutes is pathetic.  Three minutes speaking time works out as 540 words.  There is no way a Member could raise an issue of any consequence in 540 words.  I do not support people talking endlessly on a topic as it achieves nothing.  At the same time, I do not believe a matter can be dealt with effectively in such a time slot.  The Minister must re-examine the format and provide a decent system for raising matters.</P>
        <P>The oral questions format is not conducive to Members obtaining proper information.  I do not know if there is a fairer system than the lottery arrangement but having important issues subject to such a process does not give them the attention they deserve.</P>
        <P>The quality of replies to parliamentary questions is another issue.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett pointed out that if one suffered from paranoia, one could wonder what the replies are trying to hide, even on the most mundane issues.  Members are only seeking information and not trying to catch anyone out.  However, the reply often results in more questions being tabled.  If Departments answered Members&rsquo; telephone and written queries, there would be no need to table so many parliamentary questions, which in turn wastes the time of the Civil Service.  It is a last resort to obtain information.  Will the Ceann Comhairle ask Departments to ensure Members receive sufficient information in replies to parliamentary questions?</P>
        <P>Once the D&aacute;il goes into its summer recess, the lack of a mechanism to table parliamentary questions means officials in Departments run and do not have to answer us.  People&rsquo;s problems do not take three months holidays; they will still come to Deputies with their problems during the recess.  When I ring or write to a departmental official <Col N="835"/>about something, he or she knows I can table a parliamentary question demanding an answer.  One just does not get the information or the service one is entitled to receive from the Department.  This needs to be addressed to ensure Departments are fully accountable 365 days of the year.</P>
        <P>Another issue I have relates to Departments asking Deputies to withdraw parliamentary questions.  I do not mind withdrawing a question about an individual person, but when I am seeking information on a general issue relating to a Department, I resent being asked to withdraw the question.  In that situation I decline to do so.  What is wrong with having the information available to the public?  It should be, but receiving an answer in an e-mail addressed to me only seems to indicate that it is a method by which to hide.  The worst aspect is the manner in which parliamentary questions are referred to the HSE, NEPS and SENOs.  This is a widespread practice which has got out of control.  I always go to the HSE, the special educational needs organiser or the NRA first for information.  When they do not give me the information I require, I have to go through the parliamentary question system, when the question is referred back to the very person who would not give me the information in the first place.  All we are doing is creating a cycle of work, keeping a few people in jobs and getting nothing done.  That is the real issue.</P>
        <P>The timelag for a response from the HSE is beyond belief, but the lack of accountability on the part of the Minister in charge is worse.  Last week I tabled a series of questions as regards maternity services because of the serious problems being experienced in the hospital in Portlaoise and others brought to my attention where consultant anaesthetists were not available to give an epidural.  Maternity beds were also not available.  As a consequence, women were not able to receive treatment because they could not be brought to the labour ward.  The reply I received was that the Minister was unable to answer the questions as they were matters for the HSE.  The reality is that the Department of Health and Children gives the HSE its budget.  When an extension is being built, Ministers are very willing to take a trowel and put cement on top of a few blocks, yet when there is a problem, they plead that the HSE has nothing to do with them.  That is wrong and has to change.</P>
        <P>There are too many quangos.  However, I do not want to be hypocritical in this regard, as I called for the establishment of a national fire authority the other night.  While there are instances in which they are needed, this does not mean they should not be accountable to the House.</P>
        <P>The practice in the Department of Education and Science of passing questions to special educational needs organisers has got out of control. <Col N="836"/> The point I wish to make in this instance is similar to the one I made as regards the HSE.</P>
        <P>The committee structure needs a radical overhaul.  I support what Deputy Naughten said about the need for much better scrutiny of European legislation which has been put through, effectively, with a nod and a wink.  I hope the proposals of the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Tom Kitt, will address this.</P>
        <P>At 22, the number of committees is too great and it smacks of jobs for the boys and girls.  Deputy Calleary might not like me saying this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>That covers both sides of the House, I take it. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not because the Government is not prepared to recognise the greater size of Fine Gael.  The Government Chief Whip has clearly said it will not happen, which is wrong.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party are entitled to be recognised with numbers relative to their size&mdash;&mdash; </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are recognised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not; certainly not by the Government.  As Deputy Stagg pointed out, everyone on the Government side of the House will have a position.  Therefore, they will be happy. </P>
        <P>I do not know who designed LH2000 or what input the Government had, but the location of the committee rooms is indicative of the Government&rsquo;s attitude towards the committees, although there have been exceptions.  I was a member of the committee set up following the CC case, the Joint Committee on Child Protection, which was chaired by Deputy Peter Power who did a great job.  We got things done and one felt one&rsquo;s contributions were constructive and would achieve something but that has not been the experience on many other committees which are important and have work to do.  The main problem is that if a committee agrees on something, nothing will happen.</P>
        <P>Deputy Calleary was reluctant to go down the road of television coverage of the D&aacute;il because it would be a stick with which to beat us but that is an occupational hazard when one enters politics.  Therefore, why not?  I would not expect the ratings to be fantastic or people to take days off work to watch the D&aacute;il.  However, it is a facility that should be available to them.  There is also the timing of politics-related programmes.  I know this is not something  the Government Chief Whip or the Ceann Comhairle can change, but if people are interested in and want to participate in politics, showing programmes such as &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; at 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. will not achieve the objective.  It does not allow people an opportunity to watch because, in the first place, by that stage many will have gone to bed, or are elderly.  This is an issue <Col N="837"/>that needs to be addressed in order that people can better participate.  Practically everything is televised in the United States; even local community meetings are available on local channels.  This gives people a far better opportunity to participate and see what is going on.  I would like to see the work being done here in the D&aacute;il and Seanad Chambers televised in order that people may better participte in the political process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words in these very important statements on the setting up of committees in the Oireachtas and D&aacute;il reform in general.  I was fortunate to have been chosen by the Taoiseach as Chairman of a committee in the last D&aacute;il, albeit for a short period before the general election.  I regarded it as a great privilege, prior to which I also had the privilege of serving on the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service for a number of years.  Certainly, the committee system has tremendous merit when taken seriously and dealt with properly. </P>
        <P>I regret that up until recently we were not able to reach agreement with the Opposition parties which were looking for more jobs for their boys and girls.  However, I welcome the fact that we have now reached agreement and the outlook is positive.  Committees constitute a major part of the Oireachtas framework.  The existing structure allows for a flexible and more transparent approach to scrutiny away from the more formal platforms of the D&aacute;il and Seanad Chambers.  Members of committees avail of opportunities provided to engage publicly on many issues.  The system also facilitates access by the public to the Houses of the Oireachtas and their committees, as we have all observed through the hearing of evidence and presentations by delegations.  We have all used the opportunity from time to time to bring various interest groups to Leinster House which report back to their communities.  This provides them with a national platform to tell their story.  The process also allows the other side of the story to be heard, that of the Department involved.</P>
        <P>The Government Chief Whip referred to the work of the Joint Committee on the Constitution in the run-up to the referendum on the right to life of the unborn.  It was a great example of the advantages attached to the committee system.  Previously debates on this issue had been characterised by bitterness and divisiveness.  However, as a result of the committee&rsquo;s intervention, a public platform was provided where all opinions could be expressed in a calm and professional environment, ensuring the debate was grounded on a much more rounded view of the issues involved and a greater appreciation of the concerns of the various interest groups participating.</P>
        <P>Another example within the past few years of a committee doing excellent work is the sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts which was chaired by the late Jim Mitchell who <Col N="838"/>was the driving force of that inquiry and followed up implementation of many of the recommendations to emerge, many of which have had a lasting influence on the way in which we conduct our business today, not least the establishment of the Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Committees are an invaluable tool for the Houses of the Oireachtas and the scale of their role may be determined from the fact that last year alone there were 531 committee meetings and 191 reports published.  Some 1,215 witnesses gave evidence.  Those statistics speak for themselves.</P>
        <P>I referred to my membership of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service in the last Administration.  In that context I welcome the changes proposed by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, and the range of reforms introduced in the past two years, including the recently announced introduction of a unified budget, with effect from 5 December next.  These initiatives will give committees greater opportunities to monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending by each Department.  In an effort to give maximum effect to the opportunities presented by these reforms, it is intended that specific provision will be made in committees to place greater importance on annual output statements and value for money and policy reviews, in particular.  Committees should be afforded the opportunity to formally examine departmental expenditure on a more regular basis, perhaps quarterly, with a view to having more informed debates on the Estimates process.</P>
        <P>Deputy Enright referred to the Adjournment debate and the discussion of current issues.  I agree with what she said, with one exception.  Three minutes is adequate time because one can tell one&rsquo;s story in 540 words.  Perhaps many of us like to hear ourselves talk too much, but that is a matter for individual Deputies.  It might be ideal to have six slots on a given day at earlier times.  With the Adjournment debate held at night, to a certain extent, it probably loses its validity, as one is talking to an empty Chamber.  If Members had an opportunity to address, albeit briefly, issues of local importance in a full Chamber, it would be more beneficial to everybody concerned.  I support the call for these welcome changes to be made, for the number of slots to be increased and the time available to be reduced to three minutes.</P>
        <P>I welcome the new committees the Taoiseach has introduced, namely, the joint committee on the constitutional amendment regarding children, the joint committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and, possibly, a committee on the Irish language.  I wish the chairpersons and memberships of committees well in their endeavours.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallBlaneyIND"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Blaney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the outline of the Government reform of, and position on, committees as set out by the Government Chief <Col N="839"/>Whip, Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, who is doing excellent work in that regard and his utmost to get committees up and running.  If he had his way, they would be up and running before now.</P>
        <P>I wish to take up a point made by a number of speakers in regard Standing Order 32.  This is my second term in the D&aacute;il and for people to stand up before the Order of Business day in day out and mention items is a wasted exercise and to no avail.  There are plenty of other opportunities, which I will outline, for members of the Opposition to raise issues.  A lot of D&aacute;il time and resources are wasted.  In the last D&aacute;il, members of the Opposition raised different items, particularly on health.  However, those same Members rarely went near the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Committees are a very valuable resource and much more use could be made of them by Members.</P>
        <P>In the last D&aacute;il, I was on the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture and Food under the chairmanship of Deputy Johnny Brady and, in the past number of months, I was added to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights under the chairmanship of Deputy Ardagh.  The relationship between members of those committees and the Chairmen was very open.  I never saw a member of any party or none being turned down in regard to bringing in any group or raising any issue.</P>
        <P>A lot of politics is being played in this House.  Members want to talk about issues in the House but not at committees.  The issue of opening up committees and having more television coverage of them was raised.  While I would welcome that in one sense, I would also have reservations because some Members are inclined to play political football too much when the camera is in front of them.  The committees are very open and chairmen are willing to take on any matter or have any debate.  Before changing the committees, we should have a good look at the existing ones because I do not believe there is much wrong with them; Members could make much more use of them.</P>
        <P>I look forward to seeing the new committees up and running as soon as possible.  I welcome the three new committees, particularly the one with the North-South dimension.  I look forward to, and will welcome, members from across the Border coming to the House to address that new committee.  It is a very welcome move which, I suppose, is as a result of the Good Friday Agreement.  It would not have happened but for the work of our Government on the peace process.  I hope that committee does well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The role of committees is closely linked to the operation of the D&aacute;il and the need for D&aacute;il reform, so I will address my initial remarks to that aspect.  There is no question but that over the past ten years or so we have seen a clear diminution of democracy and of parliamentary democracy and accountability in particular.  In many ways, the media has become the real parliament.  One can go out to the plinth or into a television studio and say almost anything about any issue, yet very often we are not allowed to discuss the various issues of the day in this Chamber.  </P>
        <P>As was mentioned by other speakers, there has been a proliferation of quangos, State boards and State authorities &mdash; approximately 450 to date &mdash; almost none of which are accountable to the D&aacute;il and some of which do not even appear to be accountable to their own Ministers.  With the development of consultative committees, enterprise boards, RAPID boards and Leader boards, we have a situation where almost any community activist, local worker or anybody who has any involvement in civil society has, in one way or another, been somehow co-opted into the Government system and been made part of a State committee.  In many ways, I can see why the Government does that because it is a great way to control dissent.  As one Minister said to me in regard to my local drugs task force, it is better to have these people pissing in rather than pissing out.  I am not quite sure what he meant by that, but I have a fair idea.</P>
        <P>In many ways, that sort of system resembles what one would see in a communist country or in a country such as Libya where one has a system of government by committee.  Everyone is a member of a committee which reports to a higher one which then reports to a higher one again.  Then the great dictator makes his decision.  That, in itself, is a diminution of democracy.  We have seen the removal of powers from local government and the transfer of powers from councillors to managers.</P>
        <P>There is definitely a need for a democratic revolution.  That means restoring power to local government, introducing democracy into the education system by giving the vocational education system control over all education, a bonfire of the quangos &mdash; I am sure we can abolish least half of the over 400 quangos &mdash; and a proper restoration of parliamentary democracy in this House.  Fine Gael has made a series of proposals in this regard.</P>
        <P>I would like a committee week perhaps every month or six weeks similar to that in the European Parliament.  That would give us a proper opportunity to concentrate on committee work and to review legislation properly through committees rather than having to run back and forth to Question Time or other debates in the D&aacute;il.  I do not see why that cannot be done.</P>
        <P>I have great concerns about the expansion of the committee system to 22 committees, which is extraordinary.  There will be 22 chairs, 22 vice-<Col N="841"/>chairs and 22 convenors, or possibly even more than that with sub-committee chairs.  I might not have the support of many of my colleagues on this but it is inappropriate that committee chairs, vice-chairs and convenors should be paid for that work.  Surely part of the job of a Deputy is chairing a committee.  I do not know anyone in any other walk of life or business who gets paid extra just to chair a committee.  If we took away that entitlement and saved the taxpayer &euro;1 million, we would see a sudden lack of interest in having so many committees and chairs thereof.</P>
        <P>If we are to have committees, rather than have more of them, we should have committees which have more power.  All the chairs should go to the Opposition parties but if that is not the case, they should, at the very least, be given out on a proportionate basis.  Committees should be given the power to review appointments.  Where Ministers make appointments to State boards and State authorities, all those people should be called in front of the committee to be questioned to see if they are qualified and up to the job.  Quangos should be responsible to the relevant committees and ministerial power over the committees should be removed.  Committees should set their own times and agendas and Ministers should not have the power to order them to meet in private.  Committees should also be given the power of inquiry.</P>
        <P>I question the need for some of the newly proposed committees.  An Irish language committee is a nice idea but much more could be done much more effectively than creating another committee to discuss the Irish language.  If we want to improve the Irish language, we need to focus on education rather than just create another committee with another Chairman and Vice-Chairman.</P>
        <P>We should have a committee on the partnership process, which is not discussed at all in this House, and we should consider adopting the Finnish model and having a committee on the future, which would look beyond legislation at some of the challenges that lie ahead.</P>
        <P>Having read the Minister of State&rsquo;s statement, I concede it proposes some reforms but it certainly does not outline what needs to be done or address the key reforms required to make this Parliament relevant and work like other parliaments of its kind around the world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I, like Deputy Leo Varadkar, have many reservations about the committee system and the manner in which the House does its business.  I would have found the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution quite encouraging had I not had the benefit of hearing the responses of some other Deputies.  I am particularly disturbed by Deputy Dan Neville&rsquo;s comments on the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  None of its recommendations, which were accepted by the D&aacute;il, have been implemented.</P>
        <P>Deputy Leo Varadkar and others mentioned that the HSE and other quangos are now being <Col N="842"/>used as a screen to prevent Ministers being held to account in this House.  I have a sheaf of parliamentary questions I asked last week that have been referred to the HSE.  This is just like referring them to eternity because I will never get the answers I seek.  If I do, it will be long past the time during which they will be of value to me or my constituents.</P>
        <P>The HSE is in disarray and is bringing politicians into disrepute because there is a perception that they cannot do anything.  Some 30 or 40 students from Templeogue who were visiting the House earlier will, on looking at this D&aacute;il, wonder why anyone should vote, let alone run for election, if politicians all appear to be neutered.  They do not seem to be able to deliver information or effect change under the current arrangements.</P>
        <P>I am obviously very interested in the Committee on Health and Children and I am very distressed at what is happening at present.  We were told there would be no cutbacks before the election, but there are cutbacks.  We were then told the cutbacks would not affect patient care, but they do.  The number of days during which the Galway cancer service operates has been reduced from five to three.</P>
        <P>Legionnaire&rsquo;s disease was discovered in the water supply of a nursing home in Dublin.  The patients there, instead of being transferred to another private nursing home that could accommodate them, were, for cost-saving reasons, placed in St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital in Raheny, which is the elective surgery unit for Beaumont Hospital.  Consequently, operations are being cancelled hand over fist in Beaumont and patients will have to wait much longer for care.</P>
        <P>Consider the case of a patient in the intensive care unit in Galway who received a serious head injury in a road traffic accident.  His consultant wanted him to have 24-hour nursing care but his request was refused by the HSE because of the staffing freeze.  Consequently, the poor, unfortunate patient has fallen out of bed on at least one occasion and his family must stand in vigil over him for 24 hours per day.  It is outrageous that this is happening in the Ireland of 2007.</P>
        <P>There is a child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome and cystic fibrosis whose home care package has been removed from him.  An elderly man with relatives all over north Dublin cannot be placed in care in this region although there is plenty of space in the nursing homes.  The list goes on and it includes real people in real distress who are suffering because of the cutbacks.  We do not even have a health committee at which to discuss them.  Even if we did have one, according to Deputy Dan Neville, there would be gagging clauses so that it could not report on various issues in public.  This beggars belief.  Is Ireland becoming a Third World communist state?</P>
        <P>I am very worried about the democratic deficit in the European Union.  Before the summer recess, we discussed the fact that the Department of Homeland Security in the United States had <Col N="843"/>extended the time during which it could retain information on Irish citizens.  We only received notice of the motion the night before and when it was discussed in the House, we discovered it was a done deal and already agreed in Europe.  Where is the democracy in this case?  Members&rsquo; parliamentary questions are being fobbed off to the HSE, which is not the only body to which responsibility is being transferred.  This shows disregard for the House and the public.</P>
        <P>Let me refer to the successful committees.  The Committee of Public Accounts, which was chaired by the late Jim Mitchell, did great work and was certainly more successful than many of the tribunals.  It reached conclusions very quickly and inexpensively.  We need to be seen to be engaging with voters and able to effect change.  We must not keep allowing the Government to hide behind semi-State bodies.</P>
        <P>We need a committee to consider drugs in prisons.  Why do people who do not take drugs on entering prison come out on drugs?  This is not good enough and needs to be explored further.</P>
        <P>I support the call to televise the D&aacute;il and committees.  I do not agree with Members who believe this would lead to playing to the gallery.  It would shine a light on the House.  Politicians should do their jobs correctly or not at all.</P>
        <P>In light of what the Taoiseach said about the difficulty in finding suitable people for positions on State boards, such positions should be advertised.  The applicants should be interviewed by an Oireachtas committee, as is done in other jurisdictions.</P>

	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to inform the House of the intention to establish a joint committee of the Oireachtas, to be called the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, to further the proposal to amend the Constitution in respect of children&rsquo;s rights.</P>
        <P>The establishment of this important committee will be the latest in a series of key developments in improving the lives of children, which started with the publication of the national children&rsquo;s strategy in 2000.   This was a ten-year action plan for children that set out a vision of an Ireland where children are respected as young citizens with a valued contribution to make and a voice of their own; where all children are cherished and supported by family and the wider society; and where they enjoy a fulfilling childhood and realise their potential.  More specifically, the strategy committed to improving children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s participation in decisions that affect <Col N="844"/>them, research on children&rsquo;s lives, and supports and services for children.</P>
        <P>The fundamental law of our land, the Constitution, or Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, should reflect our commitment to value and protect childhood.  Provision must be made in our Constitution for children to be protected from maltreatment, neglect or abuse.  The Constitution must require that, in appropriate circumstances, the welfare of the child be the paramount consideration.  Over recent years, there have been calls from many quarters to strengthen children&rsquo;s rights in Ireland, including seeking an amendment to the Constitution to reflect the rights of children.</P>
        <P>The Constitutional Review Group recommended in its report of 1996 that the Constitution be amended to include the welfare principle and to provide an express guarantee of certain other children&rsquo;s rights deriving from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In January 2006, the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution recommended in its review of the articles dealing with the family that a new section be inserted in Article 41 dealing with the rights of children.</P>
        <P>In September 2006, my predecessor as Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, led the Irish delegation at the UN committee hearing on Ireland&rsquo;s second report on the implementation of the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child which took place in Geneva.  The committee expressed concern that some of the recommendations it had previously made had not yet been fully addressed, in particular those related to the status of the child as a rights holder.</P>
        <P>Against this backdrop, the Taoiseach announced in November last year that a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights should take place.  The then Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was asked to initiate a process of consultation and discussion with the other D&aacute;il parties and with all relevant interest groups with the aim of achieving  consensus on the wording  of an appropriate constitutional amendment.</P>
        <P>Following an extensive round of consultations, the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2007 was published in February 2007 and it proposes wording to amend the Constitution in respect of children&rsquo;s rights.  The Bill seeks to repeal Article 42.5 of the Constitution and insert a new Article 42A.  The proposed text incorporates a number of separate proposals, covering areas such as the imprescriptible rights of the child, adoption, collection and exchange of information in relation to persons who are a risk to children, and absolute and strict liability in relation to offences against children.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government agreed in June 2007 includes a commitment to &ldquo;establish an all-party committee to examine the proposed constitutional amendment with a view to deepening consensus on this matter&rdquo;.  I will be bringing <Col N="845"/>proposals to Government shortly regarding the establishment of such an all-party committee.  The priority is to agree on wording for our Constitution that will reflect the desire of the Irish people to establish robust safeguards for the rights and liberties of all the children of our nation.  It is envisaged that the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2007 will form the basis of the deliberations.</P>
        <P>The power to change our Constitution rests with the people alone.  Time and again, the people have demonstrated their strong attachment to the Constitution.  As has been stated by my predecessor, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, we should not underestimate the huge onus that rests on all of us who seek to strengthen the position of the child in our Constitution.  The burden of persuasion in any referendum is a heavy one.  It is all the greater when the proposal relates to the delicate and intimate relationships that exist between child, parent, family and the State.</P>
        <P>I look forward to working with the committee and Members of this House to advance this important issue and, following discussions at Cabinet level, I will revert to the Houses with further proposals on this issue in the near future.  I look forward to playing my part in a continuous drive towards an improved quality of life for all our children and I know I can count on the support of the Members of this House in moving towards that shared goal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome the proposals brought forward by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and Government Chief Whip, Deputy Tom Kitt, in regard to the operation of the committee system in the 30th D&aacute;il.  As a new Deputy who has not previously been involved in Oireachtas committees, I am very much looking forward to working on whatever committees I am selected to serve on.</P>
        <P>I firmly believe the committee system allows Members to be involved in a very real way in formatting and amending legislation.  The system allows me as a D&aacute;il Deputy for Dublin North to ensure that the views and feedback of my constituents in regard to proposed legislation are brought to each relevant committee.  In this way, the public&rsquo;s views form a central role in drafting and amending legislation.  My previous experience of committees was at local authority level on Fingal County Council, which was the first local authority in Ireland to broadcast meetings live on the Internet.  This is very effective in allowing people to view how their politicians are working on their behalf.  Most importantly, it allows each citizen easy access to debates on issues that matter to them.</P>
        <P>It is with this in mind that I welcome the e-consultation programme outlined by the Minister of State.  This will allow the public to access information on-line.  It will lead to greater understand<Col N="846"/>ing and engagement with the parliamentary process and enable the public to contribute to policy consultation and policy formation on-line by making submissions on matters before Parliament and its committees in a structured fashion.  I would, however, like to see enhancement of the live web casting of D&aacute;il committees and D&aacute;il debates which will allow the public see the work that takes place on their behalf.  I was interested in the debate among Members about the possibility of a dedicated television channel for the Oireachtas.  This works for the Westminster Parliament and the Welsh Assembly.  The more the public can see how this House operates, the better.  It will improve transparency for the public.  The Minister of State should examine the possibility of having a dedicated television service for the Houses of the Oireachtas not just in regard to the D&aacute;il and Seanad, but in regard to committee debates.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair would be surprised by how many people watch &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  I have seen how live web casting has helped to make local government in North Dublin transparent and has improved the understanding of the public of the workings of the council.  I would like the same approach to be taken by the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>More specifically, in regard to what was outlined by the Minister, I very much welcome the initiative of parliamentary scrutiny of EU legislation and the oversight role.  I agree with the Minister that it is crucially important that the Oireachtas should scrutinise EU legislation at the earliest possible stage.  As we all know, EU legislation and directives from the European Parliament have become increasingly important to Ireland and it is vital that such legislation is scrutinised in an efficient, timely and structured fashion.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the speedy establishment of the new Oireachtas committees which will allow all Members of the House to have a real and effective input into legislation.  I was interested to hear from Deputy Enright and in particular Deputy Reilly regarding his distress that committees have not been set up.  It is a pity that his party, Fine Gael, delayed the establishment of these committees purely because Deputy Kenny wants to hand out a few extra jobs to some of his more senior Deputies who were promised Ministries before the election if Fine Gael were elected to Government and now has a group of backbenchers who are causing him a headache.  I look forward to the House in general and particularly the Fine Gael Party agreeing with the Chief Whip to move forward and establish these committees as soon as possible so that we can get on with the work of the House.</P>

	<P>It could be construed that I am one of those Members to which the last speaker referred.

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and whose disappointment may not be assuaged.</P>
        <P>During my time in this House I have seen numerous changes, many not for the betterment of Parliament.  There has been a dramatic growth in the number of committees.  Government has a preponderance of power in all committees.  I will go into that in a minute.  Initially the purpose of that growth was to provide a means of placating Government backbenchers.  That still remains the case.  I can understand that but, unfortunately, it indicates that we are heading towards a one-party State.  That is a serious matter.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is something I have studied carefully.  There are some analogies.  In Malaysia, the same party has governed for almost 50 years.  It has experienced the same pattern of events as this country.  The same main party has been in power all the time.  It has a presidential style of leadership, committees to defuse situations &mdash; to lance the boil, to remove concerns from within and from without.  Committees constitute an area into which various groups can be drawn so that they no longer blame Ministers directly.  Instead they come before a committee to express their grievances.  Then they walk away and, as other speakers have said, nothing happens.</P>
        <P>I have seen changes in this House.  At one time this House was full of Deputies at Question Time.  Everybody had the right to raise a question, to have that question put on the Order Paper and to get an answer.  There was no lottery system.  Every question had to be dealt with, from the moment it was tabled until it cleared the Order Paper.  Ministers did not like that.  They did not like to be kept in the House all day for a week or, in some cases, two weeks so ultimately the system was changed.</P>
        <P>I have seen the change in the system whereby the importance of the committee has been expanded to the extent that it has undermined the importance and the privileges of the House so that the plenary session of the House is diminished and nobody comes into the House.  The reason Members do not come into the House is <Col N="848"/>because they have no business there.  They cannot participate in a debate except in ordered slots of ten, five, or two and a half minutes.  That is not democracy.</P>
        <P>There has been a change in the system whereby public representatives are elected by the public to represent them in parliament.  Here we have drawn much of our inspiration from the European Parliament.  Members will remember the Committee on Petitions.  It was a means of bringing democracy of a kind to the people in a situation where the elected Member does not have the power to get access to the authorities.  A system was introduced under which it could be arranged for a delegation to go to Brussels to air grievances.  If power were vested in the elected Member there would not be a problem.  The elected Member, of all parties or none, should be able to deal with issues of that nature.</P>
        <P>We arrange for various groups, such as North-South groups and east-west groups, to come before committees and air their grievances.  It is tokenism.  Nothing happens.  I have been on virtually every committee in this House over the years.  My experience is that one could be dead in a committee for a fortnight before anybody would discover it because nobody has any interest.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>One could attend every meeting of a committee and anything that one would say or do at it would be of no consequence.  It is a waste of time.  It makes no difference that committee chairmen and convenors are paid.  We need to recognise that the role of parliament has been undermined and diminished to a significant extent by the establishment of several quangos and committees and the way it has been ordered.  This will suit whoever is in Government and will limit the degree to which government will change in the future.  This is not a criticism but a comment.</P>
        <P>Let me give an example, I remember having a role to play when the decision was made in this House to the effect that the Taoiseach would be out of House after Taoiseach&rsquo;s questions on a Wednesday.  It was obvious that the objective was to adopt a different role.  The Taoiseach in fairness made comparisons with his European colleagues and explained that they would not be in parliament.  However, many of the so-called democracies in Europe are very new to democracy, so I would not take lessons from that quarter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The mother of parliaments would not be where I would necessarily look for an example of what is less than democracy.  We will park that and deal with it again.</P><Col N="849"/>
        <P>We have reached a time when we must look at the way parliament is run.  Parliamentarians are elected directly by the public.  Unlike other democracies, we have no list system and Members are elected directly.  This is the most pure form of democracy with the exception of the Australian system.  We have failed to recognise that.  The way the institution is now being run is our fault.  We allowed it to happen.  Government must take the weight of the responsibility for that because every committee is dominated by Government.  There are many more issues that I would like to address.</P>
        <P>We have a presidential style of leadership, with the Taoiseach of the day out shaking hands, pressing the flesh, launching events, cutting tapes and talking to the people.  That is not necessarily the role of the head of Government.  Parliament is something that is being dealt with in committee.  That is not the way it should be.  Incidentally, I do not agree with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  It is another quango.  I do not agree that the Ceann Comhairle should be the Chairman of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  There is a conflict of interests, and that is not a criticism of the incumbent.</P>
        <P>It is a fact of life that the Government has the predominance in the nomination of the membership to the commission.  Why?  All the Government needs is a majority of one.  What is the purpose of the exercise?  Where is democracy?  There is a notion that representation is proportional.  Proportionality has a rather peculiar meaning because in the previous Government the main Opposition parties had a higher proportion than is proposed to them now.</P>
        <P>On-line submissions are the brainchild of the Minister of State and I criticised it in committee when it came before me.  It is the ultimate attempt to bypass public representatives.  It is an attempt by Government to reach over their heads of the elected public representative and talk directly to the people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is to the discredit of the Government that it keeps coming up with this.  Every attempt allegedly made to improve the system brings with it a referral to a committee and on-line submissions that the Government will deal with directly to the exclusion of the Opposition.  The Opposition can make on-line submissions too.  What is the benefit of having a parliament?  Why not abolish it and have the odd plenary session every six or eight months?  Let the committees do the digging and let the various Minister do what they want, be out of the House at all times.</P>
        <P>Deputy Sean Barrett referred to Question Time and he put forward a very good idea to ensure that everybody participated in it.  There should not be a lottery system and in that way there would not be picking and choosing, just <Col N="850"/>open questions for everyone and every question would have to be answered.  One could put a limit on the number of questions and that would bring every single Member into this House.</P>

        <P>We have relegated the role of the plenary session of parliament to the role of a committee and have elevated the role of committees to plenary sessions.  We have seen the extension of the committees and they have become the extension of Ministries, a means whereby the Minister can have his persona in a particular role doing the job the Minister would have done previously and which is now being conveniently done for him.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to statements on the committees in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I thank the Government Chief Whip for facilitating this debate.  This is my third term in the D&aacute;il and it is the first occasion on which we have had a wide ranging discussion on the role of committees.  This is very useful.  The committees have become more active and it is time to look at the overall role, the number of committees and their functions.  This debate contributes to that, for which I thank the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
        <P>I have been sitting for the past 20 minutes listening to the contributions from the Fine Gael bench.  I am bemused by what I have heard from the Opposition benches.  I am disappointed that Deputies Leo Varadkar and James Reilly have left the House because I wish to address the comments they made a few short moments ago.The gist of Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s complaint is that there are too many quangos.  Last night, the same Deputy and his party voted for the establishment of a new national fire authority.  Last night, they wanted a new quango to be established, but today they say there are too many quangos.  That was bad enough, but he continued by stating that we want to have real democracy and give more power back to local authorities.  Last night, the Deputy and his party colleagues voted to take the power for fire services away from local authorities and to give it to a new national quango.  I cannot understand how these Members contradict themselves in a 24 hour period.</P>
        <P>Deputy Varadkar was sitting beside Deputy James Reilly and saying we have too many committees, but before Deputy Reilly sat down he proposed to establish a new committee to deal with people in prisons who are on drugs.  Within <Col N="851"/>a speaking slot of ten minutes, they contradict themselves in everything they say about committees.  The same Deputies are fundamentally contradicting themselves in how they voted last night and on their first opportunity to speak in the D&aacute;il today.  I hope that when they become involved in the committees they will show some consistency in thought because it will make a farce of the committees, the D&aacute;il and democracy in general if Members say one thing on a day, having done the precise opposite the day before.  Empty vessels make a great deal of noise.  New Deputies should consider the noise they are making and be more consistent in their remarks.</P>
        <P>I have been a member of a number of committees since I was first elected to the House in 1997.  The work of the committees can be improved.  Most Opposition spokespersons take their role very seriously, senior Government members also take their role very seriously and we have very good debates in the committees.  I would divide the work of the committees into two halves &mdash; the work select committees do on legislation directed to them from the D&aacute;il with regard to Committee Stages of Bills or Estimates debates and the work the committees do within their respective remits on a range of activities on which they issue reports they lay before the D&aacute;il.  They have tremendous scope if they want to use their power.  They do not always wish to do so.</P>
        <P>The quality of information provided by public servants to committees can vary enormously.  I have seen public officials give full and complete answers to the questions they are asked by committee members.  I have seen others who, whether they attend for two minutes or 22 hours, will give no information which is not already in the public arena.  I would like to see public officials more confident and open with committees in discussing matters for consideration within their Departments.  Some are afraid to say what is being talked about within a Department if the Minister has not made a final decision.  As a result, committees do not derive the full value from questioning public officials.</P>
        <P>As chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I was the only chairman who conducted every aspect of committee business in public session.  Committees often meet in private session when they wish to discuss certain items, usually matters concerning travel.  I was elected to the D&aacute;il and I do not carry out the business of the D&aacute;il in private session.  I see no reason, therefore, to conduct committee business in private, unless certain information must be given.  There is a tendency among all Members to hide some of their activity from the public glare.  However, the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service did its job satisfactorily in public.  Confidential information and letters can be discussed without disclosing the name of the person concerned.  Members may be nervous about doing all business in public but it can and <Col N="852"/>does work.  It simply requires a change of culture.  I would like to see an end to private committee sessions.</P>
        <P>I have been a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, which frequently meets in private for an hour and a half before the public session begins.  This baffles me.  As much as 80% of correspondence deals with routine matters which have come before the committee previously or will do so again.  There is a tradition that all correspondence is discussed in private session.  One must be careful occasionally with certain items of correspondence but the blanket rule that all correspondence must be dealt with in private session makes no sense.  I have tried unsuccessfully to change procedure in the Committee of Public Accounts.  I hope it will change in the future.</P>
        <P>I would like to see improved research facilities for committees.  I understand improvements have been made and I look forward to the establishment of new committees with improved research facilities provided on a non-party basis.  In joint committees, which do not deal with legislation and where a strict party line is taken, open and frank debate leading to a consensus of opinion is not unusual.  Additional research facilities would help.  Sometimes the best way to research an issue is to table a parliamentary question but one is not always given the information one wants.</P>
        <P>I thank the Chief Whip for the changes he is making in the Estimates procedure.  We will no longer see Estimates in November and the budget in December.  The new approach is correct and sensible.  The old idea of discussing in one month without reference to income what one will spend next year, and in the following month discussing the income one must raise to finance expenditure which is already approved is nonsense.  No organisation does its business that way.  I am delighted the Oireachtas and Departments are now coming into line, facilitated by the Chief Whip.  The new finance committee will have an oversight role in the Estimates for all Departments.</P>
        <P>I ask each committee to take its Estimates debate seriously.  Many committees spend less than one hour discussing billions of euro.  The same Members who will spend the rest of the year whingeing about what is not being done in a Department will fail to question the Minister, the Accounting Officer and senior officials when they attend the Estimates meeting.  Perhaps the information is presented in a cumbersome manner.  The new procedure will involve output statements, projections of work to be done and priorities for the Department and people will see where the money is being spent.  This will improve public accountability in the Estimates procedure.  I ask that Estimates be cleared prior to the commencement of the financial year.  We have often discussed Estimates in May, June or July when half the year has passed, half the money has been spent and the rest is fully committed.  I hope new <Col N="853"/>committees will take the debates on the Estimates seriously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>With the agreement of the House, I will share time with Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
        <P>Debates involving D&aacute;il reform usually attract the ire of the Opposition rather than of Government.  I have a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.  </i>Not having been a Member of the D&aacute;il for five years I find this debate remarkably similar to debates which might have taken place ten or 12 years ago.  This is indicative of our slow pace of reform.</P>
        <P>Twenty-two committees is far too many for a House of 166 Members.  Deputy Fleming is one of the more successful committee chairmen.  As a constituency colleague, I acknowledge his constructive work in the area of finance.  The D&aacute;il and its committees have failed to keep Ministers accountable.  Many committees are being run by the Executive, whether openly or surreptitiously.  Ministers and ministerial functionaries are ordering the business of committees in the same way as the business of the House is being ordered exclusively by the Executive.</P>
        <P>The Legislature remains weak and loses out on all occasions.  The lack of ministerial accountability has grown considerably since I left here in 2002.  A parliamentary question on health can now be responded to six weeks after it is tabled and contain no relevant information.</P>
        <P>The D&aacute;il needs to be less tribal and more representative of the people.  We should not always break down on party lines and slavishly follow the party whip.  I hope we will have an opportunity to deal with this issue on a future occasion.  We have Government conveners, vice-chairs and a variety of super-Deputies but one must remind oneself of the minimal power entrusted to these people.</P>
        <P>We now have Government by press release and press conference.  None of the major decisions of the day affecting how we do our business is made from within this House.  They are made in the plush surrounds of Merrion Street or after Fianna F&aacute;il cumainn arrangements in Galway, Kerry or north Dublin, usually on days when the House is sitting but with no one here.  This place has become a total irrelevance and the Chief Whip is constitutionally charged with the duty of wresting power back to the Legislature.  He has failed abysmally in introducing a 22 committee labyrinthine structure which will take Members out of the Chamber to meet one another going back and forth in corridors, carrying files.  No one, certainly not the people who elect us to this House, will know what is happening.  Power needs to be wrested back and vested in the Legislature where we could have scrutiny and accountability of a type we do not have now.  Twenty-two committees is not the way forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and Deputy Flanagan for sharing time with me.</P>
        <P>There can be no doubt or no question in anybody&rsquo;s mind but that the position of this House <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Executive has been consistently eroded in recent years.  The agenda, timetable and decisions of this House are the prerogative of the Executive.  As someone who has served on a number of committees and who served longer than anybody else in this House on the Committee of Public Accounts, I acknowledge that committees can do good work.  The Committee of Public Accounts and its DIRT inquiry under the chairmanship of the late Jim Mitchell, on which I was proud to serve, was an outstanding example of Parliament at work &mdash; Parliament as distinct from the Executive &mdash; pursuing a matter of public interest, scrutinising and examining the evidence, reaching conclusions and making findings and recommendations.  It is an excellent example.  It was the work of six Members of this House with no public or civil servant involvement in the writing of the report.  It was purely the work of parliamentarians and it brought credit to this House.</P>
        <P>Since then, we have shut down inquiries by parliamentary committees.  Doing so merely because of a court decision in respect of Abbeylara is no argument.  I can understand in the particular circumstances of Abbeylara why it would be wrong to have Members of this House draw conclusions that would or might adversely reflect on the reputation of another citizen, regardless of whether he or she is a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I can understand that, but in terms of the use of public money and matters of public interest, inquiry by parliamentary committee would make this House more relevant and would give the committees a function.</P>
        <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Charles Flanagan that these committees are effectively run by the Executive.  That is what happens.  A House comprising 166 Members cannot productively support 21 committees.  There are 650 Members in Westminster.  This House comprises 166 Members and we now have more people in ministerial office than ever before, certainly a great deal more than when I came into the House.  Why is it proposed that 21 committees be created.  Some of them do not perform and others cannot perform because they do not have the required resources or the commitment on the part of Members who are pressed to maintain their membership of other committees and duties in the House.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is stoking public cynicism by allowing this to continue.  The inference the press will draw from the establishment of 21 committees is that it facilitates the Taoiseach being able to give a chocolate sweet to those backbench members of the Government parties who failed to attain junior office in government.  We will be facilitating people by enabling them to get a stipend.  I will never forget the day I met a col<Col N="855"/>league, a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il benches, rushing out of the Committee of Public Accounts saying: &ldquo;Will you go in there quickly and vote?&rdquo;  When I asked what it had to do with him he told me he was the Whip of the committee.  I had never heard of a Whip of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is supposed to be an audit committee, a non-party committee and, by and large, it has functioned that way and has done its job.  Why must we create all these positions for disappointed office aspirants and pretend this constitutes D&aacute;il reform?  It does not.</P>
        <P>The size of this House does not warrant the establishment of 21 committees.  We need only establish half that number of committees, ensure they are properly resourced and that members who hold down positions on them have the required interest, skills and expertise to do the job.  Just as the Committee of Public Accounts carved out a reputation for itself in recent years, there is no reason the chairman of the foreign affairs or finance committees should not be a person of some stature with some clout when offering an opinion, even if it is not always the opinion of the Executive, on matters of foreign affairs, finance and so on.  The notion that we should do this for the reasons that will be inferred by the press diminishes this House and does it no credit.  It is time we had a serious debate on D&aacute;il reform.</P>

	<P Just="Left">This debate takes place at the request of the Fine Gael Party and particularly Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  I sat through most of the debate today and listened carefully to what was said, and I will respond as best I can to the points raised.  However, I will not be able to deal to everybody&rsquo;s satisfaction with all of them.  I speak in that regard to the Deputies opposite.</P>
        <P>There is an onus on me, my officials and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, the head of committees and the committee secretariat to respond as best as possible to the many suggestions made.  There is a record of this debate.  Some Members spoke of the need for records to be produced quickly.  Members will be aware that an immediate record of this debate will be available.  However, the issue will be taken seriously by me and many others.</P>
        <P>The Government is involved in ongoing discussions on various positions with the Fine Gael Party, which increased its representation in the House following the recent general election.  The discussions, if not already concluded, are almost concluded &mdash; I hope they will be concluded before the end of the day.  I informed my colleagues opposite earlier that we should first have this debate today, listen to what people had to say and conclude those discussions.</P>
        <P>I will respond to the comments made by Deputies Rabbitte and Flanagan as they are freshest in my mind.  Deputy Rabbitte spoke <Col N="856"/>about the Government trying to satisfy Deputies, but that is not the case.  Many capable Members on this side and the opposite side of the House will obtain chairmanship positions in various committees.  I too instance, as I did earlier, the work of the Committee of Public Accounts in terms of the DIRT inquiry.  I referred to the late Jim Mitchell and I acknowledge the work done by Deputy Rabbitte and others in terms of the subsequent legislation enacted as a result of the work of that committee.</P>
        <P>Issues arise all the time.  We know, as politicians, that times change and new issues emerge be they related to children, the Constitution or whatever.  Two other areas are being considered in respect of committees about which I will inform the House in due course.  What I am doing is being done in good faith.  I will return to the House as quickly as possible to put in place the process required to get the committees up and running.  I am convinced that many able people here will make a genuine commitment to the process.</P>
        <P>It is also proposed that reports from committees be brought into the House thus maintaining a connection between committees and the House.  Many Deputies spoke about the need for greater awareness and a dedicated channel for Oireachtas proceedings.  This matter will be considered by the re-established broadcasting committee.  I assure Members I have taken serious note of the comments on this issue from across party lines.  I will try to advance the issue.  I support those who called for a dedicated Oireachtas channel.  Lack of media attention has been mentioned.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has allocated more resources to enable better promotion of our work in the committees through media and the press office and to ensure what happens in other Parliaments is reflected here.</P>
        <P>On D&aacute;il reform, I was delighted to hear Deputy Kenny say that the Fine Gael Party will engage with Government on this and that there is a great deal of common ground between us.  I intend to re-establish the sub-committee on D&aacute;il reform.  I have noted that there is support for bringing forth Adjournment Debates.  I hope we can put the issue of whether the Taoiseach comes into the House on Thursday out of the way.  We have spent four years talking about that issue and I hope it can be parked and that we can move away from it.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> if he will introduce a regulation requiring all mobile telephone masts to open for use for all network operators in order to improve coverage and reduce duplication of masts; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23168/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The regulation of telecommunications operators, including regulatory issues surrounding access by operators to other operators&rsquo; networks, including infrastructure, is the responsibility of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in accordance with the requirements of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and the regulations which transpose the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications.</P>
        <P>The building of physical infrastructure for the purpose of providing electronic communications services is a matter for commercial decision by the service providers.  In a fully liberalised market, network operators cannot be statutorily required to open their infrastructure for use by other service providers unless they are found by ComReg to hold significant market power.  No mobile telephone operators have been found to hold such power in Ireland.  However, the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Access) Regulations 2003, provide operators with a right to negotiate interconnection with another operator for the purpose of providing publicly available electronic communications services and also oblige requested operators to negotiate interconnection requests.</P>
        <P>These regulations also make it a function of ComReg to encourage and, where appropriate, ensure adequate access, interconnection and interoperability of services in accordance with the regulations in the interest of efficiency, competition and benefits to end users.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first opportunity I have had to wish the Minister well in his new brief.  I am glad to see him in this particular Ministry because its handling by Fianna F&aacute;il in the past five years has amounted to a succession of missed opportunities.</P><Col N="858"/>
        <P>The Minister ought to be aware, if he is not, that Eircom has recently sold its mast network to Threefold Project Management.  Given the fact that Threefold Project Management owns and manages masts for Eircom, NTL, O2 and Meteor, is it not now approaching the significant market share to justify ComReg requiring that all masts be open to all competitors to use, in the interests of consumer protection and coverage?  If a Vodafone user drives between Cork and Dublin his or her telephone will cut out on at least a dozen occasions.  I suspect the same problem exists with other operators and the reason is the fact that we do not have shared networks.  I am sure the Minister supports the principle of ensuring Eircom&rsquo;s line network is unbundled and open for competition to use in the provision of services such as broadband and we should ensure the mast network around the country is treated no differently.</P>
        <P>It is not true to say the Minister and the Government do not have the power to intervene because a telecommunications Act in the Netherlands in 2004 has done just that.  If they decide not to go down the legislative route they have the power to issue a directive to ComReg to ensure it insists on the opening up of all masts to all operators, in the interests of consumers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Coveney for his kind words and I look forward to working with him and other Members opposite in my time in this Ministry.  I hope it will lead to a beneficial exercise in policy regulation for all the people of this country.</P>
        <P>The Deputy made the assertion that we do not have shared use but my understanding is that we do.  It may well be facilitated further by the sale of the Eircom mast network.  I understand some 60% of the mast network is shared at present and that figure is increasing.  Those areas where it is not on the increase are mainly rural locations where there may be competitive issues concerning access but, on the whole, sharing of masts is occurring.  There are regulatory powers and I encourage ComReg to use them wherever possible.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct to say it is crucial we not only have access to masts but good coverage.  ComReg is fully empowered to enforce licensing agreements by which mobile telephone companies must abide to ensure good coverage.  If there are black spots which are in breach of the licensing conditions, ComReg has the power to act.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy that the policy we want to follow is one that brings about shared and more open access, both in respect of fixed line and mobile networks.  Another step in the right direction is that, after a significant delay, we are now seeing a mobile virtual network operator, in the shape of Tesco working in conjunction with O2.  Tesco operates on the O2 network to provide a separate retail service to customers.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point on the need to generate open <Col N="859"/>access and that is occurring in terms of the masts and the network.</P>

        <Quest> the reason he has significantly reduced the grants available to homeowners for renewable heating systems under the proposed phase 2 of the greener homes scheme; the number of applicants who obtained grants under phase 1 of the scheme; the number of applicants on the waiting list for grants; the amount in total he proposes to be allocated for phase 2 of the greener homes scheme; the location where the money is being diverted from to pay for it; when this scheme will be implemented; the reason there will be a significant time lapse between phase 1 and phase 2 of the grant schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23254/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The objective of the greener homes scheme is to stimulate consumer investment in renewable heating solutions and to develop the market for renewable energy technologies, thereby reducing CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions in the domestic sector.</P>
        <P>Over 16,000 grants were approved under phase 1, which ran from April 2006 to August 2007.  There is no waiting list.  Some 6,600 of these applicants have completed installations and have received grant payments.  A further 1,800 payment requests are being processed by Sustainable Energy Ireland.  Over 8,000 applicants have received grant approval but have not yet requested grant payment.</P>
        <P>Since the scheme was launched there has been a dramatic increase in renewable technology suppliers and a tenfold expansion in the number of renewable energy products available on the market.  This clearly demonstrates the very significant level of market development since the scheme was first launched.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the scheme has achieved all of its objectives speedily and within the overall budget.  Consequently, the grant levels are being reduced for some technologies where it is clear that the market has reached a level of maturity to allow it to continue at a lower rate of support.</P>
        <P>Other grant levels remain unchanged.  Phase 1 of the greener homes scheme was concluded on Monday, 3 September.  There was a pause of 28 days ahead of phase 2 being opened on 1 October.  The pause of 28 days was required to allow space to process the remaining applications from phase 1 and to put in place all relevant administrative procedures, structures and details of the phase 2 scheme.</P>
        <P>The objective in greener homes phase 2 is to consolidate the market, underpinning it with quality standards and training and providing for a long-term future that is not grant-dependent. <Col N="860"/> The aim is to ensure that the market for these products, services and fuels continues to develop strongly, allowing suppliers and installers to consolidate their market offerings ahead of an unsubsidised market.  It will also bridge the gap between the ending of phase 1 and the introduction of new building regulations which will further stimulate market uptake.</P>
        <P>The new building regulations announced recently by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, will mandate the use of renewable heating systems in all new buildings which will provide a fundamental boost to these technologies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Minister well.  He will find there will be times when he gets more support on this side of the House than the Government side.</P>
        <P>The Minister has made a bad start.  The greener homes grant scheme, which the Minister described on 11 October 2006 as a drop in the ocean, has run into the sand because the money has run out.  He now proposes a much lower grant scheme for what is a relatively costly business for many people, namely, changing to renewable energy products from traditional sources.  It is very hard to understand how the Minister can justify slashing grants as he is doing and I ask him to comment.  How much money has been allocated for phase 2 and where is it coming from?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy McManus.  I look forward to working with her and to getting support from all sides of the House in the important work we have to do.</P>
        <P>I have indicated to the Deputy that we will require a Supplementary Estimate for a transfer budget in my Department because the committees, where such work would normally be carried out, have not yet been established.  I understand we may have to do it in the D&aacute;il sometime next week.  We will then have a chance for a further debate on the details of the revised scheme and the reasons for any changes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not good enough.  I ask the Minister not to flimflam me.  I asked him how much money would be allocated for this scheme.  It all depends on money.  The scheme that was in place ran into the sand because it did not have enough money.  How much money will be allocated for this one?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have said a Supplementary Estimate is being prepared and will be brought before the D&aacute;il next week.  It will set out in exact detail how much money will be needed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I intend to bring a Supplementary Estimate to the D&aacute;il, which is the appropriate forum for this matter to be discussed, next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister knows how much this will cost.  He knows how much money will be allocated, but he will not tell the D&aacute;il now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I can give the Deputy the rough amount now.  There will be additional expenditure of between &euro;15 million and &euro;17 million this year.  We will wait until the actual Supplementary Estimate for the exact figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is that coming from?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It will come internally from within the Department.  I would prefer to wait for the proper occasion &mdash; next week&rsquo;s debate on the Supplementary Estimate &mdash; before I make a decision on the matter.  We could have a debate on the Supplementary Estimate now, but we would not have time for any of the other Priority Questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need for a debate.  I want the Minister to answer my questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to answer them.  Given that the solar energy grant, for example, is being maintained at the exact same level, I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s contention that we are slashing the scheme.  Many of the heating grant levels are staying the exact same.  Reductions are being made in other areas because market technology has reached a certain maturity.  I am sure the Deputy supports other schemes within the budgetary context which also need funding.  As Minister, the prudent thing for me to do is to allocate my budget appropriately.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to my comments about the scheme in October last year, when I said the green homes scheme was &ldquo;a drop in the ocean&rdquo;.  She may have noted that I also said, if I recall correctly, that the then Minister should do exactly <Col N="862"/>what I am doing now, which is to move to a regulatory approach where all new buildings will be required to have these heating systems.  I asked the then Minister to do this, but I did not get an answer.  That is what we are actually starting to do now.  The purpose of the grants is to try to undo the damage caused by 100 years of an oil and gas-fired industry supply chain by moving towards a renewables-fired supply chain.  We need to oblige people to use it.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the way he will facilitate the opening of a fully competitive market in the postal delivery sector and in particular the way he will deal with financially supporting the public service obligation that currently exists for An Post in the context of open competition; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23169/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Commission published a proposal for the third postal directive last year.  It proposed that the postal sectors across the European Union should be fully opened to competition.  The proposal has been debated at the European Parliament and European Council.  Political agreement was reached at Council level on 1 October last that the deadline for the full opening of the market would be 1 January 2011 for most EU countries, including Ireland.  As Ireland has fully implemented the first two European directives, the liberalisation of our postal sector has commenced.  The reserved area, the part of the market confined to An Post, has been gradually reduced since 2000.  To date, Ireland has adopted a light-handed and pro-competition approach to regulating the postal market, thereby maximising the number of postal operators entering the market.  In the light of the benefits that competition brings, there is no reason to suggest Ireland should depart from such an approach.</P>
        <P>I do not doubt that liberalisation and the complete removal of the legal barrier to entry will encourage new entrants into the postal market.  Other sectors which have liberalised as a result of developments at EU level such as the telecommunications market have resulted in greater consumer choice and reduced prices.  I anticipate that the liberalisation of the postal market will have similarly positive effects for Irish consumers.</P>
        <P>Issues that will be important for Ireland in the context of a fully liberalised market will include the protection of the universal service and the continued viability of An Post in the face of open competition.  The draft directive proposes that the existing levels of universal service be maintained, which means that there will be one clearance and <Col N="863"/>one delivery to every address in Ireland no less than five days a week.  If it can be established that meeting the universal service obligation constitutes a net cost, the draft directive sets out a number of options from which member states may choose, including the establishment of a compensation fund, the procurement of the universal service by a member state, the provision of compensation from public funds or the requirement that the universal service provider bear the full cost of the obligation from its resources.  No decision has been made on how the cost, if any, of the obligation will be met in the absence of the reserved area.  Many international studies suggest that meeting the obligation may not entail a net cost.</P>
  
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>To inform Government in its decisions on options relating to the USO and other matters, I intend, before the directive is transposed, to conduct a public consultation seeking the views of all stakeholders in these and other matters arising from the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>With all due respect, if the Minister were on this side of the House, he would describe that answer as waffle.  Rather than answering the question, he gave the facts that everybody knows &mdash; for example, that competition will be good for the market.  He said we needed to consider a number of options, but I want to know which option he favours.  Competition will be not be a problem in busy cities and urban areas.  An Post accepts it will have to compete with companies coming into Ireland to cherry-pick profitable areas within the postal sector.  The problem is how we will pay for the universal service obligation.  How can we ensure people in places like the Beara Peninsula, Connemara and north-west Donegal receive the same level of postal service as people living in Dublin 4?  The reality is that we cannot expect An Post to compete on a head-to-head basis with companies in competitive areas while having to cross-subsidise loss-making in those parts of the country where the universal service obligation is more difficult to fulfil.  How will we pay for it?  Will we impose a levy on new entrants into the market?  Will the State carry the cost by means of taxpayers&rsquo; money?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The protocol is that Ministers answer questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer it with a question.  How is Deputy Coveney so certain that a cost will be applied?  Contrary to the absolute assertion that compensation will certainly be <Col N="864"/>required, the international experience in countries where liberalisation has already taken place such as Sweden, Finland and the United Kingdom is that there has been no need for a compensation scheme because a discernible cost has not been applied.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no such thing as a point of information, but the Deputy may ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister give way?</P>

	<P>The Minister asked a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems somewhat warped that the Minister has started to ask the Opposition spokespersons questions.  Intense lobbying is taking place in the United Kingdom for what is called zonal pricing, for the very reason I have outlined.  Certain interests are trying to make the case that the further a postal company has to carry a letter, the more it should be allowed to charge the customer.  We are trying to avoid the introduction of such a philosophy as part of our universal service obligation.  The United Kingdom is not a particularly good example.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not object to any support measures we may need to put in place.  However, there should not be an absolute and blanket assumption that such measures will be needed.  It is important to consider the reality of the experience in other countries as we make our decision.  It would not be appropriate for me to announce today the type of support price or mechanism we should put in place.  This proposed directive was cleared by the European Council last week.  We will have to respect any changes to the proposed directive which may be made by the European Parliament when it is referred to that forum.  When the final outcome of the deliberations in Brussels is known, we will ask the public and the various bodies interested in this sector for their views.  The Government position that will be outlined at that point will be based on detailed analysis of the support systems which might have to be put in place, if it is actually necessary in the light of international experience to do so.</P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>I certainly do.  The European Parliament will certainly not prescribe <Col N="865"/>how the Government should implement competition in the Irish postal market.  It will agree the overall directive and possibly amend the manner in which it will be framed, in the interests of promoting competition across the European Union.  The Government will decide how we will put it in place in the Irish market.</P>

        <Quest> his views on an east-west electricity inter-connector between Ireland and Britain will be built; the person who will pay for same; the capacity it should have; the acceptable timeframe for the project to commence and be finished; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23170/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is giving high priority to the development of the east-west electricity interconnector between Ireland and Britain.  The White Paper on energy policy and the programme for Government underline this commitment which will contribute to security of supply and competitiveness.  Greater interconnection between member states is a key priority for the European Union if it is to ensure the Internal Market will work effectively.  Work on the east-west electricity interconnector project is progressing well.</P>
        <P>Following a 2006 Government decision, the Commission for Energy Regulation is arranging the design of a competition to secure the construction of a 500 MW interconnector at the earliest possible date before 2012.  The Government has also decided that the interconnector will, as a national strategic asset, remain in public ownership and be owned by EirGrid.  The Government also decided that as a national strategic asset the interconnector will remain in public ownership and will be owned by EirGrid.</P>
        <P>EirGrid is progressing work on route selection and technical specification of the interconnector and has recently announced that Woodland in County Meath is the most favoured connection point on the Irish side.  Work is also advancing with the relevant authorities on finalising the connection point on the west coast of Britain. <Col N="866"/> EirGrid, overseen by the CER, is also finalising the competition structure, documentation and related contractual arrangements.</P>
        <P>To oversee and ensure delivery of the interconnector to schedule, a high level co-ordination group has been established under the chairmanship of the CER and comprising representatives of EirGrid and my Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, which provides for a streamlined planning process for strategic infrastructure developments, includes special provisions designed to expedite the planning process for electricity interconnector projects.</P>
        <P>To underpin the interconnector development process, new arrangements have been made in respect of the construction and governance under licence of interconnector operators by the CER in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006.</P>
        <P>In particular, the Act provides that the CER may, with ministerial consent, secure the construction of an interconnector.  Such consent will be contingent on final Government approval.  As regards funding, the CER and EirGrid are working to determine the most cost-effective and efficient solution. Funding proposals will be part of the submission seeking Government approval for the CER to proceed with securing the construction of the interconnector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that the ESB offered to build this interconnector and then hand it over to EirGrid? Why did the Government turn down that offer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Deputy that it was the previous Government which made that decision; I only arrived in June.  The decision was part of a general development to ensure the separation of EirGrid as a fully separately owned asset company which would develop this transmission asset.  The Government has put its confidence in EirGrid and in my experience to date, that confidence has been well justified.  EirGrid is proving to be a highly effective, highly capable operator showing that it can deliver projects of this scale.</P>
        <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that EirGrid recently secured Woodland in County Meath as a connection point for the interconnector on the Irish transmission side.  In the last few weeks EirGrid has received a connection offer on the British side for Deeside in Wales.  PB Power and Anderson PS technical advisors have been commissioned to start work on the design and planning in Britain.  My assessment of the project and of EirGrid&rsquo;s capability shows they are fully able to deliver these types of assets.  I believe it will be completed in time and the Government&rsquo;s original decision will be seen to be well placed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify the position, the taxpayer will pay for it and it will be <Col N="867"/>handed over to EirGrid who will own it on behalf of the State.  It will be linked up with the network which EirGrid controls and will own separately from the ESB when the Minister decides to introduce legislation to make this happen.  Is this correct?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister satisfied &mdash; because I am not &mdash; that 500 MW is big enough?  People in the industry tell me that if the cable is being laid, there is a question as to why it is being limited to 500 MW instead of 1,000 MW.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed there is no benefit in going to 1,000 MW in terms of the construction costs.  It is more debatable whether it makes sense in terms of energy.  The analysis carried out by the Department showed that a phased introduction to interconnection was a better way of doing it.  Care must be taken to develop our own market systems here by encouraging generation and not to undermine this by introducing a large supply on an interconnection basis which might undermine some of the renewable development projects here.  It will be a measured approach which allows us to proceed further and gain experience in new technology such as long distance sea cable interconnection.  This will provide information on further opportunities such as further interconnection into the UK or possibly into France or into grids which run in a north-south direction along the Irish Sea.  </P>
        <P>To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question, it is proposed that the transmission network will be managed and owned by EirGrid and that includes the interconnector in this case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the clarification.  Does the Minister mean there is no cost saving to building a 1,000 MW interconnector at that stage as opposed to a 500 MW?  Will it be as cost effective to upgrade in the future?  Is this cost being factored in by the Minister?</P>
        <P>The point made by the Minister is also the point I wish to make.  We are endeavouring to introduce competition into the Irish market by connecting to the British grid.  Is it not the case that electricity in Britain has consistently been 15% and 20% cheaper than in Ireland over the past five years for households and businesses?   The purpose of the interconnector is not just to provide more capacity and security and perhaps the opportunity to export green energy, but it is primarily about piping in competition into the Irish electricity market place and to allow businesses and households have cheaper bills.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed from the consultants&rsquo; reports that there is no cost loss to the State by choosing this option and it may well be more cost effective.</P>
        <P>With regard to the difference in electricity prices on either side of the Irish Sea, the Govern<Col N="868"/>ment is concerned about the cost of electricity but it underlines that we must be careful to deliver those renewable electricity sources which will be more cost competitive in the long run.  Fossil fuels will become more scarce and therefore more expensive.  We must take care not to undermine that development in the manner in which we develop the grid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It will keep costs high so renewables are competitive.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the strategy he supports for an efficient and speedy roll out of broadband to all parts of the country; the timeframe that this can be achieved in; the way the Government will support the process; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23171/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, the widespread provision of broadband services is a major priority for the Government.  In this context, the primary role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</P>
        <P>Broadband penetration has increased significantly in recent years.  Penetration levels have increased to 698,000 subscribers which, by OECD measures, is the equivalent of 16.48% of the population.  This compares to less than 1% in 2002.</P>
        <P>As a result, Ireland has improved its position internationally and Government action through provision of an optimal regulatory regime and targeted infrastructural investment will continue to support this performance.  In the latter context, the State has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant aid under the recently concluded group broadband scheme and investment in metropolitan area networks, known as MANs.</P>
        <P>There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services. <Col N="869"/> Accordingly, the procurement process for a national broadband scheme is under way.  The national broadband scheme will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the procurement process, the pre-qualification questionnaire phase, is now complete and four candidates have pre-qualified.  As my Department indicated on 2 September 2007, the four candidates in alphabetical order are: BT Communications Ireland Limited consortium; Eircom Limited; Hutchinson 3G Ireland Limited and IFA-Motorola consortium.</P>
        <P>The next phase of the procurement process involves inviting candidates to participate in a competitive dialogue process.  My Department is anticipating that the national broadband strategy contract will be awarded in the second quarter of 2008, with roll out of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter.  This timeline is subject to negotiations with candidates during the competitive dialogue phase of the procurement process.</P>
        <P>The broadband product to be provided under the national broadband scheme will be broadly equivalent to the tariffs and products typically available on the Irish market.  The most appropriate mechanism to achieve this aim will be decided during the competitive dialogue process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  It is helpful to know which groups are in the running for the national broadband scheme.  I wish to make a reality check for anyone listening to this debate.  Ireland is still a long way behind all its direct competitors and many of its European neighbours in terms of broadband connectivity.  A total of 7.8% of the population of County Leitrim have broadband and the total in County Cavan is 9.1%.  I contest the Minister&rsquo;s figures of 16% which he outlined.  Independent estimates would put the figure closer to 12% or 13%.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>With regard to the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;16.2 million which was mentioned earlier and which we will debate next week, a total of &euro;10 million of that sum has been diverted from information and communications technology programmes.  What is losing out?  Will it be broadband roll-out or group broadband schemes?  If so, is the Minister transferring money from IT development and broadband roll-out to the greener homes scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures are OECD figures, which are used most commonly, although many people would criticise them as not providing an accurate picture.  However, there are various distortions with whatever statistics one uses.  In general, we must aim to be at the top of the international league, regardless of the measures, and we should not concentrate only on narrow <Col N="870"/>percentages.  We should aim to have as widespread availability as possible.</P>
        <P>The group broadband schemes, numbering approximately 120, were set up to provide local community-based services, often through small local providers.  The thinking in the Department was that this did not provide a proper, comprehensive or efficient response to the problem of connectivity in rural isolated areas.  That is the reason for the advancement towards a new scheme, the national broadband scheme.  It is far more comprehensive and covers all the areas that would not otherwise have coverage.  It is a more effective and innovative scheme which I believe will be successful.  It involves a competitive bidding process which, hopefully, as we go through that process will allow us to raise the level of service in terms of the speed of broadband and technical capabilities, while reducing the costs.</P>
        <P>With regard to the funding, there was a re-allocation within the Department.  There is a multi-annual funding scheme available to the Department for metropolitan area networks, which are a long-term investment and the correct investment for the future in terms of putting fibre in the ground.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister must conclude.  The time for this question has expired but I will allow a final supplementary question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister confirm that he is abandoning the group broadband scheme because he believes it is not working?  The reason it has not worked is that there is only matching funding and the community must find half the funding.  It is being abandoned in favour of a national broadband scheme that will happen at some stage in the future and the money is being diverted to a different sector in the Department.  People who aspired to get funding to bring broadband to their communities can forget it because the &euro;10 million earmarked for that will now go to the greener homes scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Coveney is incorrect.  The Government is following through on financing the group broadband scheme.  All grant applications are set out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is coming from the multi-annual programme in the telecommunications area, particularly from the MANs and other development.  The funds were not fixed on any year, which allows us flexibility in terms of payment.  That allowed us to transfer funds.</P>

        <AskConj><b> </b>asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> if he will bring forward measures to give the energy regulator, CER, co-competition powers with the Competition Authority over the oil and liquid fuels market; if he will direct CER to investigate and report on pricing policies in the oil and liquid fuels market; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23055/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated.  There is free entry into the market.  The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, is the independent body statutorily responsible for overseeing and regulating Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and gas sectors.  The CER has no role in regard to the oil industry.  The Competition Authority is a statutory independent body with a specific role in the enforcement of competition law.  The National Consumer Agency has specific responsibilities for protecting the rights of consumers.  Its function is to ensure that competition works optimally for the benefit of consumers throughout the country.</P>
        <P>There are no proposals at present to bring forward measures to give the CER a role in regard to the Irish oil industry, given the nature of the market and the roles and responsibilities of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure what body is charged with ensuring a competitive oil and liquid fuels market.  There is clearly concern on the part of motorists purchasing petrol that there are cartels operating, but nobody appears to be in charge of investigating or dealing with that possibility.  The only organisation I can find is the Automobile Association, AA, which is hardly the appropriate body.  There is also the issue of the difficulty in accessing supplies, given that so many petrol stations are closing due to the lucrative property market.  This is a problem particularly in rural communities, where petrol stations are closing and people are concerned that this will concentrate the facilities to an even greater degree.  What does the Minister intend to do about that?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="872"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>If there is evidence, even a suspicion, that a cartel is operating, the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency, a statutory body established last May to defend consumer rights, can investigate and bring to book anybody in the industry who is engaging in cartel practices.  In Dublin, where property prices are high, the availability and expense of sites are issues.  However, it is not possible for the Government to intervene and regulate a free market by trying to set prices or, indeed, set particular filling station locations and micromanage it at that level.</P>
        <P>The Department and the CER have a general role in the energy policy area to ensure general security of supply.  We are preparing a report at present examining energy security and long-term security implications.  I have also, through the amendments that were made possible in the changes to the National Oil Reserves Agency Act, recently raised the security of supply levy to ensure we will have 90 days storage available in the event of any disruption.  The State is engaged at that level.  With regard to issues involving incorrect practices that exploit the consumer, the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency are sufficiently strong to address them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a weak and ineffectual reply from the point of view of the person who is trying to get petrol at a reasonable price.  There is clearly deep suspicion about price fixing.  Is the Minister aware that an advertisement in this regard has been placed in various newspapers similar to the advertisement placed by Newry solicitors regarding planning, which unearthed major scandals in the planning system?  The Minister must accept some responsibility.  There is widespread concern and many questions about petrol prices and the fact that they tend to rise at the same time and stay at the same level.  The price may vary regionally but within regions the price is more or less the same.  If it looks, smells and feels like a cartel, one must do something about it.  However, it is not clear who has the authority to do it.  The Minister says he can deal with oil reserves but he will not deal with the issue confronting the individual buying petrol.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand from people in the sector that the margins in the fuel delivery business are incredibly tight, probably because it is an open and competitive market.  The Deputy sees a suspicion of price fixing where prices move up and down in tandem.  Perhaps she is right, and her deep suspicions or widespread concerns are based on fact.  Alternatively, however, perhaps the fluctuations in the oil market price cause prices in the petrol stations here to rise and fall accordingly.  If there is evidence to support the deep suspicions and widespread concerns, there are mechanisms in place for those concerns to be presented and the Com<Col N="873"/>petition Authority or other bodies can examine them.  If the Deputy is saying that I should respond to deep suspicions when I do not have the statutory authority to do so but other Departments do, that does not appear to be a logical approach.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>When similar questions were raised about the mobile phone market, the regulator, ComReg, responded with a website which outlined to consumers in clear terms the difference in prices and options on offer from various operators.  Would it be forward thinking to take a lead on this issue and speak with the energy regulator about similarly comparing diesel, petrol and biofuel prices throughout the country?  As someone who drives between Cork and Dublin on a regular basis, I can state the costs vary widely.  While the Minister states his understanding is that the margins on petrol are tight, the reality is that the price for people at the pump varies significantly from petrol station to petrol station.  It may remain the same within regions and this is the potential cartel activity mentioned by Deputy McManus.  Does the Minister agree many problems would be solved if the regulator took a lead on this issue and published prices on a website so people could make comparisons?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify for the Minister that this is not only my suspicion &mdash; if it were I would not be here asking important questions on it &mdash; it is of widespread concern.  Within regions there seems to be uniformity and this raises questions.  When this happens, the Minister with responsibility for energy must deal with it.  Otherwise the consumer is left unprotected.  The Competition Authority investigates dentists, solicitors and everybody else, but somehow this issue is allowed float free.  This is a matter of concern and it lands on the Minister&rsquo;s desk.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>If evidence is presented to show regional or other competition issues which must be addressed and investigated I will happily pursue them.  To answer Deputy Coveney, the difference between the mobile phone market and the petrol station market is that one is regulated and has a licensing system and the other is a free and open market which one can enter and exit easily.  Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s point that price differences between various petrol stations are perfectly apparent is valid.  This allows the consumer, including the Deputy as he drives to and from Cork, to decide where to stop and purchase petrol.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is that not everyone drives from Cork to Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>If a station is cheaper and the sign outside the door states clearly the rate per litre, one is free to purchase the petrol.  It is slightly different with mobile phone oper<Col N="874"/>ators, who could improve transparency on real prices because one is contractually obliged to use the phone unless one changes operator.  It is different from stopping one&rsquo;s car and choosing one petrol station over another.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 11, 47 and 66 together.</P>
        <P>The Corrib gas project is an infrastructural development of major national importance.  The developers of the field have completed the majority of the sub-sea construction work to prepare the Corrib field for production of gas.  Construction work has begun on the terminal.</P>
        <P>Last month, consultants engaged by the developers of the Corrib gas field announced a short list of three indicative route corridor options.  This followed a recommendation made by the mediator, Mr. Peter Cassells, to modify the route of the pipeline in the vicinity of Rossport to address community concerns regarding proximity to housing which was accepted by the developers.  These three corridor options will now be subject to further environmental and technical studies in parallel with community and landowner consultation as well as consultation with relevant statutory agencies.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14- ?><P>Once a preferred route is selected it will be necessary for the developers to make an application to me under the Gas Act for consent to construct the pipeline.  In addition, consent from An <Col N="875"/>Bord Plean&aacute;la will be required under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act.  It would not be appropriate for me, having regard to my regulatory role, to express a preference for any particular pipeline route for the Corrib gas project.</P>
<?oasys _dc0- ?>
        <P>Since my appointment as Minister I have met a wide range of stakeholders involved in the project, including the developers, individuals who are interested in the project and people from the local community.  As the project advances I am open to continuing my engagement with representatives of the local community and others on matters relating to my regulatory role.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister inherited this issue and I pay tribute to Mr. Peter Cassells for the work he has done on this difficult matter.  The timeframe is short and the Minister will be expected to make his decision in November according to the documentation I received.  Is this still the case?  A great deal of work would be involved between now and November.  How far has work progressed on the environmental impact of the three alternative routes?  When the Minister was in opposition, he recommended that Bord Gais be involved in overseeing the operation of the terminal.  Is this still his view and, if so, has he made any progress in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The November deadline relates to the EPA which was due to make a presentation on the final clearance it must give on the terminal building.  This decision was deferred until November when the EPA will deal with a variety of environmental licensing issues with regard to the terminal building.  Later this year the developer will announce its preferred pipeline route option.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that this year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, this year.  This is subject to its work programme and technical issues which may arise.  The timeline is not ours and the initiative is with the development company rather than the Department or any other body.  A complicated evaluation process will follow this, including public consultation involving An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the new Planning and Development (Critical Infrastructure) Act, the foreshore licensing section of the relevant Department and my Department in terms of consent.  My Department liaises with the other Departments and agencies involved in this complicated process to ensure a co-ordinated approach.  I intend that the process will be open and transparent and will engage people in a positive and constructive manner so their concerns are addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>What timeframe is involved?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="876"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The timeframe will begin when a preferred route option is proposed and the process will continue into next year.  It will not be a short timeframe.  It will take several months rather than weeks as it must engage An Bord Plean&aacute;la as well as the Department.  The timeframe is difficult to quantify in advance and the Planning and Development (Critical Infrastructure) Bill means we are in new territory.  I am confident it can be done in an orderly manner which is respectful of all parties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I also asked the Minister about Bord Gais.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Bord Gais made clear that its involvement does not extend beyond the internal gas transmission pipeline.  It constructed the pipeline connection to the terminal building but is not engaged in the offshore pipeline section.</P>

        <Quest> the White Paper on Energy Policy has been implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23118/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The energy White Paper was published on 12 March 2007.  It sets out a comprehensive range of policy actions designed to deliver on our strategic goals for security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness over the period to 2020.  There is no doubt that we need to make fundamental changes to the way we provide and use energy.  Ireland&rsquo;s sustainable energy future depends on it.  The programme for Government endorses the White Paper and underlines the imperative to secure long-term energy security and a low carbon future for Ireland.  The urgent and massive challenge of climate change underscores this imperative.</P>
        <P>The many policy actions in the energy White Paper have different timelines.  The short-term actions are under way.  Others have longer time horizons with work starting now.  As the Minister responsible for energy, my clear objective is accelerated, intensified delivery on all fronts, reflecting the challenges we face.  To achieve a secure, sustainable energy future for Ireland we need collective delivery across all the priority areas.</P>
        <P>I will outline some of the key priority areas and associated progress.  The single electricity market is on schedule to go live on 1 November.  The energy efficiency action plan has been launched for consultation and will be finalised before the end of this year.</P>
        <P>The east-west and north-south electricity interconnectors are proceeding according to schedule, with a view to delivery by 2012 or sooner if possible.  We are giving priority to accelerated delivery of our renewable energy targets for electricity <Col N="877"/>and heating by addressing barriers and ensuring positive signals to the market.  We are putting in place measures to support the potential of Ocean Energy as a key opportunity for Ireland.</P>
        <P>The all-island grid study is nearing completion and will provide critical underpinning for future development of the grid in support of renewable energy.  We are expediting the programme of roll-out over time, of the installation of smart meters in every home through the Commission for Energy Regulation, ESB Networks and Sustainable Energy Ireland.</P>
        <P>The policy actions under way and planned in the White Paper, together with the additional commitments in the programme for Government, will result in a transformed landscape for the Irish energy sector.  I am committed to working in partnership with my Government colleagues and with all stakeholders to deliver that change.  The challenges of security of supply and climate change have created a new energy paradigm for Ireland for Europe and globally.  My objective is to meet the challenge of being ahead rather than behind in energy policy terms in addressing that new framework.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I concede the question was so general that I did not expect precise answers.  May I probe the Minister on one or two specifics; first, how does he intend to handle the separation of the ESB and Eirgrid?  In essence what he is proposing is to take the transition system which is made up of 6,600 km valued at &euro;840 million away from the ESB balance sheet and any ESB maintenance work and so on and put it under the direct responsibility of Eirgrid to manage it as a State asset.  The principle of that is one with which I agree but there are some significant hurdles to be got over to achieve it.  My understanding is that the ESB has very substantial borrowings based on the balance sheet that includes the transmission system and that the value of the transmission system is security for the ESB on some of its substantial spending programmes which involve significant borrowing.  How does the Government plan to deal with that issue early next year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Coveney and I were opposition colleagues at a time when the borrowing limit was increased for the ESB from, if I recall correctly, &euro;2 billion to &euro;6 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Looking at the recent annual accounts it is interesting to note that the borrowing level has not increased to anywhere near what was anticipated.  It is probably closer to what it was at the time when emergency legislation had to be drafted.  I am less concerned about the balance sheet, the borrowing aspect of the ESB, than I would be if it had been closer to the levels we provided for in legislation.  Deputy <Col N="878"/>Coveney is correct in saying that in opposition I also welcomed the separation of the ownership of the transmission assets under the understanding that these assets would be maintained in public ownership, that this was an asset that rightly belonged to the people, that it is a natural monopoly and, therefore, there was no question of these assets being privatised.  Given that we had a separated out transmission grid company that was meant to have complete autonomy and was acting with complete autonomy, the reality was that in a sense the assets had to be transferred to make a reality of that separation out.  It was nonsense to separate out this company completely and not give it ownership of the assets it managed.  On the basis of giving that company confidence in how it manages those assets there would be no effective transmission grid company if on the one hand it was told to act in a certain manner and at the same time it did not have confidence in what it was doing because it did not own the assets it managed, so it made sense.</P>

	<P>Taking a slightly different tactic, because this is a huge area, the renewable energy promotion area, does the Minister plan specific targets on an annual basis in terms of the overall power generation in Ireland coming from renewable energy and, if not, why, because that is something he promoted strongly in opposition?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have the obvious target of 15% in electricity generation by 2010.  At present we are close to 10%.  With targets we have to be careful not to set limits to our ambitions.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am quite happy to be measured on reaching those targets not as a limit of our ambitions but as the floor on an annual basis and to be picked up on that if we do not achieve it.  I will come back to the ESB at a later stage.</P>

        <Quest> if he will report on the Government&rsquo;s target of 700,000 broadband subscribers by the end of 2007; his views on the targets the Government should set for broadband roll-out to 2010; the measures he will take to introduce this objective; if he has had contact with broadband service providers on achieving the new 700,000 target; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There were 698,000 broadband subscribers in Ireland at end of quarter two of 2007 according to official figures from ComReg.  Since then, the 700,000 target has been achieved and I am confident the final figure for the end of 2007 will greatly exceed 700,000.  This 698,000 figure is equivalent to 16.48% of the population.  At the start of 2005 only 3% of the population were broadband subscribers and 6.76% of the population at the start of 2006.  This is significant progress by any measure. </P>
        <P>A draft policy paper on next generation broadband is being prepared by my Department, which will review current communications infrastructure policy, and analyse policy options in light of industry developments.  This will give guidance on the optimum role for Government in the planning and roll-out of broadband.  It will be in this context that any new targets may be set.</P>
        <P>My Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded group broadband scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks, MANs.</P>
        <P>Despite these Government initiatives there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a national broadband scheme is under way.  The national broadband scheme will provide broadband services to areas that are currently not served and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in those areas are met.</P>
        <P>My Department is anticipating that the award of the national broadband scheme contract will be in quarter two of 2008, with roll-out of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter.  This timeline is subject to negotiations with <Col N="880"/>candidates during the competitive dialogue phase of the procurement process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the major complaints I have received through constituents and across the country has been problems with broadband.  Is the Minister aware there are still significant complaints in regard to inability to access it, the cost in some cases, and sometimes technical difficulties? Has he considered looking at the figures to see how effective is the provision across the country because it appears there is a slight disconnect between the reality and the figures and statistics he has given?  In relation to MANs, when in opposition the Minister called MANs a spectacular waste of money.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on his views now, because it appears that what he is talking about in terms of transferring &euro;10 million out of the MANs and into the greenhomes scheme will have a fairly sizeable impact, whether on a multi-annual basis or not.  What exactly will be the impact?  Given that all politics is local, on the whole issue of enabled exchanges, Eircom has enabled 500 exchanges and have promised 400 more in the next two years &mdash; although it keeps changing its timetable &mdash; yet, there is a huge disparity across the country.  In Wicklow there are 13 while in Donegal there are 30.  That does not auger well for my constituents and I am sure other parts of the country have difficulties as well.  Perhaps the Minister would comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Where we are not getting sufficient service I have no problem in deploring that and in encouraging the companies involved.  I will have no problem in regulating as much as possible to ensure that the companies involved begin to provide services.  In the case of Wicklow if that is the level of exchange that has been enabled, then it is an issue of real concern.  The response to that is how we deliver it.  There are various way of delivering service, one of which is through competition.  Where a company does not provide a viable product in that area, if we could ensure there is a competitor who would get a competitive advantage it would give a real impetus to the existing companies to ensure they provide it.</P>
        <P>In other words if a cable operator in Bray or Wicklow could start meeting some of the slack demand or a mobile operator could take on the business that undoubtedly exists there, it would put pressure on companies where there are gaps in availability to ensure it is provided.  It is not just basic availability.  We need to consider higher speeds and cheaper prices.  We need to move on from the level of coverage and the statistics in terms of the number of houses that have it to the quality of the service.</P>
        <P>In general we have a difficulty relating to two very different geographical circumstances.  In urban areas it would be easier to achieve such competition because of the existence of cable and <Col N="881"/>fixed lines &mdash; there is copper in the ground.  The national broadband scheme exists to ensure we do not leave sections of the country behind and that we have universal accessibility.  We then need to ensure the speeds are higher and the prices are lower.  This is not just banging or hammering companies.  Their long-term viability relies on such a universal high-quality and lower-price service being available.  This represents the future for communications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the end of the group broadband scheme, is the Minister telling us today that people in rural areas without the capacity to connect to broadband will have no Government sponsored or supported scheme to help them connect to broadband until the national broadband scheme is in place, which the Minister has advised will be some time after 2008?  For the next 18 months people can have no aspiration to gain broadband in their homes or businesses if they cannot currently get it.  The Government has nothing to offer to people for the next 18 months to two years until the new national broadband scheme is in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to reinforce what the Deputy has said.  I am aware of significant rural parts of my constituency where considerable frustration has been expressed.  There would be concern that they will now need to wait until 2008.  The Minister talking about competition is a very poor response when we are talking about areas of the country in which competition will not apply to any great extent.  It is one thing to have a model in Dublin.  I am not talking about people living on the tops of mountains; I am talking about relatively sizeable villages with only recent introduction of broadband as is the case in Rathnew, for example, or places still struggling to get a decent broadband service.  If a decent broadband service exists they are often expected to pay through the nose for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know where Deputy Coveney got the 18 months figure.  I believe I said earlier that the scheme would be operational by the second quarter of 2008, which would be less than six months away.  The group broadband scheme was fully implemented in terms of processing all the applications and providing grants in 2004 and 2005.  Based on the experience of that scheme it was decided that the way to ensure it really covered all areas was to move to this national scheme, which I regard as a positive development.</P>
        <P>When on holidays in Inishbofin this summer I experienced a very good broadband scheme in a very isolated rural island, which indicates that companies exist and group broadband schemes are operating providing it to rural areas.  We need to ensure universal availability and then move up to make it higher speed and lower cost, which is <Col N="882"/>the key development I will be pursuing in the consumers&rsquo; interest.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <QRef>[23122/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Eircom&rsquo;s fixed line network is one of many regulated communications networks in Ireland.  The communications landscape has been transformed over the last decade.  Where once we had just one publicly owned telecommunications company, we now have close to 400 operators in the communications area.  Ireland now has a mix of mobile, wireless, cable and fixed networks all of which are capable of delivering high-quality, innovative telecommunications services including broadband.  The regulation of these networks, including Eircom, is a matter for the independent Commission for Communications Regulation.</P>
        <P>My role as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is to ensure the best possible legislative and regulatory framework for telecommunications services to promote the public interest in this area.  In my view the public interest is best served in the telecommunications sector by having a state of the art, affordable and accessible telecommunications service that can be used sustainably for social and economic development.  My priority therefore, is to provide the policy framework for the sector as a whole to facilitate the provision of competitive high-quality communications services across a range of infrastructure platforms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister consider it would be desirable for Eircom to considering splitting into a wholesale network provider and a retail provider of telecommunications services?  If that were to happen would the Government be interested in using the split as a way to roll out broadband across the country and to ensure that the network was managed and regulated independently without a retail arm and concentrated solely on providing a wholesale pricing for the use of its network to all competing service providers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it would be a positive development.  We look to the UK example where a similar incumbent provider separated its business and provided its mainline retail network on a wholesale access basis.  Going back to the argument the Deputy made earlier, it seems to me that there is an economic or commercial benefit for companies moving in that direction.  By raising the overall level of business, be it in wholesale or retail, it could make more efficient use and development of a network system.  I would be supportive of such a development.  The <Col N="883"/>exact mechanisms and how it would be done would primarily be a commercial matter for the company.  It would be its decision as to how it managed its assets and arranged its business.  The Government will work in one manner with ComReg and the Department to assist in whatever way possible such a development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>If that split were to happen would the Government be tempted to buy a share in that network company?  The Minister and many others have been very critical that in the sale of Telecom &Eacute;ireann we sold a very valuable network which many people would like to see in State hands or at least controlled by the State.  Is there a potential opportunity for the State to buy back an asset that perhaps should never have left State hands in the first place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Earlier I spoke about the developing competitive market in terms of not just fixed line telecommunications providers of which there are several.  The number of companies in the telecommunications area is very significant in wireless, cable and a range of different technological services.  We need to be very careful that we do not just jump into a very quickly evolving and competitive market in a way that would restrict our development technologically.  My general instinct is that we would need to look in some detail at any proposal, to consider the costs and benefits and the developing market conditions, and to be very careful before making similar bold moves that in the past might have seemed in the first instance to be very astute but actually have longer-term consequences that are difficult to manage.  My main intent in this regard is to work with ComReg, which has been in existence for ten years and has considerable experience, and my Department to consider all the consequences of any such separation, but not to commit the State to anything as yet.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the need to strike a land balance between energy and food crops.  The European Commission has indicated its awareness of general sustainability issues regarding biofuels and has signalled its intention to introduce incentives and support systems to avoid such issues.  Specifically, it intends to encourage the development of &ldquo;second gener<Col N="884"/>ation&rdquo; biofuels which can be produced from non-food crops or from areas that do not conflict with food production.</P>
        <P>To this end, it is anticipated the Commission&rsquo;s renewable energy legislative proposals, to be published at the end of 2007, will contain targets for biofuels market penetration, subject to the introduction of sustainability criteria and the coming on stream of second-generation biofuels.  The Commission also notes that European demand for biomass, especially biofuels, could contribute to improving trade relations with the European Union&rsquo;s trading partners, in particular developing countries, many of which have the potential to produce and export biomass and biofuels at competitive prices. It will be important to strike a careful balance to ensure the optimum outcome in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in transport, providing opportunities for developing countries and, at the same time, minimising risk to food production.  Ireland&rsquo;s biofuels obligation will take account of EU sustainability initiatives relating to biofuels and I intend to work very closely with my EU colleagues in addressing this complex challenge for biofuels policy.</P>

	<P>When the proposals are published, will the Minister ensure they are debated in the House because this is a major issue?  There is always the danger that as the notion of renewable energy is promoted, we could create imbalance and unfairness elsewhere.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on what he thinks the EU could do to ensure the poorest people of the world are not put at a great disadvantage as the battle develops between the use of land for food and the use of land for fuel.  Grant aid alone is not an effective way to address this issue.  Presumably, more effective measures could be used.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I would very much welcome a detailed debate but this may take more than a debate in the House.  For example, this could be a subject for a committee because it is highly complex and technical.  Second generation biofuels have different implications for generating feed stock, as they are generated from a general organic source rather than a food source.  Such issues require much analysis and it would be appropriate for the Oireachtas to go into detail on this so that we have a proper understanding of market conditions.  They are complex not only in the context of food prices for people in the developing world but also in the context of environmental consequences, as we could end up subsidising or supporting biofuel production elsewhere which has a detrimental environmental effect.  I commend the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion that the Oireachtas examines this issue and I look forward to working with her in this regard so that we have a clear outcome.</P>
        <P>The best and most effective approach is to reduce demand for fuels and transport in general. <Col N="885"/> When energy prices doubled in 2005, demand for fuel in Ireland increased by 8% in the transport area.  That inexorable growth will put us under pressure and it will lead to pressure for these fuels as the world approaches a peak in oil production.  The sustainability issue can be addressed.  For example, the UK has moved towards a system of labelling the sustainable sources of a biofuel crop.  That is a progressive development and we should look to progress that in Ireland.  Similar measures have been introduced in Germany and Holland.  Although the world trade rules in this area are highly restrictive, that may help us address a number of environmental concerns.</P>
        <P>The food price issue is the result of American biofuels policy where the development of bioethanol from wheat and maize is causing a large spike in wheat prices globally.  The European Union, therefore, does not have a specific role in this.  The development of biofuels will have a beneficial long-term consequence for Ireland in securing its fuel supply if there is an energy shock.  Significant waste supplies can also be used for biofuels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We could debate this subject for hours.  Food crops have been the winner in the competition for land between food crops and energy crops.  Has the Minister made representations to the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance in the build up to the budget to support energy crop production in Ireland, particularly on set aside land, on which farmers are not permitted to sow food crops anyway, as this would not impact on the food industry?  If not, why not given the Minister promoted that thinking for a long time when in Opposition?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do whatever I can to ensure Irish farming benefits from biofuel supports rather than distant sources, without infringing world trade rules, which could result in Ireland being pulled up and a stop-start approach for the industry.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has a key role in this regard.  We must be innovative and, at the same time, careful.  The energy White Paper sets out the best approach, which is to move towards an obligation system for fuel suppliers to carry a set biofuels quotient rather than a grant support system so that the oil supply companies, as opposed to the taxpayer, carry the cost.  However, within that, support measures should be implemented so that Irish farming is provided with a positive and lucrative market in the long run.  I would support that, while taking into account the general policy issues relating to global food prices, of which I must be cognisant.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the important issue of providing a top quality health service at Beaumont Hospital.  All Members have a duty of care to the vulnerable, the sick, the disabled, the elderly and the very young.  If we do not do that, we will lose sight of our progressive vision for the country.  That is why in my agreement with the Taoiseach I pushed strongly for support services for the sick and disabled.  I could have moved in another direction but top quality, professional and caring health services must be provided for the disabled, cystic fibrosis patients and cancer patients.</P>
        <P>I warmly welcome the additional cancer services for Beaumont hospital.  I am delighted my local hospital has been designated a centre for future cancer care.  It will service more than 5,000 people, many of whom reside on the north side of Dublin city.  I raised this issue in my deal with the Taoiseach and it is covered in section 5 of our agreement.  This represents a major investment in the north side and I urge everyone involved to get on with the job and to work hard in the interest of patients.</P><Col N="887"/>
        <P>I also welcome the &euro;850,000 allocation for a new day care centre at the Central Remedial Clinic in Clontarf and the provision of an additional 255 residential places, 85 respite places and 535 day places for those with intellectual disabilities nationally.  The total cost of these services will be approximately &euro;45 million.  I am delighted to inform the residents of Dublin North Central of these developments.  I also addressed these priorities in my deal with the Taoiseach and they provide value for money for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>I look forward to further investment in services at Beaumont Hospital.  The people of the north side deserve them as a right and I will not take lectures from politicians who talk down the progressive policies I am trying to have implemented.  Major improvements have taken place in the accident and emergency department in the hospital in the past three months.  Such departments on average deal with 3,300 people daily of whom 825 usually require admission.  Patients who require admission sometimes have to stay in the accident and emergency department while they are stabilised, receive emergency treatment or undergo initial tests.  On average 131 people attend the accident and emergency department at Beaumont Hospital daily, of whom 32 are admitted with two patients on trolleys for more than two hours and five for more than six hours.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE to be more proactive in providing additional services for patients with cystic fibrosis.  This is an issue I raised in my talks with the Taoiseach.  It is raised in section 5(4) of my document of agreement which states we must increase and improve services to cystic fibrosis patients by designating a national centre.  This is the way forward and action must be taken now.  There have been enough talks and meetings.  Cystic fibrosis patients cannot afford to wait any longer.  This is one of my urgent priorities and I urge the Minister to fast-track these services.  We must reach international best practice and standards for all cystic fibrosis patients and their families.</P>
        <P>As well as a national centre, there must be increased local support in communities.  Under no circumstances should patients be affected by problems in the HSE.  I have made my views known to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in recent days.</P>
        <P>I thank and commend the staff of Beaumont Hospital.  We all have a duty to support them and the great work they do.  This support must be practical and take the form of adequate funding.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy McGrath for raising this important issue.  I take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, <Col N="888"/>Deputy Harney.  We welcome the opportunity to set out the position on cancer services at Beaumont Hospital, one of the eight cancer centres designated by the HSE last month.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the national cancer control strategy is a major priority for the Government.  The overarching objective of the strategy is to deliver high quality, fully integrated, multi-modality cancer care nationally.  The delivery of cancer services on a programmatic basis will serve to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient outcome, irrespective of geography.  The decision of the HSE to provide four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The HSE plans to have completed 80-90% of the transition of services to the cancer centres by the end of 2009 and has informed the Department that meetings and discussions are under way with the eight centres.</P>
        <P>Beaumont Hospital has also been selected as a site for the development of radiation oncology facilities.  Initially, four linear accelerators will be provided at the hospital.  This will be increased to an equivalent capacity of eight linear accelerators on an incremental basis thereafter.  The contract for the design consultants for the new facilities at the hospital has commenced.  The evaluation process for procurement of the supply contract is also under way and a technical subgroup is preparing the equipping specification for the phase one developments.</P>
        <P>The HSE has confirmed that it will have in place radiation oncology capacity to meet population need by 2010, after which it will continue to increase capacity to ensure these needs continue to be met.  The Minister is fully confident that this will be achieved through a combination of direct Exchequer provision, public private partnerships and, where appropriate in the interim, the use of capacity in the private sector.</P>
        <P>The HSE reports that Beaumont Hospital treats significant numbers of cancer patients, with nearly 7,000 day cases and more than 800 inpatients treated in 2006.  From January to June this year, more than 3,500 day cases and 450 inpatients were treated at the hospital.  The HSE has informed the Department that revenue funding of more than &euro;10 million has been provided for this purpose in 2007, including non-pay costs of more than &euro;6 million.</P>
        <P>The Minister recently approved national quality assurance standards for symptomatic breast disease services under the Health Act 2007.  The specialist centre for symptomatic breast disease services at Beaumont Hospital was officially opened last year.  The HSE has informed the Department that additional revenue funding of almost &euro;1.7 million has been provided for this service.  Seven new consultant appointments have been made to facilitate the development across the various modalities of care, including surgery, radiology and medical oncology, with further appointments due to be made in breast surgery, <Col N="889"/>plastic surgery and pathology.  There have also been appointments in nursing, physiotherapy and counselling.  The unit operates a fully multidisciplinary symptomatic breast disease service with multidisciplinary meetings and triple assessment clinics.  Last year, 235 new breast cancers were recorded at Beaumont Hospital and more than 1,600 women attended for mammography services.</P>
        <P>As I have outlined to the House, there have been significant developments in cancer services at Beaumont Hospital.  The Government will continue to build on developments to date in cancer services nationally, including at Beaumont Hospital.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Two reports have been published in the past 24 hours that can only be described as damning indictments of the failure of the Government to provide essential services for children in need of care and for children at risk.  The failure of services for children, as managed by the HSE, to provide for proper care management and long-term planning for children in care aged 12 years and under is highlighted in a report published by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  It details just under 100 children aged 12 years in residential care for whom fosterage was more likely a better alternative and in respect of whom no managed care plans of an adequate nature were provided.  The report states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Inspectors found considerable variation and significant shortfalls in the standard of statutory care planning across the country.  In relation to care plan reviews, inspectors found the care plans reflected the situation as it was at the time of admission or whether the initial identified needs were met.  They did not take account of significant life events or the views of the children.  Inspectors found that care planning was more often determined by crisis management rather than long-term planning for what best met the needs of the child.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It further states there were &ldquo;significant discrepancies&rdquo; between initial care plans and current circumstances and &ldquo;wide variations in care planning practice&rdquo;.  Some children&rsquo;s views were not actively sought and some of those, where sought, were given very limited weight, despite our obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second report published today, launched by the Minister, was written by two experts in Waterford and deals with the predicament of child victims of domestic violence.  It can be summed up by saying there was a total failure to provide children who were victims of domestic violence with access to meaningful services which could have provided them with help or support other than refuge services.  In the context of <Col N="890"/>refuge services, it was clear that such services generally excluded teenagers who were just as much at risk as younger children.  The report highlights the need for child centred services, community-based child service supports and refuges to be open to teenage boys.  It also emphasises the need for a community care social work response and, in particular, the necessity of access to child psychiatry and counselling services without long waiting periods.  None of these services is being provided.</P>
        <P>An issue the report does not seem to address but with which I am personally familiar is the need for court based services when wives or husbands who are the victims of domestic violence attend court for the purpose of obtaining protection orders or domestic violence orders.  There is no social work back-up system attached to the courts to provide either counselling for spouses or children or to ensure liaison with local communities.</P>
        <P>I cannot take seriously the speech delivered earlier today by the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, regarding the robust safeguards for the rights of the child intended to be put in place in the context of the Constitution when we have a ten year action plan for children, the national children&rsquo;s strategy, which was published in 2000.  Seven years into this plan, there are significant gaps in services.  It is essential that there is an immediate response by the HSE and the Government to both reports.</P>
        <P>In the context of the forthcoming report by the proposed Oireachtas committee on the wording for a children&rsquo;s rights referendum to the Constitution, we must ensure we do not become distracted from the obligations of the Government to provide well managed, properly resourced and comprehensive services to meet the needs of children.  Many of those needs can be met without any change to or amendment of the Constitution.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I am greatly concerned that the debate on the constitutional referendum will be a diversion from focusing on the major defects in services and the significant gaps that must be addressed.  There is a possibility that the debate on a constitutional provision will become mere constitutional window-dressing.  For 30 years I have personally campaigned for a change in our Constitution to recognise and protect the rights of the child.  I welcome the fact that we are on the road to doing that, but we must not forget the very real needs which should currently be met and for which statutory provision has been made.  These needs are not being met.</P>
        <P>It is my wish for us to have a constructive discussion in the committee to be formed and that we do our best to produce the best form of wording to address the major gaps in our constitutional provisions as they currently apply to children.  If we are to do so on a co-operative basis, the co-operation must come from the beginning.</P><Col N="891"/>
        <P>I note the Minister of State in a speech earlier today commented on producing terms of reference shortly for Cabinet.  This committee involves all parties in the House and I hope that before terms of reference for the committee are finalised, Fine Gael, as the main Opposition party, will be consulted about the draft terms of reference.  In that way we would have input into its formation and the work to be done by the committee from the start.  In the meantime, I hope the Minister of State will indicate the specific action proposed to be taken by the Government to rectify the problems graphically illustrated in the reports published yesterday evening and today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Shatter for raising these important issues on the Adjournment and congratulate him on his appointment as spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party on children&rsquo;s matters.  I look forward to working with him over the coming years in a constructive manner.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to reply to this Adjournment matter.  I assume the Deputy is referring to the findings of the Health Information and Quality Authority social services inspectorate&rsquo;s report, The Placement of Children aged 12 and under in Residential Care in Ireland, launched yesterday, and the report, Listening to Children: Children&rsquo;s Stories of Domestic Violence, launched earlier today.</P>
        <P>The Health Information and Quality Authority&rsquo;s social services inspectorate&rsquo;s report notes that inspectors found a lack of placement options for this age group, with continued placement in residential centres being maintained due to a lack of available options.  I understand the Health Service Executive has accepted that children of this age group should only be placed in residential care in exceptional circumstances.  For example, this would be where a sibling group is being placed together for the purposes of maintaining a family unit, where there are particular therapeutic needs or where short-term issues must be addressed prior to an alternative placement.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that the numbers of children in this age group in residential care has reduced from 120 children aged 12 and under in 2004 to 93 in 2006.  The latest information available to the HSE suggests a further substantial reduction by the end of 2007.  These reductions reflect the ongoing priority attached to caring for children in family settings.  I am heartened by the HSE&rsquo;s indication that the findings of this report will be used to make further improvements in this area.</P>
        <P>The importance of effective and rigorous care planning cannot be underestimated. I welcome the finding that all the children in this study had a care plan and virtually all had a social worker assigned to them.  My office has been assured by the Health Service Executive that having ensured <Col N="892"/>compliance with statutory requirements, it will continue to work to improve the quality of care planning throughout the care system.  In respect of the current placement of those under 12 in residential settings, the HSE has initiated a review of all these cases to ensure they are placed appropriately and will, if necessary, strengthen care planning arrangements for their placement in alternatives to residential care.</P>
        <P>Where there is no option but to take a child into State care it is imperative that we continue to work towards providing each child with specific services to meet his or her needs and those of the families.  I welcome the fact that the executive is seeking to develop specialised foster care services which will provide more intensive support for children who have significant needs in this regard while working closely at all times with the child&rsquo;s family.</P>
        <P>An annual national fostering campaign is also being developed by the executive in conjunction with the Irish Foster Care Association for 2008.  I anticipate that this, together with the HSE ongoing foster carer recruitment campaigns, will encourage many more people to undertake this important role in the lives of these children.</P>
        <P>My office and the Health Service Executive are examining all the recommendations contained in the report and are working together on the development of a policy direction regarding the placement of children aged 12 and under in residential care.  We must be mindful that at times residential care may be the most appropriate and beneficial option for the child at that time.</P>
        <P>The report, Listening to Children: Children&rsquo;s Stories of Domestic Violence, launched earlier today, identifies the impact on children of witnessing domestic violence and the nature, scope and adequacy of domestic violence services for children.  My office commissioned this study which, as Deputy Shatter mentioned, was carried out by two researchers from Waterford Institute of Technology.</P>
        <P>To improve the level of co-ordination and coherence in the Government&rsquo;s response to domestic violence, it was decided that an executive office should be established with key responsibility for this issue.  Cosc, the national office for the prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, was established in June this year to fulfil this task.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Cosc has agreed to work with my office in instances where issues regarding domestic and sexual violence against children arise.</P>
        <P>Research indicates that some services are difficult to access but children who are the victims of domestic violence and their families have access to the range of child protection and child welfare services provided directly by the Health Service Executive and through funded agencies across the country.  They can also access child and adolescent mental health services.</P><Col N="893"/>
        <P>Part of Cosc&rsquo;s work will be to raise awareness of the services available and to work with the agencies concerned towards the delivery of well co-ordinated services to support victims of domestic violence.  My office and the Health Service Executive support and encourage a primary care response to domestic violence which integrates locally based and readily accessible services, including joining the services of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, general practitioners and the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>It is also important to point to the increased allocation to the HSE from &euro;12 million last year to &euro;16.5 million in 2007, which should assist in improvement to front-line services.  A further &euro;1.5 million was allocated for the implementation of the review of the sexual assault treatment services, with a commitment to increase this allocation by &euro;1 million in 2008 to cover the full-year cost of implementing those recommendations.</P>
        <P>I will ask the HSE to examine the findings of the research being undertaken and to consider how services in this area can be further improved.</P>

	<P>The subject matter of this Adjournment debate is very much related to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply to the previous matter.  It concerns residential care which had been part and parcel of this State for the first 70 years of the last century.  That form of residential care was closed down in 1970.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My request to the Minister for Education and Science is that she add Bethany Home, located on Orwell Road, Rathgar, Dublin 6, to the list of institutions in the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.  I am seeking this specifically at this time because the Department of Health and Children examined some papers in its archives earlier this year and concluded that Bethany Home was subject to a regulatory and inspection function in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 4 to the Act.  Subsequently, the Minister for Education and Science was informed of the discovery.</P>
        <P>I will read the relevant section of the letter sent to a solicitor whose client is one of the former residents of Bethany Home.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Dear Sir,</P>
        <P LI="1">I refer to your letter dated 19 July 2007.</P>
        <P LI="1">This Department contacted the Department of Education on 14 May 2007 regarding your client.  We confirmed that we had examined papers in relation to the Bethany Home, Orwell Road, Rathgar, Dublin 6.  We also advised the Department of Education that they may wish to give consideration to the inclusion of this institution on the Schedule of the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002 as there is evidence of a regulatory or inspection function as set out in Schedule 4 of the Act.</P><Col N="894"/>
        <P LI="1">The inclusion of institutions on the schedule of the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002 is a matter for the Department of Education.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">That letter was sent by the child welfare and protection policy unit of the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Education and Science.  As it states, inclusion of any new institution on the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act is the sole prerogative of the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
        <P>When the Act was progressing through the Oireachtas five years ago, I raised the issue of Bethany Home, which was largely a home for Protestant orphans, and requested that the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, include it in the Schedule.  At that time, I possessed only anecdotal evidence to support my arguments of abuse at the home.  I also only had anecdotal evidence regarding departmental supervision and regulation.  Now, however, the Department of Health and Children has confirmed my viewpoint and is making to the Department of Education and Science the same case I made five years ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recent disclosures indicate that, to date, over 16,000 complaints have been received by the Residential Institutions Redress Board in respect of the abuse of children in residential institutions that were subject to State regulation and supervision.  Over 9,000 of these have been processed to a conclusion, with average compensation in the order of &euro;67,000 per person.  Some &euro;750 million has already been paid and the total sum is likely to be in excess of &euro;1 billion.</P>
        <P>It would be very harsh if the Minister for Education and Science were to close the door to the inclusion of further institutions such as Bethany Home when new information comes to light.  The children from Bethany Home, who are now elderly, are entitled to recognition by the State that they were detained in an institution in which they were abused and in which they were neglected by the State, which had a legal responsibility to supervise and to ensure that their welfare was protected.</P>
        <P>The Minister should do the right thing by these children and announce that Bethany Home will be referred to the Residential Institutions Redress Board.</P>

	<P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board was established under statute in 2002 and is governed by the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.  The board was established to make fair and reasonable payments to persons who, as children, were abused while residents in industrial schools, reformatories and other institutions subject to State regulation or inspection and who were placed in such institutions by the State.  The board offered an alternative to the then often <Col N="895"/>daunting prospect of bringing a claim for damages through the court system.  The threshold of proof that an applicant must satisfy at the board is far lower than in the civil courts, where the burden of proof is much higher.</P>
        <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board is independent in the performance of its functions.  In addition, the board and the review committee are independent in the performance of their functions in accordance with the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.  When the Act initially became law, the Schedule contained a total of 128 institutions.  As provided for in the Residential Institutions Redress Act, these comprised industrial schools, reformatories, special schools established for the purpose of providing education services to children with physical or intellectual disabilities, orphanages, children&rsquo;s homes, hospitals providing medical or psychiatric services to people with physical or mental disabilities or illnesses in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.</P>
        <P>In compiling the list, the Department of Education and Science had cause to make inquiries from the Department of Health and Children &mdash; under the jurisdiction of which some of the institutions operated &mdash; as to whether certain institutions could be considered for inclusion having regard to the criteria for eligibility.  Under section 4(1) of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, the Minister for Education and Science may provide for the insertion in the Schedule of any of the institutions to which I refer.</P>
        <P>Since the enactment of the legislation, my Department has received correspondence from both individuals and survivor groups identifying a number of other institutions that may warrant consideration for inclusion.  Following examination of the matter, the Minister signed an order on 9 November 2004 which provided for the inclusion of 13 additional institutions in the Schedule.  A further order was made on 1 July 2005 adding three institutions to the Schedule.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question of including additional institutions has been fully considered by the Department of Education and Science.  It is not proposed to add any further institutions to the Schedule.  The intention was that all institutions which were brought to the attention of the Department would be considered and a decision made as to their eligibility for inclusion prior to the closing date for receipt of applications to the board, which was 15 December 2005.</P>
        <P>In making its initial inquiries in respect of the Bethany Home, my Department consulted the Department of Health and Children to establish if it could be considered for inclusion on the Schedule to the Act.  The response was that following a review of papers available in the Department of Health and Children, officials were unable to locate any documentation which would indicate that a public body had an inspection or <Col N="896"/>regulatory function in respect of the Bethany Home.  At that time, the Department of Health and Children was not in a position to recommend its inclusion in the Schedule.  Given that we were not in a position to confirm whether there was a State inspection or regulatory role, Bethany Home could not be considered to be eligible for inclusion.  No further inquiries were made at that time as to whether this institution would have been eligible under any other criteria.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children advised my Department in May 2007 that certain papers had come to light which indicated a State regulatory and inspection role and that my Department might now wish to consider its inclusion on the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act.  Further inquiries made by my Department with the Department of Health and Children have revealed that one of the papers relating to the Bethany Home, which prompted it to recognise a regulatory or inspection function, was the report of an inspection conducted under the Registration of Maternity Homes Act 1934.  The expression &ldquo;maternity home&rdquo; means any premises either wholly or partly used or intended to be used for the reception of pregnant women or women immediately after childbirth.  There are several references on the papers held by the Department of Health and Children to &ldquo;Bethany Mother and Baby Home&rdquo;.  It does not appear that persons were placed in this facility by the State.</P>
        <P>Section 4(1) of the Act states that the Minister for Education and Science may, by order, provide for the insertion of any industrial school, reformatory, orphanage, children&rsquo;s home, special school which was established for the purpose of providing education services to children with physical or intellectual disabilities or a hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with physical or mental disabilities or illnesses.  It is clear from the information available to my Department that Bethany Home operated as a mother and baby home and is, therefore, not eligible to be considered for inclusion on the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be pointed out that ineligibility to be considered for redress under the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 does not affect a person&rsquo;s statutory right to pursue other legal avenues which may be open to them.</P>
        <P>In dealing with correspondence relating to the inclusion of Bethany Home on the Schedule, the issue of the religious ethos was put forward as a possible reason for the decision not to include it.  As the religious ethos of an institution was not part of the criteria prescribed under section 4 of the Act, the Department did not require full details of the religious ethos of all the institutions listed.  It appears, from records held by my <Col N="897"/>Department, that there are 19 institutions listed that were non-Catholic facilities.  Of these, one was multidenominational, five had a Protestant ethos and 13 were run by the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the office of the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating me in raising this matter and I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House to debate it.</P>
        <P>This week, the Council of Europe&rsquo;s internationally respected Committee for the Prevention of Torture again shone a light on Ireland&rsquo;s prisons.  The picture that emerged was deeply shocking.  In short, Ireland&rsquo;s prisons are dominated by gangs, violence within them is mounting and they are flooded with illegal drugs.</P>
        <P>While Ireland has been transformed into a modern, wealthy First World nation in the past decade, some of our prisons have remained in a Dickensian time warp.  Such prisons are vastly overcrowded, with prisoners packed tightly into dank, stuffy and darkened cells; hundreds of inmates locked away for much of the day for their own protection; and basic sanitary facilities that are lacking.</P>
        <P>The most modern feature of Irish prisons is the prevalence of narcotics.  Mountjoy Prison was recently described as the biggest methadone clinic in the country.  Prisoners on temporary release are placed under enormous pressure to smuggle drugs back into prison when they come back from outside.  Drug treatment programmes are still optional.  Anyone with the slightest knowledge of addiction will say that it is very difficult for an addict voluntarily to reach a decision to enter rehabilitation.  Making such a decision optional when someone has just been incarcerated makes little sense.  These people are in despair, feel they have nothing left to lose and have little appetite for the rigorous regime of drug rehabilitation.  Who can blame them?  Many of them have been failed completely by the State.</P>
        <P>An analysis of 2,000 prisoners by the Institute of Criminology at University College Dublin has shown that incarcerated alongside the gang members that dominate prison life and making up the majority of prisoners are young, unemployed petty criminals.  A total of 93% of the prisoners profiled by the institute were male; 82% of whom were unmarried with an average age just under 30.  They do not have jobs and the majority of them do not have homes or do not feel they have a future.  Shockingly, 65% of Irish prisoners are illiterate.</P>
        <P>We expect this group of people voluntarily to sign up for drug rehabilitation programmes, literacy courses and so forth while all they want to do is concentrate on staying alive and unharmed in an environment where the threat of inter-prisoner violence is ever present and accessing drugs is as easy as accessing rehabilitation.</P><Col N="898"/>
        <P>It is time that we got real about Irish prisons.  Rehabilitation programmes for drug addicts should not be optional, rather they should be compulsory.  A real and sustained effort must be made to encourage participation in education and training programmes in our prisons.  The Victorian ideal that prisoners would reform inside prison through training programmes and education and make a contribution to society was a noble one, but that ideology appears to have been lost or at least replaced by a &ldquo;lock them up and forget about them&rdquo; approach.</P>
        <P>Our current model evidently does not work.  In the past ten years, the prison population has grown by more than 10,000.  It costs the taxpayer &euro;91,000 to keep one person imprisoned for a year and much more if the prisoner happens to be in Portlaoise Prison.  That is not money well spent for two reasons.  Rehabilitation is not taking place inside prisons and habitual criminality is rampant, with more than one quarter of people sentenced to jail going back there within a period of four years following their release.</P>
        <P>The report of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment has highlighted a prison system that is failing the prisoner, the prison officer and the tax-paying, law-abiding citizenry.  We have now received the fourth report of the Council of Europe on Irish prisons.  This must be the one that precipitates a meaningful policy shift by Government and transforms our prison system into a functioning, rehabilitative and corrective regime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>At the request of the Irish Government, the Council of Europe yesterday published the report of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CPT, on its visit to Ireland in October 2006, as well as the response of the Government of Ireland to the points raised by the CPT in that report.  Its previous visit to this jurisdiction was May 2002.  It visited a number of Garda stations, prisons and the Central Mental Hospital and presented its findings earlier this year.  Its report and the formal response of the Government together amount to approximately 100 pages.   I am not in a position in this statement to go into the same level of detail but would encourage Deputies to read both documents in full as they set out comprehensively the issues raised and the action being taken to address those issues.</P>
        <P>The role of the CPT in its national visits is to draw attention to those areas affecting persons in custody where improvements can be made.  Nevertheless, the CPT report goes out of its way to praise the co-operation it received during its visit to Ireland.  It points out that the Irish authorities have made commendable efforts to stamp out ill treatment by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and praises the new legislation introduced and the use of technological devices such as <Col N="899"/>closed circuit television and mandatory audio-video recording in interrogation rooms.  The CPT also states that the majority of prison officers were attempting to deal in a humane manner with prisoners.</P>
        <P>As regards the Irish prison system, the principal shortcomings it identified were the lack of progress in updating legislation governing the operation of the prison system, notably the 1947 prison rules; the need for better investigation of prisoner complaints about ill-treatment; the poor physical conditions in Mountjoy Prison, Limerick Prison and Cork Prison, with overcrowding and slopping out; the existence of inter-prisoner violence and intimidation; the number of prisoners on so-called protection; the drugs situation in Limerick Prison, Mountjoy Prison and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution; and the need to enhance the regime activities for prisoners in certain prisons.</P>
        <P>Action is or has been taken to address all these issues.  The Minister knows that the lack of modern prison rules was a matter of particular and ongoing concern to the CPT and I am glad to report that comprehensive new prison rules were signed by the former Minister on 29 May 2007 and entered into force on 1 October 2007.</P>
        <P>The CPT also expressed concern about the investigation of complaints of ill-treatment by prisoners.  It acknowledged that senior management in the Prison Service are determined to take appropriate action when allegations of ill-treatment of prisoners by staff emerge.  Its main concern related to Garda investigations and access to an independent complaints system.  The Garda Commissioner has now put new procedures in place to ensure an appropriate level of Garda investigation into allegations by prisoners of assault.  As regards an independent complaints system, the visiting committees have the authority to investigate complaints from prisoners and the office of Inspector of Prisons has been established on a statutory basis.</P>
        <P>There is no denying that Mountjoy Prison and Cork Prison need to be replaced and that certain blocks in Limerick Prison need to be refurbished.  The Government is pressing ahead with the new <Col N="900"/>prison complex at Thornton to replace Mountjoy and a site at Kilworth has been designated as the location for a new prison to replace Cork Prison.  There are also plans to refurbish the relevant blocks in Limerick Prison.</P>
        <P>The point must be made that the poor physical conditions in the Mountjoy complex, including the lack of facilities to keep prisoners productively occupied, has not facilitated the prison authorities in their efforts to prevent violence between prisoners.  Those of us who heard the CPT representative being interviewed on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on RTE Radio will be aware that their concerns about safety in particular related to the older prisons of Mountjoy and Limerick and were contrasted with the much more favourable situation in modern prisons such as Cloverhill and Wheatfield.</P>
        <P>Owing to its location and limited footprint, it is simply not possible to make the Mountjoy complex secure from drugs and weapons thrown into the prison nor is it possible to provide a wide range of workshops and recreational facilities.  Similarly, the cramped nature of Mountjoy makes it difficult to separate particularly dangerous prisoners from the general population.  This emphasises the need to proceed with the new prison developments at Thornton and Kilworth as a matter of urgency, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform hopes the Opposition parties will support our efforts in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should conclude.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do so.  In the meantime, we must take action within the constraints imposed by our older prisons. The CPT quite rightly has identified that the level of violence among prisoners in our prisons has increased.  There have been specific incidents in Mountjoy Prison, Limerick Prison and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, which are a cause of serious concern.  There is additional information in my script which will be of use to the Deputy.  I thank him for raising this matter.</P>

	<P>I travelled to the United States from 24-27 July last to make contacts and garner information on best policy practice in the area of telecommunications and energy, including energy sustainability. </P>
        <P>I used the opportunity to also visit a number of Irish community centres in the Bronx and Yonkers to speak to the &lsquo;undocumented Irish&rsquo; and reported their situation to Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dermot Ahern.</P>
        <P>Amongst the meetings in New York, I met Ms. Christine Quinn, the Speaker of the New York City Council, Mr. Marty Mack from the New York Governor&rsquo;s Office and Mr. Rohit Aggarwala from the Mayor&rsquo;s Long-Term Planning and Sustainability Office to discuss Mayor Bloomberg&rsquo;s plans for a greener New York.  It was agreed that my Department would be in further contact with the Mayor&rsquo;s office on the issue of sustainable cities and that we would institute an &lsquo;Exchange of Officials&rsquo; programme to progress this initial link-up.</P>
        <P>In Washington, I met with the European-American Business Council. This group comprises many large companies engaged in transatlantic business. The main purpose of this meeting was to portray Ireland as an excellent location for further expansion of these companies, particularly in the growing energy and telecommunications sectors.</P><Col N="902"/>
        <P>On Capitol Hill, I met with Congressman Edward Markey who is Chairman of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.  We agreed on further cooperation between both our offices to maximise our efforts on energy investment and efficiency.</P>
        <P>In the telecoms area I met with Brian Thompson, a former member of the telecom advisory council who advised the Irish government on previous telecoms developments.  I had a meeting with Mr. Richard Beaird of the State Department which focused on current issues in the telecommunications sector, including international broadband statistics, net neutrality and cyber security issues.  I also met with Mr. John Kneuer of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and we discussed current US policy on wireline, broadcasting and Next Generation Networks.</P>
        <P>I also met with US Energy Secretary Mr. Sam Bodman to discuss US plans for negotiating a successor agreement to Kyoto in 2012.</P>
        <P>I met with both Bob Nordhaus of the Van Ness Institute who specialises in federal electric, gas and environmental regulation and the John Podesta Centre for American Progress.</P>
        <P>Both of these meetings, and indeed my entire visit, advanced the expressed purpose of my visit: namely, to learn from the experience of the United States in the areas under my portfolio and to strengthen ties between Ireland and the US in both directions on the issues of energy and telecommunications development.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 19 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.</P>
        <P>The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</P><Col N="904"/>
        <P>Broadband penetration has increased significantly in recent years.  Penetration levels have increased to 698,000 subscribers which, by OECD measures, is the equivalent of 16.48% of the population.  This compares to less than 1% in 2002.</P>
        <P>As a result Ireland has improved its position internationally and Government action through provision of an optimal regulatory regime and targeted infrastructural investment will continue to support this performance.</P>
        <P>There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the procurement process, the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) phase, is now complete and four candidates have pre-qualified.  As my Department indicated on 2 September, the four candidates are, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.</P>
        <P>The next phase of the procurement process involves inviting candidates to participate in a competitive dialogue process.  My Department is anticipating that the award of the NBS contract will be Quarter 2 of 2008, with rollout of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter.  This timeline is subject to negotiations with candidates during the competitive dialogue phase of the procurement process.</P>
        <P>The broadband product to be provided under the NBS will be broadly equivalent to the tariffs and products typically available on the Irish market.  The most appropriate mechanism to achieve this aim will be decided during the competitive dialogue process.</P>
        <P>Financial modelling has been undertaken to establish the estimated cost for the Scheme.  I do not propose to make that figure public as knowledge of the estimated cost could influence the negotiation process.</P>
        <P>Broadband connections are excluded from the Universal Service requirements.  The implementation of such a requirement would be the responsibility of ComReg.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 24 and 68 together. </P>
        <P>I have no function in regulating the provision of services in the telecommunications market.</P>
        <P>Primary responsibility for consumer protection falls within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the National Consumer Agency.  A function of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, is the investigation of complaints from consumers in relation to the supply of, and access to, electronic communications networks, electronic communications services and associated facilities.</P>
        <P>ComReg also has an objective to promote the interests of users of these services within the European Community.</P>
        <P>Under the EU Framework Regulations, ComReg shall, where appropriate, consult and cooperate with the Director of Consumer Affairs on matters of common interest in connection with the protection of consumer interests.  I am informed by ComReg that discussions are ongoing between both parties at present with a view to the development of a memorandum of understanding on the matter.</P>
        <P>ComReg, in consultation with the service providers, are examining the possibility of amending the conditions of the general authorisation of service providers in an effort to minimise disruption to consumers in the event of a service provider exiting the market.</P>
        <P>The amendments being considered would include a minimum period of notice of service termination, which service providers must give, during which it would be their responsibility to work with ComReg to ensure that any disruption to customers is minimised.</P>
        <P>ComReg have informed my Department that it plans to issue a direction concerning this matter to service providers by early next month.</P>
        <P>Given ComReg&rsquo;s undertaking in this matter, I have no plans to bring forward measures to implement a statutory basis for notice of with<Col N="906"/>drawal of electronic communications services or any electronic communications product to an end user.</P>
        <P>The regulation of Universal Service Obligations and quality of service is the responsibility of ComReg, in accordance with the requirements of the Universal Service and User&rsquo;s Rights Regulations 2003.</P>
        <P>The principal obligation, in relation to access to a public telephone service, which Eircom has to fulfil as Universal Service Provider is:</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The ESRI comment, originally contained in an article published last year, underlines the necessity to ensure adequate capacity margins on the generation system.  The Government is committed to ensuring that electricity supply consistently meets the needs of Irish consumers and business.  My Department liaises closely with the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which has key functions with regard to security of electricity supply, and with EirGrid as the independent Transmission System Operator.  Reporting to the CER, EirGrid has responsibility for managing generation adequacy and monitoring generation capacity.  EirGrid produces an annual Winter Outlook Report, which provides a rigorous analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity generation capacity to meet expected demand over the peak winter months. </P>
        <P>The Winter Outlook Report for this coming winter was published by EirGrid in August and business and enterprise organisations were briefed.  Based on their analysis and on detailed contact with each of the power generators, EirGrid forecasts that electricity generating capacity will be sufficient to meet demand this winter.  This is in line with EirGrid&rsquo;s previous medium-term generation adequacy forecasts.</P>
        <P>The report assumes a peak demand this winter of 5,250 Mega Watts.  This compares with the peak demand last winter of 5,035 Mega Watts.  EirGrid calculates that generating capacity of 5,930 MW will be available.  This includes the new 400 Mega Watt facility at Huntstown, which is now in service.</P>
        <P>It is also expected that connected wind capacity will reach 900-1000 Mega Watts by year end, <Col N="907"/>which will represent a very significant increase of over 25% of installed wind capacity since the start of the year.</P>
        <P>As with any power generation system, it is not possible to give definitive guarantees that generation adequacy will always be maintained.  By their nature, high level forced outages on the system cannot be predicted.</P>
        <P>Plant outage, whether planned or unforeseen, must at all times be critically managed to maintain security of supply.  EirGrid operates a range of demand control measures in place to assist in managing demand at peak times.  These could include reducing demand by agreement with large users in the interests of ensuring domestic customer supply is maintained.</P>
        <P>Our generating capacity must ensure an adequate margin between electricity supply and demand.  Medium term capacity will be enhanced with the base-load plants currently under construction as well as the new electricity interconnectors scheduled for 2011 and 2012.  The provision of new flexible plant and the continued strong growth in wind and other renewable energy is critical in that context.</P>
        <P>Key imperatives for electricity supply and demand are energy efficiency and a diverse fuel mix.  Radically improving energy efficiency and achieving the ambitious renewable energy target set by the Government will significantly enhance security of supply and ensure that demand itself is more sustainable.</P>

	<P>Section 39 of the Electricity Regulations Act 1999 permits the offering of financial guarantees to developers of new renewable energy powered electricity generating projects, to be selected in a competitive process.  On foot of this process, the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) programme is a fixed price support model designed to bring greater certainty to project developers.  It includes a quantitative limit which delivers the competitive element required by the legislation.  However, the REFIT rules also permit the extension of the total capacity supported from time to time.  This discretion will be exercised to ensure that the support programme offers assistance to all qualifying projects submitted into REFIT which have already secured a connection offer and projects which receive a connection offer in the current Gate 2 connection offer programme.</P><Col N="908"/>
        <P>This level of capacity and market interest are capable of assisting delivery of the 2010 renewable energy target of 15% contribution to electricity.  I consider that there is an imperative to significantly increase both the scale and pace of development to ensure our 2020 target of 33% of renewable sourced electricity is achieved and indeed surpassed.</P>
        <P>In order to maximise the scale of development from renewable energy resources and to deliver the 2020 target, I have already made clear my intention to extend REFIT to cover additional renewable technologies.  These include the offshore energy resource both wind and ocean, additional biomass categories including cofiring at the peat stations and support for additional or hybrid technologies as they emerge from research and development programmes.</P>
        <P>The REFIT programme is being kept under constant review and will be adapted as needed to ensure that it supports the accelerated development of indigenous renewable energy resources, through positive signals to the market.  Renewable energy together with energy efficiency is key to lower carbon intensity in electricity generation, enhanced security of supply, fuel diversity and sustainability and overall competitiveness.</P>

	<P>The White Paper on Energy Policy and the Programme for Government endorse the case for a process of structural change in the electricity sector.  The effective working of the all-island market, the competitiveness of energy costs, the interests of consumers and the economy require it.  We need to create the conditions which will deliver more competition, real consumer choice and support greater innovation in the electricity market and the strategic development of the distribution and transmission networks. </P>
        <P>The Government is committed to the transfer of the electricity transmission network assets from ESB to EirGrid establishing EirGrid Company by end 2008.  EirGrid already manages the assets as a fully independent entity.  Combining the ownership and operation of the transmission assets makes sense.  It will ensure that the system operates transparently and effectively giving confidence to all market players.  The present structure is complex and cumbersome and adds to costs.  It creates additional overheads and transaction costs, duplication of skills and activities and the risk of blurred accountability.  It also makes for more complex regulation.</P>
        <P>The mechanisms to implement the transfer to EirGrid of ownership of the assets comprise a range of legislative, commercial, legal and finan<Col N="910"/>cial dimensions.   The detailed implementation process will involve my Department working with both ESB and EirGrid with the involvement, as necessary, by the CER.</P>
        <P>I intend to bring the necessary legislation forward for Government approval over the coming months.  The Bill will include provisions enabling EirGrid to own infrastructure and undertake any necessary borrowing.  The legislation is also likely to include a range of amendments to existing electricity legislation to fully reflect the new arrangement.  The advice of the Attorney General on the precise parameters of the legislation will determine the scoping of legislation.</P>
        <P>In line with successive Partnership Agreements, there will be a full process of engagement with the Management and Unions of both ESB and EirGrid on implementation of the Government&rsquo;s policy decision.  The process will also include engagement on legitimate concerns of the ESB&rsquo;s Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT).</P>
        <P>The transfer of ownership of the transmission assets will be implemented in a way that ensures the future of both EirGrid and ESB as strong semi-State companies, as well as reflecting the position of the State and the ESOT as shareholders.   There is no question of breaking up the ESB.  The ESB Group will remain a strong, commercially viable and integrated entity after completion of this process.  I have no doubt that the ESB has a vibrant future ahead.  Given its prominence and central role in the Irish energy sector, ESB has a crucial contribution to make in the challenges ahead.  It is equally the case that EirGrid, has a crucial national role to play in the new energy landscape.</P>
        <P>Both ESB and EirGrid will be stronger and better placed strategically as a result of the Government&rsquo;s actions.</P>
        <P>We will have a healthier more transparent energy market which will reinforce the benefits of the Single Electricity Market and encourage investment.  Transparency in relation to access to the Grid and Transmission assets will attract more players into the market and encourage competition.  Competition on its own is not necessarily a panacea for lower energy prices but a more competitive and transparent environment will benefit the energy sector and Irish business and the consumer.</P>
        <P>The Energy Policy White Paper and the Programme for Government contain a range of actions to deliver energy security of supply and a low carbon future for Ireland.  ESB, EirGrid and Bord Gais Eireann together with all the players in the energy sector have crucial contributions to make in the collective challenge to address security of supply, competitiveness and climate change.</P>

        <QRef>[23092/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government considers that nuclear power is neither sustainable nor an answer to Ireland&rsquo;s energy needs irrespective of the position of a number of Member States. Our position is shared by several Member States and the EU Commission has made repeatedly clear that it is for Member States to determine their own energy mix.  The President of the Commission Jose Barroso publicly restated this message on 1 October.  </P>
        <P>The Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government make it clear that the Government fully intends to maintain the statutory prohibition on nuclear generation in Ireland.  My own position on the question of a debate on the nuclear issue has long been consistent.  As with all aspects of energy policy, I have no difficulty with a debate on nuclear power set in the full context of an overall review of our energy use in transport, heating and power generation.  In each of the three areas of energy use I believe we have the solutions, it is a matter of accelerating delivery of renewable energies and energy efficiency first and foremost.  I believe a rational debate on our future energy options will help reconfirm this case.</P>
        <P>The use of nuclear fission for the generation of electricity in Ireland is statutorily prohibited under Section 18(6) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  This prohibition does not, however, include the importation of electricity generated by nuclear energy.  Legal advice received by my Department states that such a prohibition would be in breach of Article 28 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect between Member States.</P>
        <P>I am therefore advised that a prohibition on the importation of electricity generated with the use of nuclear energy would be highly unlikely to have a legal justification even if it were technically feasible.</P>
        <P>I am further advised that it is not technically possible to guarantee that electricity imported over an interconnector is not generated from nuclear sources as it is not physically possible to prevent the flow of nuclear generated electricity onto the network.  Nor is it possible to distinguish the flow of electricity across interconnectors by reference to the original source of supply or generation.</P>

	<P>Matters relating to quality and levels of postal service in An Post are a matter in the first instance for the management and board of the company and one in which I have no statutory function.  </P>
        <P>An Post operates within a regulatory framework as enshrined in EU and Irish law and therefore the universal service obligation is a statutory requirement for An Post, as the designated universal service provider.  This is set out in Statutory Instrument 616 of 2002, the European Communities (Postal Services) Regulations.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in accordance with these regulations, is responsible for the monitoring, measurement and regulation of the postal sector including measuring the levels of service achieved by An Post and ensuring that the company abides by its statutory universal service obligations.</P>
        <P>The regulations provide that ComReg may issue directions to An Post in relation to its obligations including quality of service targets. In the event that ComReg is of the belief that An Post, as universal service provider, is not in compliance with such a direction, it may, under the current regulatory framework, apply to the High Court requesting an order to direct An Post to comply with the direction. This Government, as set out clearly in the Programme for Government, wants to see much improved next day delivery rates.  The Programme states also that ComReg should be empowered to impose financial penalties in the event that delivery targets are not met.  I am currently considering the options available in this regard.</P>
        <P>In regard to the methodology used to measure quality of service, I understand that An Post and ComReg are currently working together to ensure that a uniform methodology is used for this measurement.</P>

	<P>I propose to take questions 27 and 32 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</P>
        <P>The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</P>
        <P>There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the procurement process, the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) phase, is now complete and four candidates have pre-qualified.  As my Department indicated on 2 September 2007, the four candidates are, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.  The next phase of the procurement process involves inviting candidates to participate in a competitive dialogue process.  My Department is anticipating that the award of the NBS contract will be Quarter 2 of 2008, with rollout of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter.  This timeline is subject to negotiations with candidates during the competitive dialogue phase of the procurement process.</P>
        <P>EU State Aid regulations do not allow for State intervention into areas that are already served by a provider. However, any area that is only served by Satellite broadband will be covered by the NBS.</P>

	<P>Under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is a statutory independent body, has been charged with all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State.  There are currently no plans to extend the natural gas pipeline from Northern Ireland into the border counties. However, I can advise the Deputy that in 2006 the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) directed Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BG&Eacute;) to implement a new Gas Connections Policy, which allows for the appraisal of connecting new towns in relative proximity to the gas network, either on their own or as part of a regional group of towns. </P>
        <P>Having regard to this new policy, BG&Eacute; is carrying out a comprehensive review of towns being considered for connection to the national gas network. The review is being carried out in three Phases, with the final phase of the study, Phase 3, due to commence shortly. This phase is expected to take some 12 months to complete and it will include the following border counties; Cavan/Monaghan, Donegal and Leitrim. The final report is due to be published in late 2008 and it will outline what towns or groups of towns are economically viable for connection, within the revised connection policy criteria.</P>

	<P>The development of renewable energy in the electricity sector represents significant challenges for the Government, the energy sector, investors and EirGrid and ESB Networks.  I am giving priority to addressing the barriers and realising the opportunities in order to deliver on our ambitious targets.</P>
        <P>Significant progress is being made. The installed capacity of renewable energy has more than doubled in the last three years. In 2004 electricity generated from wind exceeded that from hydro for the first time. Wind is now the dominant renewable energy technology.</P>
        <P>The current Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) support programme will complete or surpass a target to increase the contribution of renewable powered electricity to 15% of consumption by 2010. It is estimated this will require installed capacity in the region of 1,650 megawatts (MWs). There are in excess of 1,000 MWs built and approximately 600 MWs already accepted into REFIT with planning permission and connections offers. When the Gate 2 connection process is completed in the coming months this latter figure is expected to more than double thereby delivering and most likely surpassing the 2010 target.</P>

	<P>I recently launched a new Licensing Round in the Porcupine Basin inviting applications for exploration licence from interested parties.  The closing date for applications is 18 December 2007. The Licensing Round offers the industry an opportunity to obtain exploration licences to invest in exploration activity in the Porcupine Basin which has recognised hydrocarbon bearing potential. The Round is an open competitive process that will be managed by my Department in accordance with best practice in public procurement and in which I have every confidence. By definition, I have no information on which companies are likely to apply.</P>
        <P>The acreage now on offer in the Porcupine Basin covers unlicensed blocks in an area of approximately 63,500 square kilometres, in which there are currently four licensed operators. The area has been classified as frontier acreage because of the challenging environment of Ireland&rsquo;s Atlantic Margin.</P>
        <P>In advance of decisions on the award of licences, a comprehensive Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of the region is being undertaken by independent expert environmental consultants.  As part of this process, a six week public consultation phase was held. The public consultation phase was publicised through notices in national and local newspapers.  Notification was also sent to over one hundred stakeholder <Col N="920"/>interests. During the week commencing 17 September, public consultation workshops were held in Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Bantry. All submissions received through the public consultation process are being considered by the independent consultants and will be addressed in the post consultation report on the SEA. Applicants under the Licensing Round are required to factor the findings of the SEA into their applications for licences.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 64 together. </P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including wired broadband, is a matter for the service providers that provide wired broadband services.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.   Difficulties surrounding the roll out of wired broadband services are a matter for Service Providers.</P>
        <P>The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</P>
        <P>The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</P>
        <P>There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.</P><Col N="921"/>
        <P>The first phase of the procurement process, the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) phase, is now complete and four candidates have pre-qualified.  As my Department indicated on 2 September 2007, the four candidates are, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.  The next phase of the procurement process involves inviting candidates to participate in a competitive dialogue process.  My Department is anticipating that the award of the NBS contract will be Quarter 2 of 2008, with rollout of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter.  This timeline is subject to negotiations with candidates during the competitive dialogue phase of the procurement process. There were 698,000 broadband subscribers in Ireland at end of quarter two of 2007 according to official figures from ComReg. This is equivalent to 16.48% of the population.  At the start of 2005 only 3% of population had broadband and 6.76% of the population at the start of 2006.</P>
        <P>Ireland has narrowed the gap behind the EU average dramatically. At the end of Q2 06 the EU-25 average was 14% and our rate was 8%. At the end of Q2 07, the EU-25 Average was 18.2% and our rate was at 16.48%. According to the latest OECD Broadband Statistics (end-Dec 2006), the strongest per-capita subscriber growth over the year came from Denmark, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Ireland. Each country added more than 5.8 subscribers per 100 inhabitants during 2006.</P>

        <P>I recently received a discussion paper from eircom on the communications sector in general which includes their proposals to separate its retail and wholesale arms which I am currently examining.  After an in-depth and comprehensive examination of the eircom material, I will engage with eircom on any issues relevant to my Department. Any matters of a regulatory nature would be progressed between eircom and ComReg.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 56, 60, 61 and 186 together. </P>
        <P>The Programme for Government commits to the development of an Irish biofuels industry and to the development and deployment of bio-energy generally in Ireland.   In this context, the Government has announced its intention to introduce a Biofuels Obligation in 2009, which will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual <Col N="926"/>fuel sales. Implementation of the obligation will require detailed consultation and development of appropriate legislation. Fuel suppliers will also require time to make the necessary logistical and supply adjustments to facilitate meeting their biofuels targets.  The 2009 timeline reflects these requirements.</P>
        <P>The obligation will build on the results of the 2005 and 2006, mineral oil tax relief schemes for biofuels, which saw a total of 18 projects being awarded excise relief between 2005 and 2010. The schemes, valued at over &euro;200m aim to ensure that we reach an initial target of over 2% market penetration of biofuels by 2008.  They were designed as interim measures to accelerate the level of biofuels in the fuel mix, in advance of the introduction of a biofuels obligation in 2009.</P>
        <P>As a result of these schemes, biofuels are already being mainstreamed in blends of up to 5% at a number of existing petrol and diesel pumps, and higher blends are being sold to identified vehicle fleets.</P>
        <P>One of the aims of the Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax relief schemes and the Biofuels Obligation is to mainstream the availability of biofuels within the existing fuel station supply network and provide market players with long-term certainty and a stable investment climate. The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated.  There is free entry into and out of the market.  There is no price control on oil products and this is to ensure that the market is fully competitive. Current trends in the petrol station network including the development  and retention of  individual retail units are a matter for the commercial companies themselves, I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>
        <P>The biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief schemes are complemented by a range of other support measures including a 50% VRT relief on Flexible Fuel Vehicles, which are capable of running on blends of up to 85% ethanol in petrol, and a commitment in the Bioenergy Action Plan to the introduction of a minimum requirement for the use of biofuels in State owned and public transport vehicles.  Grants for the conversion of diesel engine vehicles to use Pure Plant Oil (PPO) have also been made available by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and the Department of Transport. The Department of Agriculture and Food has also introduced &euro;6m energy crop &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; payment of &euro;80 per hectare on top of the existing EU Energy Crops Premium of &euro;45 per hectare.</P>
        <P>As we move towards higher targets for biofuels, the issue of sustainable global development of Biofuels is coming increasingly into focus. It is expected that the European Commission&rsquo;s forthcoming renewable energy legislative proposals, will contain targets for biofuels market penetration, subject to the introduction of sustainability criteria and the coming on stream of second-generation biofuels.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s biofuels obligation will take account of EU sustainability initiatives in relation to biofuels and I intend to work very closely with my <Col N="927"/>EU colleagues in addressing this highly complex challenge for biofuels policy.</P>

	<P>A proposal on postcodes was brought to Government earlier this year.  Before the project can proceed however, the Government decided that further analysis and quantification of the benefits of postcodes is required.  The upfront cost of establishing a postcode address database, implementing and promoting the postcode has been estimated in the region of &euro;15m.  There would also be ongoing annual maintenance costs but these would be met from revenues generated by the postcode manager.  As part of its work on the project, the National Postcode Project Board carried out an extensive consultation with stakeholders, both within the postal sector and outside it.  In addition to this, a public consultation will also be held before a postcode system is introduced. </P>
        <P>The commitment to introduce a postcode system in Ireland is contained in the programme for Government and I am currently considering the issues involved and the next steps.</P>

	<P>Groundwater resources are assessed by the Geological Survey of Ireland, a division of my Department, through their aquifer classification and groundwater vulnerability mapping. Groundwater in Ireland is protected under European Community and national legislation, and local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency are responsible for enforcing this legislation. </P>
        <P>The Geological Survey of Ireland undertook a major review of aquifer classifications across Ireland in 2002-2004, as part of the Water Framework Directive. All available data were carefully examined to arrive at the current aquifer classifications using considerable experience, knowledge and assessment of many data nationally according to a clear set of criteria.</P>
        <P>The area around Nevitt, Lusk, County Dublin was part of this study. The quality and extent of the data used to classify the aquifer which includes the Nevitt area significantly exceeded the minimum data requirements of the classification criteria.</P>
        <P>The data were re-examined, together with additional well information provided by the Nevitt-Lusk Action Group, in October 2006. This reassessment confirmed the existing aquifer classification. On the basis of the information currently available, the aquifer classification remains &ldquo;locally important bedrock aquifer which is generally moderately productive (Lm)&rdquo;.  This information has been made available to the relevant local authority and all other interested parties.  Any further re-examination of the aquifer which includes the Nevitt, Lusk, County Dublin area would not necessarily lead to a reclassification.</P>

	<P>As a peripheral island energy market, Ireland fully supports the progressive integration of European markets and European energy networks. The Energy Policy White Paper underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the progressive development of a regional electricity market with UK and North West Europe over the coming years The all-island Single Electricity Market from November this year and the East West Electricity Interconnector by 2012 are key steps in this development.</P>
        <P>My Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the Transmission System Operator, EirGrid, along with their UK and French counterparts, are working towards the development of a regional electricity market, as part of the EU Commission&rsquo;s initiative to develop regional energy markets through ERGEG (European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas).</P>
        <P>The objective of the ERGEG Regional Initiative is to make concrete improvements in the development of a single energy market in Europe by first integrating national markets in electricity and gas into regional markets.  This is achieved through the identification and removal of impediments to trade at a regional level.</P>
        <P>The France, Ireland and UK electricity Regional Electricity Market initiative is led by the British Energy Regulator (Ofgem) and aims to integrate national markets in the three countries. The Irish authorities are actively participat<Col N="931"/>ing through the Regional Coordination Committee and Stakeholder and Implementation Groups. Progress is being made in addressing the key priorities of congestion management and intra day trade, balancing and transparency issues.</P>
        <P>Annual electricity consumption in France, Ireland and the UK is around 30% of the EU 25 electricity market. At present ESB has a total installed generation capacity of just over 60% of the generation market in Ireland. The CER /ESB Asset Strategy agreement, which includes an agreement for ESB to divest 1,300 MW of its existing capacity, in conjunction with the SEM, will ensure that ESB&rsquo;s share of the all-Island power generation market falls to approximately 40% by 2010</P>
        <P>It is in this context that ESB Powergeneration will continue to compete in the island of Ireland and, eventually, as the regional energy markets progress, the wider single energy market in the EU.  The scope for European-wide competition is determined also by the availability of physical interconnection between systems.  Ireland endorses the priority being given to interconnection under the Energy Policy for Europe.</P>
        <P>The European Commission published proposals for a third package of energy legislation on 19 September.  As part of this package, the Commission proposes to establish an Agency for the Cooperation of National Energy Regulators (ACER), with relevant powers and duties, to complement National Regulators. This is a welcome initiative in terms of the high level principles and will support both the ERGEG Regional Market Initiative and the All-island Energy Market. The detail of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals is the subject of on-going discussions at EU level on the draft legislation.</P>

	<P>The commercial development of a proposed large scale wind-farm on the Arklow Banks is primarily a matter for the project developers. A proposal for a smaller phase 1 project of 25 megawatts (MW) on the same site has been submitted into the offshore wind category of round 6 of the Alternative Energy Requirement support programme (AER 6), operated by my Department. Evaluation of applications in this category by my Department is currently ongoing which precludes me from commenting on the project. </P>
        <P>Currently Ireland has over one thousand Megawatts of renewable capacity connected. This consists of approximately 793 MW of wind powered plant, 236 MW of hydro powered plant with the balance (c. 34 MW) made up of different biomass technologies.  Grid connections are awarded by EirGrid and ESB Networks. The network operators are overseen by the Commission for Energy Regulation. Currently there is over 3,000 MW of renewable generation in the grid connection application process, the vast bulk of which is wind-powered technology.</P>

	<P>In line with the Programme for Government commitment to ensure that the ESB installs smart electronic meters in every home, I have mandated my Department to work as a priority with the <Col N="933"/>Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), ESB Networks, and Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) to expedite a costed national smart meter roll-out programme, building on research and pilot projects to date as well as best international practice. </P>
        <P>The issue of cost will be fully addressed in the context of developing and rolling out the national smart meter programme. It will factor in the real benefits which smart metering can deliver for consumers by allowing them to reduce their bills by cutting back on unnecessary use of electricity as well as the benefits which will accrue for the economy and society as a whole in terms of enhanced security and sustainability of energy supply.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 190 together.  </P>
        <P>The Programme for Government commits to a range of measures included in the White Paper on Energy, which provides a comprehensive roadmap for the development of the energy sector.  Alternative energy development is critical to addressing the key challenges of climate change, competitiveness and security of energy supply.  The White Paper on Energy Policy supports the targets and strategic approach in the Bio Energy Action Plan with the objective of delivering a fully integrated approach to the sustainable use of bioenergy resources.</P>
        <P>The Government has committed to ambitious but achievable targets and a range of policies and programmes to meet those goals are already firmly established.  A series of renewable energy support programmes valued at over &euro;400m have already been introduced and are designed to be accessible to all energy users, from householders, to community and voluntary groups, the commercial and industrial sector and renewable electricity producers. They will be backed up by support for investment in research and development into renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency initiatives.</P>
        <P>We have increased the EU target for renewable energy sourced electricity from 13.2% to a national target of 15%, which will be delivered <Col N="934"/>through the REFIT programme, and further increased the target to 33% of gross electricity consumption from renewable energy sources by 2020.</P>
        <P>In Biofuels for transport, we have committed to a target of 5.75% by 2010, in keeping with the EU Biofuels Directive and to a further target of 10% by 2020 in line with current EU proposals. These targets will be delivered through a Biofuels Obligation which will be introduced in 2009.  In the heat sector, targets of 5% and 12% market penetration by 2010 and 2020 respectively are being delivered through the successful Greener Homes, ReHeat and CHP grants programmes, as well as measures to encourage the growing and processing of energy crops. These targets have been established in advance of any EU targets or legislation in this area.</P>
        <P>Renewable energy and energy efficiency are key priorities in the twin goal of reducing carbon emissions and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.</P>

        <Quest> if he is confident that Ireland will meet renewable and climate change targets as set down in the Government&rsquo;s energy plans; if he will report on those plans; the position in relation to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am confident we can meet the Renewable and Climate Change targets in the Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Energy Policy and the Programme for Government.  The targets should not be seen as a limit on our ambitions but rather a baseline from which further progress can be achieved.</P>
        <P>The Government has also set a national target of a 20% reduction in energy demand across the economy by 2020, including the electricity, transport and heating sectors. We have also set a specific national target of 33% improvement in the public sector in order to demonstrate its leadership and exemplar role.</P>
        <P>I have launched the Energy Efficiency Action Plan for consultation.  It demonstrates how Ireland proposes to achieve and exceed energy efficiency targets through a mixture of ongoing actions.  Achievement of our targets will require integrated policy action across Departments and Agencies.  Ultimately, success in this endeavour will help reduce our dependence on imported fos<Col N="935"/>sil fuels and increase Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position in the global economy, while contributing to a more sustainable future.</P>
        <P>The REFIT support programme is capable of delivering and surpassing a target to increase the contribution of renewable powered electricity to 15% of consumption by 2010. It is estimated this will require installed capacity in the region of 1,650 megawatts (MW). There are in excess of 1,000 MW built and approximately 600 MW already accepted into Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) with planning permission and connections offers. When the Gate 2 connection process is completed in the coming months this latter figure is expected to more than double.</P>
        <P>We have also set ambitious 2020 targets to further increase the contribution of renewable energy at that time as quantified in the following table.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  </P>
        <P>The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.  I have reviewed the recent State of the Net report. I note the report&rsquo;s findings that the north west is behind most of the rest of the country in broadband take up.  A rural lag is generally a feature across the EU and beyond, due to the private sector being unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services in some rural areas.</P>
        <P>My Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage, including providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme, the building of Metropolitan Area Networks and, more recently, the development of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).</P>
        <P>The NBS, for which the procurement process is underway, will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.  My Department is anticipating that the award of the NBS contract will be Quarter 2 of 2008, with rollout of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter.  This timeline is subject to negotiations with candidates during the competitive dialogue phase of the procurement process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 80, 81, 86 and 89 together.</P>
        <P>My Department and the HSE have been reviewing the pharmaceutical supply chain, with a view to seeking value for money in the State&rsquo;s drugs bill in order to better fund existing and innovative therapies without compromising continuity of supply or patient safety.  An HSE-led negotiating team, including officials from my Department, engaged with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland (APMI), representing the proprietary and generic supplier representative bodies, and completed new agreements with these bodies in mid-2006. These agreements are in place.</P>
        <P>As wholesale margins are not addressed in the new IPHA and APMI Agreements, it was intended to negotiate direct formal arrangements with the wholesale sector. Following completion of the manufacturer agreements, the negotiating team entered talks with the wholesaler representative body, the Pharmaceutical Distributors&rsquo; Federation (PDF).</P>
        <P>Early in discussions, PDF refused to negotiate a new margin for community supply, based on its own legal advice that this was a contractual matter between individual wholesalers and retailers. Subsequent legal advice to the HSE, confirmed by legal advice to my Department, indicated that, under section 4 of the 2002 Competition Act, PDF as an association of undertakings may not collectively negotiate fees, prices or margins on behalf of its members. Given the fact that the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU) is also an association of undertakings, it is not possible for the State to negotiate with PDF or the IPU on fees or margins as such negotiations <Col N="941"/>would place these bodies at risk of prosecution. Consultation with the IPU Pharmaceutical Contractors&rsquo; Committee, under Clause 12 of the Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement, in relation to fees, prices or margins, would also be excluded under Section 4 of the 2002 Competition Act.</P>
        <P>In light of the legal position arising from the wholesaler legal advice, the negotiating team re-considered how best to address the review of pharmaceutical supply. Based on the legal advice, a consultation process accompanied by independent economic analysis was considered the most appropriate means to allow for the determination of new reimbursement arrangements. The consultation process involved direct discussion with wholesaler companies and a call for public submissions, published on 20th December 2006, in response to which a total of 161 submissions (including 143 from community pharmacy contractors) were received.</P>
        <P>Following the completion of public consultation, and informed by independent economic analysis, carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants, new reimbursement arrangements were announced by the HSE on 17th September 2007. The new price arrangements involved revised rates for community and hospital supply, as follows:  Community supply &mdash; reimbursement of cost of drugs and medicines to pharmacy contractors reduced from ex-factory price plus 17.66% for wholesale supply (previous mark-up), to ex-factory price plus 8% from 1st January 2008 and 7% from 1st January 2009 (new mark-up); Hospital supply &mdash; new interim mark-up of 5% for wholesale supply from 1st January 2008, with further discounts for efficient ordering and supply in that sector.</P>
        <P>Community pharmacies are paid the ex-factory price of drugs and medicines, as determined under the IPHA and APMI agreements, plus a percentage mark-up to cover distribution costs by wholesalers. There is no direct arrangement between wholesalers and the HSE for community delivery, as the HSE does not buy medicines directly for the community schemes. In addition to the foregoing, community pharmacies are paid a dispensing fee per item for dispensing to GMS medical care patients, and a fee plus 50% mark-up on each item dispensed under the DPS and LTI schemes.</P>
        <P>In its examination of the issues involved and in determining the new arrangements, the negotiating team considered a reimbursement level that reflects the market value of pharmaceutical wholesale services, and security and continuity of supply at current levels to patients. The evidence on which the decision is based, following examination of the issues, direct consultation and independent economic analysis, all indicates that the State is currently paying a premium for the services in question. It is possible and necessary for revised arrangements to be put in place with<Col N="942"/>out a substantial impact on the delivery of such services.  Information available to the negotiating team indicates that small and rural pharmacies typically receive discounts of 2-3% on the existing wholesale markup, while larger urban pharmacies and chains typically receive discounts of up to 12%. Therefore, smaller and rural pharmacies would be proportionately less affected by the revised arrangements.</P>
        <P>I would also point out that pharmacists&rsquo; arrangements with wholesalers for the supply of drugs and medicines is a private commercial arrangement, and that the HSE&rsquo;s role is confined to setting the most appropriate reimbursement rates for pharmacies. The basis for the new reimbursement arrangements was set out in detail by the CEO, HSE on the 17th September 2007, including:  a note on achieving better value for money in the supply of medicines, and a detailed presentation on reducing the cost of medicines.</P>
        <P>I will arrange for copies of these documents to be forwarded to the deputies. The HSE also intends to publish the report of Indecon Consultants &ldquo;Review of Pharmacy Wholesale Margins&rdquo; as soon as concerns by wholesalers, regarding commercially sensitive information, have been addressed.  The negotiating team met with the IPU on the 3rd October to discuss implementation issues arising from the recent announcement of new wholesaler arrangements, and in particular the position of wholesalers in relation to their pricing structures under the new arrangements. I understand that clarification has been received from each of the main wholesalers on their processes for compliance with the new arrangements.</P>
        <P>In the light of the legal advice received, and following consultation with the IPU, a separate procedure was also agreed to examine available options for advancing contractual negotiations in compliance with Irish and EU competition law.  This process is being chaired by Mr. Bill Shipsey, SC and is continuing.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to A Fair Deal, the new Nursing Home Support Scheme which is due to commence on 1 January 2008.   The current system of nursing home support is not predictable or sustainable.  People who need care face different costs depending on whether they are in public or private nursing homes.  People in private nursing homes may qualify for a nursing home subvention but are otherwise required to meet the full costs of their care.  Subventions are means-tested and take a person&rsquo;s income and assets into account.  In particular, the means test imputes an income of 5% from housing assets, and effectively assumes people have a higher assessable income than they currently have.</P>
        <P>Therefore, many people who do get support, as subvention payments cannot afford to pay the balance of their costs.  As a result, people are sometimes forced to sell or mortgage their homes to pay for their care, or must rely on contributions from their family or friends.  Many people do not receive any support from the State</P>
        <P>The Fair Deal aims to remedy the above situation.  Under the new scheme, a person will make a contribution towards their care costs and the State will meet the full balance of cost in homes approved for the purpose.  This will ensure that long-term residential care is affordable for all who need it.  The means assessment for the scheme will work out how much the applicant can contribute to the cost of their care by taking into account their income and assets.  For the purposes of equity, it is important that the means assessment takes account of both types of means.</P>
        <P>The immediate contribution by the applicant towards the cost of their care will be based on 80% of their assessable income, i.e. Old Age Pension, private pensions, etc.  Depending on the amount of assessable income, there will also be a Deferred Contribution of up to 5% on the applicant&rsquo;s assets, such as their home. The contribution is deferred because it will not have to paid during the applicant&rsquo;s lifetime.  Of course, the person can choose to pay the contribution on assets at the time of receiving care if they so wish.  Under A Fair Deal, anyone who is assessed as needing long-term nursing care can apply for support under the scheme. The scheme is voluntary.  Every person will make a fair contribution to the cost of their care, based on their means.</P>

	<P>The 2007 Pharmacy Act allows for <Col N="948"/>the removal of the restriction on pharmacists educated in other EU or EEA countries owning, managing or supervising a pharmacy in Ireland that is less than three years old &mdash; the derogation under Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC.  My motivation in removing this derogation was to facilitate the many Irish pharmacy graduates who, because of the shortage of pharmacy undergraduate places available in the State, went abroad to train.  On their return these graduates found that they were at a disadvantage to their Irish trained colleagues in not being able to establish a new pharmacy business, having instead to confine themselves to ones which had already been in operation for at least 3 years, a situation that was clearly unfair and unsustainable. </P>
        <P>The Pharmacy Act will be commenced in 3 stages.  The 1st Stage of the process has put in place the Council of the new Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the 2nd Stage will put in place a new Registration regime for pharmacists and pharmacies, including offences and powers of investigation and the 3rd Stage will deal with complaints, inquires and discipline (Fitness to Practice Provisions).  A three stage process allows flexibility in implementation dates, given the complexity and number of new policies and procedures that the new PSI Council must have in place to accommodate each stage.</P>
        <P>In relation to the removal of the derogation, new policies and procedures must be in place before the second stage of implementation of the Act, including the removal of the derogation, can proceed.   The second stage of the implementation of the Act will deal with the new procedures for registration of pharmacists and pharmacy businesses under Part 4 of the Act, the conditions for conduct of a retail pharmacy business, including 3 years post-registration experience for supervising pharmacists, Part 7 of the Act on the investigation of alleged offences, breaches of codes or professional misconduct, regulations for supervision of the sale and supply of medicinal products and, in the interest of public safety, new conditions for registration of pharmacists in terms of forensic and linguistic competency.  Once these new policies and procedures and the new regulatory regime for pharmacists and pharmacy businesses, are put in place by the Council, it will be possible to revoke the 1962 Pharmacy Act and remove the derogation.</P>

	<P>The tabular statement below sets out the number of full time permanent jobs in manufacturing in Enterprise Agency (Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland) assisted firms in Co. Kildare for each of the years between 1997 and 2006.  This data indicates an increase of nearly 3000 manufacturing jobs or 25% over the period.  Kildare has in recent years attracted some world class manufacturing companies such as Intel, Braun, Oral-B and Hewlett Packard.  These companies continue to invest in the area.  This is reflected in the 2006 announcement by Hewlett-Packard Financial Services of the expansion of their EMEA headquarters in Leixlip.  Similarly Intel announced in 2007 its plans to establish the Technology Research for Independent Living (TRIL) Centre in Ireland.  Approximately $30 million will be invested in the TRIL Centre over a period of three years and Intel will collaborate with several leading Irish universities, including UCD, TCD and NUI Galway to create one of the largest research efforts of this type in the world.  IDA Ireland is also working to attract the International Services, Software, Financial Services and Pharmaceuticals sectors. </P>
        <P>The enterprise development agencies are committed to promoting Kildare as a location for investment as part of an integrated East Region, with access to a population base of 1.5 million people, as well as supporting and developing businesses already present in the county.  In general, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for County Kildare is to:</P><Col N="952"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Progress the development of a knowledge economy;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Encourage increased co-operation between foreign direct investment companies and third level institutions in the county; e.g University College Maynooth and the establishment of the Innovation Value Institute;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Work with the existing client base in the county to expand its presence;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Work with Local Authorities and relevant infrastructure providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure to the county.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies who are setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at national and regional levels through supporting research in companies and third level institutions.  Since the beginning of 2003, EI has approved over &euro;12m in support to companies in Kildare to help them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation and new product development in order that they can compete on world markets.</P>
        <P>New companies &mdash; now leaders in the consumer products market &mdash; have been established and have created new employment.  The consumer foods sector in particular, has shown rapid growth in recent years.  Over the last two years we have seen significant investment by Green Isle Foods and Dawn Farm Foods Ltd, both supported by Enterprise Ireland, leading to significant employment increases in both of these state of the art facilities.</P><Col N="951"/>

	<P>Following the enactment of the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 which revoked the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987, I asked the Competition <Col N="952"/>Authority to review and monitor developments in the grocery sector in light of the new regulatory environment.  Later this year the Authority intends to publish an analysis of developments in the sector focusing on pricing trends, market structures and barriers to entry.</P>
        <P>During the debate that surrounded the removal of the Order I indicated that increased competition in the market should lead to prices being cheaper than they would be if the Order remained in place.  CSO figures are consistent with this view, particularly when grocery price inflation is compared with overall inflation.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive has stated that it has received an application for mortgage interest supplement from the persons concerned in respect of their residence which was re-mortgaged with a new mortgage provider in December 2006.  The property was originally financed by a local authority loan.  The Executive has advised that it has requested the persons concerned to provide documentation from the local authority stating the amount outstanding on the <Col N="954"/>original mortgage, immediately prior to the transfer of the loan, so it can establish the correct entitlement.  The requested documentation has not yet been received.  The Community Welfare Officer (CWO) offered to provide an exceptional needs payment pending a decision on the claim, but this offer was refused.</P>
        <P>The Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme, administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare Division of the Health Service Executive, provides for short-term weekly or monthly income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  In making a decision on entitlement, the Executive must be satisfied that the amount of mortgage interest payable by the claimant does not exceed such amount as the Executive considers reasonable to meet his or her residential needs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not aware of the reports mentioned by the Deputy regarding Irish Child Benefit but I am aware of a recent report in the Daily Express, dated 24th September last, regarding UK Child Benefit.  Claims for Child Benefit are only put into payment when all necessary documents including original birth certificates have been obtained and verified and enquiries regarding entitlement are confirmed by the other member state.  Regular checks are carried out to ensure that those in receipt of benefit continue to be entitled to it.  These include the use of mailshots and follow up Social Welfare Inspector visits as required.  Child Benefit customers are also informed at the time of their claim, and in ongoing communications, of their obligation to inform the Department of any change in circumstances that may affect their entitlement to benefit.</P>
        <P>EEA migrant workers in Ireland with entitlement to Child Benefit fall into one of two categories &mdash; those who have their families living with them in Ireland and those whose families reside in their home country.  Applications for child benefit from EEA migrant workers who come to live in Ireland with their families are dealt with under domestic legislation.  Entitlement is based on the applicant satisfying the Habitual Residency condition and the child being ordinarily resident in Ireland.  Before Child Benefit is awarded, the Department confirms that the applicant or spouse is in insurable employment in Ireland and that the children are resident in the country.  Employment status is confirmed with the employer or via the commencement of employment data held by the Department.  The residency of the child is normally confirmed with the school the child is attending. If the child is not yet school age, the parent will be asked to provide confirmation from the family doctor or other nominated professional, of the child&rsquo;s residency in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the Department is satisfied that the qualifying conditions have been met, the claim is put into payment and a notification is sent to the EEA country where the family previously lived to inform them that the family now reside in Ireland and that Child Benefit is being paid here.  The authorities in the other member state will then take any necessary action to regularise the customer&rsquo;s payments (if any) in that jurisdiction.  EU regulations do allow for partial payment of Child Benefit from more than one State &mdash; where a top-up amount is paid by one State in addition to Benefit paid by the other one &mdash; so it is possible to receive Child Benefit payments legitimately from more than one State.  However this would very rarely arise in the case of Poland as, due to the means-tested nature of the Child <Col N="956"/>Benefit payments in that country, the entitlement from Ireland would almost invariably eliminate any entitlement in Poland. Migrant workers who are not EEA nationals are dealt with in the same manner as EEA nationals but the Child Benefit section also confirms if the person is registered with the Garda National Immigration Board (GNIB) as legally resident in Ireland.</P>
        <P>EEA nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose family remain in their home country may have an entitlement to Family Benefits in Ireland under EU regulation 408/71.  When an application is received from an EEA migrant worker whose family is resident in another member state, the Child Benefit Office contact the relevant authorities in the member state where the worker&rsquo;s family reside.  The authorities are asked to verify details of children being claimed for, and any family benefits being paid in that country.  This information is used to calculate the amount of Child Benefit to be paid to the customer.  The payment issues either as a primary payment or a supplement top-up as appropriate and the relevant authority is notified of the Irish Child Benefit payment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regular periodic reviews are carried out to confirm that the claimant is still in employment and has entitlement to Irish Child Benefit.  The Department is currently enhancing its IT systems under the Service Delivery Modernisation (SDM) programme to record the certification of non-Irish national customers in the terms of their residency and employment status as appropriate.  This will further enhance the scheme control capabilities.  These enhancements, coupled with the scheme review policy being drafted this year, will enable the Department to better focus control and review activity on selected segments or customer groupings as appropriate.</P>

	<P>My Department assists and encourages the unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed, lone parents and other social welfare recipients to return to training or  education through a range of measures administered by my Department&rsquo;s social and family support service.  </P>
        <P>These measures include the payment of income support through the back to education allowance scheme to customers who are undertaking a full-time course of education. The scheme is an educational opportunities scheme for unemployed <Col N="957"/>people, lone parents and people with disabilities in receipt of particular payments from DSFA and its objective is to enhance the employability skills of vulnerable groups who are distant from the labour market</P>
        <P>In addition my Department through its special projects funds provides funding to third parties to assist welfare recipients, as well as members of their families, improve their employability, personal and family situations through education, training and personal development courses.  The fund is focused on assisting people most marginalised in social and economic terms and is operated in a manner that enables a quick response to any needs identified.  The projects have given much help by way of intensive training, counselling and other supports to groups at risk of developing long-term welfare dependency.  Groups who need special help of this type include the very long-term unemployed, travellers, people with literacy difficulties, lone parents, the long-term ill and people with disabilities.  From January to December 2006, over 160 projects were funded at a total cost of &euro;2.9 million.</P>
        <P>The funding focuses on assisting people most marginalised in social and economic terms and gives much help by way of intensive training, counselling and other supports to groups at risk of developing long-term welfare dependency.  Groups who need special help of this type include the very long-term unemployed, travellers, people with literacy difficulties, lone parents, the long-term ill and people with disabilities and their families.</P>
        <P>The initiatives funded demonstrate the positive results of a partnership approach between my Department, the Voluntary and Community Sector and other local players in identifying and addressing local needs in terms of education, training and development.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted a 2006 National Reserve application under Categories A and B.  Category A catered for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16th May 2005 and who had leased out his/her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000-2002.  The person named is not eligible for an allocation as the leased land has not been received free of charge or for a nominal amount.</P>
        <P>Category B catered for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who did not receive any direct payments in respect of that scheme year.  In addition, the 2006 National Reserve had provisions for New Entrants who were farming leased/rented land provided they could demonstrate a genuine commitment to farming.  In this context the applicant must have declared the leased/rented land on the 2004 Area Aid application and on both the 2005 and 2006 Single Payment applications.  The person named was deemed not eligible under this category as he only commenced farming in 2006 and therefore had not been leasing the land for the three requisite years, i.e. 2004, 2005 and 2006.</P>
        <P>A letter outlining my Department&rsquo;s decision has issued to the person named and if he is dissatisfied, he now has the opportunity to appeal the decision to the Independent Appeals Committee setting out the facts and contentions on which he relies in support of his appeal.

	<P>Modulated funds of &euro;225.5m are an integral part of the overall funding available for the 2007-2013 Rural Development Programme. The total funding for this programme amounts to &euro;5.778bn from three sources: EU co-funding &euro;2.114bn, Modulation &euro;0.225bn, Exchequer &euro;3.439bn.  The programme addresses three priorities, competitiveness, the environment and the wider rural economy, and encompasses the following main measures: REPS, compensatory allowances, early retirement, installation aid, farm modernisation. The funding provided for these farmer payment schemes took full account of the amount available from modulation and was agreed with the farm organisations in the social partnership agreement.  The Programme was approved by the EU Commission in July of this year. </P>
        <P>It should be noted that the Rural Development Programme includes only those measures that are co-funded by the EU.  The National Development Plan includes additional measures which are funded entirely by the exchequer.  The total value of the NDP agri-food package is &euro;8.7 billion.</P>

However not all of these staff are due to move to Portlaoise, e.g. the Animal Health and Welfare Division, and other posts, are due to move to the Department&rsquo;s new offices in Backweston.  In total some 600 posts are due to move to Portlaoise. My Department&rsquo;s decentralisation programme has been underway since 2004 so most of those who initially expressed interest have since transferred. The Department&rsquo;s Decentralisation Implementation Plan allowed for a phased movement to Portlaoise, i.e. the transfer of functions and posts over a number of years, as outlined below. </P>

	<P>The scheme to which the Deputy refers is an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) pilot scheme which is funded by my Department.  My Department has received 12 applications for inclusion in this scheme.</P>
        <P>With regard to specific provision for children with autism, the Government believes that as each child with autism is unique; such children should have access to a range of different interventions to meet their individual needs.  ABA is one of the methodologies used in special classes for children with autism.</P>
        <P>Advice received from international experts on autism, the National Educational Psychological Service and the inspectorate inform the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s view that a range of approaches should be used, rather than just one. An analysis of research, including the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism, also supports this approach, and autism societies in <Col N="963"/>other countries also caution against relying on just one intervention. By enabling children in special classes to have access to a range of methodologies, including ABA, the Government is doing what we are advised is in the best interests of such children.</P>
        <P>The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. My Department therefore supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. It is important that children have access to a range of methods so their broader needs can be met. Whereas ABA helps to improve behaviour, other interventions, such as TEACCH and PECS, are important in developing children&rsquo;s communication skills.</P>
        <P>Children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA. The level of such training available to teachers has significantly improved in recent years and is a major priority for the Government. Children in special classes also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.</P>
        <P>In excess of 265 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level and the National Council for Special Education will continue to establish more such classes where the need arises. At primary level there are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants (SNAs). Extra assistants are provided where the children need them. An individual child can have access to full-time support from an individual SNA if he or she needs one.  The scheme referred to by the Deputy was established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools.  She will be aware that the Programme for Government commits to the long-term funding for the twelve centres that are currently in the ABA pilot scheme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable the Department to support them as primary schools for children with autism.  I am pleased to advise that the issue is being actively progressed.</P>
        <P>In terms of autism provision in other locations, we will continue to work to ensure that all children can have access to a broad programme, with provision for ABA as appropriate, in special classes.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to facilitate the provision of education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.</P>
        <P>Further detail on the tutor in question is required to establish the applicable rate of payment.  Officials in my department are communicating directly with the Deputy&rsquo;s office in this regard.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s Post Primary School Transport Scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres or more from her/his local post primary education centre.</P>
        <P>The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside. However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area &mdash; otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.</P>
        <P>The Transport Liaison Officer for Co. Limerick and Bus &Eacute;ireann have advised that the transport service under the school transport scheme is operating to capacity. The families in question should continue to liaise with Bus &Eacute;ireann regarding the availability of catchment boundary seats in the future.</P>

	<P>CCTV systems are an important support to policing in ensuring public safety and can act as a useful deterrent to crime and public disorder.  As the Deputy is aware, the Community-based CCTV Scheme was put in place in June 2005 in response to a demonstrated demand from local communities across Ireland for CCTV systems.  The scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local com<Col N="968"/>munity CCTV systems. The scheme operates at two levels: initial funding for the assessment of needs and substantive funding for fully developed proposals.  Matching funding for RAPID areas is available from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  </P>
        <P>I have been informed by Pobal who are engaged to administer the Scheme on behalf of my Department, that to date, three local groups from County Kildare (Athy Town Council, Maynooth Business Association and Rathangan Community Alert Group) have applied for and been granted funding under the scheme.</P>
        <P>It is intended to invite applications for funding under the Community-based CCTV Scheme on a periodic basis and it is open to any group from County Kildare or other counties to submit an application for funding.  Further details of the scheme and the relevant documentation are available on my Department&rsquo;s website (www.justice.ie) or on Pobal&rsquo;s website (www.pobal.ie).</P>

        <P>Officials in that Section are currently processing applications received at the beginning of 2005 and have approximately 13,700 applications on hand to be dealt with before that of the person in question.  These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  There is nothing contained in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question that would warrant taking this application out of sequence and treating it expeditiously.</P>
        <P>It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the application will commence in the second half of 2009.  I will inform the Deputy when a decision is reached on this application.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 6 July 2005 and was granted temporary permission to remain until 15 July 2005.  He remained in the State beyond that date and failed to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau as he was required to do. He has therefore been illegally present in the State since 15 July 2005.</P>
        <P>The person concerned signed a consent to deportation form on 23 January 2007 which was <Col N="973"/>witnessed by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A request was then made to my Department by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na requesting the making of a deportation order.</P>
        <P>On receipt of this request, the case of the person concerned was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  On 1 May 2007, my predecessor refused temporary leave to remain in the State and signed a deportation order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring him to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on 29 May 2007, in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State.  The person concerned failed to present himself as required and was classified as evading his deportation. In the meantime he has resumed contact with the Garda&iacute; and is due to present himself to the GNIB on 15 October 2007.  The effect of the deportation order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State.  The enforcement of the deportation order is now an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising two independent statutory offices; the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted.</P>
        <P>All applications are considered in line with the provisions of the Refugee Act 1996. Section 2 of the Act defines a refugee, subject to stated exclusions, &ldquo;as a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Every asylum applicant is guaranteed an investigation and determination of his or her claim at first instance.  Each application is assessed on the basis of the circumstances of the individual case and having regard to both the subjective elements (the applicant&rsquo;s own account or personal history) and objective elements (up-to-date information on the applicant&rsquo;s country or place of origin).  This country of origin information comes from a wide variety of sources.  Applicants are also guaranteed a <i>de novo</i> hearing with the Refugee Appeals Tribunal where necessary and have access to legal advice throughout the process.</P>
        <P>While it is not the practice to comment in detail on individual asylum applications, I would point out to the Deputy that delays in finalising cases can occur for a variety of reasons, including giving applicants and appellants the fullest oppor<Col N="976"/>tunity possible to present their cases and the determination of Judicial Review proceedings.</P>
        <P>I would also like to point out that the heads of the two independent offices, namely, the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Chairperson of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal occupy independent statutory positions under the Refugee Act, 1996 and are independent in the performance of their functions under that Act.  As such, it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further on the matter.</P>

	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible, inter alia, for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers through the Government policy of direct provision. The RIA  is a cross-departmental Agency which coordinates service provision in  areas including health, education and welfare. The RIA is currently accommodating almost 7,000 people in 60 centres in 22 counties.</P>
        <P>In addition to direct provision accommodation, the Agency operates a very limited number of self-catering accommodation centres in certain parts of the country. This accommodation is reserved for special needs and extreme medical cases in the main.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The person referred to in the details supplied applied for asylum in February, 2004. She has made 4 requests for self-catering accommodation in the past 20 months. The first 3 were made on the basis of the length of time she was residing in direct provision accommodation. The most recent request dated 22nd August, 2007 was referred to our independent medical referee who was of the opinion that she did not have adequate medical grounds to be considered for self-catering accommodation. As her request referred to her medical condition and wanting to cook for herself she has been asked to provide centre management with a diet sheet  from her doctor which she has failed to do to date. It should be noted that she has never complained to management about the food or asked for any special dietary concessions. Once <Col N="979"/>she complies with this request centre management will do everything in their power to facilitate her dietary requirements.</P>
        <P>In relation to food, the RIA places particular emphasis on meeting, to the greatest extent possible, the dietary needs of residents and, in this regard, 28-day menu cycles are in place in all large centres. The menus offered reflect the reasonable needs of the different ethnic groups and the reasonable prescribed dietary needs of any person accommodated in centres.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All contractors are required to serve, breakfast, lunch and dinner each day. At the centre where the person referred to above is accommodated breakfast consists of eggs, a choice of 4 cereals, a choice of 2 juices, a selection of fruit, milk, tea, coffee, toast, brown and white bread, and a selection of spreads, jams and preserves. Lunch consists of a choice of 3 light main courses (varied daily) together with vegetables, pasta, rice, potatoes, juice, tea and coffee. Dinner includes a choice of 2 starters (1 hot and 1 cold) or dessert or yogurt and a choice of 3 main courses (varied daily) to include a meat dish, a fish dish and a vegetarian dish. Tea, coffee and toast are made available outside of normal meal times.</P>
        <P>All contractors are required to consult regularly with residents to ascertain what foods they prefer and how such foods should be cooked. These meetings are particularly important where many ethnic groups may be accommodated in the same centre and where there are residents who have special dietary requirements. Menus are kept under review and are revised from time to time with a view to meeting the ethnic and special dietary needs of residents to the greatest extent possible.</P>
        <P>Regular inspections of centres by RIA staff and by an Independent Inspectorate are carried out and appropriate measures are taken where the requirements of residents are not being met. In addition, RIA staff, including senior management, regularly eat in centres to ensure that the fare on offer is of the standard required.</P>
<P>In relation to the running of centres, residents are provided with a copy of the House Rules and Procedures, which incorporates a complaints procedure. Management organises regular meeting with residents where issues can be addressed. Moreover, RIA staff regularly hold &rsquo;clinics&rsquo; in centres where residents can raise issues in relation, inter alia, the running of the centre, the provision of services at the centre and any problems with quantity, variety or quality of the food.</P>

	<P>A wildlife officer of my Department visited the site on 4 December 2006 and made a written report to the Felling Section of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on 18 December. This report did not note any grounds for refusing the felling licence. The site is not a designated conservation area.  It is not normal practice to lay routine reports of this nature before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>The procedures for the appointment of ordinary members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la are set out in the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended by Sections 14-16 of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006. In addition, Article 11 of the Planning and Development Regulations, 2006 amended the list of prescribed bodies for the purposes of making nominations to the Board and the Irish Rural Dwellers Association are now included on the list. I am satisfied that the current nomination and appointment processes are fair and transparent. Furthermore, as the legislative provisions underpinning these processes have only recently been endorsed by the Oireachtas, I have no proposals to make any further amendments at this time.</P>

	<P>Section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended by Section 46 of the Wildlife Amendment Act, 2000, provides protection for vegetation on uncultivated land such as hedgerows by providing that  &ldquo;it shall be an offence for a person to cut, grub, burn or otherwise destroy, during the period beginning on the 1st day of March and ending on the 31st day of August in any year, any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated or in course of cultivation for agriculture or forestry&rdquo;. </P>
        <P>The purposes of these provisions include protection of bird life during the nesting season, prevention of forest fires, and protection of vegetation and wildlife habitats during the months of growth and reproduction.  While it is not illegal to destroy vegetation while preparing or clearing a site for lawful building or construction works, including road construction, the destruction of vegetation on uncultivated land in the course of unauthorised development is an offence.</P>

	<P>The regulations governing the essential repairs grant scheme, which is operated by local authorities, do not specify an age qualification.  The scheme is designed to enable older people whose houses cannot be made habitable in all respects at a reasonable cost to have basic repairs carried out.  In determining priority between grant applicants, local authorities would have regard to relative means and needs and they generally restrict payment of essential repairs grants to older persons.</P>
        <P>The administration of the scheme in individual cases is a matter for the local authority concerned within the framework laid down in the regulations, which as far as is practicable, is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to authorities at local level.  In addition, local authorities are encouraged to operate the scheme in a sympathetic and flexible manner, having regard to the needs of the applicant.</P>

	<P>The Government is giving high priority to the development of the East West electricity interconnector between Ireland and Britain.  The Energy Policy White Paper and the Programme for Government underline this commitment, which will contribute to security of supply and competitiveness.  Greater interconnection between Member States is also a key priority for the European Union to ensure the effective working of the Internal Market. </P>
        <P>I can advise the Deputy that work on the project is progressing well.  On foot of the Government decision in 2006 the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is arranging the design of a competition to secure the construction of the 500 megawatt interconnector at the earliest possible <Col N="989"/>date before 2012. The Government also decided that the interconnector will, as a national strategic asset, remain in public ownership and will be owned by EirGrid.</P>
        <P>EirGrid is progressing work on route selection and technical specification of the interconnector and has recently announced that Woodland in County Meath is the most favoured connection point on the Irish side.  Work is also advancing, with the relevant authorities on finalising the connection point on the west coast of Britain.  EirGrid, overseen by the CER, is also finalising the competition structure, documentation and related contractual arrangements, with a view to going to market to the end of 2007.</P>
        <P>To oversee and ensure delivery of the interconnector to schedule, a high level co-ordination group has been established under the Chairmanship of the CER and comprising representatives of EirGrid and my Department.</P>
        <P>The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure Act) 2006, which provides for a streamlined planning process for strategic infrastructure developments, includes special provisions designed to expedite the planning process for electricity interconnector projects.  To underpin the interconnector development process, new arrangements have been made in respect of the construction and governance under licence of interconnector operators by the CER in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006.  In particular, the Act provides that the CER may, with Ministerial consent, secure the construction of an interconnector.  Such consent will be contingent on final Government approval.  As regards funding, the CER and EirGrid are working to determine the most cost-effective and efficient solution and this will be part of the submission for Government offered to proceed with construction.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</P>
        <P>The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).  Despite these Government initiatives there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the procurement process, the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) phase, is now complete and four candidates have pre-qualified.  As my Department indicated on 2 September 2007, the four candidates are, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.  The next phase of the procurement process involves inviting candidates to participate in a competitive dialogue process.  My Department is anticipating that the award of the NBS contract will be Quarter 2 of 2008, with rollout of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter.  This timeline is subject to negotiations with candidates during the competitive dialogue phase of the procurement process.</P>
        <P>There were 698,000 broadband subscribers in Ireland at end of quarter two of 2007 according to official figures from ComReg. This is equivalent to 16.48% of the population.  At the start of 2005 only 3% of population had broadband and 6.76% of the population at the start of 2006.  Ireland has narrowed the gap behind the EU average dramatically. At the end of Q2 06 the EU-25 average was 14% and our rate was 8%. At the end of Q2 07, the EU-25 Average was 18.2% and our rate was at 16.48%.  According to the latest OECD Broadband Statistics (end-Dec 2006), the strongest per capita subscriber growth over the year came from Denmark, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Ireland. Each country added <Col N="991"/>more than 5.8 subscribers per 100 inhabitants during 2006.</P>
  <P>A draft policy paper on next generation broadband is being prepared by my Department, which will review current communications infrastructure policy, and analyse policy options in light of industry developments. This will give guidance in relation to the optimum role for Government in the planning and rollout of broadband.</P>

	<P>The universal service obligation, enshrined in European and Irish law, provides that each Member State is obliged to provide a postal service whereby the minimum level of service that must be provided is a clearance and delivery every working day to the home or premises of every person.  Under Irish regulations, An Post is designated as the Universal Service provider.  There are no plans to change this.</P>
        <P>Liberalisation of the mail market in Ireland has already commenced and the Council of the European Union recently agreed that the postal sector should fully liberalise and be fully open to competition by 1 January 2011.  The development of the postal market requires the availability of competitive, high quality products. The current level of market opening has introduced new players with offerings that meet consumer needs and further market opening will provide further opportunities for new and existing players. The development of further competition allied with a modernised and customer-focussed An Post will provide the basis for the further development of the postal sector.</P>

As is set out in the Programme for Government, this Government is committed to ensuring that Irish customers continue to enjoy high quality postal services. The current regulatory framework, which is enshrined in EU and Irish law, sets out the requirement for the provision of a universal postal service and An Post, as the designated universal service provider has statutory responsibility for providing the universal service. The draft third postal directive proposes to maintain the universal service obligation at its current level, a position strongly supported by the Government.</P>

	<P>The intention of Greener Homes scheme is to stimulate consumer investment in renewable heating solutions and to develop the market for renewable technologies and fuels, thereby reducing CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions in the domestic sector.  Over 16,000 grants were approved under Phase I which ran from April 2006 to August 2007.  </P>
        <P>Since the scheme was launched there has been a dramatic increase in renewable technology suppliers and a ten-fold expansion in the number of <Col N="993"/>renewable energy products available on the market. This clearly demonstrates the very significant level of market development since the scheme was first launched.  The first phase of the scheme has achieved all of its objectives speedily and within budget.  Consequently, the grant levels are being reduced for some technologies where it is clear that the market has reached a level of maturity to allow it to continue at a lower rate of support.  Other grant levels remain unchanged.</P>
        <P>The objective in Greener Homes Phase II is to consolidate the market, underpinning it with quality standards and training and providing for a long-term future that is not grant-dependent.  The aim is to ensure that the market for these products, services and fuels continues to develop strongly, allowing suppliers and installers to consolidate their market offerings ahead of an unsubsidised market.</P>
        <P>The new building regulations announced recently by my colleague, John Gormley T.D., Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, will mandate the use of renewable heating systems in all new buildings which should provide a further boost to the development of these technologies.  From a cost-benefit perspective the Greener Homes Grant Scheme will continue in terms of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> reductions, market development and access to cleaner renewable technologies and fuels by consumers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The task of providing a competitive, secure, and sustainable energy future for Ireland poses considerable challenges for Ireland&rsquo;s electricity industry.  It also presents exciting opportunities for the sector.  Both EirGrid and ESB have critical roles to play.</P>
        <P>The ESB Group will remain a strong, commercially viable and integrated entity with a leading role to play in supporting the development of renewable energy and demand side and management strategies.  ESB International will be strongly growing its UK, European and international business.  ESB Group will continue to compete successfully with Viridian, Airtricity and all other independents in power-generation and electricity supply in the all-island electricity market.</P>
        <P>EirGrid, as the independent owner and operator of the national grid, is securely positioned in <Col N="994"/>that strategic role so that it can fully contribute to supporting an effective competition environment and transparency in the electricity market, a stable investment as well as ensuring security of supply and generation adequacy.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government, together with the White Paper on Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, explicitly confirms the Government&rsquo;s position that the electricity and gas networks, as strategic national assets, will remain in State ownership and will never be privatised.  The transfer of ownership of the transmission assets to EirGrid is taking place by end 2008 in that context.</P>
        <P>In relation to generation, the establishment of a gross mandatory pool in the context of the Single Electricity Market &mdash; which is to commence operation on 1 November &mdash; is designed to deliver an efficient and fully competitive all-island generation market.  The CER-ESB Asset Strategy, which was agreed between the Commission for Energy Regulation and ESB in November 2006, is an important step in ensuring that the optimum conditions prevail to underpin the establishment of real competition in that market.  The Strategy is designed to ensure the progressive reduction in ESB&rsquo;s market share in power generation to around 40% in an all-island market context by 2010.  In addition to the expected positive impact on market conditions, it is the expectation that ESB Power Generation will also become more efficient and commercial in the process.</P>

	<P>Last week I announced a new Licensing Round opening acreage in the Porcupine Basin to the west of Ireland for exploration for oil and gas.  The area covers unlicensed blocks in an area of approximately 63,500 square kilometres.  The Porcupine Licensing Round is part of an ongoing strategy of offering regular opportunities for licensing in the basins of the Atlantic Margin.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas is a resource of the people and I want to ensure that our waters are fully explored and also that we get a proper return to the State where commercial finds are made.  To this end, in August I announced changes to the tax regime which are designed to provide the Exchequer with potentially greater funds if commercial finds are made.</P>
        <P>Under the new regime profitable fields will pay up to 40% in taxation to the Exchequer which represents a top rate increase of 15%.</P>
        <P>I have also recently introduced new non-fiscal licensing terms for oil and gas exploration that are designed to encourage more vigorous exploration proposals from the industry while ensuring that there are sufficient incentives to maintain ongoing interest by the oil companies in Ireland as a location for oil and gas exploration.</P>
        <P>With regard to non-petroleum minerals, it is Government policy to stimulate discovery of economic mineral deposits and to maximise the contribution of the mining sector to the national economy, with due regard to its social and environmental impact.  Exploration and development is undertaken by private enterprise and regulated under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999.  New exploration is continuously undertaken as part of my requirements to holders of Prospecting Licences, of which there are currently 331.  Details of these Licences can be found in the six monthly report to the Oireachtas, which I am obliged to lay before the House under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999.  The last such report was in respect of the six-month period ended 31 December 2006.  I will shortly lay before this House the report for the six months to 30 June 2007.</P>
        <P>All extraction of minerals under the Acts is subject to payment of royalties to the State.  These are negotiated individually.  They reflect current international practice and the economics of the specific deposit to give a fair market-based return.</P>
        <P>While it is my intention to consolidate and update the Minerals Development Acts in a new Minerals Development Bill currently being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel which will further encourage mineral exploration in Ireland, I do not propose to change policy in relation to royalties.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</P>
        <P>The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</P>
        <P>Despite these Government initiatives there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.</P>
        <P>The first phase of the procurement process, the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) phase, is now complete and four candidates have pre-qualified.  As my Department indicated on 2 September 2007, the four candidates are, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.  The next phase of the procurement process involves inviting candidates to participate in a competitive dialogue process.  My Department is anticipating that the award of the NBS contract will be Quarter 2 of 2008, with rollout of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter.  This timeline is subject to negotiations with candidates during the competitive dialogue phase of the procurement process.</P>
