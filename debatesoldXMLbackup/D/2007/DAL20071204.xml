      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I will first deal with the question on EU law.  Transposition and implementation of EU law is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant Departments and Ministers.  My Department has a monitoring role in the timely transposition of EU legislation into Irish law, through the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on European Affairs, the ICCEUA, which is chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche.  The transposition of EU directives is a standing item on the work programme of that committee.  Departments are required to provide regular updates on directives that are applicable to their area.  The updates assist in the co-ordination and monitoring of the transposition of all EU directives, including those that are counted towards the European Commission&rsquo;s internal market scoreboard.  The European Commission has set a 1% transposition deficit target for the internal market scoreboard for 2009.</P>
        <P>There are no particular arrangements in place to monitor specifically or review the ongoing implementation of EU law.  Instead, Irish law giving effect to EU directives and regulations forms part of the overall corpus of Irish legislation.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to instigate a review of the entire economic regulatory environment and I answered questions in this House recently regarding that commitment, particularly on the administrative burden arising from regulation.</P>
        <P>I will travel to Lisbon on Thursday, 13 December to attend the signing ceremony for the reform treaty.  On Friday, 14 December, I will attend the European Council in Brussels.  The agenda for the Council focuses on three areas, namely, freedom, security and justice; economic, social and environmental issues; as well as external relations.  At the meeting, I will emphasise the need for the EU to lead the international response to climate change.  This is especially important in light of the forthcoming United Nations conference on climate change in Bali at which the EU, supported by all member states, must approach the task with a clear focus on an effective way forward to ensure a new international agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol.  As I have said to this House before, the position on holding a referendum on the reform treaty is that, while no formal decision has been taken, I expect that we will hold a referendum sometime next year, probably in the summer.  I <Col N="1771"/>have said this to several of my European Council colleagues.</P>
        <P>Regarding plans for official visits abroad in the period ahead, I will attend the European Council next week and those during 2008.  I will also attend the EU-Africa summit in Lisbon this weekend and I will travel to Lisbon for the signing ceremony for the reform treaty, as I have already mentioned.  Several other trips abroad have been confirmed for 2008.  I plan to visit the Republic of South Africa in January to see at first hand Irish overseas development aid efforts.  I will also lead a trade delegation to South Africa.  I will attend the EU-LAC summit to be held in Peru in May.  I addressed the Association of European Journalists at their conference in Dublin Castle on 10 November.  A copy of my speech is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.taoiseach.gov.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The main priority once the treaty is signed next month will be to engage the public and ensure that they are well informed about the treaty ahead of the planned referendum next year.  The National Forum on Europe will play a leading role in facilitating public debate.  The Government will engage in a thorough information campaign which will include <i>inter alia</i> the publication and distribution of a comprehensive White Paper on the reform treaty as well as other information materials such as leaflets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Government decided when the referendum will be held?  Is it likely to be in May-June, before the summer, or will it be held over until the autumn?  Is it likely that the people will have only one chance at this?  The eyes of 500 million will watch this country next year.  We are the only country that needs to hold a referendum.  This is a chance for Ireland, on behalf of everybody else, to ratify the treaty that will allow Europe to work with a structure that will enable 27 countries, instead of 15, to do business.  </P>
        <P>Has the Taoiseach examined the timeline for a children&rsquo;s rights referendum if it is to be held on the same day?  The all-party committee has much work to do on this.  I have said we will contribute constructively.  A wording must be agreed, a Bill must be published and debated in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, and the requisite period must be allowed before the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights can be held.  Has the Taoiseach examined the timeline and is he happy that it will be possible to hold two referenda on one day, one on children&rsquo;s rights, if the committee can agree and the House can pass it, and one on the EU reform treaty?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As soon as the agreement is completed next week, with whatever final issues might be included the Attorney General will give a formal legal judgment.  The outcome is not in doubt.  However we must go through this legal process.  Then the treaty will be signed.  We must <Col N="1772"/>then turn our minds to the date to bring forward referendum legislation to allow us to hold the referendum.  We must put the machinery in place for a referendum commission and structure a campaign.  I look forward to talking to Opposition leaders next week and coming to an agreed view on that.</P>
        <P>If possible I would like to honour the commitment we made on the children&rsquo;s rights referendum.  The committee on the constitutional amendment on children begins its work this week.  The members said they would need four months.  That takes us to the end of March or so, around Easter.  I understand that this timeframe cannot be improved on, which brings us into the next parliamentary session because Easter is very early in 2008.  We will have to consider whether it will be possible to hold the two referendums.  From talking to people around the House on this issue, there are differences of opinion.  Some people favour having one, while others believe we should have two.  We will have to form a judgment on this and I am quite happy to discuss these issues with colleagues from other parties.</P>
        <P>As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s other question, there is no doubt, given that it looks extremely likely that Ireland will be the sole EU member state that has to have a referendum, that this will clearly focus the eyes of Europe on us.  The ability of the European Union to move forward, having had a long protracted period of debate about institutional change for the better part of a decade, hopefully will be completed if each country ratifies the  reform treaty in terms of its own parliamentary or electoral process or constitutional arrangements.  In our case, we have to do both.  Sometimes people forget a treaty must be ratified by the Houses of the Oireachtas as well as by the people.  Ireland is unique within Europe in that regard and it is a very good opportunity to show Europe how we can move forward.</P>
        <P>Essentially, the reform treaty is about developing the EU in terms of providing for 27 or more member states, as against nine or 12 in the past.  It is also about the extremely important issue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, improved parliamentary scrutiny and to give individual parliaments a greater role by being involved in such procedures.  These are the essential issues.  It is about reforming the institutions and how we do our business, putting arrangements in place for a larger Europe, dealing with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, parliamentary scrutiny etc.  These are the big issues and the onus is on us to do what others will not be doing, namely, win popular support for the reform treaty.  That would be good for this country and for Europe for the next decade.  All the member states have pledged that they do not intend to return to institutional matters for the next decade.  That is a wise decision, having spent so much time on this issue.  This initiative will stand the test of time for at least the next decade and it will <Col N="1773"/>be important for this country to have played a key part.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I share his sentiment that this obviously will be good for Ireland and Europe.  We intend to play our part in that as fully as we can. </P>
        <P>Is the Government concerned about a revelation in a recent opinion poll that support for the EU reform treaty has halved since the previous poll?  No more than the Taoiseach, I do not get carried away by opinion polls.  Nonetheless, it is an indicator of interest in the whole European process.  It looks as if all parties in the House, save one, support the treaty.  The  National Forum on Europe and the Institute of European Affairs are disseminating information so that the public can make up its mind.  In that sense, a real challenge is presented if that recent opinion poll reflects any degree of truth.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach raise at the summit, as I have with leaders of the European People&rsquo;s Party, the question that surfaces often of the harmonisation of corporate tax rates within Europe?  This could be very damaging for Ireland and we should resist it completely.  In the context of Europe looking at Ireland to make a decision, this should be cleared up and assurances given that the EU does not intend to follow through on that matter.  A recent European People&rsquo;s Party document placed no urgency on this.  However, it is important for the leader of the Government to state this in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s position.</P>
        <P>Is the Taoiseach concerned about comments attributed to Commissioner Fischer Boel that an expedited review of the Common Agricultural Policy should take place?  The Taoiseach has often spoken about the fact that on a number of occasions we signed on for changes to the CAP.  The last change was to carry us through to 2013.  While everybody recognises the inevitability of change I would not see it as helpful for this country if the European Commission or the Council proposed an expedited review of the CAP given that this is a crucial decision for Ireland and Europe.</P>
        <P>A fortnight ago, I made the comment publicly that if we put a case before the Irish people for the passing of a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights and enshrining them in the Constitution, whatever the legislation is and whatever the people decide we should underpin those rights with a system of family courts that is separate and distinct and focuses on family law with trained judges and mediation services available.  With children&rsquo;s rights enshrined as central to our Constitution they should have such a family law system.  Does the Taoiseach agree with this principle?  It has worked well in a number of other countries.  Compare this to what we have which is fragmented and dissipated and causes endless controversy and difficulties for thousands of people.  I do not suggest we have a referendum on this on the same day.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1774"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny asked a number of questions.  With regard to the poll, it will always be shown that in a referendum, whatever the issue is, a large proportion of people will be in the &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Know&rdquo; category.  This poll shows we need the maximum amount of information out there.  In fairness to the public, they go about their everyday business and cannot be expected to follow the minute level of developments from preparation for the convention, through the convention, the first round of discussions, the period of reflection and finally to what is almost agreed.  For the public, this was a long drawn out process over the better part of a decade.  The public will not be familiar with what is in the reform treaty and this is the challenge for the Government and people who are supportive.</P>
        <P>The Government has a responsibility so people can listen to the conclusion of the long debate that took place and to show the importance of the issues, the reason for them and the reason the decisions worked on for almost a decade have come to this position.</P>
        <P>On the CCCTB initiative, I do not think we would be the only country opposing it and this is important.  As Deputy Kenny knows from his colleagues, this debate gunges on and is never ending.  In my view it will be never ending.  Countries believe it would be the greatest thing forever if we harmonised everything.  There are centralists such as my old Belgian colleague who I think is no longer there &mdash; it is nine months since the election but they go on forever forming governments.  Others believe this is essential and others like ourselves are opposed to them.  I always held the view that complicated tax issues are first of all for the sovereign independent state to make a decision on.  Tax harmonisation in other blocs of the world, such as Asia and the United States, and tax competition has never done anything but good.  I do not believe Europe should be concerned with this issue.  However, certain arguments may have some validity and the debate will continue.  I do not foresee it being signed off but the Commission and the European Parliament are aware of our stance on it.  I have been involved with four rounds of negotiations on this issue and it will keep returning in some form or other.  There are those who believe in its merits and that it would solve a lot of issues for them.</P>
        <P>For many years it has not been the case when the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, lead campaigns with IDA and Enterprise Ireland to win foreign direct investment that we have been in competition with our colleagues around Europe.  Increasingly, the competition comes from China, Bangalore in India and Singapore, which must be admired for its ability as a small country to deal with these issues.  At the European level, it is Switzerland rather than any EU member which is aggressive in this area.  In terms of areas that are moving up, Puerto Rico is extraordinary.  I do not think any of these are in the EU.  I am continually making <Col N="1775"/>this point to colleagues and, when they look at their own figures, they see that is the position.  Why, therefore, do the centralists continue to make this argument?  I suppose they are equally bored with my arguments against them but it is one of those long running issues which will continue into the dim and distant future.</P>
        <P>With regard to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question on children&rsquo;s rights, a number of issues arise.  Three High Court judges are totally tied up with family law business.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point regarding the Children Court and perhaps that could be better harmonised.  I do not know what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has proposed or if he has any proposals to bring forward on the matter.  In all circumstances, we should try to have the best, fairest and most compatible arrangements for looking after young people but I do not know the specifics of the matter.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kenny asked about something else.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have made an arrangement and we all know fundamental changes will occur in respect of the Common Agricultural Policy.  In Berlin in 1999, during the Irish Presidency and on the previous two Financial Perspectives, we have successfully pushed that down the road.</P>
        <P>On the most recent occasion, it was the agreement and understanding that we would move to single farm payments and reform the system in one fell swoop rather than on the phased basis sought by the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development.  The argument was that if we did that, we would have a settling in period which would bring us to the end of the next Financial Perspective in 2013.  It was agreed that the review would begin in a few years time but not that it would commence in 2008.  I have explained our views.  The French President stated last summer that he would like to commence this during the French Presidency.  When I visited the President in September, this issue and our position on it was the primary focus of our discussions.  I do not think he disagrees with the position and while some people would like to enter that debate earlier, as far as I am concerned the agreement on the Financial Perspective was firm despite any attempts otherwise by anyone.  However, while some are making mistakes, they are not pushing it that hard.  Our position is very clear.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Kenny will appreciate, I have stated on numerous occasions that the agricultural sector has to understand the system will fundamentally change after 2013.  The Department of Agriculture and Food is conscious of this and is working on it.  In terms of the kinds of arrangements we have been involved in, I was lucky in Essen in 1992 when I led the negotiations and in 1998 when I was party to the negotiations with <Col N="1776"/>the then Ministers, Mr. O&rsquo;Kennedy and Mr. MacSharry.  I have been through this debate four times and I have made clear to the agriculture industry for a long number of years that the present position will not hold after 2013 and it has to be ready to take on what will be fundamental reforms at that stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach stated he will sign the EU reform treaty on 13 December.  In doing so, he will have the support of the Labour Party and, as Deputy Kenny indicated, the Fine Gael Party.  Do all the parties in government support the signing of the EU reform treaty considering that the leader of one of them was one of just 11 eurosceptics who signed the minority report at the European Convention?</P>
        <P>I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement that he will meet Opposition leaders to discuss the referendum.  Will he discuss with us developing a strategy to disentangle the European referendum from the unpopularity of the Government in order that people will be focused on voting for or against the EU reform treaty as opposed to for or against the Government?  Does the Taoiseach believe that the comments of Commissioner McCreevy are helpful in this context, bearing in mind that the Commissioner considered the rejection of the first Nice treaty hilarious and extolled its virtues at the time as an anti-establishment vote?</P>
        <P>In the context of the summit in Lisbon, does the Taoiseach have a view on the proposal by President Sarkozy that a committee of wise men should be established to reflect on the future of the European Union in the period 2020 to 2030?  Would it not be more useful to hold back on such an initiative until after the reform treaty has been ratified by all member states?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s and the Labour Party&rsquo;s support for the reform treaty.  As I said, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and I will discuss these issues with the party leaders.  Obviously, we want to develop a strategy which will have the treaty passed.  To do that, we need the large number of people who support the Government and the other parties to support the treaty.  </P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>On President Sarkozy&rsquo;s proposal for a committee of the wise, all members of the European Council have agreed to leave behind the issue of institutional debate.  The French President&rsquo;s proposal is for a group to look at Europe in the long term, that is, beyond 2010.  The idea is to generate reflection in the coming years, not to suggest institutional change.  He does not see this as being in any way related to treaty negotiations and the committee is unlikely to have done much work before we have to deal with these issues.</P>
      
        <P>Some of the big issues facing Europe include how Europe will evolve and develop over the next ten or 20 years, what will happen to the new <Col N="1777"/>neighbourhood policy that was instigated during the Irish Presidency in 2004, what will ultimately happen on the issue of Turkey, which is a big difficulty for President Sarkozy and others, and how the trading blocs of the world will operate on the other side of WTO talks, if and when an agreement is concluded.  While a number of issues need to be looked at, they are seen very much in a long-term perspective.  What we should do in this period of preparation is focus on the many positive aspects of the reform treaty and ensure that the focus is on the reform treaty only.  That is the key issue.  It is what we are asking people to support and it is what is important to Europe.  It is about giving truthful information to the Irish people.  To reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s first question, all the parties in government support the reform treaty and, I hope, not alone that but actively work for its passage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for that reply.  In connection with the agenda for the summit, is it intended that there will be a discussion on relations between the EU and Russia?  Does he anticipate that consideration will be given to the unease expressed by election monitors about the conduct of the recent Russian elections or will there be space on the agenda for consideration of that matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I imagine that the Foreign Affairs Ministers will discuss Russia in some form or other.  Each EU Presidency would have a report back on their own summit with Russia.  I am sure it will generate some discussion.  It will probably take a week or so before a comprehensive report is given to the Foreign Affairs Council on that but I would be surprised if it is not discussed by the Foreign Affairs Ministers at the Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>An agency workers&rsquo; directive is due to be discussed at the Council of Ministers meeting tomorrow, 5 December.  Given that previously the Irish, British, Danish and German governments blocked this measure, what is the Irish Government&rsquo;s position in relation to such a directive now?  Will the Taoiseach support the directive on this occasion and will it be a matter to be addressed at the upcoming summit?</P>
        <P>During recent questions &mdash; this is where I take some encouragement &mdash; the Taoiseach indicated that it was his and the Government&rsquo;s intention to address this matter so in the context of that previous reply can he give us some positive indication today?  Accepting that in order to block off all exploitative avenues of what I can only describe as a very vulnerable sector of the workforce &mdash; pay and conditions are the critical area &mdash; can the Taoiseach confirm that the directive suggests that after a period of six weeks agency workers will be treated exactly the same as all other workers?  Is it the case, despite his earlier <Col N="1778"/>indication to me that this is a matter he wanted to see addressed, that the Irish Government is of the view that this period of time is too short?  Is that the situation he has been arguing?  Given the support of the trade union sector in Ireland for the introduction of the directive and the six-week period, following which all workers, irrespective of their being directly employed or agency placed, will be treated exactly the same, will he not back the trade union call for Government support on this occasion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of points here.  During the negotiations on 2016 we spent a long time coming to agreement on this issue.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, has been preparing legislation on the agency Bill, which we are anxious to bring forward.  We also have the employment compliance Bill.  We have employed additional inspectors and we are due to increase the number to the full quota shortly.  The ongoing negotiations seek clarity.  They seek to regulate improvements and to try to arrive at a directive that is balanced and complies with our competitive position so we do not lose ground in that regard &mdash; we will discuss competitive issues later today in the House.</P>
        <P>Many countries have derogations which we do not have, which are part of their agreements with the EU.  As we have been a member of the Union for a long time, 35 years, we do not have such a derogation, which is a consideration.  It is not a question of us blocking anything but, as always happens with a directive, of one trying to have it implemented in a way that corrects the balances, protects workers, in particular those who might be marginalised or paid below the required rate, and deals with all of the exploitation issues.  On the other side, the directive seeks to retain the flexibilities that are important for international and Irish companies in Ireland, which need flexibility to get top quality expertise into their workforces.</P>
        <P>All of these matters must be taken into account in the round.  Obviously, we would like to have them brought to a satisfactory and balanced conclusion, and to pass the agency Bill and the employment compliance Bill, which is what we are determined to achieve.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to what the Taoiseach has indicated he is trying to achieve, I am mindful of a number of other considerations.  My first concern is with regard to the rights of access to fair treatment by those who are employed through agency placements, whether indigenous or incoming workers.  Does the Taoiseach accept that while this directive will seek to address the inconsistencies and unfairness that unfortunately is rife in employment in this State at present, against the interests of agency workers, this will directly impact on those who are directly employed in a period much shorter <Col N="1779"/>than the medium term?  Indications of this are already well documented.  Does the Taoiseach believe  that it is patently in the interests of all workers, whether directly or agency employed, that this measure is adopted?</P>
        <P>On a separate matter, the EU Food and Veterinary Office report of last March made 25 recommendations, the implementation of which would compel Brazilian beef to comply with EU safety standards.  Why are we still facilitating the importation of Brazilian beef in the absence of the implementation of these recommendations, which clearly point to the need for Brazilian beef to be compelled to comply with the highest standards within the EU?  Why can we not act independently in the interests of the health of our communities and, given the spill-on from that, the interests of the Irish beef sector?  Why have we not yet acted to prohibit the importation of Brazilian beef that clearly currently does not meet the strict standards the EU would expect and seeks to compel compliance through the implementation of the 25 recommendations in the March report?  Will the Taoiseach act on this matter in the interests of health and, as a follow-on to that, the Irish beef sector?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has made clear our position on Brazilian beef and safety and veterinary standards.  She also made clear in the Agriculture Council what she is trying to achieve.  We must remember it is a collective position; we do not act unilaterally but in agreement.  The Minister has set out our position and the Deputy would need to put down a question on how she is following through on the various recommendations.  We have clearly stated our position, and no one has been more conscious than the members of this Government and the previous Government on protecting and enhancing the beef industry, opening up markets for it and securing its future.  We export 90% of the beef produced here and obviously wherever there is a threat, unfair market advantages given or standards not complied with, we are the first to raise such cases trenchantly.</P>
        <P>As regards the issue of agency work, I am very much in support of protecting fair labour laws, as the Deputy will know from what I have said on previous occasions.  That is why we are anxious to implement the arrangements contained in Towards 2016.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, is anxious to proceed with that legislation, including the agency Bill and the employment compliance Bill.  The Minister has informed me the drafting of the latter Bill is already under way.</P>
        <P>As regards the ongoing discussions in Europe, we must protect our interests and, as with any directive, we must take into account those working in various sectors of the economy.  There are differences, however, because agency workers are used in some sophisticated and advanced hi-tech <Col N="1780"/>areas.  They are engaged for such projects on short-term contracts, which works out well.  They are paid more than the rates, are given secure employment and, by and large, there are no difficulties in these areas.  In other areas there is ongoing concern about rates agency workers are paid, and we must be cognisant of protecting them.</P>
        <P>We are in competition across Europe for export markets, while protecting indigenous Irish employment.  We must be conscious that many countries have derogations in these areas, so when we adopt any EU directive we can incur competitive costs compared to other competitors.  All these matters must be taken into account.  All we ever try to do in these negotiations is to get a fair and even playing field as best we can.  Our labour laws are probably more advanced than most countries, while at the same time we operate our industrial relations on the basis of a collective bargaining system.  It is for us to seek an arrangement that is compatible with our laws, arrangements and practices.  We have 2.2 million people in the workforce and our first interest is that their rights are protected and enhanced where possible.  We must never lose sight of the need to achieve balance as well as sustaining and growing that level of workforce in future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said he will attend the EU-Africa Summit before the January Council meeting.  What is his view of President Robert Mugabe attending that summit, given the current plight of the Zimbabwean people?  Does the Taoiseach feel anything useful will be achieved by the Irish Government being represented at that summit, without in some way specifically noting the state to which President Mugabe has reduced that country?  Like all colonial histories and their aftermaths, that of Zimbabwe is complex.  However, the state of affairs in Zimbabwe is such that people are dying there.  Irish Aid is assisting but it is not meant to be a pushover for what has become an extremely harsh regime that no longer has anything good to offer its own people.  Will the Taoiseach comment on what line he will take in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton is correct in stating that I will be attending that summit meeting.  Last summer I stated my views on the Zimbabwean regime when we were discussing the EU-African Summit.  Some considerable time has been spent trying to arrange it.  In fairness to the Portuguese Presidency, which is well positioned, it put a lot of effort into trying to make it happen over the past year and a half.  I have nothing good to say about the regime in Zimbabwe and how it treats its people.  I will obviously use my time to say a few harsh things about it, as will nearly all my colleagues.</P>
        <P>To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question, there is nothing to be gained from staying away from the summit.  All our interests lie in helping Africa.  I <Col N="1781"/>have worked extremely hard to invest considerable resources in overseas development aid in recent years.  We have moved from a very small base seven or eight years ago to a very strong Irish NGO base and linkage base through the UN organisations throughout Africa.  We are helping countries with HIV-AIDS, water supply, basic infrastructure, education and health services or whatever other services are necessary.  It is in our interest to be there, to work, help and promote them and win further support for the causes these people represent.</P>
        <P>It is a pity we have to deal with the Zimbabwe situation but I do not believe we should allow Zimbabwe to spoil or dominate the proceedings.  Boycotting or staying away from the summit is an absolute waste of time and will have no value or purpose.  It is always best in respect of these issues to go and say our piece.  When Ireland held the Presidency of the European Union, it was suggested that we should stay away from a meeting to which representatives from Myanmar were coming.  It fell to me to make the Presidency statement and we were able to berate Myanmar for its activities.  It proved to be very productive and effective to have an international forum at which to speak.  Anyone staying away from the forthcoming meeting is wrong.  From the start, I said it was not something we would do.</P>

        <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>  his plans to alter the habitual residency condition as applied to the child benefit payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[32582/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Child benefit may be paid in respect of every child under the age of 16 who is ordinarily resident in the State.  Payment can be extended to the 19th birthday if the child is in education or incapable of self-support.  The benefit is paid to the qualified person with whom the child resides and the qualified person must satisfy the habitual residence condition.</P>
        <P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  It was introduced in the context of the Government&rsquo;s decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the ten new EU member states, without the transitional limitations that were imposed at that time by most of the other member states.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare <Col N="1782"/>assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland.</P>
        <P>EU regulations provide that EEA nationals who are migrant workers, that is, those who are employed or self-employed in this country, or who are receiving the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit since being in employment here, are entitled to payment of family benefit in respect of their families, including those who reside in another member state.  Under these regulations, the family members are treated as if they are habitually resident in Ireland for the purpose of child benefit.</P>
        <P>A survey was done by my Department on new child benefit claims decided between January and the end of August 2007, in which period a total of 28,542 claims was decided.  Of these 3,430, or 12%, required particular examination of the habitual residence condition.  Some 90% of these satisfied the condition and only 341, or 10%, were refused owing to its not being satisfied.  In effect, just over 1% of the total number of new child benefit claims failed to satisfy the habitual residence condition.  Those who are refused child benefit are mainly people whose claim to asylum has not yet been decided, others who have not obtained a work permit or people who have had only a minimal or no attachment to the workforce since coming to Ireland.  In the case of families in the asylum process, direct provision, funded by the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform, is available, ensuring that the rights and welfare of the children are protected.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied the habitual residence condition is achieving its intended purpose, allowing access to our social welfare schemes to persons who are genuinely and lawfully making Ireland their habitual residence while preventing unwarranted access by persons who have little or no connection with the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Minister believe it is achieving the purpose for which it was intended given, as he admitted in his reply, that the reason it was brought in was EU enlargement?  Excluding people from those countries from receiving the child benefit payment was found to be contrary to EU law.  Now those people are automatically included.  Only approximately 3,000 children of asylum seekers are affected by this.</P>
        <P>Has the Department received any legal advice on Ireland&rsquo;s position in respect of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which we signed up in 1992, and are there any contradictions, as I believe there are, in regard to articles 3 and 26 which guarantee the right of every child to benefit from social security?  Does the Minister believe it is appropriate that children living in direct provision are expected to survive &mdash; I accept their food and shelter is paid for &mdash; on &euro;9.60 per week?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Prior to the introduction of the habitual residence condition in 2004, <Col N="1783"/>full examination was given by my Department to the question of whether it was consistent with a number of international conventions to which Ireland was party, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The convention allows national legislation to prescribe the manner of provision of that benefit.  The benefit does not have to be a cash payment.  Benefit-in-kind may equally satisfy the requirement.  Therefore, direct provision is made in the case of persons in the asylum process.  That provision meets the obligations of the convention and Ireland is not obliged to pay child benefit in addition to this.  The outcome of this examination was, therefore, that the habitual residence condition was not incompatible with the provisions of the convention.</P>
        <P>We had a very good debate in the Seanad on this subject in the past couple of weeks.  I made the point, which I reiterate, that because we have a direct provision system, funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to look after the families and children, this was accepted under international law as fully meeting the obligations of the convention.  It is wrong to suggest people are being asked to survive on the minimalist cash payment.  The State is more than meeting its obligations.</P>
        <P>We must be careful because we do not want to open potential floodgates.  If there was no restriction, many more people would try to come to this country to access the welfare system, which is quite generous and is a good one by any international standards.  Although we cater for almost all people, particularly our colleagues in the European Union, having the habitual residence condition is clearly of benefit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister would have to admit that one would want to have many children to make child benefit a pull factor.  Does he accept the amount of money given to these children each week deprives them of basic necessities?  Surveys have been done on this.  Children have been unable to get school uniforms and school shoes, to participate in trips with their classmates and to get proper school lunches because of the amount of money they get under direct provision.  Has the Department accurate figures on the number involved?  </P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware of his chief appeals officer&rsquo;s criticism of the long delays in dealing with asylum appeals?  What is his view on the fact that some people, who have faced particularly long delays, have been able to avail of child benefit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I gave the Deputy detailed information in my reply.  As I said, from January to August 2007, a total of 28,542 claims were decided.  Of these, 3,430 required particular examination of the habitual residence condition.  Some 90% of these satisfied the condition and <Col N="1784"/>only 341 were refused as the condition was not satisfied.</P>
        <P>I repeat we provide direct provision.  I would be astonished if certain children were excluded under the school meals programme where that is provided.  I have no knowledge of that happening and I suspect it is not.  All children in schools where meals are provided can avail of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not provided in every school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about a balance.  It is not only about a few people, as the Deputy rightly said.  The generosity and flexibility in the system is indicative of the Irish people and the amount of resources we have put into this area.  It would be wrong to be irresponsible and to attach no conditions for people coming to this country to access what is a very generous social welfare system.</P>

        <asker>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</asker>
        <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>  the action he plans to take to eliminate consistent poverty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[32574/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The overall goal in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion, NAPinclusion, is to reduce the proportion of our population experiencing consistent poverty to between 2% and 4% by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016.  The goal is based on the trends since 2003 in the EU survey on income and living conditions, EU-SILC, conducted by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
        <P>It also involves using an updated set of indicators devised by the Economic and Social Research Institute which are considered more realistic and in keeping with living standards today compared with the indicators used for the earlier national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
        <P>The latest results from EU-SILC, released last week, indicate that the rate of consistent poverty in the population in 2006, using the new measure, was 6.5%, down from 8.2% in 2003.  The achievement of this goal is dependent on the policies to be pursued over the next ten years.</P>
        <P>These are detailed in the NAPinclusion and the NDP which contains 12 high level strategic goals in key priority areas supported by over 150 more detailed targets and actions.  It is based on a life cycle approach designed to achieve greater co-ordination of policies and their implementation in relation to children, people of working age, older people and people with disabilities.  Increasing participation in employment is at the core of the strategic approach as it remains the main route out of poverty to a decent standard of living.  Those most at risk of consistent poverty among those of working age live in households where there is no one in employment, or if they are in employment, they are on a low income.</P><Col N="1785"/>
        <P>The majority of children experiencing poverty also live in such households.  A key focus of policies in the NAPinclusion is to remove, as far as practicable, remaining disincentives to obtaining employment in the social welfare system and obstacles to entitlement to other services.  Proposals to achieve this are being developed in my Department, with reference especially to lone parents and parents in larger families.</P>

        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>A second overall strand is the further development of an activation approach involving case management.  This includes ensuring that those not in the workforce have access to appropriate education, training, help with job search and services such as child care.  Generous income support is being provided for children and additional education supports are being targeted at children living in disadvantaged areas.  Provision is also made in the NAPinclusion to provide income support and to improve access to and the quality of essential services, such as health, education and housing, especially for those for whom employment is not an option.</P>
        <P>In the case of older people, the aim is to ensure that they have an adequate income and access to services.  In the period since 2003 the proportion of older people below the EU at risk of poverty threshold has more than halved from 29.8% to 13.6% in 2006.  A further consequence has been the reduction in the rate of consistent poverty from 3.1% in 2005 to 2.2% in 2006.  In effect, therefore, the 2012 goal for reducing consistent poverty has already been achieved for older people.</P>
        <P>The causes of consistent poverty are multi-faceted and there is no single answer for the many diverse groups in that position.  Achieving the overall goal will require not just effective and well resourced policies but also a significant degree of co-ordination among all service providers.  The plans provide for this approach.  I am confident that from the strong backing and determination being provided by Government and working with all the relevant stakeholders, this ambitious goal will be met over the next five and ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept last week&rsquo;s EU-SILC figures are a serious indictment of the Government&rsquo;s record in recent years?  According to those figures, Ireland has the third highest rate of people at risk of poverty.  Does the Minister accept Ireland is still a shockingly unequal society?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Does he accept the figures which show the rates of poverty are static?  Last year 6.9% of people were living in poverty while the figure for the previous year was 7%. <Col N="1786"/> Little or no progress is being made on tackling the rates of poverty in our society.  After a decade of so-called prosperity, why are 293,000 people still living in poverty?  Given the targets set in the national anti-poverty strategy, what is the Minister&rsquo;s analysis of that figure?  Why are so many people still living in poverty when there has been such economic prosperity in the past decade?  More importantly, what does the Minister intend to do to reach the targets he has set? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The measurement used is utterly meaningless and I will explain why.  EU survey results for 2006 are not yet available from all EU countries.  However, in the case of Ireland, given the progress being achieved in tackling poverty, it is expected that our comparative position should improve.  Ireland has regularly pointed out the limitations of the use of at risk of poverty measures.  They may well change it because it has become so meaningless.  </P>
        <P>First, it is not suited to making comparisons between countries at different stages of economic development with different living standards.  This can yield illogical results, some of which have just been put on the record by Deputy Shortall.  For example, less developed countries have lower at risk of poverty rates than Ireland.  Bulgaria is shown to have an overall at risk of poverty rate that is 1% below the EU average of 16%, while Ireland is 4% above the EU average rate at<?oasys _jy ?>20%.  However, Ireland&rsquo;s at risk of poverty income threshold, adjusted for purchasing power, is &euro;18,909 for a family of two adults and two children.  This is just over four times greater than the figure used in Bulgaria, which is &euro;4,269.</P>
        <P>Second, it masks the reality of the situation in Ireland where we have had significant economic growth and where increases in household income have outstripped even substantial increases in the incomes of those dependent on social welfare or on low wages.  This is exactly what has happened in this country.  People are now significantly better off in real terms but at risk of poverty figures clearly do not reflect this fact.  To be honest, I do not think anybody gives any credibility to the fact that, on this measurement, we are supposedly the third worst country in Europe.  It simply is not true.  Quite frankly, the measurement is a nonsense and is meaningless to every country.  It does nothing to promote the agenda.  If one looks at the figures I have given, I think we would all agree that suggesting that Bulgaria is better than the EU average is a nonsense.  The way the measurements are used at the moment come up with what I have just described as an illogical and, quite frankly, ridiculous conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Deputy Shortall have a supplementary question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the equivalent of shooting the messenger.  The argument about the way of measuring poverty in this country is <Col N="1787"/>over.  Whatever disagreements may have existed about it in the past, we know now that all of those groups working in this area, including research organisations and indeed the Minister&rsquo;s Department, accept the way of measuring poverty in this country.  </P>
        <P>What these figures show is that in recent years where the Government has targeted poverty among older people through changes and improvements in the social welfare system, that has worked.  However, the glaring problem that remains is the question of child poverty.  Does the Minister accept that 11% of children are living in poverty and that this represents some 96,000 children?  One in nine children under the age of 14 is living in poverty.</P>
        <P>I concede that there has been very welcome success in tackling poverty among older people through welfare measures.  Is the Minister now prepared to put the same kind of focus on and target resources in the same way in respect of children at risk of poverty?  By any standards, having 96,000 children living in poverty amid the prosperity in this country is entirely unacceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Deputy shifted her focus and argued for dealing with the real picture where there are children living in consistent poverty.  There is no question about that and we have been dealing with this issue.  The figures are coming down.  That is why under the NAP inclusion plan, the national development plan and Towards 2016, we want to eliminate it within that timeframe.  That is something into which we should all put our energies and efforts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>As a point of information, last week&rsquo;s figures show that the rate of child poverty is increasing in this country.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I want, again, to deal with what we know to be the factual position as opposed to some statistical analysis.  I pointed out to the people who bombarded me with statistics that we are actually dealing with real people here.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, 96,000 of them. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Frankly, I am not interested in dealing with people who are using all sorts of very strange measurements to come up with certain figures.  The fact is that we are targeting a huge amount of our resources to deal with children in poverty.  In respect of the two big groups, children in families where there is unemployment and the children of single parents, there are two pilot schemes being carried out at the moment, one in Coolock and Kilkenny, which involve all the services working together to try and move&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy wanted an answer to the question.  It is not about the amount of money one simply gives somebody; it is about using the services to get them out of the situation and into employment, which is what we are doing &mdash; just so the Deputy knows what the strategy is.  </P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Rent supplement is administered on my behalf by the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur.  These rent limits are set at levels that enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  Household size is taken into account and the objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation, having regard to the size of the household.</P>
        <P>Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, as we learned in the past, leading to a more general rise in rent levels.  This, in turn, would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with a particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes, including people in low-wage employment.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements, the Health Service Executive may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent levels.  This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.</P>
        <P>In January 2007, a review of the maximum levels of rent which a person may incur and still be eligible to receive a rent supplement was completed.  The purpose of the review was to inform the process of setting new limits, applicable from January 2007 until 30 June 2008.  The review included consultation with the HSE, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Central Statistics Office, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and volun<Col N="1789"/>tary agencies working in this area.  This process ensured that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country and that they will continue to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Additional information not given in the floor of the House. </i></P>
<P>Arising from the review, rent limits were adjusted upwards, from January 2007, for a number of household types in 14 counties.</P>
        <P>There are currently over 59,000 rent supplements in payment, of which some 24,000 have been awarded since the current rent limits were set in January 2007.  This demonstrates that rented accommodation is available within the current rent limits.  I intend to have all limits reviewed next year with a view to implementing any revision found to be necessary from 1 July 2008.</P>
        <P>The fact that there are over 59,000 tenants receiving rent supplement suggests that payment in arrears is not causing difficulty.  Given the scale of cost involved and the Government&rsquo;s other social provision priorities, I have no plans to change the current arrangement.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that the cost to the Exchequer of paying rent supplement in advance would be in the region of &euro;33 million.  Changing the payment arrangements would have to be considered within a budgetary context and in the light of resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister outline any proposed changes in respect of the area as a result of all this consultation?  The Minister will be aware that there are about 4,500 people in bedsits, the majority of whom are in Dublin city centre.  They were described by the director of Threshold as poor quality, damp, vermin-infested firetraps, lacking basic necessities.  The preliminary findings of Threshold&rsquo;s access housing unit&rsquo;s survey revealed that the biggest reason that landlords will not accept rent supplement is because it is paid in arrears, rather than in advance.  Are there proposals to change that so that it will be paid in advance?  It is clear that it is the biggest stumbling block.  Landlords are looking for the deposit and the first month&rsquo;s rent upfront and if they can get someone who will pay that, they will pick them rather than the person who is on rent supplement.</P>
        <P>Where a person makes an application for rent supplement and is refused, it takes about six weeks to assess the application.  This effectively means that if the person does not get it, he or she owes the landlord six weeks&rsquo; rent, which forces him or her back into homelessness.  In light of the fact that between 5,000 and 6,000 people are homeless in this country, does the Minister intend to make any of these changes?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1790"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said earlier, the review for this year has been completed.  Clearly, there are issues within the system at which I would like to look.  The system that is in place will run up to June next year.  In the meantime, we will look at all of the issues, some of which were raised by Deputy Enright and some of which I am aware of, having interacted with many of these people who come to my clinic, as they do to those of Deputy Enright and everybody else.  </P>
        <P>What we are trying to do in the system is to genuinely support and help people who are in need of rent supplement and to use the system in such a way that nobody, in effect, should be homeless.  That is the reality.  I agree with the Deputy that the quality of some of the properties people are renting is appalling.  People should not be given rent supplement for such properties.  I was in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Deputy might recall that I set up the Private Residential Tenancies Board and brought the legislation through the House.  I would like to have a more full-on system.  As the Deputy is aware, landlords must notify the Private Residential Tenancies Board of the tenancies involved.  I have been alerted to some loopholes in that system whereby that has been avoided in a number of cases.  If it needs legislation to do that, apart from just policy change or a shift in emphasis, we should introduce it.</P>
        <P>The other major change has been moving people from the Department of Social and Family Affairs system to local authority housing.  That is beginning to gather momentum.  Many people who were on rental schemes, supported by my Department, are now in housing, having been housed in social housing by local authorities, but there are aspects with which I am not happy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Minister that there are 43,000 low income families on housing lists, compared to 23,000 in 1991.  The Minister states that the review has been carried out and will not come into force until June.  Will he inform the House if any of the questions to which I refer will be dealt with when changes are made in June?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister intend to review rent caps?  If the limit is &euro;600 one cannot add &euro;10 or &euro;15 per week to the rent and this forces the tenant into a poorer standard of house, below that limit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be wrong to provide a specific answer seven months in advance of what may happen because that would have a major effect on the market and the people with whom we are both trying to deal.  When the review, which will involve voluntary organisations, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and various Departments, is complete&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>  if the national carers strategy will be published before the end of 2007 as stated in the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and An Agreed Programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[32584/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is a priority of the Government and has been so since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for the carers allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.  Recent reforms of the scheme allow people in receipt of certain social welfare payments, who are also providing full-time care and attention to a person, to retain their main welfare payment and receive a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.  The amount paid will vary depending on their means.  </P>
        <P>One of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement Towards 2016 is the development of a national carers strategy and this commitment is reiterated in the programme for Government.  One of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs Report on the Position of Full Time Carers, which was published in 2003, was that such a strategy should be developed.  I am pleased that we are now in a position to act on that recommendation.</P>
        <P>The strategy will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community.  While social welfare supports for carers will clearly be a key issue in the strategy, other issues such as access to respite and other services, education, training and employment will also feature strongly.  Co-operation between relevant Departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.  For that reason, all relevant Departments and agencies will be involved in the strategy and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners.</P>
        <P>My officials have been in discussions with their colleagues in other relevant Departments to decide on the best approach to the development of the strategy.  In view of the need to ensure that appropriate arrangements and structures are in place to support its development, it will not be possible to complete the strategy by the end of this year, as had been intended originally.</P>
        <P>An interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, is being established to develop the strategy and to manage <Col N="1792"/>the consultation process.  I expect the strategy to be completed by summer of 2008.  The recent improvements in the income supports available from this Department represent major improvements in supports available to carers in the community.  The development of a national carers strategy provides us with an opportunity to build further on these improvements and to consider other areas where progress can be made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Government fail to prioritise the national carers strategy and meet its commitment in the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and in the programme for Government, which was only decided six months ago?  It promised the carers strategy would be developed by the end of 2007.  There are 27 days remaining and the Minister has made it clear this commitment will not be met.  Will the Minister guarantee that the strategy will be published by summer of next year?  Will specific commitments be made and quantified in terms of cost?  This is what carers groups want.  They do not necessarily want a glossy book to launch the strategy but set timeframes.</P>
        <P>Will there be a focus on young carers as part of the national carers strategy?  This is of concern to everyone.  I do not expect the Minister to tell me what will be in the budget tomorrow but maybe he can give us a taste of whether the commitments made to carers in the programme for Government, such as the increases in eligibility, the doubling of the means test respite care grant and the extension of the fuel allowance, will be met?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Much as Deputy Enright might like me to do so, I cannot put the budget on the record of the House this afternoon.  The development of a strategy for carers, which has happened over the past few years, resources and major income supports are very important.  I, like Deputy Enright, have met many carers throughout the country who say that the quality of their lives has been transformed in recent years, not just because of the financial supports but because of the easing of the conditions by which one can access support.  The process must be inclusive and that is the way carers want it.  I have listened to what the groups want and they know what the Government is doing.  They are supportive of the approach taken in the recent past.</P>
        <P>These issues are on the table.  It was not possible to have the strategy ready by the end of the year, a target that was unrealistic.  I have instructed those involved in the process to finalise the strategy in the next six months.  I agree with Deputy Enright that we do not need a glossy brochure to set out the strategy &mdash; some targets are obvious.  Much of it is set out in the NAP inclusion and Towards 2016.  It is a question of managing resources to get to the point where people will see continued improvement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>A memorandum of understanding between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland concerning co-operation and mutual assistance in the administration of social security schemes was signed on 9 October 2000.  The memorandum provides for the establishment of a management committee, which meets several times a year and oversees and directs the programme of mutual co-operation and assistance.  The operations forum directed by the committee meets once per quarter to co-operate and assist in facilitating the investigation of social security benefit fraud with a cross-Border dimension.  It undertakes individual fraud investigations and larger projects.  It is also committed to sharing best practice in counter fraud operations. </P>
        <P>The report of the operations forum for the year ended March 2007 states that six projects undertaken in that year resulted in seven prosecutions and a further 15 cases being considered for prosecution.  Under the memorandum of understanding, considerable benefit has been derived by my Department in preventing cross-Border fraud.  Procedures are in place to deal with ongoing referrals, fraud and non-fraud through a single point of contact in each jurisdiction.  Referrals are made for a variety of reasons, for example, to establish whether there is an existing claim in payment in either jurisdiction, to establish contribution details for a pension or to ascertain payment details as part of an investigation for a means-tested payment.</P>
        <P>In the year ended March 2007 my Department received a total of 700 inquiries from Northern Ireland and 100 inquiries from Great Britain.  Belfast operations intelligence unit is the single point of contact for non-fraud referrals or inquiries for my Department, relating to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, incapacity benefit and income support.  This unit carried out a total of 4,000 checks in the year ended March 2007.  Fraud inquiries are dealt with on a case-by-case basis, by fax, to the national intelligence unit in Folkstone.  Similar arrangements are also in place for fraud and non-fraud inquiries, with the pensions service, Newcastle-upon-Tyne for pensions and the disability benefit unit, Blackpool for disabled living allowance.</P>
    
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>In addition, in July 2004, a social welfare inspector was assigned to the Garda National <Col N="1794"/>Immigration Bureau to assist my Department and the bureau in the investigation of social welfare fraud and breaches of the immigration Acts, to provide information and intelligence and to promote the benefits of a multi-agency approach to immigration and employment law enforcement.  A second inspector was assigned to the bureau in August 2006.</P>
        <P>A joint control exercise is undertaken periodically at airports and ports in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  It involves personnel from the Garda National Immigration Bureau, my Department and the United Kingdom immigration service.  Social welfare inspectors assigned to the Garda National Immigration Bureau conducted inquiries into 600 social welfare customers in 2006, achieving savings of &euro;3.5 million, and 415 social welfare customers up to the end of November 2007, achieving savings of &euro;3.61 million.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will be aware of recent media reports in respect of an allegation of fraud in his constituency.  That is why I raised this question and I do not suggest that cross-border fraud is the only type that occurs.</P>
        <P>The Minister provided figures on prosecutions but I am not sure whether they relate solely to this country or to a group of countries.  How many of the prosecutions in question relate to cross-border fraud involving Ireland and other countries?  The Department made savings of &euro;375 million last year in respect of anti-fraud measures.  How much of that money related to internal fraud and how much related to fraud of a cross-border nature?  Is such information readily available to the Minister?  What steps has he taken to consult his counterparts in other EU countries, particularly those from which a large number of people have come to Ireland to live and work, in the context of putting in place measures to ensure that payments are only made in one state?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question was specific to Northern Ireland and, therefore, all the information I provided relates to cross-Border fraud involving people from that jurisdiction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The question relates to cross-border fraud and to EU borders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There has obviously been a misunderstanding because the information <Col N="1795"/>I provided relates specifically to people from Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The Deputy&rsquo;s supplementary questions related to all EU borders.  There is a memorandum of understanding in place and cases are continually being investigated.  The seven prosecutions and the 15 pending relate specifically to fraud involving people from the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the issues that have arisen in my constituency.  The matter was investigated and I provided information in respect of it.  When the data was broken down, and even though a substantial overall number were involved, it appears that only three people were either in breach, to a certain degree, or their cases fell into a somewhat grey area.</P>
        <P>There are issues that arise in respect of the broad spectrum.  In an EU sense, openness and the necessity to exchange information are crucial.  I am not sure of the exact position because I have not yet attended a Council meeting since becoming Minister.  However, this will be one of the issues with which we will deal.  Reporting is continual among the relevant units here and in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest>  when he will end the cohabitation rule for lone parents; and the justification for delaying reform in this area.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[32184/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government discussion paper, &ldquo;Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents&rdquo;, put forward proposals for the introduction of a new social assistance payment for lone parents and other low income families with young children.  It also proposed a range of additional services, including the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities, the extension of the national employment action plan, focused provision of child care and improved information services.  Under the proposals, the contingency of lone parenthood would no longer exist.  The one parent family payment would, therefore, be abolished.  Instead, a new payment would be made to all parents &mdash; living alone or with a partner &mdash; with young children and on low incomes.</P>
        <P>As I recently reported to the House, the development of any new scheme to support low-income parents can only be introduced when the necessary co-ordinated supports and services are put in place by other Departments and agencies.  This is why the non-income recommendations in the discussion paper are being tested in Coolock <Col N="1796"/>and Kilkenny.  These tests are focused on identifying and resolving any practical and administrative issues that may arise in advance of the scheme being introduced.  They are scheduled to run until the end of the year and a report will then be made to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion.  Various reports have already been delivered to the committee.</P>
        <P>The tests to which I refer will allow for operational and logistical co-ordination between the relevant Departments and agencies to be considered and will facilitate the development of the policy and operational details of the new scheme and accompanying supports.  Although the exact terms of the new scheme have not been finalised, the objective is to ensure that the necessary financial and other supports are in place to assist families towards improved employment prospects and that all disincentives to work will be kept to a minimum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is more than 18 months since the Department published proposals on providing supports for lone parents and it appears that little or no progress has been made in implementing these.  The question relates specifically to the proposal to end the cohabitation rule.  Does the Minister accept that it makes no sense for the State &mdash; as it is currently doing in respect of social welfare and tax policies &mdash; to actively encourage parents to live apart?  If the answer is yes, why has he not taken action before now to end such behaviour and to enable lone parents to enjoy greater flexibility in the context of their family arrangements?  Surely it makes sense for the State to remove any obstacles to parents living together.  At present, there is a ridiculous situation whereby parents are far better off living apart than they are cohabiting or getting married.  That is not justifiable or sustainable as a social policy.  Why is the Minister taking so long to alter this ridiculous situation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not necessarily state that people are far better off if they are not married and are living alone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>They are better off.  The figures prove that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s principal point regarding the cohabitation rule.  The latter was based, clearly and historically, on a purely financial consideration that took no account of the welfare of all involved in what would constitute a family unit.  A child who is involved with both parents &mdash; regardless of whether they are married or single &mdash; enjoys a better upbringing and will have a better chance to become a more rounded individual.  That is not to say that a child who happens to be in a one-parent family cannot achieve all of those things.  However, the commonly held view among the various agencies and people to whom I have <Col N="1797"/>spoken is that involving fathers &mdash; most of these children are raised by their mothers &mdash; and allowing them to cohabitate without penalising mothers in the context of the benefits they receive, represents a far better way to proceed.  I intend to progress this issue.</P>
        <P>The Deputy raised several other points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take further supplementary questions from Members so the Minister may expand on his reply later.  I call Deputy Enright.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Many people in the agencies involved in trying to resolve difficulties in this area want to ensure that the other services will buy into this change and that it will not all take the form of a simple payment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am anxious to allow Deputies to contribute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what we must achieve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>What level of priority has the Government afforded to this matter?  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor announced this change in December 2005.  We have almost reached the second anniversary of that announcement.  At the time, it was expected that the change would be introduced during the following year.  Does the Minister accept his predecessor&rsquo;s assertion that the aim of the review was to help people escape the poverty trap?  If the latter is the case, why are will still discussing the matter two years later while people remain within that poverty trap?  Does the Minister agree that family formation will not be facilitated while this matter remains on the long finger?  Will he indicate a clear date by which we can expect real changes?</P>
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If it was merely a matter of changing the cohabitation rule, we could do it tomorrow morning.  However, it is not possible to proceed in that way because there are huge knock-on effects, involving many other aspects of the social welfare system, which must be taken into consideration.  I want to get agreement between the various parties to the different perspectives, particularly those who come from an especially narrow perspective to represent a point of view about a particular issue.</P>
        <P>I accept that we must change the system.  I would like the process to reach a conclusion very quickly.  I would be happy to introduce legislation to deal not only with cohabitation but with the wide range of issues that surround it.  I hope those involved in the process and in consultation can reach agreement.  There are different perspectives on various aspects of this.  Nevertheless, I fundamentally agree with the substantive point made by Deputies Shortall and Enright, namely, that <Col N="1798"/>the existing cohabitation rule is wrong and must be abolished.  The quicker we abolish it the better.</P>

The habitual residence condition does not introduce any distinctions based on citizenship, nationality or any other factor, and it applies equally to all claimants for the relevant schemes.</P>
        <P>EU regulations provide that EEA nationals who are migrant workers, that is those who are employed or self-employed in this country, or those who are receiving the Irish jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit since being in employment here, are entitled to payment of family benefits.  EU regulations also provide for the payment of supplementary welfare allowance, including rent supplement, to migrant workers.  Former workers who continue to be treated as workers for this latter purpose include those who have been temporarily laid off because of illness or those who have become unemployed, are genuinely seeking work and have registered with F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>The EU regulations permit a residence condition to be applied in the case of other assistance schemes, such as the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or the non-contributory state pension.  The protections afforded are specifically for migrant workers, not for those who move between member states for other reasons, or who have failed to obtain genuine or effective work since their arrival in the host state.  These regulations apply equally to nationals of all member states.  Therefore, although differences will arise in the circumstances of each individual case, there is no distinction in principle in the application of the habitual residence condition between nationals of the older member states and nationals of the newer member states.</P>
        <P>The operation of the condition was reviewed by my Department in 2006 and the report of the review was published early this year.  The full content of the review may be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.welfare.ie</i>. It is not proposed to introduce any changes to the current policy in this regard, as the original reason for the policy is still valid.</P>

        <Quest>  if his atten<Col N="1799"/>tion has been drawn to the fact that the general public can not get through to the child benefit phone number in Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The child benefit office is responsible for the administration of the child benefit scheme and the early child care supplement scheme which my Department administers for the Office of the Minister for Children.  There are over 570,000 customers, and 1.1 million children are currently receiving payments totalling over &euro;2.6 billion in 2007.</P>
        <P>The child benefit office operates a phone service using a lo-call number which allows customers to contact the office from anywhere in the country for the cost of a local call.  The phone service in the child benefit office is staffed from 9.15 a.m. to 5.15 p.m.  A total of six staff is dedicated to phone answering duties.  With the increase in the child benefit customer base in recent years and the introduction of the early child care supplement last year, there has been an increase of 75% in the number of phone calls received in the office since 2005.  The number of calls received in 2005 was 187,000, which increased to 281,000 in 2006 and is estimated to reach 330,000 this year.</P>
        <P>To date this year, over 221,000 calls have been answered in the child benefit section, representing around 75% of all calls to the section.  At non-peak times, that is, weeks in which there is no payday, the percentage of calls answered is regularly in excess of 90%.  On certain days, particularly before and after the paydays for both child benefit and early child care supplement, the level of phone calls received increases significantly and this can lead to delays in calls being answered.  Up to four additional staff are allocated to phone-answering duties during these peak periods to minimise the waiting times experienced.</P>
        <P>On the day the Deputy reports difficulty in contacting the office, a total of 1,950 calls were received, almost double the normal daily volume.  This surge in calls was primarily due to the fact that child benefit had been paid the previous day.  Technical difficulties were also being experienced at this time and this had a negative impact on the call answering service.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s strategy is to continue to develop our customer channels, namely, phone, call-in, and online services, in order to provide a quality customer service whereby customers can choose the channel that best suits them for particular inquiries.  To this end the telephony infrastructure has been upgraded over the past year to support this programme of developments and a new phone management system will be installed in my Department&rsquo;s Letterkenny office in 2008. <Col N="1800"/> My Department is also currently engaged in a tendering process to procure a text messaging facility which will be deployed in 2008.  This will facilitate the acknowledgement of claims, in order to reduce the need for customers to contact us by phone, as well as providing an additional channel for forms requests.  The position regarding the levels of phone calls and the ability to respond is being constantly monitored to ensure disruption to the service is kept to a minimum.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Monday week I spent one hour and five minutes on the phone to Donegal without getting a reply.  I was put through to answering machines with Irish accents, Polish accents and other accents, but I could not get through to get information for a constituent.  If I am in that position, in what position are members of the general public?  This problem happens with most public services nowadays.  We get answering machines but no reply nor anyone to deal with problems.  I cannot understand how the public puts up with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not seek to justify what happened to the Deputy or to anyone else.  It is utterly unacceptable and I have made that clear in the Department.  We have tried to put extra staff in there to cope with the volumes on certain days.  It appears that on the particular day the Deputy called, there were technical problems with the phone system which compounded the problem.  I hope that if the Deputy tries again, he will not have a similar experience.  I am sure he will test the system again and I would be interested to know how he gets on.  The information available to me is that people are getting responses, although the number of calls goes through the roof on the day before and the day after payments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated that he has four extra staff available on some of those days.  Would it not make more sense to have those people working in that section on a longer-term basis?  Many of these people will be calling from payphones or mobile phones, so even with a lo-call number, waiting for an hour will be quite expensive for them.  Can the Minister re-examine this to ensure there are sufficient staff to deal with very genuine queries from people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I put down the question to alleviate the problem for the general public.  It is alright for public representatives, as they have other lines to call.  However, this was a particular case and I tried to call from my office in Galway.  The caller first hears a 30 second answering machine outlining the various options.  It is far more important for members of the public to speak to somebody on the other line than to listen to an answering machine telling <Col N="1801"/>them to press one or another button and getting no response at the end of all of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have experienced the same frustration myself, but it does not just apply to the public sector.  It also applies to many of the private companies providing services in this country.  I have given up trying to get through to some major companies in this country just to do my own personal business.  It drives me absolutely nuts to be told to press one button or another by an answering machine.  That is not a good service and it should not be tolerated in either the public or the private sector.  It is my objective that every single member of the Department be as productive as possible and use our human resources for the maximum benefit of the public.  It is a huge service Department that deals with over 1 million customers every week.  There are many cases where it has been highly commended for the service it has provided.  We want to resolve any problems and where we can improve the service, we will do so.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 131 together. </P>
<P>Information on poverty levels, deprivation and social exclusion is provided in the EU survey on income and living conditions, which is conducted on an annual basis by the Central Statistics Office.  The most recent results were published on 28 November and refer to 2006.  Data from the survey indicate that the overall consistent poverty rate has reduced from 8.2 % in 2003, when the survey was first introduced, to 6.5 % in 2006.  This figure refers to an updated version of the consistent poverty measure, which was developed by the ESRI.  The revised measure is more realistic and in keeping with living standards today than the indicators considered appropriate for the earlier national anti-poverty plans.  It forms the basis for the overall poverty reduction goal in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016, which is to reduce the number of persons experiencing consistent poverty to between 2% and 4% by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016.  The recent survey results show that we are on track to meet this target.</P><Col N="1802"/>
        <P>The NAP inclusion plan sets out a wide-ranging and comprehensive programme of actions over the period to 2016 to continue to reduce poverty and achieve the overall consistent poverty goal.  The plan adopts a lifecycle stage approach, in line with Towards 2016, with specific, measurable goals set for each group &mdash; children, people of working age, older people and people with disabilities and their communities.  The plan contains 12 high-level strategic goals in key priority areas supported by over 150 targets and actions, with a programme of action to meet them during the period 2007-16.  It has a particular focus on the effective delivery and implementation of quality public services for each stage of the lifecycle.  The targets cover the broad spectrum of services including education, health and long-term care, housing, income support, employment supports, early childhood development and care, transport, and sport and culture.  The first annual social inclusion report, launched last month, shows that progress is being made and that social inclusion targets are on track for 2006-07.</P>
        <P>The continued reduction and eventual elimination of poverty remains a top priority for the Government and the programme for Government prioritises the objectives of the NAP inclusion plan.  To this end, the Government continues to support the office for social inclusion which has a key co-ordinating role in the social inclusion agenda.  The office, which is located within my Department, has overall responsibility for the development, monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the NAP inclusion plan and on the social inclusion chapter of the national development plan.  This includes co-ordinating the social inclusion process across Departments, agencies, regional and local Government and implementing key support functions, including the use of poverty impact assessments by Government Departments, local authorities and statutory agencies in the development of policies and programmes.  The office is currently working with Government Departments on implementing revised guidelines for poverty impact assessment.  The office also has a co-ordinating role in supporting research on poverty and its causes and on the development of a data strategy to better support measurement of the outcomes being achieved under the two plans.</P>
        <P>My aim, in working with Government to deliver the NAP inclusion programme over the coming years, is to build on the significant and visible progress already made in reducing poverty and material deprivation and to deliver real improvements in living standards and well-being for the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The survey to which the Minister refers shows that consistent poverty has remained static at approximately 7% for the past two years.  What does the Minister think are the principal reasons that little or no progress has <Col N="1803"/>been made in reducing that rate?  Does he accept the real scandal is that 96,000 children live in poverty and that little or no progress has been made on reducing that number?  Will the Minister guarantee that in tomorrow&rsquo;s budget and his work over the coming year he will target that unacceptable level of child poverty and put the same attention and focus into tackling that problem as he put into tackling poverty among pensioners?  I give him credit for tackling that problem successfully and reducing the rate.  The key poverty issue must now be children.  Can the Minister guarantee he will give that his full attention in the coming year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in a position to disclose tomorrow&rsquo;s budget.  One child in consistent poverty is one too many, let alone 96,000.  Deputy Shortall raised an important point and it gets to the nub of the matter.  The issue for many agencies and voluntary organisations is not just about money from my Department.  There is a range of issues on how the agencies operate and how we can get unemployed people from families that have been consistently unemployed and single and lone parents into the workforce.  Many voluntary agencies are talking about this matter.  As I said in my response, that is being worked through to target the resources, including human resources in my Department working with the agencies to interact on a one-to-one basis with these people, which is a huge undertaking.  We aim to explain how these people are there and how we can get them to move on, particularly into some form of employment.  This offers them the best way out of poverty and can have a significant impact on how they see the world and their lives, how they live their lives and the quality of their and their children&rsquo;s lives.  Over the past number of years, the Government has put significant, targeted resources into working with all concerned to achieve that.  We will continue to build on that in tomorrow&rsquo;s budget.</P>

	<P>It gives me no satisfaction to have to raise again matters about which the Taoiseach spoke yesterday.  However, it appears the credibility of the Taoiseach as leader of the country is being torn to shreds by contradictions emerging from statements he made here and elsewhere.  The Irish people do not give two hoots whether the Taoiseach and Mr. Padraic O&rsquo;Connor were friends, but it matters to them that they are not taken for fools.  The Taoiseach can accept as a fact that a &euro;5,000 donation ended up in one of his personal bank accounts.  Could the Taoiseach clarify three important issues as much for me as for anybody else?</P>
        <P>On the national airwaves, the Taoiseach told Mr. Bryan Dobson of RTE that Mr. O&rsquo;Connor accepted that he took the money only on the basis that it was a loan, a debt of honour, and that he would repay it with interest.  The Taoiseach told the Mahon tribunal that he thanked Mr. O&rsquo;Connor for this money.  The Taoiseach told Mr. Dobson on RTE that he offered to repay the money to Mr. O&rsquo;Connor.  Those are three statements the Taoiseach made in the full knowledge of what he was saying.  I have the quotes and the references here if the Taoiseach wants me to read them out.  I am sure he does not.  Does the Taoiseach still say he personally thanked Mr. <Col N="1805"/>O&rsquo;Connor for this money?  Does he still say he told Mr. O&rsquo;Connor he would accept the money only as a loan?  Does he still say he offered to repay the money?  These are three questions directly relevant to three statements the Taoiseach made.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach was asked yesterday, and he commented freely, about a false invoice.  I have the quotation where he said he thanked Mr. O&rsquo;Connor in January.  Does the Taoiseach still accept that this was a debt of honour and a loan that he said he would repay with interest?  The Taoiseach must return to the tribunal to answer more questions.  Fundamentally, the equivalent of &euro;300,000 in today&rsquo;s terms, found its way into personal accounts controlled by him.  The sad fact is that the public has not been given credible explanations as to how that happened, why, who paid it and for what reason.  As I said earlier, the Irish are a forgiving people, but they should not be taken for fools.  If there was a simple explanation for this, I am sure it would have been given long ago.  </P>
        <P>I ask Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach and leader of the country to spit it all out, warts and all, so that at least the people have the facts.  If this goes on, his credibility as the leader of our country will be torn to shreds.  People do not believe him.  They cannot assimilate the contradictory statements about these payments to the Taoiseach, over this 18-month to two-year period. <Col N="1806"/> In his own interest, as the leader of his party and the country, before his credibility is torn to shreds, I ask him to clarify, once and for all, the background to the equivalent of &euro;300,000 paid to him, who paid it, where it came from and why.  He might save everybody, including himself, a great deal of trouble.</P>

	<P>It is important I point out to Deputy Kenny what while recognising as Chair the necessity for political accountability, and its importance for any democracy, it is important to recognise that this House has delegated certain matters to the tribunal which is engaged in a public inquiry into very serious matters.  It is not possible for me as Chair, to allow the proceedings of that tribunal to be replicated here while recognising, nonetheless, the need to ensure that there is political accountability.  In other words, it would not, for example, be proper for a question to be asked or answered as to the veracity or otherwise of a given statement which was made at the tribunal.  We cannot go into that type of detail here and Deputy Kenny will understand that as well as I do.  I call on the Taoiseach. </P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach accept that what we have heard over the past week further undermines his credibility and erodes his authority?  We heard Mr. Padraic O&rsquo;Connor last week giving sworn evidence which tears apart the carefully constructed accounts of <Col N="1808"/>the dig-outs that the Taoiseach gave to Brian Dobson on RTE in September 2006.  We have heard claims from the former chairman of the national lottery that as Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach approved that body&rsquo;s involvement in the plan to build a casino on the Phoenix Park racecourse at a time when he publicly opposed the project.  It was also at a time while the main Fianna F&aacute;il fundraiser &mdash; and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s personal fundraiser &mdash; accepted a donation from one of the promoters of the project, coincidentally in dollars, in Manchester. </P>
        <P>It appears to me that the Taoiseach is engulfed in all of this at present.  All of this is taking place at a time when the country is facing very significant problems.  We hear today that 500 people are to lose their jobs in Galway.  There is a continuing problem with cancer services.  We had the National Women&rsquo;s Council outside the D&aacute;il today and there was a big meeting of the ICA last week, on cancer care services.  There was a shooting in Finglas over the weekend, showing us that gun crime has not gone away.  Also, there are reports of a decline in Government revenues and a tightening in the economy.</P>
        <P>What proportion of time is the Taoiseach now giving to defending himself, as distinct from addressing the many problems the country is facing, which require his attention as Head of Government?  Specifically, will he tell the House the dates on which he is due to appear before the Mahon tribunal again?  I understand he is due to give evidence to the tribunal before Christmas.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House what dates he is due to give evidence before the Mahon tribunal and for how many days he will be preparing for this?  Does the Taoiseach expect to be before the Mahon tribunal again after Christmas?  On how many occasions does he expect to be back before the Mahon tribunal before it concludes hearing evidence on the module it is now investigating?</P>

	<P>I do not agree with Deputy Gilmore that it affects my credibility or authority, or that I am engulfed in anything.  As I do most days, I spent recent days preparing and working with my colleagues on the annual budget which will be announced tomorrow.  The answer to the question on time is that I did not time the press conference yesterday but perhaps six or seven minutes is the amount of time I spent on it.  I am in the tribunal whenever the learned gentlemen of the tribunal ask me to be there on whatever dates are fixed.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore is correct to state there are a lot of serious issues and if he had raised any of them I was prepared to answer them as I have been involved in briefings, but obviously he opted to raise an issue about 1994.</P>

        <P>I was answering the question about the casino, but perhaps the Deputy does not want to hear it.

The point being forcibly made and the story that ran for two days in a national newspaper is that I gave personal approval to some process, which had nothing wrong with it, about a disclosure agreement or a confidential agreement.  I did not do that.  It was done subsequently in 1998 but there was absolutely nothing wrong with it.</P>
        <P>As regards meeting people, I was only one of a privileged number of people that met, but there was nothing wrong with that either.  People inside and outside the House who try to state that <Col N="1813"/>should at least have the common decency to retract their stories.</P>

I am unsure whether that has been approved in respect of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Irrespective of the content, which will be of the utmost importance to people, tomorrow&rsquo;s budget cannot be compared to any previous one because of the style and format of its presentation.</P>
        <P>A number of weeks ago, unanimous all-party agreement was reached on a motion proposed by Deputy Ring on the undocumented Irish in the United States.  Today I received a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs which stated the matter is a top priority for the Government.  This Parliament agreed that we should pursue a bilateral arrangement with the US but the Minister&rsquo;s letter makes no reference to that other than to indicate the issue is a priority and that he spoke with US Congressmen and Senators.  In the context of the current visit to the US by Dr. Paisley and Mr. McGuinness, has any direct contact been made with the US Government or its ambassador with a view to building on our all-party agreement to pursue a bilateral arrangement?  This is the month to pursue such an arrangement because, as the Taoiseach will be aware, the approach of Christmas and the end of the year means the issue becomes personal and sensitive to a great number of these people.  The House has given its verdict on the motion and I ask <Col N="1815"/>whether the Government has taken any action to build on that platform.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs is acutely aware of this issue and has been very active in dealing with it for a number of years.  The issue of immigration is extraordinarily fraught in the current campaign and we have to keep in touch with our various contacts on all sides to progress a bilateral arrangement in any way we can.  There are a lot of difficulties around this and the most efficient way to proceed is to go as quietly as we possibly can.  It concerns many other countries and complications and we are trying to pursue it but it is very difficult.  I have spoken with US Senators and Congressmen in the recent past and it is going to be difficult to progress it in the context of the election.  It is not an area in which common agreement exists and the extensive efforts which they have made on two rounds of it have not brought success, so we will just have to take our time in dealing with it.  The Minister is doing that.</P>

	<P>Last Thursday, in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s absence, I raised the nursing homes Bill with the T&aacute;naiste.  I understood from his reply that the Bill would be published this Thursday and would be first taken in the Seanad and then completed in the D&aacute;il prior to Christmas.  I made it clear to the T&aacute;naiste that the arrangement would not be acceptable to the Labour Party because complex and sensitive issues are at stake which require time and attention.  I understand a statement was made today to the effect that the Bill will not now be published this week and, by implication, a longer period of time will be allowed for its consideration.  Can the Taoiseach indicate the arrangements for the publication and taking of the nursing homes Bill and can he give an assurance it will not be rushed through the House before Christmas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have taken note of what Deputy Gilmore and others said last week, when I was asked a number of questions on the matter in the House and by organisations outside the House which were supportive of the Bill but wanted certain amendments to be considered.  I can confirm that we discussed the matter and the Bill will not be published for a while.  We will not attempt to bring it through the House before Christmas and we will try to deal with it after reflecting on the considerations put forward by Members, including Deputy Gilmore and others.  The only downside, which was quickly pointed <Col N="1816"/>out to me over the weekend by some of the organisations concerned, is those who were looking forward to receiving the benefit from 1 January will not now receive it.  I am afraid, however, I can do nothing about that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The child care Bill remains on the list of promised legislation.  Is there any prospect that the Taoiseach would consider expanding the focus of that Bill, given the continued concerns felt throughout the country about the proposed community child care subvention scheme?  Is he aware that Dublin City Council last night unanimously passed a motion calling for the suspension of the introduction of that scheme, for the continuation of the EOCP support for community child care provision and for a full consultative process to be initiated with providers, parents and interested parties in regard to the construction of such a scheme?  In line with that unanimous decision, which also included the Taoiseach&rsquo;s colleagues elected councillors in this city, will he consider this clear request, that is echoed throughout the country, to examine this legislation with a view to determining whether it can be expanded to address these issues of concern?  Will he make an intervention with the Minister to have his proposed scheme suspended and expanded in line with the needs of communities and individual parents?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The contents of the legislation cannot be debated now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The heads of the child care Bill have just been completed and the legislation is due next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of the statutory instruments being laid before the House on today&rsquo;s Order of Business were made under the Civil Registration Act 2004.  That particularly good Act was passed three years and ten months ago.  Does the Taoiseach intend providing time to discuss any of these statutory instruments?</P>
        <P>In the context of the legislation, is he aware that, despite the announcement on the website of the Department of Health and Children that since the beginning of November people can celebrate civil ceremonies of marriage in venues other than civil registry offices, the HSE is refusing to authorise any venue other than a registry office for marriages in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow and does not intend to inspect any other venues until next July at the earliest?  It appears the HSE, after three years and ten months, is incapable of fulfilling its own statutory function under this legislation.  Will the Taoiseach do something about this?  The Health Service Executive is effectively sabotaging the wishes of the House and undermining the launch the Minister engaged in to celebrate the fact that marriages can now be performed in less soulless places than civil registry offices.  At the behest of the HSE, <Col N="1817"/>the entire population of counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow will not be allowed to avail of this option until next July at the earliest and, possibly, a good deal later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the proposed health amendment Bill, will the current HIQA report on Cork University Hospital, which will, I hope, be published on 18 December, be discussed in the House before Christmas?  Will the Taoiseach inform the House of the reason the House has not yet had access to the Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty report despite unqualified assurances?  When will we have sight of said report?  Will the planned legislation on HIQA, the health amendment Bill, ensure the organisation&rsquo;s reports or inquiries into the health service are not bogged down by legal wrangling or attempts at sanitisation?  Will he also indicate when another HIQA report on the Galway hospital will be available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s call for a debate.  A protest was held outside the House today.  Given that it is clear that women no longer trust the diagnostic services for breast cancer, it is vital that this issue is debated in the House before Christmas, which leaves only two weeks.  The Taoiseach must give an assurance today that following publication of the HIQA and Dr. Ann O&rsquo;Doherty reports or any other reports that may be published before Christmas, the House will have time to debate their findings to ensure we rebuild trust in the health service, particularly breast diagnostic services.  The resources available for rolling out the cancer strategy in the near future must also be debated.</P>

	<P>With regard to the budget tomorrow, will the Estimates be produced as a separate volume or included in the budget?  Will they be the subject of a specific explanatory statement by the Minister for Finance?  At what point will they be released to the media?  The Opposition will be placed in a difficult position in that we may have virtually no details of the Estimates.  In what format will they published?  It was custom and practice, given their nature, to give the Opposition two hours advance notice of the Estimates.  Even with the pre-budget outlook, this practice continued.  What will be the position <Col N="1818"/>tomorrow?  As is customary, Deputies will receive the text of the Budget Statement when the Minister stands up to speak.

        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />welcomes the holding of the Second EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon and the EU Presidency&rsquo;s intention to ensure the current grave situation in Zimbabwe is appropriately raised and discussed at the summit;</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />emphasises the critical importance of a level playing field being established in order to guarantee the conduct of free, fair and democratic elections in Zimbabwe in 2008;</P>
       <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />calls for full compliance by the Zimbabwean Government and parties with the SADC Guidelines on the Conduct of Democratic Elections and encourages the broadest possible international observation of any elections held in Zimbabwe in 2008; and</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Taoiseach takes the grave political, economic and human rights situation in Zimbabwe most seriously.  Ordinary Zimbabweans are suffering desperately in a country racked by hyperinflation, which reached 8,000% in September, and with unemployment now estimated at 80%.  In rural areas, the economic crisis and government mismanagement have compounded the effects of <Col N="1822"/>drought and many now depend on food aid.  Hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans, including much needed professionals, have emigrated to neighbouring countries.  The deteriorating economic situation, worsening poverty and increased migration are in turn having an impact on those affected by the HIV-AIDs pandemic.  Only today I have received a briefing paper from Tr&oacute;caire which strongly underlines the gravity of the situation.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There are, unfortunately, no signs on the ground that the Zimbabwean Government is willing to change the destructive policies which have brought the country&rsquo;s economy to its knees.  In addition to the economic hardships, there are continuing reports of brutal repression of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, MDC, and other civil society groups perceived to be challenging the Zanu-PF ruling party.  There is a pervasive atmosphere of intimidation and violence towards those who seek change in the country.</P>
        <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Andrews.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Outrages such as the ill-treatment of opposition activists and supporters in custody infringe not only UN human rights standards, but also those standards which African governments have signed up to, such as the African Charter on Human and Peoples&rsquo; Rights.</P>
        <P>Ireland and the EU strongly believe that African leadership is the key to encouraging progress towards economic and political stability.  We support the talks between the government and opposition in Zimbabwe which are being mediated by President Mbeki under a Southern African Development Community, SADC, mandate.  A review of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s economy is also being undertaken by SADC Finance Ministers.</P>
        <P>I understand that some progress has been made in the political talks and that it is expected that they will conclude shortly.  This is encouraging in so far as it goes.  Implementation of any agreement reached will be crucial and must bring about real policy change.  The Zimbabwean people must have a chance to express their will without fear in the presidential and parliamentary elections which are due to take place in March 2008.</P>
        <P>Although the signs so far are very mixed, the EU places great priority on free and fair elections and the creation of a level playing field and we hope to work together with African partners, including neighbouring countries, the African Union and SADC, to ensure that the elections are in line with newly-developed African best practice standards.  We would like to see real change take place in Zimbabwe as fast as possible.  In practice, while Europe and the rest of the world can add their voices and their weight to pressure for change, it is Zimbabwe&rsquo;s own neighbours who have most influence.</P><Col N="1823"/>
        <P>Ireland stands ready to assist the Zimbabwean people in any way we can.  Ireland has significant historic links with Zimbabwe and our own national experience found expression in our support for the country&rsquo;s decolonisation struggle in the 1970s.  The ambassador and officers from the embassy in Pretoria regularly visit Zimbabwe in order to assess the situation and meet with members of the estimated 3,000-strong Irish community there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland is among those EU member states which have most strongly condemned human rights abuses and urged political and economic reform in Zimbabwe.  The Embassy of Ireland in Pretoria monitors allegations of human rights abuses in Zimbabwe and raises issues of concern with the Zimbabwean Government at every available opportunity.  The Secretary General of my Department, when he visited Zimbabwe recently at my request, raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns with Zimbabwean officials in Harare in June and also had talks on Zimbabwe with South African officials in Pretoria. Ireland&rsquo;s embassies in the region have consistently highlighted our concerns and pressed those concerns.  Ireland has also supported EU action to raise Zimbabwe in the appropriate UN human rights bodies.</P>
        <P>Since 2006, Ireland has provided over &euro;17 million to alleviate the hardships suffered by the people of Zimbabwe.  This funding is focused on humanitarian assistance, mitigating the impact of HIV-AIDs, and is channelled through UN agencies, Irish and international NGOs, Irish missionaries and local civil society organisations.  Ireland does not give any direct funding to the Government of Zimbabwe.</P>
        <P>The EU operates an arms embargo on Zimbabwe and a targeted visa ban against Zimbabwean leaders.  Contrary to what the regime would suggest, there are no sanctions against the ordinary Zimbabwean people.  The EU is a major provider of aid to the Zimbabwean people and this commitment to their welfare will remain in spite of government actions.  The EU consistently uses political contacts with countries in the region to highlight concerns about Zimbabwe.  Representatives of the local EU Presidency in each of the SADC countries have this year expressed to their host governments the concern of the EU and its member states over the developments there.</P>
        <P>In October 2007, EU Foreign Ministers expressed readiness to respond appropriately to tangible results from the SADC initiative and President Mbeki&rsquo;s mediation.  When the council last discussed Zimbabwe on 19 November, I and my EU colleagues agreed that President Mugabe will hear a tough and clear message on the EU&rsquo;s abhorrence of his policies at the EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon.</P>
        <P>I would like specifically to address the issue of Zimbabwe and the EU-Africa Summit.  Ireland fully supports the EU-Africa Summit and <Col N="1824"/>believes that this is an important step forward for EU-Africa relations.  It will mark the beginning of a new phase in the Europe-Africa relationship &mdash; reaching beyond the historic coloniser-colonised and donor-recipient relationships to form a true partnership of equals, allowing Europe and Africa to face common global challenges together &mdash; global challenges which range from development and governance, to climate change and energy, to migration and trade and many other issues.  However, we have to be aware that there are other major international players, notably China, with a growing interest in Africa.  Europe cannot take its relationship and its role for granted.</P>
        <P>The Joint Africa-EU Strategy, which will be adopted at the summit, also places respect for human rights, freedom, equality, solidarity, justice, the rule of law and democracy at the centre of this partnership.  This Government is firmly committed to all the principles and values on which EU-Africa partnership is based.</P>
        <P>There is much of a positive nature to highlight at the summit and there are also country situations of common concern on the EU-Africa agenda.  These include the tragic situation in Darfur; the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in Somalia; the violence in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where appalling atrocities have been committed against civilians; and the situation in Zimbabwe.  A consistent EU approach to all of these crises will give the lie to allegations from President Mugabe that EU policy is influenced by former colonial associations.</P>
        <P>The Government regrets the fact that President Mugabe has been invited to Lisbon.  We had urged that other options for Zimbabwean representation be fully explored.  It became clear that no alternative was possible.  However, along with almost all EU member states, we do not wish the EU&rsquo;s relations with an entire continent to be held hostage to one country&rsquo;s problems.  The fact is that 23 of the 27 member states will be represented at Head of State or Government level in Lisbon, along with President Barroso and High Representative Solana.  This includes, for example, Chancellor Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Balkenende of the Netherlands, two of the countries which share our serious concerns about the human rights situation in Zimbabwe and which cannot be accused of downplaying such issues internationally.</P>
        <P>We do not believe that the correct response to the tragedy of Zimbabwe &mdash; or to other even more tragic situations on the continent &mdash; is to preach from a distance.  Rather, we believe that we should work in partnership with the 53 nations of Africa to strengthen our shared values and to tackle African and global challenges together on the basis of those values.  We believe the summit should be about the substance of the EU-Africa relationship rather than about attendance.</P><Col N="1825"/>
        <P>Irish links with Africa go back for decades to the work of our missionaries and charitable organisations and Ireland has a long and continuing history of engagement with Africa.  We have good relationships with many African states, which appreciate the similarities in our historical experiences.  Africa is the focus of our rapidly increasing Irish Aid programme and seven of our nine programme countries are in sub-Saharan Africa.  Ireland also has a distinguished peace-keeping record in Africa.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s attendance at the summit this weekend will be in keeping with this proud tradition of Irish engagement with Africa.  The summit will be the opportunity to highlight the depth of the EU&rsquo;s concern in relation to developments in Zimbabwe.  It is important that Ireland be represented at this summit.  It would have been the easiest thing to turn around and, in effect, boycott it, and, as I said earlier, shout from a distance.  I strongly believe Ireland should be represented at the highest level in order that we are part of the ever increasing contact with the African continent.  It is far better that we treat this as a matter of substance rather than on attendance of particular people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for allowing me to share time with him and the Whips for allowing the motion to be tabled and, in particular, AWEPA for allowing us to have a meeting on the issue of Zimbabwe about two weeks ago here in the Oireachtas which was attended by 20 members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad and by lawyers and activists from Zimbabwe and Amnesty International.  The whole purpose of the initiative was to raise awareness of Zimbabwe, the problems there and to explore ways in which we can contribute to its improvement.  That we are taking an initiative such as this boosts the morale of those people who stand up for democracy and human rights in Zimbabwe.  We were inspired to a certain extent by the view that although there is little enough we can contribute, that was not an excuse to do nothing.  It was decided to try to put down an all-party motion on the subject.  We are delighted to at least have this debate.</P>
        <P>The sanctions applied against Zimbabwe in the past few years have not been effective.  If their intention was to try to change the behaviour of the regime or change the regime itself, they have not been successful.  We need to consider different ways of trying to improve the lot of the ordinary Zimbabwean.</P>
        <P>The SADC initiative is welcome, as is the role of President Mbeki, but we must be cognisant of several issues.  First, President Mbeki has tried in the past and has not succeeded.  We must bear in mind that he has difficult domestic issues to consider that hamstring his efforts to mediate successfully between the opposition and the Zimbabwean Government.  He has perhaps not been as stringent in applying the principles the <Col N="1826"/>ANC and his colleagues relied upon when they were seeking independence and freedom in the 1980s and before.  We must also bear in mind that the Zimbabwean regime is on its best behaviour and looking for an economic package in the context of the mediation taking place and the forthcoming elections.  All of these factors must be taken into account when assessing the effectiveness of the SADC initiative.  Great pressure must be put on the South African Government, and Mr. Mbeki in particular, to make him a persuader on behalf of the principles to which the Minister referred, which helped found the Southern African Development Community and also the African Union.</P>
        <P>The information we received at the meeting in Leinster House is that there is great concern that the outcome of the election is preordained.  For example, I am told voter registration is already closed, which has resulted in serious problems.  People must vote in the place from which they came &mdash; mostly rural areas &mdash; so the stronghold of the MDC in urban areas is effectively being diluted, which disenfranchises the opposition.  It will be too late if we wait to monitor the election; this is the time to monitor what is happening.  Hopefully, the election can be put back until the summer, which I believe is being discussed.</P>
        <P>Another issue I would like the Minister to consider, although perhaps not at this time, is divestment, considering the role played by particular UK national banks in Zimbabwe.  According to the International Crisis Group report published in September, Barclays Bank is providing a lifeline to the regime, investing $50 million in 2005 and lending large sums to the government on a concessionary basis.  While this is not the right time to raise this issue, if changes are not effected through the SADC initiative, we must consider such measures.  We must consider whether Irish pension funds are invested in Barclays Bank and whether this supports the regime.</P>
        <P>Sanctions have not been effective because they have been limited.  I am concerned for those who have the temerity to stand up for democracy and human rights at this time.  When the election has passed in March, or whenever it takes place, it is they who will be the focus of the anger of the regime and there will be little to help them at that stage.</P>
        <P>Other issues have been suggested by AWEPA, including that we try to encourage a UN human rights mission to Zimbabwe to assist in the pre-election process.  We must take note that all humanitarian aid moneys must be exchanged at the Zimbabwe Reserve Bank for local currency at unrealistic rates, which itself is of direct benefit to the Zimbabwean Government.  Irish Aid needs to reflect on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">After the second paragraph to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">believes however that, given the deep unhappiness of the Irish people, and human rights organisations, at the human rights record of the government of Robert Mugabe, and the failure of President Mugabe to respond positively to attempts by Ireland and others to urge a greater commitment to human rights, it would be inappropriate for the Taoiseach and any member of the Cabinet to attend the EU-Africa summit should President Mugabe also attend;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Fine Gael welcomes the motion and the opportunity to speak on the issue in Government time, and we thank those who organised it.  As we want to make the motion stronger, I wish to insert the amendment, after the second paragraph, because actions speak louder than words and, to date, words have achieved very little.  I also wish to include it because, as a nation, we have no agenda other than to see an end to human rights violations in Zimbabwe and a real move to an open and fair democracy.</P>
        <P>When we call for suppression to be replaced by tolerance, and tyranny to be replaced by freedom, we do so in the knowledge that we are not a hostage to a colonial past.  We have no covert economic agenda and our motivation is based purely on respect for a people that has seen economic sabotage result in dispossession, fear and hunger.  Zimbabwe, once proudly known as the bread basket of Africa, a country that represented many of the hopes and aspirations of fellow African states, today has the highest inflation rate in the world at 1,700%.  Unemployment is close to 80%, many survive on grain handouts, some 700,000 have lost their homes since the so-called &ldquo;slum demolition drive&rdquo; in 2005 and the land redistribution campaign which began in 2000 has resulted in the emigration of much-needed professionals.</P>
        <P>Street protests organised by NGOs, trade unions and other pressure groups are violently dispersed and political opponents are beaten and arrested.  Mr Mugabe divides and conquers, and divisions in the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, only strengthen his position.  There are growing tensions within the ruling ZANU-PF party, however, and this, aligned to the presence of some moderates, gives some small sign of hope.  Will a global vision of Mr. Mugabe arriving at the Lisbon summit this weekend and being greeted by European Heads of State assist change in his home country?  I do not believe so.</P>
        <P>The last EU-Africa summit took place in Cairo in 2000.  The EU accounts for approximately 75% of sub-Saharan Africa&rsquo;s trade.  Europe is also the biggest aid donor to Africa.  However, European imports and exports to Africa are decreasing. <Col N="1828"/> Since the last EU-Africa summit, China and Africa have held three such events.  Two-way trade was just $40 billion in 2005 and is expected to be worth $100 billion by 2010.  While some will argue that the summit should deal solely with economic matters, and others desire a token salute to the wrongdoing in countries like Zimbabwe and Sudan, we believe these issues should be at the heart of the matter.</P>
        <P>Mr. Mugabe is a master at manipulating the international audience.  This autumn he was greeted with loud applause by delegates as he arrived at a meeting of the 14-nation Southern African Development Community.  The impact of his attendance at the forthcoming summit in Lisbon will only be gauged in the years ahead.  History to date tells me it will strengthen his position, not weaken it.</P>
        <P>Since 2002, Europe has placed travel sanctions on President Mugabe and many of his officials.  France banned Mugabe from coming to a meeting of French and African leaders earlier this year in Cannes.  Now, all appears to be okay.  China trades with a clear conscience and Europe gets uneasy as economic activity with Africa comes under threat.  EU member states have their own motivations and commercial interests can supersede a requirement to do the right thing.  Europe must decide how it deals with leaders such as Mugabe.  I believe we can express our view best by having the Taoiseach and Ministers not attend the summit.  When asked why, they should have the courage to outline the reasons.  I hope others can join us in support of this amendment.</P>
        <P>In his wrap-up, I would like the Minister to outline what measures the Government explored for other Zimbabwean representation at the summit.  The Minister stated that 23 of the 27 EU member states will be represented at the summit at Head of State or Head of Government level.  What four countries will not attend?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a particular interest in Zimbabwe because my uncle was a policeman there for 20 years and I grew up reading letters from him about the situation there.  As with every other policeman in Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe took his pension.  I suppose my uncle was one of the lucky ones.  He went to South Africa and started a business and was not one of those who have been evicted from their farms and beaten up.</P>
        <P>This is probably why, particularly at meetings of the Joint Committee on European Affairs in recent years, I have raised issues concerning Zimbabwe, specifically the issue of Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s participation in any EU-Africa conference and Ireland&rsquo;s participation in such a conference.  I am not trying to catch anyone out, but the Minister may remember me asking him about such participation, specifically at the Committee on European Affairs.  In the context of President Mugabe&rsquo;s attendance, I asked him if Ireland was opposed to an EU-Africa Summit due to human <Col N="1829"/>rights violations in Zimbabwe, which continue to deteriorate.  The Minister replied:</P>
        <P LI="1">As I said in my statement, the summit cannot take place because of the insistence on the attendance of President Mugabe.  While the EU wishes to proceed with better relations with the African continent, it must be acutely aware of the situation in Zimbabwe which, as I said, is getting worse.</P>
        <P FLI="0">When I pressed the Minister on Ireland&rsquo;s participation at the summit, he said: &ldquo;As I have stated, the position is that the EU is reluctant to proceed with such a summit and we [meaning the Irish State] are reluctant to participate because of President Mugabe&rsquo;s proposed attendance&rdquo;.  Five or ten minutes ago, the Minister said we should deal with the conference on substance as opposed to attendance.  That is a hell of a difference in the Minister&rsquo;s position.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year, when I questioned the then Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, he replied:</P>
        <P LI="1">Zimbabwe has been a conflict between donor countries such as us and recipient countries, and is one of the reasons the conference has not taken place to date.  We take the view that it would not be especially helpful because no right-minded person could stand over what is occurring in Zimbabwe at present, and it would send all the wrong signals.  A number of Deputies have expressed concerns, as have many civil society groups, about corruption and the systematic abuse of human rights, and donors and others involved in development must draw the line somewhere.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">We do not even need to argue for our amendment.  One only has to read what the Minister has been saying on the issue in recent years.  For the last few years, he has articulated the position that we are now proposing.  The Minister has continually made the case in official condemnations, expressions of concern, speeches and statements.</P>
        <P>As an aside, I read yesterday that Zimbabwe&rsquo;s chief statistician has said he can no longer work out the country&rsquo;s inflation rate because there are not enough goods left in the shops to count.  That is interesting.</P>
        <P>It is hard to take the EU seriously either.  Despite being blacklisted by the EU and barred from travelling to Europe, Portugal and the EU have granted President Mugabe a visa for the forthcoming conference.  In his speech, the Minister said it became clear that no alternative was possible, but we should have opposed the visa for President Mugabe&rsquo;s attendance at that conference.  It is something we could and should have done.  The Minister has taken the wrong decision on this issue.  Based on what he has been saying about President Mugabe and this conference, it is fair to say the Minister&rsquo;s opposition has changed dramatically, for whatever reason.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Robert Mugabe was once hailed as a symbol of the new Africa following his election as President in 1980.  Soon afterwards, however, that optimism turned to fear.  In May 2005 alone, some 750,000 people were evicted from their homes.  Since 2003, four independent national newspapers have been shut down and the arbitrary arrest of journalists and protestors is commonplace.  Power is now entirely in the hands of the government and the military.  In the face of these concerns, hunger is spreading and the distribution of aid is controlled by the state&rsquo;s grain marketing board.  The Zimbabwean peace project has recorded hundreds of incidents of people being refused subsidised food because they do not support Zanu-PF.  Fear is having the desired effect &mdash; vote with your stomach or starve.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Suffer the little children&rdquo; is a phrase that is never far from one&rsquo;s mind in today&rsquo;s Zimbabwe.  The long lines of children&rsquo;s graves in the overflowing graveyards in Bulawayo or Beit Bridge are a testament to the high mortality rate for children in that country.  Nobody knows how many people are dying in Zimbabwe today, given that the costs of buying a coffin and registering a death are beyond the means of ordinary people.</P>
        <P>The Mugabe government has tried to interfere in the distribution of international aid.  The Irish contribution to this aid for 2006 amounted to over &euro;8 million with many Irish agencies working under extraordinary conditions, battling with local government corruption to ensure that those most in need of aid will receive it.</P>
        <P>Amnesty International has reported claims by many women of arbitrary arrest, beatings and in some cases torture in police custody.  In Zimbabwe, the majority of human rights activists are women fighting to feed their children.  Human rights activists, trade unionists, media workers, NGO workers, lawyers, students and the political opposition have been targeted by the Mugabe government for special attention.  Human rights work is dangerous.  In 2006, the director of the lawyers&rsquo; human rights group, Arnold Tsunga, was prosecuted by police because he sat on the board of an independent radio station, Voice of the People.</P>
        <P>According to the latest monthly report on political violence, produced by the Zimbabwe human rights NGO forum, during the first nine months of this year there were 776 cases of assault and 526 cases of torture, which is almost twice as many as for the same period last year.  Torture is Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s election weapon and the international community can no longer sit by while human rights abuses are widespread in Zimbabwe.</P>
        <P>Last weekend, the Senegalese President, Addoulaye Wade, attempted to mend fences between Mugabe and London, but Mugabe spurned the offer.  Following the imposition of sanctions by the EU since 2002, pleas from this country and others have fallen on deaf ears. <Col N="1831"/> Mugabe has ruined his country with policies that are killing thousands of people.  As my colleagues have said, the non-attendance of the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs in Lisbon would signal our protest at events in Mugabe&rsquo;s Zimbabwe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this motion but urge the Government to accept Fine Gael&rsquo;s amendment.  The EU-Africa Summit scheduled to take place in Lisbon will be the first of its kind in seven years.  It offers a major opportunity for Europe not just to forge stronger and improved relations with Africa, but also to put pressure on African leaders and their governments to take action when human rights abuses occur.  Since 1980, we have seen the catastrophic effects of Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s rule in Zimbabwe.  Land has been seized and 1.5 million people have been displaced from their homes.  Four out of five people are living below the poverty line, while one quarter of the population has fled the country.</P>
        <P>There is an opportunity for the European Union to take a stand on the matter.  This is particularly the case for Ireland, which has a proud record of humanitarian aid and peacekeeping work.  There is a risk that this critical summit will be completely upstaged by the presence of Robert Mugabe.  The Taoiseach should not stand shoulder to shoulder with Mugabe, thus lending him credibility and legitimacy on the world stage.</P>
        <P>In 2002, following rigged elections in Zimbabwe, the EU imposed a visa ban on Mr. Mugabe and almost 100 senior Zimbabwean officials and government ministers.  EU observers were denied an opportunity to participate in election monitoring at that time.  I would like to know what has changed in the interim.  Why have the visa restrictions on this despotic dictator been relaxed to allow him to attend the Lisbon Summit?  Why is he being granted legitimacy by being treated as the head of a normal, democratic state?</P>
        <P>In his speech, the Minister said the strategy to be adopted at the Lisbon Summit will place respect for human rights, freedom, equality, solidarity, justice, the rule of law and democracy at the centre of the EU-Africa partnership.  I understand that European governments will sign up to those principles, but how can the Minister claim that Robert Mugabe will stand by such principles or honour any commitments made at the summit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Howlin.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the conditions that prevail in Zimbabwe and support what I understood to be an agreed motion condemning the behav<Col N="1832"/>iour of the country&rsquo;s president, Robert Mugabe.  President Mugabe should have been confronted long ago on many issues, particularly in respect of human rights.  It is a very long time since he was received on a visit to Ireland.  When a very young person raised the question of his treatment of the gay community in Zimbabwe, nobody offered support.</P>
        <P>We are all in agreement on certain issues and it would be a great pity if this were not acknowledged beyond this House.  We are in agreement that there have been grave violations of human rights and of the civil process in terms of the participation of and respect for the rights of the opposition in Zimbabwe.  We are in agreement on the destructive economic actions of the regime, particularly on the poor.  We are, I hope, in agreement that we should sustain our attempts to continue to provide aid and ensure it is delivered where it is most needed.  We have a responsibility to place everything that has happened in context.  I regret I cannot support the amendment because we must make a choice as to how best we can advance the case we are making on human rights, the civil process, the proper conduction of the elections and the structure of civil society.</P>
        <P>The confrontation with President Mugabe must be moved to the top of the agenda and this requires our presence at the Africa-EU summit.  If one abstains, one follows Prime Minister Gordon Brown and simply makes President Mugabe the centre of an important summit.  The issues that arise in Africa are incredibly important, including the destruction of the environment, in respect of which the pastoral families are perhaps the worst affected.  It is unfair on 49 of the 50 African countries to say the issues that affect them &mdash; the environment, aid, trade, debt and the international economic order &mdash; cannot be discussed.  The decision on which we are divided is how best to proceed.</P>
        <P>All the aforementioned issues are important for the entire Continent of Africa.  President Mugabe should be confronted very seriously, including by his neighbours.  South Africa has been entirely insufficient in respect of the pressure it has put on President Mugabe.  It was very late in the day that he was first condemned, and this was by someone who was less than a full Cabinet Minister.  I do not accept the argument that South Africa is a new nation on the block or that one&rsquo;s neighbour should be handled with kid gloves.  There are issues of human rights to be considered, bearing in mind that South Africa&rsquo;s independence and current position are founded on the vindication of the rights of a population.  The same should apply to Zimbabwe.</P>
        <P>People will excuse me for being somewhat cynical regarding Prime Minister Gordon Brown&rsquo;s position.  During the long history of Britain&rsquo;s relationship with Zimbabwe, there was a cynical breach of the Lancaster House agreements.  While it is certainly true that President Mugabe&rsquo;s party was abusing the process for the <Col N="1833"/>reallocation of land, it is also true that the British Government failed in its commitments regarding what would facilitate transitions in Zimbabwe.</P>
        <P>Anyone who has studied election fraud in different Continents has found evidence that most fraud of this kind takes place in the registration process.  The Canadian Bar Association, for example, in its handbook put the figure at approximately 70%.  This means election observers need to be put in place very early.  One also needs to be able to confront the registration process because observing on polling day or immediately afterwards is of very limited value.  If one is to make the case as to how best to confront fraud during the registration process and how best to observe the elections, one must ask whether this can be achieved through a meeting of the European Union with its African neighbours.  Is this not the most positive approach?</P>
        <P>I am anxious that there be the widest possible consensus in the House in condemning President Mugabe so as to address the needs of the poorest people in Zimbabwe, who are carrying the brunt of his oppression.  I seek consensus in putting pressure on Zimbabwe&rsquo;s neighbours to bring about changes in the country.  One can do this best by putting the issue in the context of general African issues.  There is no doubt that anybody who considers the effects of climate change will note that its impact on the African Continent is overwhelmingly greater than that on other Continents.  It is equally true that the rush on the cities through urbanisation and the migration problems are more serious in Africa than elsewhere.  On the rush to sign economic partnership agreements, there is a real difficulty regarding the imbalance of power between the European Union and Africa.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to China&rsquo;s relationship with Africa.  It is very important that there be a human rights element to the development model, which in turn should govern the trade model.  Aid, trade and odious debt, which is often incurred by dictators, some of whom are no longer on the Continent of Africa, form a wide context involving 50 countries with considerable issues.  It would be a great pity if President Mugabe were to dislodge the general discussion in this regard.  I hope we are all able to agree to condemn the economic havoc being wreaked on the lives of people in Zimbabwe, the social impact of the political regime on housing and the abuse of a people by somebody who has betrayed the post-colonial opportunities of the country.  We should do so in the context of wanting to see a better, deeper and fairer relationship between the European Union and Africa.  I strongly support the motion on behalf of the Labour Party but regret that I cannot support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome the opportunity to discuss an issue concerning Africa in this House.  We have few enough opportunities to do so despite the great interest of <Col N="1834"/>Members in issues pertaining to Africa, including that of development, and also the great interest of the Irish people in such issues.  I commend Deputy Barry Andrews on his initiative in organising the very important meeting of the Association of European Parliamentarians for Africa, AWEPA, on 20 November, which was attended by 20 Oireachtas Members.  Very important first-hand accounts of what is happening in Zimbabwe were presented.</P>
        <P>The circumstances in Zimbabwe are an unfolding tragedy and the details thereon have been outlined to the House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The nation&rsquo;s anguish is noted by all the people of Ireland.  Ireland has no colonial baggage and has an interest in development and therefore has particular responsibility within the European Union and among the international community to speak in a very straightforward manner on this issue.</P>
        <P>I speak as the chairman of the Irish section of AWEPA, which has a proud and honourable tradition of supporting the liberation movement in Zimbabwe since its inception.  I visited Zimbabwe in its very early days and it was then the cradle of hope.  I met President Robert Mugabe and the then Speaker of the Parliament, Didymus Mutasa, and we had great hope.  These figures were the models who were to show how a new democratic Africa could be developed and they helped to export the liberation struggle to the neighbouring front-line states.  They were pivotal in bringing an end to apartheid in South Africa.  It is absolutely unacceptable that this potential has been squandered and that the regime of Zanu-PF in Zimbabwe, which is now waging war on its people, should go without answer.  We therefore have a great responsibility to adopt a position in defence of the people of Zimbabwe.</P>
        <P>I welcome the united effort of this House to take a stand.  It is important our Government is represented at the EU-Africa summit to confront, without the baggage of history, the despotic leader of Zimbabwe and to state the position of the Irish people directly to him.  That cannot be done through abstention.  I regret the British Prime Minister, who has done so much to put Africa on the international agenda, particularly the G8 agenda, and who has driven the economic reforms to try to clear African debt, will not be there.  My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, is quite right in that the entire continent of Africa requires focus and we cannot avoid taking the actions needed due to the absence of an individual.</P>
        <P>What is the methodology to be used?  The traditional AWEPA way is to build consensus across European Parliaments and to have a common alliance for democracy.  I hope this motion is the beginning of that process.  It will be replicated in other parliaments across the European Continent and, I hope, in the European Parliament.  I hope we can unite in democratic action to assist.</P><Col N="1835"/>
        <P>I mention the requirements on the neighbours of Zimbabwe to take action.  The action, in particular, of the dominant nation in southern Africa, South Africa, is critically important.  South Africa is not only an economic powerhouse in the region but it exerts real influence on Zimbabwe.  I hope that through our diplomatic efforts, we exhort the President of South Africa to use the influence of that nation on Zimbabwe.  The South Africans know of the flood of refugees crossing their border on a daily basis fleeing oppression in Zimbabwe.  It is critically important they take a stand.  Most of us are disappointed at the temerity of the South African approach to this issue to date.  There is a notion that there is quiet diplomacy.  Quiet diplomacy is often important but it must be at least robust beneath the surface and impactive.</P>
        <P>The reception Robert Mugabe got at the SADC conference in August, at which he got a standing ovation, was mentioned.  It is a pity many of the positive things that emerged from that conference in Lusaka, such as development issues, free movement of people and trade in the area, were dwarfed by the media focus on Zimbabwe simply because one individual got a standing ovation.  It is depressing for those of us who have been friends of Africa for a very long time, and who hope to be friends for a lifetime, to see a despot like Mugabe being greeted in that fashion.  However, that is the African way and they respect a head of state, particularly one from a nation which has been so pivotal in building the liberation movement across southern Africa.</P>
        <P>It is time for the nations of Africa to listen to their friends.  The Irish do not have baggage in this regard.  It is important to state that because it is simple for the Mugabe regime to dismiss British or French criticism as a sort of post-colonial continuing repression.  We have none of that baggage and, therefore, we have unique authority to demand and support change in the democratic structures in Zimbabwe.</P>
        <P>The chair of the eminent advisory board of AWEPA, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, has been very courageous in his denunciation of what has happened in Zimbabwe.  I hope his lead will be followed by many other eminent South Africans and that we listen to the voice of people such as the Zimbabwean human rights lawyer, Otto Saki, who spoke to Members of this House at a meeting a fortnight ago and urged us to take action.  Let us be united in this House and clear in our message that we want democratic changes in Zimbabwe, that we demand the rule of law and that the principles of democracy and human rights are applicable to all nations and peoples and that Ireland will be to the vanguard in ensuring that comes about.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The words from the Stevie Wonder song, Peace Has Come to Zimbabwe, are ringing through my head and are mocking us <Col N="1836"/>all.  They are also spurring us on to action to try to bring peace again to Zimbabwe and rebuild a country where life expectancy has almost halved over the past ten years.</P>
        <P>I applaud Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s placing of the Zimbabwe issue in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s past.  Ireland is almost uniquely positioned in the European context as a country which has known colonisation and oppression and which, I hope, can lead by example in showing Zimbabwe the way forward.  My colleague, Patricia McKenna, has discussed how the Irish experience of the Land Commission could show Zimbabwe a way to reform land ownership in a democratic way which can allow all the people to share in the wealth, opportunity and future of their country.</P>
        <P>I welcome the mediation efforts of Thabo Mbeki to promote political dialogue between the Zimbabwean Government and the opposition parties.  It is disingenuous of Deputy Billy Timmins to suggest that non-attendance would show Ireland was more interested in human rights violations in Zimbabwe than Europe&rsquo;s trade with Africa.  It is important to be there because this summit does not take place every year but only every seven years.  Given Ireland&rsquo;s increasing leadership role in development aid to sub-Saharan Africa and the huge pressure of climate change which is dramatically reducing crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a great onus to act and engage in dialogue now and to show a way forward rather than simply walk away from an event which does not happen on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>It is hugely important to show how we can move forward because Zimbabwe is plagued by street marches, which are violently dispersed by the regime, and by leaders being routinely arrested.  I refer the case of Fergus Blackie, a retired Zimbabwean justice, who was hauled from his home before dawn, held in jail for three nights and paraded through the bumpy streets of Harare in handcuffs in an open top Land Rover.  This is the message Mugabe is sending to the western world and we must show that we will engage in dialogue but that through that dialogue, we will show the best way forward.</P>
        <P>It is important to talk, to be there and to show leadership and how Ireland&rsquo;s aid, which was &euro;17 million over the past couple of years, can make a huge difference.  We should call on the Zimbabwean Government to comply with the SADC guidelines on free and fair elections.  We should publicly welcome the mediation efforts of Thabo Mbeki to promote political dialogue between the government and the opposition parties.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been through the trauma of being colonised and the process of nation building.  It was not an easy process and there were dark days in the 1920s with landowners being burned out and pushed out of the country but there was also hope, leadership and a democratic, peaceful and egalitarian process which gave us an agrarian optimism and future which led us through the <Col N="1837"/>dark days of the 1930s and 1940s.  It is possible to reform land ownership without deporting people.  It is possible to show that a democratic future is possible.  We all look forward to a day when democracy is restored to Zimbabwe and hope is brought to all of the Zimbabwean people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted that we are having this debate.  This country has had a long association with Zimbabwe through our missionaries and others.  We still have 3,000 of our own people in Zimbabwe.  It is over 20 years since I, as a Minister for State for Foreign Affairs, visited Zimbabwe.  The hope and expectation that was there was palpable.  It was not too long after independence.  Agriculture was very strong there and the country had the potential to be the bread basket of Africa.  There was all that hope then.  </P>
        <P>What we have now is a country that has been brought to its knees by Mugabe and his cronies.  It is now one of the poorest countries in the world.  The details have been given.  Life expectancy is down to 37 years and falling, while the unemployment rate is 85%.  The country also has the highest rate of inflation in the world.  It is giving a new definition to hyperinflation.  The official figure runs into thousands.  In June, the US Ambassador estimated that it would be 1.5 million per cent by the end of this year.  One stops counting when one reaches that far.</P>
        <P>In contrast, in Burma, which is another country on which we have focused recently, the rate is only 40%.  Zimbabwe also has the world&rsquo;s highest rate of AIDS infection.  Let us look at it.  It is not a coincidence.  Zimbabwe has none of the norms of democratic governance.  The judiciary is totally repressed.  Any of its members who show any independence are dealt with by the regime.  The rule of law does not apply.  There is even racial discrimination there.  There is no independent media.  Human rights are blatantly violated.  The country is now marked by political violation and intimidation.  The independent newspapers were bombed and closed down, while members of the judiciary were threatened and arrested if they showed any indication of having an independent line.  Even when the judiciary issued rulings in favour of the opposition MDC, they were ignored by the police.</P>
        <P>We are talking about a country that has become the sewer of the world as far as democracy is concerned.  Why is this the case?  It is because it has been and is ruled by a murderous megalomaniac.  Mugabe is a murderous megalomaniac.  It is as simple as that.  He and his cronies have brought that country to its knees.</P>
        <P>When I was a Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs about 20 years ago, I had the doubtful privilege of having to accompany Mugabe around when he visited this country.  He told me of his views on the benefits of one-party rule, which he thought would be of great benefit to this country.  I did my best to persuade him otherwise.  Obviously, I was not very successful. <Col N="1838"/> He and his cronies have been responsible for the state of his country.</P>
        <P>Efforts have been made to deal with it.  I am glad South Africa, which is the main nation in southern Africa, has been making some efforts but let us be blunt.  The results have been very poor.  There is too much handling of Mugabe with kid gloves.  Of course, the lead should be taken by his African neighbours, especially by the biggest power in Africa.  I would prefer a much more focused effort on the part of his African neighbours, in particular South Africa.</P>
        <P>Quite rightly, there is a huge consensus here.  We want to highlight this issue and must raise it at every level when we can.  We want to raise it here and throughout the EU.  We want to do what we can, which is little enough.  We support the EU sanctions, but what are they?  There is a ban on arms sales, which is being enforced.  Other countries, however, have filled the gap.  There are visa restrictions on the top 130 members of the Mugabe regime.  That is it, yet he is invited to the EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon.  My stomach turns at the notion of that man being invited to Europe and the fact that the visa restriction was lifted.  What sort of signal are we sending to the other 129 members of the regime when the boss man is brought to Lisbon?  It was a bad mistake to invite him to the Lisbon summit and we, or, more correctly, the EU, should have stood firm on it.  The wrong signal is going out.  One can imagine how that will be relayed back throughout Africa and specifically in Zimbabwe.  The notion of that murderous megalomaniac being recognised in Lisbon turns my stomach.</P>
        <P>That brings me to the legitimate question of what we do about it.  Deputy Timmins asked whether we should be represented at the Lisbon summit.  Other countries, including our neighbour, Great Britain, have decided that they will not go.  It is a very legitimate point that, to further express our frustration, we should not go either.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution to what I consider to be a very important debate.  The Minister and his Minister for State, Deputy Michael Kitt, should understand the depth of feeling that exists across the floor as far as this issue is concerned.  I am sorry if we are going to divide on the matter and I hope we do not do so.  </P>
        <P>In fairness to Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, he makes a reasonable point.  However, there is another reasonable point to be made, which I have heard made in other debates and in coverage in the UK last week.  It is a question of confrontation or no <Col N="1839"/>confrontation.  I am sure when President Mugabe goes to the conference, he will understand the depth of feeling of different leaders.  One must make up one&rsquo;s mind as far as that is concerned.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Howlin, who is one of the vice-presidents of the Association of European Parliamentarians for Africa, AWEPA, of whose council I am delighted to be a member, has already made reference to Deputy Barry Andrews&rsquo;s initiative in this regard.  It was a very important meeting.  I made the point at different AWEPA meetings that we are all busy people who are concentrating on our own constituencies.  It is right that we find the time to concentrate our energies on what is going on in the African Continent.  Over the years, AWEPA, even before I became involved, has done that very skilfully.  The particular meeting we attended under the chairmanship of Deputy Barry Andrews, whose efforts in that regard I applaud, is a good example of what we can all do.  I hope we can also use this debate to promote the work of AWEPA in the House.  The Irish section of it would certainly welcome even more participation.  The meeting held a couple of weeks ago was very impressive and we will have more of those meetings.  It was good to hear the Ambassador of South Africa being confronted, if one likes, by a number of colleagues, including myself, regarding issues of concern to colleagues here tonight.  I hope progress would be made in that regard.</P>
        <P>I have had an interest in this particular subject for a long time.  Today, I tried to find correspondence I exchanged with the then Prime Minister of Rhodesia, Ian Smith, in 1966.  The reason I remembered it is because I received the response from what I considered at the time to be the propaganda department.  I think it sent me about 20 pages justifying what was going on.  I am not going to write to Robert Mugabe but I am sure that if I did, I would receive the same drivel.</P>
        <P>It is very important that we stand up and speak out on these particular issues.  I have visited Zimbabwe twice.  I feel the people there, particularly parliamentarians, would want us to support them and I hope this particular motion goes some way towards that this evening.  I will now hand over to my colleague, Deputy Michael Kennedy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Barry Andrews for giving us the opportunity to speak today.  The question is whether our Taoiseach should go to the Lisbon summit.  It is my belief that he should because it will give him a firm hand, along with our European partners, to ensure that human rights abuses are raised and discussed with Zimbabwean officials.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Are we talking about Lisbon? </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1840"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>This can only be done if we show a firm commitment by attending.  Abstaining will achieve nothing.  </P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The fact is that 52 other African countries are attending and it is an opportunity for us to show solidarity with them.  I certainly believe that this is more than just an informal little chat.  It is about Ireland as a member of the EU joining with its EU partners in ensuring that we enter into dialogue with the other African countries and that we give a clear message to Mr. Mugabe that what is happening in that country is not acceptable to us in Ireland.  A boycott of this event by Ireland will not benefit anyone and would certainly not benefit the other African countries.  The summit will be historic because an EU-African strategy will be developed as a result.  It is unfortunate that the President Mugabe issue has eclipsed the objective of the summit.  Fine Gael is wrong in suggesting we should not be in attendance.  Ireland is not just a tiny country in the corner of Europe &mdash; it is a member of the major European body.  We have the same collective responsibility as any of the 26 member states who will attend.  Ireland has a role to play and we have a clear message for Zimbabwe.</P>
        <P>We can be proactive on trade issues.  China is making inroads into trade with Zimbabwe.  It is totally unscrupulous in how it deals with trade.  Ireland has the opportunity to continue the trade Europe does but also to attach conditions.  If we did not attend, President Mugabe would relish the thought that he had defeated the Europeans.  He would regard our not turning up as a moral victory.  We cannot allow him to do that.  We must press home the fact that we reject the humanitarian issues, and that he starves half his people and exports badly needed food.  By sending the Taoiseach, along with Prime Ministers of other European countries, we send a clear message, which is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank speakers for contributing to the debate.  I was approached by Deputy Barry Andrews last week, who suggested that, as a result of the AWEPA meeting, a sizeable proportion of the House wished to pass an all-party motion and I readily agreed.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>I am disappointed that the House will divide on this matter.  Deputy Higgins stated that we agree on the issues involved in the crisis in Zimbabwe and must decide how to proceed.  Ireland has been consistent on this matter and has made its position clear publicly and at relevant EU meetings.  Ireland made clear its reluctance to hold a summit with Robert Mugabe in attendance.  We have used every opportunity to insist he would not be present at the summit.  Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe exhorted the EU to stand firm.  This summit would not take place if we adopted a holding firm position on this.  It would mean that the entire effort to get the rest of the countries in <Col N="1841"/>the African continent in a wholesome way would have fallen.  The overall context of the summit was to deal with issues of governance and capacity building of African Union member states on an equal basis, not just dealing with Africa and the EU in the positions of recipient and donor as has been the case for far too long.  This is particularly the case in respect of climate change, as Deputy Cuffe stated, and issues such as human rights and humanitarian assistance.  From a national and EU point of view we believed that attendance is a far better option than staying away and claiming a pyrrhic victory which would, in effect, mean shouting from afar.</P>
        <P>A Member asked how many member states would not be represented at head of state level.  The countries are the UK, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland.  It is illustrative to point out that none of the Irish NGOs of which I am aware have called for us to boycott this meeting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a boycott.  The amendment refers to the Taoiseach or a Cabinet Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In effect, it is a boycott.  Tr&oacute;caire&rsquo;s recent statement makes clear it regards this as an excellent opportunity to highlight the serious nature of the crisis in Zimbabwe.  Efforts were made behind the scenes to ascertain if representation could be made at some level to preserve the overall context of the conference.  We are where we are in respect of the attendance <Col N="1842"/>of Mr. Mugabe.  If we are to learn anything from our experience of difficulties on this island, it is not to turn our backs and walk away but to engage with those people.  By engaging with those with whom we disagree, we can confront those people.  There is no better opportunity to confront Mr. Mugabe on human rights and all difficulties his regime metes out to his people than attending.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot engage with him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This is true not just from a national point of view but the EU point of view.  This will give a strong message to Mr. Mugabe and his regime and particularly the fellow member states that we wish to have an excellent relationship dealing with common issues on an equal basis but we also wish to highlight issues of human rights.  On the basis that it is not an issue on which the House should divide, I appeal to the Members opposite.  All of the other parties have indicated that it is best that the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Mich&eacute;al Kitt, attend the conference.  I appeal to Fine Gael.  I do not know who is pulling the strings in Fine Gael since the last election.  I do not make this as a political point &mdash; this House should not divide on this issue.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
        <P LI="2">Regional Fisheries Boards (Postponement of Elections) Order 2007,</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 8 November, 2007.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the opportunity to come before the House today to discuss the motion on the Regional Fisheries Board (Postponement of Elections) Order 2007.  The management and development of the inland fisheries sector resides with the Central Fisheries Board and the seven Regional Fisheries Boards.  Elections to the Regional Fisheries Boards are due to take place on 18 December 2007, following extensions agreed by the Oireachtas last year.  However, I propose, subject to the approval of the D&aacute;il and <Col N="1844"/>Seanad, to make an Order postponing elections for a further year.  If this is not done, the boards will fall.  By deferring the elections for a further year, the opportunity will be presented to work, in partnership with the existing Chairpersons and members of the Boards, on proposals for a more effective management structure for the sector.</P>
        <P>I am encouraged by recent efforts by the fisheries boards liaison group at developing proposals for the future management of the sector.  Significant progress can be made during 2008.  The fisheries liaison group consists of the chairpersons and the chief executive officers of the central and regional fisheries boards.  It is not my intention for these boards to continue in existence indefinitely, but  there is a real prospect of advancing proposals to restructure the sector in the coming year and I do not want to miss this opportunity.</P>
        <P>In 2005, on foot of an independent review of the inland fisheries sector in Ireland, my predecessor announced plans for the restructuring of the sector.  Under that policy, the sector was to be re-organised by subsuming the existing Central and Regional Fisheries Boards into a single national inland fisheries authority.  It is fair to say and it has been widely acknowledged among all parties that the management structures currently in place in the sector are not operating at an opti<Col N="1845"/>mal level.  There is a real need for change and a move towards a more effective, accountable and transparent management system.</P>
        <P>An initiative undertaken by the fisheries boards liaison group regarding the proposed restructuring of the sector has recently been brought to my attention. On Friday last, I held an exploratory meeting with the chairpersons of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards to hear the broad terms of their proposals.  Through further development of the proposals put forward, it may be possible to bring about an agreed programme for the restructuring of the sector which will result in more effective, accountable and transparent management systems.  I have asked the sub-committee established by the liaison group to work with officials from my Department in drawing up detailed proposals over the next three months.  If acceptable, I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval of these proposals in early 2008.  In any event, this exercise is time bound.  I expect that any new structures proposed will take account of Ireland&rsquo;s EU and international obligations, particularly the water framework and habitats directives.</P>
        <P>In the context of providing the legislation necessary to facilitate the new structures, an examination is being undertaken on how the existing legislation governing the inland fisheries sector can be modernised and consolidated into a single statute.  There are currently seventeen Acts governing the inland fisheries sector, dating back to 1959.  Many provisions of the existing legislation are out of date and in some cases defunct.  For some time there has been a consensus that the legislation should be updated.  I am committed to producing one consolidated Bill for the inland fisheries sector which is in line with the Government&rsquo;s policy on better regulation.  The new legislation will make provision for the new structures to be established as part of the agreed restructuring programme, and the updated and consolidated text will assist in the smooth transition to any new management structure.</P>
        <P>A sub-group of the national fisheries management executive, which comprises the chief executives of the fisheries boards, has been established to ensure that those dealing with the legislation at an operational level will have an input into proposals for the legislation that will govern the sector.  This group is working closely with the Department on developing the legislative proposals.  The sub-group will examine areas such as licensing, rates, conservation imperatives and river catchment management plans as part of their deliberations.</P>
        <P>The Government has recently appointed an interdepartmental group charged with overseeing the independent review of inland fisheries with a view to bringing it to a conclusion as soon as possible.  The interdepartmental group consists of senior representatives from my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; the Department of Environment, Heritage and <Col N="1846"/>Local Government; the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  It is chaired by the Department of Finance.  The composition of the group reflects the fact that our inland fisheries resource is affected by and crucial to a wide range of sectors and emphasises the importance of developing co-ordinated approaches to this resource.  The establishment of this group, along with the initiatives under consideration, should ensure that significant progress is made in the coming year in advancing proposals to restructure the inland fisheries sector.</P>
        <P>The fisheries boards and senior management accept that change is necessary and I am encouraged by their willingness to engage in discussions on much needed changes.  However, these discussions are not open ended.  If agreement cannot be reached within a few months, I will bring forward proposals.</P>
        <P>The Government has long held the view that our wild salmon stock is a national asset that must be protected.  One of the most positive developments in environmental management in recent years has been the moves to protect that stock through the introduction of a single stock management system.  While that change has important benefits, it allows us to concentrate on the other key elements in the protection strategy, such as habitat management and obtaining scientific evidence to find out what is happening in the Atlantic to our salmon stocks.  Failing to deliver that single stock management system would make it impossible to concentrate resources in the areas of water quality, habitat management and ocean science analysis.  That is why it was a very significant scheme.  I hope we can see the results of that when rivers are re-opened as stocks go above conservation levels.  We should be able to show Ireland as a best-case example in the management of a resource that we are privileged to have, unlike so many other countries.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the implications of alignment with the scientific advice, my predecessor also put in place a fund to address the financial hardship that will be experienced by the commercial netting sector.  The salmon hardship scheme is intended to provide a measure of relief to individuals in line with the level of hardship likely to be experienced based on recent catch history.  The hardship fund of &euro;25 million is available to all those former licence holders affected by the closure of the mixed stock fishery.  The scheme is being administered by BIM and the regional fisheries boards and more than &euro;8.5 million has been paid out to more than 600 applicants who have accepted offers made under the scheme.  The closing date of 31 December 2007, until which applicants can obtain payment, is drawing near and I encourage those interested in availing of the scheme to submit their claims as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Government has provided a fund of &euro;5 million that will be available under a community support scheme.  The focus of this measure is pri<Col N="1847"/>marily those communities where drift net fishing had been a well-established activity and where its withdrawal demonstrably impacts on their economic and social fabric.  While the scheme is targeted on those affected by the ending of drift-netting, it also addresses those areas where other mixed stock fishing activities are affected.  The scheme will be directed at the development of additional economic opportunities for crews and employees in the processing and ancillary sectors in the community.  The scheme will be administered by the Leader companies through my Department in conjunction with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently working on a suite of measures to be put in place through the fisheries boards for the management of the wild salmon fishery in 2008.  I recently initiated the statutory 30-day consultation process on the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme regulations.  The new regulations provide for, among other things, revised total allowable harvest of salmon by commercial fishing nets, quotas for anglers and improved management on certain rivers which have been identified as requiring greater control and monitoring.  Following on from measures introduced last year, total allowable catches will continue to be allocated on a river by river basis.</P>
        <P>The draft regulations published for consultation show indicative figures for total allowable catches on individual rivers which are based on preliminary scientific advice.  The final advice from the scientists is expected very shortly and the regulations will be amended to reflect this and will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website as soon as I receive them.  I will introduce a number of by-laws which will provide for, among other things, angling bag limits, the conduct of catch-and-release and the closure for harvest of certain rivers that are not meeting conservation limits.</P>
        <P>The fisheries boards, management and staff are to be commended for the excellent work they have undertaken in managing the significant change to the operation of the wild salmon fishery.  They have accomplished an onerous task over the past year in a compassionate and understanding manner in partnership with the myriad stakeholders who share the salmon resource.  There are equally challenging initiatives to be pursued in the management of coarse fish and undertaking their role in the monitoring of fish stocks and water quality under the water framework directive.</P>
        <P>Given the speed at which changes are happening in the sector in terms of conservation efforts, I am anxious that, in view of their valuable contribution, the existing members of the regional fisheries boards would be given an opportunity to play a key role, not only in ensuring a continuing input to the work of the regional boards, but in advancing the proposals to restructure the sector.  Accordingly, I propose to postpone the elections to the regional fisheries boards <Col N="1848"/>for a further year in accordance with section 15 of the Fisheries Act 1980.  This will facilitate the continued contribution from those directly involved in overseeing the service, whom I feel will have a key role in advancing restructuring of the sector.  They are committed to appropriate changes.  This order, when made, will also result in the postponement of elections to co-operative societies.  The position of the co-operative societies will be addressed in the context of the new legislation to be introduced.</P>
        <P>It is my firm belief that, through the newly appointed interdepartmental group, proposals to restructure the sector can be significantly advanced over the coming months thereby allowing the sector to reach its full potential through more coherent and consistent policy making and resource allocation.  While I am committed to the restructuring of the sector, I recognise that there will be significant challenges in bringing it about.  The changes to the inland fisheries sector will be progressed on an open and transparent basis to ensure as much involvement as possible by as wide a range of stakeholders as possible.  I trust that the House will pass the motion approving the order to defer the elections.</P>

	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy D&rsquo;Arcy.  Could the Leas-Cheann Comhairle please tell me when ten minutes have elapsed?  I am glad we have the opportunity to debate this.  Although it was discussed last week by the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, there are issues that need a debate and the opportunity for a vote in the D&aacute;il.  This is an opportunity for some general comments on the inland fisheries sector.</P>
        <P>The Minister has been handed a hospital pass.  What has not happened over the past two years is not his fault, however he is responsible for trying to sort it out.  The Farrell Grant Sparks report was published in February 2005 and approved by the Government in December 2005, two years ago.  The restructuring of the sector that report recommended has not progressed.  The Minister seems to say we will postpone these elections to ensure the existing regional fisheries boards fall.  We are doing away with regional fisheries boards without having the alternative structure in place to take over under a new management structure.  Could the Minister address that concern?  There is a fear that we are removing the existing structure without agreeing on the structure that will follow.  That is not a sensible way to proceed.  The Minister said we are close to agreement, and I welcome that.  However in such negotiations one can be close to agreement for a long time.  If the existing board structure falls in January, and if the Minister imposes his ideas on a new structure in mid-2008, as he says he must in the absence of agreement, what management structure will man<Col N="1849"/>age the inland fisheries and who will have responsibility after January?</P>

	<P>They will not fall for a year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The second issue I want to raise is the poor allocation of resources to supporting, developing and enforcing the rules and regulations on inland fisheries over the past seven or eight years.  In 1999 &euro;21.5 million was made available to the inland fisheries sector.  In 2004 &euro;20.5 million was available and in 2007 it was still less than &euro;30 million.  When one considers that we have more than 6,000 km of inland waterways, there is something wrong with the fact that we refuse to prioritise it.  Unfortunately the lack of priority in this area has a real cost in fish stocks.  At last we are beginning to address that and some brave decisions have been taken.</P>
        <P>Let us examine the number of tourists who visit Ireland to fish.  In 1999 173,000 people came to Ireland to fish.  In 2006 it was 103,000.  We have seen a dramatic reduction in the number of tourists visiting Ireland to fish, despite the fact that in almost every other sector there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of tourists coming to Ireland for activity holidays.  There are real problems in this sector, and that is why we must examine how we will restructure it with a sense of urgency.  It does not matter how we restructure this sector if we do not fight for the necessary allocation of resources to ensure we promote and develop the sector through marketing, fish stocks and improving the physical infrastructure that allows people to fish and enjoy themselves.  Without this we will not develop this sector in a safe, sustainable way.</P>
        <P>On the restructuring process, we are moving from a complicated management structure to a similarly complicated one.  We are moving from having a central fisheries board, answerable to the Department, which advised and helped to manage seven regional fisheries boards to a centralised national inland fisheries authority.  From a regional viewpoint, there will be inland fisheries advisory councils.  Essentially, my fear is that we are following a similar model to the one used in the creation of the HSE, which is moving away from regional decision-making and accountability and some transparency, albeit some inefficiency as well, to a centralised management body.  Our experience with the HSE in terms of trying to get answers to basic questions and in terms of accountability and transparency has not been good.  On that front, we should be embracing the ideal behind decentralisation, which is to encourage local decision-making as much as is practically possible in a whole range of different areas when there is reason to allow local areas to make decisions for themselves.</P><Col N="1850"/>
        <P>There have been, and there are, flaws in the current structure and it needs to change.  However, we need to ensure there is local accountability and transparency with people who understand the locality making and standing over management decisions that are taken as regards waterways, rivers and all the other matters involved in inland waterways.  This is as opposed to one body that makes all the decisions from a centralised base and with people from the regions trying to influence those decisions.</P>
        <P>Presumably the rationale behind changing the management structure is to get more efficiency into the system and to try to get decisions based on scientific knowledge that is held centrally &mdash; to ensure experience in one part of the country is shared with other regions so that there is informed decision-making on our rivers and fish stocks, etc.  It seems to be the case, however, that assurances are being given under the current management structure of the Central Fisheries Board and the seven regional boards to the effect that everyone will keep his or her job and have a role.  We must ask whether we are restructuring in order to ensure that the people involved in the management structures hold their jobs or to ensure there is better more efficient management of fish stocks.</P>
        <P>There is a crazy situation within the HSE, where senior management openly admit it is trying to find jobs for members of middle management as it is required under contract to ensure everyone keeps his or her job.  While I do not wish to see wholesale layoffs in this area, I want to be sure that any management changes and new structures are being put in place for the sake of fish stocks, fisheries tourism and the management of rivers, as opposed to looking after people&rsquo;s careers.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister might come back as regards the scientific research element of the change in structure.  My understanding is that the shifts will involve the scientists who work in the regional fisheries boards going into the Marine Institute.  The institute does a great deal of fantastic work, but we need to ensure that the priority and emphasis on inland fisheries, stocktaking and research remain intact rather than being dispersed within a much bigger structure, namely, the Marine Institute.</P>
        <P>On the whole, while I have some concerns, we will not vote against the motion.  However, we have some genuine reservations and I ask the Minister, on a serious basis, to ensure that a proper workable structure is in place to take over before the existing structures fall.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Coveney for giving me the opportunity to discuss this matter this evening.  As Deputy Coveney was not able to make the committee meeting, he asked me for my opinion on whether the motion <Col N="1851"/>should go through without debate.  I was very much of the view that this issue should be debated in the Chamber. </P>
        <P>I want to touch briefly on the point on which Deputy Coveney finished his contribution, scientific knowledge.  One criticism I have is that much of the data available on rivers is EPA-based and tends to be a couple of years old.  That is something which needs to be examined by either the regional fisheries boards or the new central agency, whatever it is to be called.  The data needs to be months rather than years old.</P>
        <P>I live on a salmonid river, the River Bann, where I run a commercial dairy unit.  It is taxing work at present, given the number of regulations and the amount of criteria that must be met in terms of running a major dairy unit.  However, I compliment the direction and the hard decisions that were made in the past.  I have never seen so many salmon in the River Bann, which is a tributary of the Slaney.  I do not fish and neither do I poach &mdash; this would not be unheard of in north Wexford.  Another consideration for the Minister is that the number of people working the rivers or keeping an eye on them is not sufficient.  There are some rangers, but not many and 6,000 km is an enormous area to cover.</P>
        <P>I also want to touch on an issue I raised with the Minister at the committee meeting regarding the accountability of the current fisheries boards.  We have seen that when boards or agencies are merged, they tend to become less accountable.  It would be a very retrograde step if the new agency becomes even less accountable than the existing fisheries boards.  The Minister knows my view as regards the fisheries boards, which are practically non-accountable.  Whatever structures are put in place, there must be public accountability, with some input from elected members of whatever agencies are created. I have a concern, too, with merging for the sake of it.  I heard what the Minister said as regards the fish stocks and given my opinion in relation to what I see happening in the rivers.  To merge for the sake of it, however, while guaranteeing employment to everyone, is wrong.  It is wrong because everyone in this Chamber sees other agencies and Departments that need staff at coalface positions.  There could be retraining, so as to provide staff in other agencies and bodies that would benefit the public sector overall.</P>
        <P>I have discussed accountability.  I hope it will work, speaking as someone who is always proactive and positive.  I hope we are not dipping our toes in shallow waters and that in a year or two we find the system is not working well.  I always look for betterment and want to see positions improve.  We will not vote against the motion.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1852"/>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Martin Ferris, with the agreement of the House. </P>
        <P Just="Left">This motion is seeking yet again to postpone the elections to regional fishery boards across the country.  It is worth pointing out that this is the third such postponement that has been sought.  We had Deputies Gallagher and Brown in the role of Minister of State with responsibility for this area and now the Minister with this responsibility is Deputy Ryan.  They all demanded interference in the democratic process.  A electorate should be entitled to renew and refresh its representatives.  However, although the Minister or Minister of State with responsibility for this area may change, the desire to postpone decisions seems to continue.  It is important to recall that on the last occasion a postponement was sought the Minister, Deputy Ryan, was in opposition and he strenuously resisted it.  If any attempt is made to postpone the elections yet again it will be met with fierce opposition from this side of the House.</P>
        <P>We will call a vote on this because we do not think it is the way to go.  Last year, when the Minister was in Opposition he called the postponement a &ldquo;shocking indictment of the Government&rsquo;s inability to prioritise the environment and wild fish stocks.&rdquo;  He called it &ldquo;a cowardly act&rdquo;.  He certainly has become rather meek since he entered the Department and he cannot remember the context and why he made these serious claims in Opposition.</P>
        <P>I appreciate he is new to the job and anybody new to a job as important as this is entitled to some grace.  However, we must remember the protection of indigenous fish species and habitats as part of natural heritage is the sole responsibility of the State.  It is enshrined in the EU Water Framework Directive and in the EU Habitats Directive that fish stocks be maintained.  It behoves the Government to take a proactive role.  I recognise considerable improvements have been made in recent years.  However, I express my reservations about another postponement.</P>
        <P>At the committee debate the Minister stated that he wanted time to meet the chairpersons of the regional fisheries boards and the central fisheries board and he met them last Friday.  It is not clear from his speech what progress was made.  He spoke about establishing sub-committees.  We need hard evidence in terms of making progress because as the Minister pointed out, relatively speaking this involves a limited time.  If he believes in consensus building, and he puts a great deal of emphasis on this, he must also deal with those outside of the existing structures.</P>
        <P>I briefly examined the Farrell Grant Sparks report which made major points of criticism.  One was about the multiplicity of existing agencies.  Agencies including the Department, the Marine Institute, local authorities and the EPA have a <Col N="1853"/>role in regulation.  Seven agencies are involved in enforcement and nine agencies have roles in what is termed &ldquo;monitoring and advisory service&rdquo;.  The report expresses concern in this regard &ldquo;not in relation to the role of the State.  Instead the concern is with the multiplicity of agencies and the inevitable inefficiency in resource utilisation and otherwise which arises.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In whatever new structures emerge, and I presume they will not be on the Farrell Grant Sparks model, it is important that the system is not complicated any more than it is already.  The lack of a clear Government policy on inland fisheries does not help and this is a lacuna which needs to be addressed.  The report examines in detail the need for policy.</P>

        <P>The report establishes certain key functions for such a policy including the development, promulgation and communication of national policy and plans for the inland fisheries sector; the establishment of an institutional framework for the sector appropriate to the effective implementation of policy including service delivery, the drawing up of legislation, securing of and the allocation of funding and providing the framework for sectoral regulation and enforcement.  This is a major task but if it were completed it would serve the country well.</P>
        <P>I recognise the existence of great goodwill and dedication among the angling community to preserve stocks and enhance the fishing environment.  Other speakers also mentioned this.  Increases in the salmon conservation fund are welcome as are proposals with regards to regulations and by-laws.  Anglers have expressed concerns to me with regard to funding.  What is provided at present will not satisfy this need.  Another concern is whether at times access to waters will be restricted to tourists only in order to make money.</P>
        <P>The Trout Angling Federation of Ireland made recommendations for new structures which deserve consideration. I presume the Minister is aware of them.  The federation makes a point of which I was not aware.  It suggests that what is required is that future regions be realigned with the Water Framework Directive river basin districts.  This seems a straightforward requirement and one I urge the Minister to take on board.</P>
        <P>The issue of accountability was raised by other Deputies.  We must ensure we have a system and statutory powers so that it can be made answerable.  Nobody in this House wants to emulate the HSE model.  The Trout Angling Federation of Ireland also argues for smaller boards in line with the Minister&rsquo;s thinking.  We will call a vote on this.  We will not win it but we want to make the point that interfering in this way in people&rsquo;s democratic mandate is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>Giving the Minister a year&rsquo;s grace will have to yield results.  He stated the Department is preparing a consolidation Bill.  A consolidation Bill is all <Col N="1854"/>very well but it only deals with what exists already.  I hope and expect the Government to go way beyond what is essentially a tidying up operation.  Clearly, we need a policy framework and appropriate streamlined structures and these are key.</P>
        <P>The Minister is asking us to postpone democratic elections and it is extremely important to have a <i>quid pro quo</i> of value resulting from what he proposes.  We must wait and see and I assure the Minister the Labour Party will play a role in encouraging the emergence of a clear policy framework and robust and accountable structures to ensure the best future for the inland fisheries sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Seven and a half minutes remain.  The Deputy has perfect timing.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy McManus and the Labour Party for allocating me this time.  I wish to discuss the decision taken by the Cabinet just over a year ago to proceed with the compulsory buying out of drift net salmon fishermen.  Not only did this go against many Government TDs and Senators but it also went against the recommendations of the Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources which proposed that any buy-out scheme should be voluntary and not compulsory.</P>
        <P>As a member of that committee I pointed out that not only was the Government bringing an end to the livelihood of many people engaged in a traditional activity, but it was inadequately compensating them for it.  The conditions attached to the destruction of nets were extremely harsh and in some cases would prevent fishermen using their nets to pursue other forms of fishing.  This decision has put further pressure on other sectors in inland fishing, particularly lobsters, crayfish and shrimp.</P>
        <P>Drift net fishermen have until the end of this month to decide whether to accept the compensation scheme and not only does this cause a major dilemma but it also causes the potential for division between those adamant that they will continue and those who feel they have no choice but to accept.</P>
        <P>With average compensation amounts likely to be between &euro;2,500 and &euro;3,000, it is understandable that many see it as a derisory sum to buy out a tradition which goes back generations within communities and families.  Another dilemma is caused by the fact that the Department told people they may be issued with new licenses if stocks rise but not if they accept the buy-out scheme.  This is a major contradiction.</P>
        <P>All in all, this has been badly handled and I appeal to the person with responsibility for this area to revisit the entire scheme at the last hour to facilitate those who wish to remain as active fishermen and to provide a much enhanced com<Col N="1855"/>pensation scheme for those who wish to avail of it.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Many other areas of fishing policy also need to be addressed but these matters rarely come up for debate here.  That is particularly true of sea fisheries and the need for a radical revision of the Common Fisheries Policy as it affects the allocation of quota in Irish waters.  The last year for which we have complete statistics is 2004, when 700,000 tonnes of fish valued at &euro;500 million was taken from Irish waters.  In that year, the Irish fleet had a total demersal and pelagic quota of approximately 200,000 tonnes and the value of that catch was &euro;123,000.  That is an indication of the disproportionate amount of fish being taken from our waters by non-Irish fleets.  Amounting as it does to 75% of the value of the catch, it represents a massive loss of one of our greatest natural resources and, to make matters worse, it is Irish fishermen and coastal communities that are bearing the brunt of the ever more stringent measures being imposed by the EU to protect stocks that have mainly been depleted by the fleets of other EU countries.  That Irish fishermen are paying the price is illustrated by the fact that the Irish share of the quota allocated has again fallen in the past two years.  The Irish share of the demersal quota has fallen from 55,000 to 32,000 in the past ten years.  Between 2000 and 2005, landings at Irish ports fell by more than 25,000 tonnes, representing a loss of some &euro;250,000.</P>

        <P>That has obviously had a major impact on employment within the sector, with overall employment falling from almost 15,000 in 2000 to 11,600 in 2005.  It has been reflected across all areas of the industry from fishing through aquaculture to processing.  With regard to the latter, not only are most of our fish taken directly from our waters but most of our exports still consist of lower value bulk and fresh products.  In 2005 less than 15% of the volume of exports consisted of processed seafood but that was valued at one third of the value of all seafood exports.  That indicates the potential that exists in that area.</P>
        <P>The entire sector is in need of a complete overhaul and the Common Fisheries Policy must be revisited.  Regarding the decision to postpone the elections, I agree that further consultation is needed.  I also acknowledge there will be significant challenges in terms of bringing it about and appreciate that the Minister intends to conduct the consultation in an open and transparent manner.</P>
        <P>I commend fisheries boards management staff on the work they have done on conservation despite the uncertainty that exists regarding their position, particularly over the past year.  I have worked closely with the regional fisheries boards over many years.  As an active fisherman, I have particular experience of the south-western regional fisheries board and have always found its officials to be fair and honourable.  They have <Col N="1856"/>done a good job.  However, I am concerned that the centralisation of boards might remove the democratic input from coastal communities if the regional aspect is lost.  With regionalisation, all sectors were represented on the board and its loss does not augur well for the future.  I will, therefore, oppose that very strongly.</P>
        <P>I welcome parts of the Minister&rsquo;s contribution but stress the need for him to revisit the decision to terminate the livelihood of driftnet fishermen and to ensure adequate compensation is forthcoming.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  Deputy Coveney made the valid point that resources for this area have historically not been at the level required to provide for the types of management and conservation measures we want.  One of the reasons for the difficulty in attracting resources may have been a recognition that regional management structures <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> central ones were not operating optimally.  I hope one of the outcomes of this process, if we can get it right, is a management structure that everyone recognises as optimal, with strong co-operation between all relevant agencies at regional and central levels so that the conflicts which formerly hindered the allocation of resources do not recur.  I agree with several of the other points made by Deputy Coveney regarding the potential benefits from tourism and other areas.</P>
        <P>In terms of where we go from here, I hope it will be possible to retain the expertise that currently exists in the area.  A complete upheaval would be wrong in this instance because there is a body of strong scientific expertise and dedicated and committed staff in each of the regional authorities and the central authority, even if some may have moved to the Marine Institute or elsewhere.  It is crucial that we retain and motivate those people within whatever restructuring exercise we set up.</P>
        <P>I was interested to hear Deputy D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s experience of running a dairy farm close to a salmonid river.  The fact that the river is full of salmon is a tribute to the way he manages his business.  We need to instill the same sense of excitement and responsibility in our entire community.  If we can get community buy-in, the effect on managing our affairs will be huge.</P>
        <P>In regard to the structures that we put in place to maintain regional representative boards, they could include elected members but it is more important that we appoint the right people, some of whom may be elected, rather than having purely representative boards.  One of the concerns I have about existing structures is that they are too large.  Deputy McManus made that point.  While many people are on the boards for valid reasons and in representative roles, whether in respect of tourism, fisheries or commercial nets<Col N="1857"/>men, the boards work more effectively when they are less prescribed in terms of representation.  Boards work well when people sit on them as a public service duty, as well as having public service obligations in respect of their own areas.</P>
        <P>In regard to my comments from last year which Deputy McManus quoted, my frustration at the time arose because there was no sense of progress.  To a certain extent, we were not doing anything.  The reason the elections are being further postponed is because I see a potential for progress.  A process has been engaged whereby the chairs of the various agencies came together last Friday and collectively agreed a proposal on how they would proceed.  In those circumstances, we at least have the opportunity, hopefully within a matter of months, to reach agreement on the structures we might put in place.  The crucial areas in that respect will include deciding the role of a central authority <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> a regional authority if we are to maintain the latter and the roles of boards and management.  Given the spirit of goodwill and unity that I sense from the chairs of <Col N="1858"/>the agencies, which in the past may not have existed, I am confident that we have the potential to do important work.</P>
        <P>I understand the concerns expressed by Deputy Ferris as a representative of his community but the changes in salmon management were essential from my perspective.  While they are not the key component of the management system, they allow us to concentrate on other issues, such as habitat and water quality, which will help us protect the stock sufficiently to allow for a certain level of commercial fishing activity on a single stock management basis.  Furthermore, these stocks will provide us with a natural resource that will enrich our lives and creates substantial additional economic potential.  It will be of significant benefit to the areas Deputy Ferris represents if we can bring back tourists and even if we can bring back&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>A few short months ago, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, was quoted in <i>The Irish Times </i>as telling us that Ireland&rsquo;s economy was at its strongest for ten years.  It is fair to say that if that statement was uttered today, nobody would take it credibly.  Amid falling house prices, a decline in construction activity, sliding share values, increased unemployment as measured by the live register and the quarterly national household survey, inflation and a worsening fall-off in tax receipts, it is clear that the economy in entering a significant downturn.</P>
        <P>The writing has been on the wall for some time despite the fact that Members opposite have chosen to ignore it.  Massive increases in private debt, an end to artificially low interest rates and over-dependence on the construction sector were the warning signs ignored by a Government drunk on power and infatuated with its electoral success.</P>
        <P>The past ten years can be broken into two different phases economically.  The first phase was from 1994 to 2000 when Ireland experienced a genuine economic boom built on added-value productivity and exports.  During that period, Ireland&rsquo;s low tax, low cost, lightly regulated, politically stable economy anchored firmly within the EU and the eurozone with a highly skilled, English-speaking workforce became an example to the rest of the world &mdash; what was known as the Celtic tiger.  After a brief slowdown, in the aftermath of the attacks of 11 September 2001 in <Col N="1861"/>the United States, we entered a second phase economically where the economy boomed again, but the character of this boom was very different.  It was not based on the creation of wealth, but on a debt-fuelled construction boom based on cheap credit, foolish tax incentives for developers, mass immigration and unsustainable increases in public spending.  Growth in the economy shifted from being driven by productivity increases and exports to being driven by domestic demand.  To quote David McWilliams, we were making money by selling houses to each other.</P>
        <P>The vast bulk of new jobs created in this period were almost entirely in the construction sector for men and in the public sector for women, whereas employment in manufacturing and agriculture fell.  Rather than adopting a prudent economic policy designed to manage growth, maintain competitiveness and deliver improved public services through reform and targeted investment, the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government recklessly poured fuel on the flames of an overheating economy through untargeted tax cuts, massive public spending increases and the SSIA give-away.  This Government, which was once economically incompetent, has morphed, to use the words of a former Member of the House, into a &ldquo;slump coalition&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Under the last Government, Ireland&rsquo;s economic competitiveness tumbled.  This did not happen by chance or as a result of external factors beyond our control.  The loss of competitiveness, falling from fifth place in the world to 22nd, can be directly linked to a series of major policy errors made by the Government.  These included the botched privatisation of Eircom, which has relegated us to third from last in the OECD&rsquo;s broadband league table, ahead of only Turkey and Mexico; the failure to introduce real competition into the energy sector; the decision to proceed with benchmarking at a cost of &euro;1.3 billion to the taxpayer &mdash; who knows what this cost private industry in terms of increased labour costs &mdash; without insisting on real reform and efficiency improvements in the public sector; the creation of almost 200 more unaccountable over-funded quangos; the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen&rsquo;s reckless cheerleading of the housing boom; his decision to increase current account public spending from 25% of GNP to 31% of GNP in six years without delivering any real improvement in public services; and, worst of all, the fuelling of inflation, 53% of which can be accounted for by increases in the cost of services delivered by Government or services regulated by Government.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that the Government&rsquo;s amendment states:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">recognises the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling inflation in areas where it has direct influence.</P><Col N="1862"/>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome that sentiment and I hope the Government will do it because inflation in the greater part has been driven by Government policies and the failure to regulate our utilities correctly.</P>
        <P>In recent years, the unsustainable property boom and the explosion in public expenditure has led to a domestic demand boom which has masked the underlying weakness of the economy.  With the bursting of the property bubble in recent months, this phoney boom is coming to an end and we must rely on genuine economic competitiveness to deliver future growth.</P>
        <P>With the right policies, I firmly believe that Ireland can recover from the property and construction downturn, although it may take two to four years for this to play itself out.  What will happen after we overcome the current property downturn?  Will Ireland&rsquo;s economy rebound once more into another boom phase?  Will we enter a period of more sustained growth or will Ireland have to endure a period of low growth or stagnation?  That is the focus of this debate.</P>
        <P>Competitiveness is in many ways an academic term for economic fitness.  A fit economy will recover from any setback whereas an unfit economy will struggle to do so.  At 22nd place in the World Economic Forum league table, Ireland is not nearly as fit as it was when the Rainbow Government left office in 1997.  While we are still relatively competitive compared to many countries, the fundamentals that brought about economic growth in the first part of the past decade are no longer present.  If competitiveness continues to decline, it will in itself become a brake on economic progress and the current property and construction-related downturn will transform into a prolonged period of stagnation for the once-proud Irish economy.</P>
        <P>Regaining and improving economic competitiveness must be the first priority of the Government&rsquo;s economic policy.  We must embark on the long, painstaking and painful process of restoring economic competitiveness as a matter of urgency.  While Fine Gael and I do not have all of the answers, I will focus on five areas where much could be done: national infrastructure; the reduction of costs to business; the building of a more business-friendly environment; education and training; and sound fiscal and taxation policies.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s physical infrastructure remains a source of acute economic and competitive disadvantage, to quote the National Competitiveness Council, the report of which is welcomed by the Minister in his amendment.  The World Economic Forum rightly places us at 49th place in the world with regard to infrastructure, behind countries such as Thailand, Barbados, South Africa, Jordan and Namibia.  Despite billions of euro in Structural Funds from the EU and several national development plans, we still do not have motorways connecting our major cities.  Congestion in <Col N="1863"/>Dublin is making it almost impossible to do business in the city and public transport is infrequent and unreliable.  Dublin Airport, our gateway to the world, is a national embarrassment and, as we saw in recent days, does not even have a safe power supply, while our sea ports are substandard.</P>
        <P>Investment in ICT is below the EU average.  The absence of a proper electricity cable connection to the UK and continental Europe is forcing us to pay much more for energy than we should.  Broadband, particularly fixed line broadband, the highway for future enterprise, is unavailable in many parts of the country.  According to the OECD, average broadband speeds in Ireland are 14 times slower than in France and 30 times slower than in Japan.</P>
        <P>We need major Government investment in all of these areas and radical reforms to our planning laws and public tendering policies to ensure that projects can be delivered quickly and cheaply.  We also need to turn to the private sector by offering it the possibility of funding, building and operating major pieces of infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The Government can no longer hide behind aspirational plans such as Transport 21.  Transport 21 is aspirational; it is not Government policy.  The decision of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann not to include, for example, Hansfield station in the Dunboyne rail order demonstrates exactly the extent to which Transport 21 is a pick-and-choose menu of options and not a real transport policy for the future.  We cannot tolerate any more waffle about EU averages to hide our problems.  Ireland should not aspire to merely catching up with our competitors.  If we are serious about developing a sound economic base for this country for generations to come, we must aim to be the world leader.</P>
        <P>The cost of doing business in Ireland is considerably higher than in most of our competitor countries.  A simple comparison between Manchester and Dublin, for example, carried out by <i>Business and Finance</i>, shows that the cost of electricity, local authority charges and levies and waste collection are up to 40% higher in Dublin than Manchester, not to mention India or China.  This must change through better regulation, increased competition and wholesale reform of the way we fund local government so its cost does not fall disproportionately on business.  We must also grasp the nettle of controlling the inexorable rise in labour costs through public sector wage restraint, beginning with Ministers, lower inflation and targeted reductions in income taxes, VAT and employers&rsquo; PRSI over several years.</P>
        <P>There is substantial scope for improving Ireland&rsquo;s regulatory environment.  By adopting the recommendations of the Business Regulation Forum of 2007 &mdash; erroneously referred to in the Minister&rsquo;s amendment as the &ldquo;Better Regulation <Col N="1864"/>Forum&rdquo; &mdash; and using the standard costs model, we could cut the administrative cost of regulation to Irish businesses by 25%, a saving of &euro;1.5 billion.  The Netherlands has done so; we should do so too.</P>
        <P>To date, Ireland&rsquo;s education system has served us well but we are starting to fall behind other countries in this regard, particularly the Nordic countries and Asian countries such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.  We must reverse the ongoing trend towards easier exams, grade inflation and lower academic standards.  In addition to smaller classes, we need higher standards and better teachers.  In particular, we need to improve take-up and standards in mathematics, science and foreign languages.</P>
        <P>I noted today that the OECD PISA report has placed Ireland 22nd in the world in maths, which is totally unacceptable, and suggests only 10% of Irish 15-year olds have reached levels five and six in maths versus a 13% OECD average.  We need to be leading the world in this regard, not catching up with the average.  We are well behind countries like Finland, China and Canada, our real competitors in the modern world.</P>
        <P>Through a package of genuine welfare reforms and a new opportunities policy to replace the current welfare system, we could reach Nordic labour force participation levels, lifting tens of thousands currently stuck in the poverty trap of welfare benefits into gainful employment.  State-funded education vouchers could help to fund higher level tuition fees for people seeking to take masters degrees or PhDs and may also provide a second chance at education for those who did not take their leaving certificate at an earlier age.  We need to radically reform F&Aacute;S, an &euro;800 million quango, by separating from it the important social employment schemes, and calling them what they are, and having a separate group for training, upskilling and apprenticeships.</P>
        <P>We need real public sector reform, not the non-reform we have seen for ten years.  We must move away from pro-cyclical budgets that increase spending and cut taxes when the economy is booming and cut back spending and increase taxes when the economy is slowing.  Increases in public spending which exceed inflation must deliver real improvements in public services.</P>
        <P>This is where the Government&rsquo;s budgetary policy is totally flawed.  We have a budgetary policy whereby one calculates the cost of doing the same thing next year as was done this year, and then includes any add-ons.  Any modern business or organisation begins every year at zero and asks itself how well it spent money in the past year before automatically adding on increases.</P>
        <P>It is interesting the Minister congratulates himself that Ireland is in third place globally in terms of job creation for its population size.  I doubt we will be in the same place this time next year.  I <Col N="1865"/>hope when I introduce a motion at that stage to point out that fact, he will vote for it.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>It is also interesting the Minister refers to the solid management of the public finances.  A country that has seen current public spending, not capital spending, leap from 25% to 31% of GNP in a short period without delivering any real improvements in public services should not regard its management of finances to be sound.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the Small Business Forum, the Business Regulation Forum, the Expert Group on Future Skills and the Enterprise Strategy Group.  Most of these bodies have made recommendations but only approximately one third of them have been implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We will exchange a<?oasys _jy ?>series of parliamentary questions on that issue, which we can discuss at a later stage.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to his commitment to tackling inflation in areas where the Government has direct influence.  As I pointed out, however, 58% of inflation is related to Government services and Government-regulated services.</P>
        <P>The Minister welcomed the report of the National Competitiveness Council, as I do.  However, while the council reported that infrastructure and inflation are the key issues with regard to competitiveness in Ireland at present, the Government is not tackling these issues.  The report clearly shows no progress has been made year on year with regard to achieving competitiveness targets.</P>
        <P>Some believe that the Ireland of the past decade is as good as it gets.  I believe that, for Ireland, the best is yet to come.  We still have the chance to emerge from the current downturn with a robust and innovative private sector and an efficient and reformed public sector in an economy based on sound public finances, low taxes, a favourable cost base and regulatory environment, world-class physical and technological infrastructure, a flexible labour market and an education and lifelong learning system that stays ahead of the curve &mdash; in short, a nation ready to enter the next phase of economic and social development.  However, we can only do this if we make the right policy choices now.  In my view, this means making the restoration of Ireland&rsquo;s economic competitiveness our number one economic priority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>The motion is an important and relevant one, particularly as we face the announcement of budget 2008 tomorrow.  It is a time of much concern as to the future of the economy.  We face challenging times.  We have heard the message from the Minister for Finance and we know tax returns to his Department do not match expectations.</P>
        <P>It is not surprising the Celtic tiger, to which we have all become used, is on a downturn at this <Col N="1866"/>stage because it has been based, as Deputy Varadkar noted, on the construction sector and the building and sale of houses.  All that is coming to an abrupt and alarming end for our economy.  In recent months, we have heard much about the state of the housing market.  The Construction Industry Federation has circulated figures according to which sales are down 50% on last year.  In the past three months, house sales have stalled and financial institutions are reluctant to finance construction projects.  The trends for next year indicate that housing output will be down by 30,000 on 2006.  We are told that approximately 35,000 jobs will be lost in the construction sector in 2008, which will mean an inevitable loss to the Exchequer.  Earlier, I heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, say he is not ruling out changes in stamp duty, but we will see what that means tomorrow.</P>
        <P>For the last number of years, the indigenous sector has been neglected through a lack of encouragement and development.  We are dependent on foreign direct investment, which has been good for the economy.  We continue to attract such investment but today we heard 500 people will lose their jobs at Abbott in Galway.  Having been in Ireland for 60 years, the company is to cease its activities in the Galway area due to intense competition from abroad.  Obviously Ireland did not win out in that competition.  Medical technology is an advancing area in which Enterprise Ireland and the IDA hope to invest money to develop jobs in that sector.  It is quite alarming therefore that such a prestigious industry is to move out.</P>
        <P>We have had similar reports recently in Cork with Amgen pulling out, along with Motorola, and Pfizer curtailing its activities in the Cork region.  All these unsettling developments are based on a lack of competitiveness given the cost of operating here.</P>
        <P>Like the Minister, I attended a conference last year organised by the Cork Chamber of Commerce which hosted a number of speakers.  It was interesting to see the vice-president of Pfizer outlining that company&rsquo;s perspective from its New York headquarters.  Taking Ireland at 100% for wages, energy and services, Singapore was at 50% while China and Japan came in at 10%.  The nub of the issue is that we are an expensive economy and Ireland is an expensive place in which to do business.</P>
        <P>The global competitiveness index for 2007-08 ranked Ireland at 22nd of 131 economies.  Our infrastructure was criticised in that report with Ireland ranking 49th behind Lithuania, Mauritius, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia and Estonia.  The quality of our port infrastructure, roads, railways and air transport was seen as weak, thus contributing to our lack of competitiveness.  That report said the most problematic factors for business in Ireland are inadequate infrastructure, inflation and inefficient Government bureaucracy.  The Government could effect changes in those three areas.</P><Col N="1867"/>
        <P>Broadband availability is woeful.  Our economy is described as being geared to investment, moving up the value chain in terms of job quality, yet investment in broadband has been pathetic since the original sale of Eircom.</P>
        <P>Last week, the National Competitiveness Council produced a report highlighting a number of areas in which we are suffering economically.  Weak growth in exports from 2000 to 2006 resulted in our overall share of international trade falling.  Productivity growth between 2003 and 2006 is below the OECD average, and Ireland is the second most expensive location for consumers in the EU 15, with the third highest rate of inflation.</P>
        <P>If Ireland is to become a knowledge-based economy, attracting investment at that level, we must correct the lack of competitiveness that was outlined in last week&rsquo;s report by the National Competitiveness Council and in the global competitiveness index.  We must invest in research and development and attract R&amp;D operations to this country.  Tomorrow&rsquo;s budget will present another opportunity for the Minister to outline what he intends to do in this regard.  The Finance Act 2004 announced some changes in that area but further alterations are needed to ensure the right type of industry will be attracted here.  In that way we will be able to regain our rightful place as a leading economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Varadkar, for proposing this motion.  It is timely to debate competitiveness in budget week.  It is dawning on many people around the country that Ireland needs to change its expenditure emphasis to ensure better value for money, as well as having more transparency on how and where it is spent.  In that way Ireland will become a more competitive place in which to do business.  I hope this motion will help to dispel the myth that the Government has a steady and responsible hand on the economy.  One could pick any one of six or seven sectors where we have performed poorly.  We have become sloppy in terms of taking prosperity and jobs for granted at a time when we should have been investing in the future.  That would have ensured the kind of rapid growth from which we benefited over the last ten years was used to invest in the future when times may not be so easy.</P>
        <P>I wish to concentrate on two areas for which the Government has significant responsibility but has not performed well.  The first is the energy sector.  Between 2002 and 2007, industrial electricity prices in Ireland increased by 52%, which compares poorly to international trends.  Across the EU 15, which is the only fair measurement, the figure is 40%, while it is 46% in the UK.  The price of electricity in Ireland has gone from 15% below the EU average in 1996 to 13% above it in 2006.  Inflation in electricity costs here averaged 5.1% per year over the decade to 2006, compared <Col N="1868"/>to an EU average of 1.85%.  While we have invested much in trying to create a competitive market for electricity, we have not managed to get the benefit from competition in that market.  That situation has been managed by regulation, which is controlled by the Government.  To sum up the difference between Ireland and similar market places, the cost of electricity per kilowatt hour for medium-sized enterprises here is &euro;10.47 compared to &euro;6.96 in London and &euro;4 in Boston.  Those figures are from January 2007, but I suspect they have not improved since then.</P>
        <P>Whenever fuel and power costs rise, the Government throws its hands in the air and says it can do nothing about the situation because it is dependent on international oil and gas prices.  The Government says its hands are tied but other economies have managed to take action despite being similarly affected by fuel price increases.  It is because of the Government&rsquo;s lack of management of our energy and fuel mix and our over-reliance on fossil fuels that Ireland has become over-exposed to dramatic increases in fossil fuel prices.</P>
        <P>Irrespective of international trends in the price of fossil fuels, we have no excuse, in a time of plenty, for not investing with a view to increasing broadband availability and speed.  The figures of Ireland&rsquo;s performance in this regard are disgraceful.  Our current broadband penetration is 15.4% of the population.  This compares to the OECD average of 18.8% and places Ireland 22nd out of 30 countries.  Our broadband penetration is also well below the EU average of 18.2%.  The Minister has attempted consistently to change these statistics by including 45,000 mobile broadband subscribers, thereby increasing penetration to 16.5%, but this is only spin.  Neither the OECD nor the EU includes mobile broadband in its data.  This is because most users with a mobile broadband connection also have&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The future lies in mobile broadband.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, that is not the case.  Mobile broadband has a role to play but we require a dramatic roll-out of fibre-optic cable throughout the country to ensure the existence of the high speed connections available in other European countries and the Far East.  Although Irish broadband availability is increasing each year, we are falling further and further behind the competition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>The heady days of Fianna F&aacute;il overspending and economic mismanagement simply must end, particularly because we are facing a significant budget deficit for the first time in many years.  Ireland has become uncompetitive and is very much creaking under the weight of a public sector that is spiralling out of control.  I am very concerned that the Govern<Col N="1869"/>ment is burying its head in the sand regarding the decrease in economic competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael supports competitiveness and low tax rates and, in particular, it supports incentivisation.  We recognise there is now a need to set out a framework to reduce obstacles to job creation, particularly for small and medium enterprises.  The Government has absolutely and abjectly failed to support indigenous industry, particularly small and medium enterprises.  There is no longer a spirit of entrepreneurship in the country and business people find themselves absolutely crippled by the ever-growing costs associated with running a company or business.  Small and medium enterprises have been excluded from social partnership and this is an example of the Government&rsquo;s attitude thereto and its failure to acknowledge the role they play in contributing to the economy.</P>
        <P>Consider the public sector and the benchmarking process.  Awarding pay increases without achieving further efficiencies and increased productivity is an absolute nonsense.  Benchmarking has simply become a form of Government robbery and it is very clear that the Taoiseach in particular has decided to avoid discomfort in negotiations with trade unions by effectively raiding the budget coffers instead.  This is very serious because buying time with social partners is not a solution to the problems in the public sector.</P>
        <P>Let me draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the goals of benchmarking.  Extra payments were to be triggered where there was hard evidence of recruitment difficulties and pay discrepancies in comparison with the private sector.  Payments were to be conditional on the delivery of a fresh agenda of reform to deliver improved public services.  Neither of these criteria was met and the reality is very different from what was envisaged.  As Deputy Varadkar stated, &euro;1.3 billion has been paid out through benchmarking and we have not seen any reforms or efficiencies of note in the public sector.  An article in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>on 30 November refers to ISME, which I believe is a very worthy organisation although it appears to be treated with contempt by the Government.  According to the article, ISME describes the benchmarking process as &ldquo;divisive, expensive and a fundamental insult to those who operate in the private sector and ultimately pay for the pay hikes&rdquo;.  The figure ISME cites in highlighting the difference between wages in the public and private sectors is staggering.  It states there is a 69% difference when one takes pension entitlements and other factors into account.  There is a marked difference in the pressures and efficiencies evident in both sectors and it is time that the Government addressed this.</P>
        <P>The ESRI and the Department of Finance stated in recent years that the only two sectors in which there was a serious amount of job creation were the construction and public sectors.  The wind has been taken out of the sails of the former.  House sales have slowed down and building is not <Col N="1870"/>taking place, therefore the only growing sector is the public sector.  This is not sustainable and there needs to be marked reform in this area.</P>
        <P>Consider Ireland&rsquo;s commitment under the Lisbon Agenda, to which it signed up in 2000 with the other EU member states with a view to improving economic efficiencies and competitiveness.  We committed to the investment of 3% of our GDP in research and development but this has not happened.  The Government has made no effort to diversify and plan for the future of the economy.  We are now facing difficult times and choppy waters.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s plan to deal with the crisis we face?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I looked at the amendment tabled by the Minister, Deputy Martin, and noted it does not stand up to scrutiny.  He referred to job creation but the main reason for this debate is that Ireland is no longer competitive.  The Government neglected manufacturing and exportation in the past six years to focus entirely on the construction industry.  The low interest rates that came about on our adoption of the euro led to artificial circumstances, thus making the Government&rsquo;s position possible.  We must return to basics.  We have a small open economy and must look after exporters.  We have not done so and have lost 30,000 manufacturing jobs in the past six years.  The Minister referred to job creation but he should realise we will lose 45,000 construction jobs this year.  We have not dealt with this.</P>
        <P>Since 1 January, there has been an increase in the price of basic goods, such as bread, in the order of 15% or 16%.  In recent years, the main problem has been Government-fuelled inflation because the Government has not regulated the markets.  Fine Gael wants the Minister for Finance, in tomorrow&rsquo;s budget, to limit increases in Government-regulated markets, including the gas and electricity markets, such that those increases will be below the rate of inflation.  This has not been achieved to date and the prices of Government-regulated services have risen at three times the rate of inflation.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the strong management of the economy.  We face a very large budget deficit tomorrow because the Government has relied totally on the construction industry without demonstrating any foresight.  We should be focusing on exports and manufacturing.  There are 250,000 small and medium enterprises in Ireland and they employ 40,000 of the population.  They have been forgotten totally although they add to the tax yield and pay for various services that are deemed necessary.</P>
    
        <P>I want to be positive and examine the area of research and development.  A research and development scheme was introduced through the Finance Act 2004.  To some extent, it has worked but it has not worked in the way it should have.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance will introduce reforms tomorrow and will encourage <Col N="1871"/>small companies to get involved.  There is a stipulation that only 15% of the costs can be made up by subcontractors.  That should be increased.  One must ease the burden as well.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The National Competitiveness Council stated that three areas need to be addressed.  We need to stimulate productivity growth.  We are way behind in that and are 22nd out of 28 OECD countries.  We need to develop greater innovation.  In terms of business expenditure as a percentage of GDP in 2005, we ranked 19th out of 28 OECD countries.  We must restore cost competitiveness in major markets.  The Government must give an absolute assurance tomorrow that it will not increase inflation in the areas it controls.  It must look at promoting export markets and at getting back to the basics as a small open economy which it has totally neglected in the past six years.</P>

<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to return to a theme about which I feel strongly.  This motion gives us an opportunity to highlight issues which are relevant to my constituency and to many other constituencies, namely, high prices and high costs for businesses, the knock-on effect on employment in many constituencies, the lack of infrastructure and how this prevents job creation in rural Ireland and the foolish spending and lending decade over which Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats presided which we now see spiralling out of control.</P>
        <P>On the Adjournment Debate last week, I tried to emphasise the catastrophic effect rising costs have had on businesses all over the country.  I used the example of Bulmers in Clonmel where considerable job losses occurred over two weeks ago.  I pointed to an admission by the management of the company that one difficult summer coupled with what it described as unfavourable market trading conditions resulted in the loss of 150 jobs in Clonmel, County Tipperary.  However much it attempts to deny this, the Government&rsquo;s mismanagement of the economy is to blame for job losses all over the country, including some of those announced today.</P>
        <P>I am sorry for the people in Galway who, so close to Christmas, are facing the loss of their jobs.  I was in Clonmel this morning and people were worried about a second announcement of job losses.  It could have happened in south Tipperary but I am glad it did not.</P>
        <P>With Ireland&rsquo;s ability to compete internationally being damaged by the Government&rsquo;s inept management of the economy, it is essential more is done to develop native Irish industry.  For the sake of riding out one difficult season, what supports has the Government provided in the example I gave?  For a plan costing Bulmers &euro;15 million with savings of &euro;10 million, the Government has thrown a small amount of research and development funding at Clonmel.  How can this <Col N="1872"/>be acceptable when employer after employer has disappeared from town and country?  All roads for locals looking for jobs lead to Dublin and abroad.  The Bulmers issue must be tackled and the Government must share the blame for what has happened.</P>
        <P>Another shocking and mind-boggling statistic which emerged from the National Competitiveness Council is that household borrowing doubled between 2003 and 2007.  Is it any wonder people are crippled by debt?  It all falls back on the poor and middle income earners among whom borrowings have spiralled out of control.</P>

       <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />supports the Government&rsquo;s commitment to make Ireland a leading knowledge and innovation economy and the recent achievement of the Strategy for Science technology and Innovation which will strengthen further our performance taking into account the emergence of competition from the new <Col N="1873"/>and emerging economies including India and China; and</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />welcomes the reports of the National Competitiveness Council which recognise Ireland&rsquo;s remarkable economic progress over the past 15 years that has given us the resources to further enhance and strengthen national competitiveness.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome this timely debate on the issue of economic competitiveness because it addresses a fundamental issue for our country.  This is the first generation of Irish people to have the opportunity to work and build a prosperous future in their own country because we have embraced the opportunity of competing in the international economy.  Success has been built and sustained and today we have an economy of which we can be proud.  Ireland is a magnet for many across Europe who seek opportunity.</P>
        <P>To succeed we must be competitive but this House will make itself marginal in meeting the challenge of competitiveness if it refuses to acknowledge progress where it is evident or to be willing to take tough economic and fiscal decisions where they are necessary.  Competitiveness is a serious and complex issue which deserves a serious debate which rises above the sort of opportunism and selective use of statistics which has come to characterise Fine Gael&rsquo;s use of Private Members&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>One of the more consistent themes of the last decade has been the refusal of Fine Gael to acknowledge any progress and for it to ignore the economy until it sees an opportunity to predict its imminent collapse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>

	<P>During Deputy Phil Hogan&rsquo;s term as spokesman on enterprise, he specialised in graphic descriptions of how the latest announcement of pressures on a company would quickly be followed by dramatic declines in employment throughout the economy.  It is already clear that Deputy Varadkar intends following this lead and is working hard to make Deputy Hogan look restrained and constructive in comparison.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael continues to demand debates but regularly shouts down Ministers when they reply.  There remains not the slightest sign of Fine Gael being willing to take a policy stance which would upset any substantial interest group or to adopt a detailed fiscal policy.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s position is very clear.  We believe that the economy continues to show many signs of strength and all figures show that employment levels are <Col N="1874"/>high and rising.  However, we have to be extremely vigilant about maintaining our competitiveness.  The right policy response does not lend itself to a cheap headline but requires action on a broad range of fronts.  These include responsible fiscal policies, investment in the productive capacity of the economy and reducing the burden of regulation.</P>
        <P>The very reason Ireland&rsquo;s success has been built and sustained across a substantial period is that we have not stood still in our policy responses.  We have not been complacent and have been willing to invest substantial resources putting in place the foundations for long-term success.</P>
        <P>No responsible Government could ever promise every employee in every company that nothing will ever change for them &mdash; that is the path of irresponsible politics.  However, we will promise that no one will match us in terms of our support of the conditions to help companies prosper and individuals to access high-skills, high-pay employment.</P>
        <P>Our progress was unachievable without engaging with the international economy so we cannot expect to be immune from international pressures.  The 2002-03 downturn represented the most significant recession of the last 20 years.  We felt many of the pressures of this but we suffered less and came out stronger than nearly any other developed economy.  This was because we reacted responsibly and we did not run around shouting &ldquo;panic&rdquo; which appears to be the extent of the detail of Fine Gael&rsquo;s economic policy.</P>
        <P>It is instructive that Fine Gael chooses to ignore any positive signs in the economy.  Time and again, its choice is to tell people to be fearful rather to be constructive.  To suggest that this economy is uncompetitive is simply untrue.  It is to deny the facts.  Our living standards are high and rising.  Our economic growth rates remain above the OECD average.  Overall, life chances continue to improve.  Together with Denmark and the Netherlands, we have the lowest unemployment rates in the OECD, the organisation of developed economies.  We also have Europe&rsquo;s largest programme of infrastructure development and a growing record of dynamic achievement in human capital.</P>
        <P>Lest we forget the ultimate goal of competitiveness, we have the fourth highest quality of life under the United Nations human development index.  An uncompetitive economy would not have growing employment, rising living standards or continued significant foreign direct investment.  There is no doubt that we face real threats to our competitiveness, which must be addressed, but to ignore the facts of continued strength makes one incapable of addressing these threats.</P>
        <P>Sustained growth has resulted in the numbers at work increasing by 760,000 between 1997 and the third quarter of this year, an increase of 55%<Col N="1875"/>.  This was not mentioned by any Member of the Opposition in their opening speeches this evening.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The success of the Irish labour market over the past decade has been unparalleled in the recent history of Europe.  At the same time unemployment has more than halved to just over 4% and long-term unemployment has fallen to less than 1.5%.  Our employment performance has been particularly impressive since 2003, with labour-intensive sectors to the fore of the economic upturn.</P>
        <P>The last quarterly national household survey on the labour market showed that while the pace of employment growth moderated, it is still firmly positive.  The number of persons in employment grew by almost 68,000 or 3.3% in the year to the third quarter of 2007.  This does not reflect the picture of a rapidly declining economy painted by Fine Gael today or at any time in recent years.</P>

        <P>One of the key elements of our enterprise strategy is to improve the level and quality of our support for indigenous firms so that we help them become an even more important driver of growth.  However, foreign direct investment, FDI, remains important and contradicts the picture of economic decline painted by Fine Gael.  FDI simply could not continue at the rates we saw in some past years but our stock of direct inward investment is five times greater than the OECD average.  Ireland continues to attract a large number of international greenfield investment projects, relative to its size.  The 2006 world investment report shows that we are first in the OECD for the number of greenfield foreign investment projects <i>per capita</i>.</P><Col N="1876"/>
        <P>The very sad and disappointing decision today by Abbott Laboratories to close the vascular device facility in Galway is particularly difficult and challenging for the workers and we will do everything we can to support them through the three State agencies &mdash; F&Aacute;S, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  Galway has about 5,500 jobs in the medical sector alone and is one of the most advanced clusters for medical technology in Europe, never mind this country.  We are confident we can do more, particularly with the Oranmore and Athenry developments, to replace the jobs that have been lost.  However, I point out to Deputy Clune that Abbott Laboratories has between nine and ten sites in Ireland, with more than 3,300 jobs, and has made a very significant contribution to the economy.  Our task is to work with it to see if we can build more here and, in particular, to look after the workers in Galway.</P>
        <P>We are now seen externally as a small economic powerhouse.  We are now recognised as a location of choice by some of the most sophisticated industries and services in the world.  We have worked hard to carefully yet prudently influence economic activity into new areas that open up different yet more sustainable sources of competitive advantage, such as life sciences, biotechnology, services and related research, development and innovation.  Deputy Tom Hayes spoke about south Tipperary.  In the name of God, we have had Abbott Laboratories and Boston Scientific in Clonmel.  Abbott Laboratories have 1,300 jobs in Clonmel.  I received a deputation today from north Tipperary with Deputies Lowry and Hoctor.  They would give their right arm for even one of the companies received by south Tipperary in the past four or five years, such as Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme in Ballydine, Johnson &amp; Johnson with Alza and Cordis in Cashel.  These are very significant FDI investments.  It is extraordinary how the Deputy can stand up here and lament the performance of south Tipperary in respect of foreign direct investment.</P>

        <P>These changes make a real impact on the nature of economic activity and employment in the economy.  Our approach to investment gives confidence to investors.  Between 1999 and 2007, chemical-pharma sites expanded, with a total investment of &euro;1.3 billion on existing sites.  During the same period, there were 16 greenfield developments, with an investment of &euro;5 billion and more than 5,000 new jobs.  This sector exported almost &euro;42 billion worth of goods in 2006, an increase of 269% since 1997.  Manufacturing yield and its output have gone up because of technological innovation and people doing the right thing for future viability.  Jobs have declined but the important point is that we are very competitive on high-end manufacturing and should stay that way.  In respect of the point I made about the investments to which I have just alluded, they are very significant investment decisions by the companies involved.  They are only made where companies can expect long-term benefits and have clear visibility around the competitive attractions and strengths of our economy.  Otherwise, they would not have made these investment decisions.</P>
        <P>Last year, when total employment exceeded two million for the first time, net job creation in the agencies, both in the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, was the highest since 2000.  A recent FDI index put Ireland at number two in the EU-15 for FDI inflows.  We are not talking about averages; Ireland was placed second.  An international report recently showed that Ireland attracted more foreign investment in life sciences than any other European country in the 12 months from July 2006 to June of this year.  This is a picture of growth and competitiveness &mdash; not the picture of decline and uncompetitiveness painted by Fine Gael.</P>
        <P>International investment decisions to invest here are not goodwill gestures &mdash; they are made on the basis of hard facts, critical evaluation and confidence in Ireland.  The IMD world competitiveness yearbook ranks Ireland as second in investment incentives and first in corporate tax rate on profit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister give way on that point? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly will not.  I have allowed six speakers to speak without interruption.  </P>
        <P>The motion&rsquo;s statement in respect of exports is another example of not letting the facts get in the way of an attack.  CSO data for the first eight months of this year show that merchandise <Col N="1878"/>exports rose by 5% compared to the same eight-month period in 2006.  This is impressive, considering that significant portions of our exports are priced in dollars.  This means that the nominal value of exports will inevitably be influenced by movements in the currency markets, such as the ongoing steady fall in the value of the dollar against the euro.  This is particularly significant given that the United States is our largest single merchandise export market, accounting for about 20% of these exports.</P>
        <P>In addition to merchandise trade, the other element of our external trade is the services sector.  There has been continued improvement in the level of this trade.  It is noteworthy that exports of services rose by 49% between 2003 and 2006, which is substantially greater than the rise in services imports of 30% for the same period.  These figures represent a narrowing of the deficit between services imports and exports during this period by an impressive 33%.  The Opposition has not mentioned services this evening.   This strong performance of our services trade needs to be considered in respect of our share of global trade.  Our share of world services trade rose from 1.24% in 2000 to 1.87% in 2002 and further upwards to 2.54% in 2006.  It is a very significant achievement.  We have doubled our world share of services trade in six years.  It reflects our strong competitiveness advantage in the services sector, which generally embraces the more highly developed parts of the economy.  We have more to do in this area and are developing a more strategic approach to services through major work undertaken by Forf&aacute;s and others.</P>
        <P>Last year, Enterprise Ireland clients won &euro;1.7 billion in new export sales.  Even exports to the US, with the weakening dollar, were up 12.5% in Enterprise Ireland client companies and, significantly, 24% growth was seen in our exports to Asia.  All of the targets set by Enterprise Ireland in its strategic vision over the past three years were exceeded.  The Opposition did not mention that in its commentary this evening in respect of our contribution to the indigenous sector.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s new strategy firmly captures the importance of building exports and exporters of scale.  We are making a big effort to address the capacity of indigenous firms to expand export markets.  Some of what we are doing is long term, such as starting trade missions to new and growing markets such as that to the Middle East and last year&rsquo;s successful visit to India.  It takes time to build a market presence but we are making the early investments for future export growth.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland has opened an office in Brazil to help Irish companies access the growing opportunities in that fast expanding market.</P>
        <P>We achieved this strength by a willingness to embrace the continued need to develop and change policies &mdash; to avoid complacency &mdash; and this remains our policy.  One of the reasons I have <Col N="1879"/>continued to actively engage with and support the work of the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, is that competitiveness is a core economic objective for this Government.  Where Fine Gael chooses selective quotations from the NCC&rsquo;s reports, we are progressing on a range of areas to address the challenges it points to.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister disagree with the Central Bank when it says the volume of exports is down this year?  </P>

	<P>The Minister, without interruption. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In a short debate, it is not possible to address all of areas where action is planned or required.  I will highlight a few.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a selective use of statistics. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of the great advances in our economy and the social progress they have enabled have come from the recognition that the State should play the role of enabler rather than controller.  Regulation is an important part of this, where we have to seek a balance between regulation necessary to protect consumers and employees and the light hand required to let those who create employment get on with their business.  While there are some who object to any regulation, the facts show that the overall level of regulation in Ireland is relatively low according to international benchmarks.  However, it is an area of ongoing interest to business and it is where we can draw new sources of competitiveness.  A good example is the Government&rsquo;s increase in the audit exemption limits, which is estimated to have saved business between &euro;10 million and &euro;20 million.</P>
        <P>The immediate priority areas for the group established under the Secretary General in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are taxation returns, health and safety requirements, statistical requirements, environmental legislation and employment and company law.  That group is already working on specific proposals and is addressing these areas as a priority.  We have also prepared a toolkit for use in conducting regulatory impact assessments which includes a specific section on assessing the impact of any proposed new regulations on small business.</P>
        <P>We must push forward with regulatory oversight which is strong enough to achieve its objective but light enough not to hinder competitiveness.  Good examples of progress, unacknowledged by Fine Gael, include compliance with good manufacturing practice inspections by the Irish Medicines Board which gives Irish companies a key competitive advantage <Col N="1880"/>against industries in other regions around the world.  A forthcoming Forf&aacute;s report will show that no pharmaceutical manufacturing site in Ireland has received a warning from a regulatory body in the past ten years, which is an outstanding performance and a major tribute to the manufacturing excellence of workers in our facilities.  Can some Member of the Opposition acknowledge that Ireland is world class in manufacturing?  Why must they knock it all the time, try to undermine it and pretend it is not happening?  We should celebrate and acknowledge it.</P>
        <P>However, we must keep pushing forward and we will do so, especially in the task of building an appreciation of the needs of enterprise into the work of the public service.  We can and must strive to embrace innovation in the public service.  Ringing condemnation of the public service will achieve nothing.  I suggest that some of the Opposition commentary is fine in a rhetorical sense but pretty useless in terms of advancing any policy agenda with the public sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>A bit like the Minister&rsquo;s ten years of managing the public service &mdash; worth nothing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The easiest thing is to knock the public service but the more difficult process is to engage with change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>It is Fine Gael&rsquo;s turn to try.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Varadkar has an extraordinarily bleak vision of the public service and is welcome to it.  If one compares its work today to that of 20 years ago, one sees vast difference and significant improvements.</P>
        <P>These continuing efforts have resulted in Ireland being ranked eighth out of 178 countries in terms of ease of doing business and fifth for ease of starting a business.  I could not believe the commentary of the Opposition on small business.  The Government has worked hard in respect of the implementation of the small business forum and SMEs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is not listening to what small businesses say on the ground.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The seed capital scheme and the business expansion scheme were radically reformed in last year&rsquo;s budget.  The bureaucracy of VAT returns improved dramatically for small business, the management development council was established and &euro;175 million of venture capital has been contributed by the State through Enterprise Ireland, which will leverage &euro;1 billion in private sector venture capital for new starting enterprise.  I remind Deputy Clune that the global entrepreneurial monitor has <Col N="1881"/>placed Ireland second for start-up companies in the EU 25.  That is the record on small business in this country.  There has been a dramatic mindset, motivated by Government encouragement of entrepreneurial activity and a tax system that is light on labour and facilitates investment decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Why are small businesses complaining about the rate of inflation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The motion is correct in pointing to productivity as an important part of competitiveness.  Without strong productivity growth, we cannot maintain high standards of living and high incomes.  However, Fine Gael has chosen to ignore the fact that our productivity levels have converged with those of the OECD and continue to improve.  The important sectors in which our economy is successful show significant and positive productivity differences against our competitors.  For example, in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, finance, and even agriculture and food, our productivity is not only above rates in the most developed EU countries, but also higher than the much acclaimed and vaunted rates of the United States.  In another part of the NCC report ignored by Fine Gael, it is recognised that we have a strong or improving performance when it comes to productivity growth in services and in the primary sectors of the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is reading a different report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>This is incredibly important because expanding productivity in key higher value added sectors is the core of being competitive.  It demonstrates in clear and unambiguous terms that Ireland is both productive and competitive. </P>
        <P>Key international reports state that we display a strong capacity to work with technology and human resources to expand the productivity frontier and innovate stronger competitive advantage in key sectors.  The World Economic Forum this year ranks Ireland first out of 131 countries on the connection between foreign direct investment and technology transfer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>This is selective use of statistics.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Varadkar did not quote this and has quoted very little of what I have quoted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister accused Fine Gael of selective use of statistics.  The Minister is a total hypocrite.  It is embarrassing.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1882"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>From another perspective, we cannot have high productivity and consequently incomes without a serious commitment to innovation.  Clever innovation and innovation based on our research base will drive our success in demanding markets.  According to the fourth Community innovation survey, Ireland performs above the EU 15 average.  This further underlines the continuing competitive attributes of the economy.  It reflects the contribution of research and development and innovation programmes that are now the foundation of a successful enterprise policy.</P>
        <P>I welcome the inclusion of a point about research in Fine Gael&rsquo;s motion but it is notable that the motion continues the party&rsquo;s decade-long failure to make a positive proposal in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I just made one and the Minister has not acknowledged it.  He refers to the negative but should take the positive elements from what I said.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>There is too much interruption.  Deputies should allow the Minister to continue with his speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Without high-level research we cannot hope to be a success in the future.  We have been world class at exploiting new ideas but we must also become world class in generating those ideas.  This is why we have prioritised research and development policy consistently during our time in office.  This has never been a substantial item on the Opposition&rsquo;s agenda and it has required major resources from the Government to be allocated in the face of many other more prominent demands but this has been the right policy.</P>
        <P>If Deputy Varadkar were to take the time to check the record, he would see that we created every single element of today&rsquo;s research support infrastructure.  When I was Minister for Education and Science, I was able to end the situation where the total research funding in that Department was zero.  When I announced details of a dedicated fund for science and technology in education, the response of the then spokesman, Deputy Richard Bruton, on behalf of Fine Gael was first that we were proposing too much and then that we were proposing too little.  This fail<Col N="1883"/>ure to credibly engage with the Government on research policy has continued to today.  To challenge the Government on this shows the overall lack of credibility or substance in Fine Gael&rsquo;s addiction to attack-led policy making.  I established the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, which made an enduring impact on the Irish landscape.</P>
        <P>The recent publication of world university rankings by the prestigious <i>The Times Higher Education Supplement</i> shows universities here are reaping the benefit of the increased investment from PRTLI, SFI and other funding sources.  Trinity College has moved up to 53rd place, while UCD has broken into the elite 200 for the first time, at 177th.  UCC and DCU have risen more than 100 places into the top 300.</P>
        <P>All objective reports show that Ireland has been making dramatic strides forward in supporting research activity and preparing it to have a substantial economic impact.  The strategy for science, technology and innovation published this year is a significant roadmap to a knowledge economy.  Over &euro;8 billion is earmarked for this area, representing a trebling of funding on the previous six years.</P>
        <P>In the field of education, the Minister and the Department of Education and Science are implementing many radical changes.  Through the strategic innovation fund, our universities are being rewarded with funding based on quality rather than quantity for the first time.  The expansion of over 30% in student numbers, which we have supported in third level participation, is being underpinned by dramatic investment in the range and quality of courses and infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Each of the agencies under my Department is playing a significant part in prompting and supporting the rapid expansion of world class research.  The work of SFI is a great example in this regard.  Last month, I announced the result of funding competitions for groundbreaking industry and academic projects.  The groups funded will be co-operating with a total of 48 distinct companies and have captured the interest of both multinational corporations and indigenous companies.  As a result of this investment in these new research clusters, approximately 490 highly qualified personnel, including principal investigators, post doctoral students and PhD students, will participate in cutting edge research projects.</P>
        <P>SFI has shown how we have created funding programmes which combine support for the highest international academic standards and industrial collaboration.  To date, over 400 different companies are collaborating with scientists supported by SFI.  Commissioner Potocnik and other international guests at the recent SFI science summit talked about Ireland&rsquo;s growing reputation as a centre of advanced research.  This was not mentioned by Fine Gael in its opening to this <Col N="1884"/>debate because it has shown no interest in the work of researchers and institutions which are providing the foundation for our future competitiveness.</P>
        <P>We are fully conscious of the need to ensure that research is integrated into our economy and our enterprise sector.  To that end, it is my intention that we will take initiatives to develop sustainable career paths for researchers and improve the ability of enterprise to employ the PhDs emerging from the increased investment in world class research.  These initiatives help shape a situation where approximately 70% of PhD output will find employment in enterprise and industry.</P>
        <P>Progress is not confined to SFI or schemes funded by the Department of Education and Science.  IDA Ireland is actively encouraging companies already here to undertake research and development activities in Ireland.  A total of 54 research and development investment projects, involving a total investment of almost &euro;500 million, were supported by IDA Ireland in 2006.  These investments will create the jobs for highly skilled people and many of the companies are working with SFI-supported researchers in higher level institutions.  Recent indicators, both national and international, show that we are clearly moving in the right direction and that significant investment is beginning to have an impact. The total research and development spend across all sectors of the economy increased by 14.3% to over &euro;2.2 billion in 2006.</P>
        <P>Realising the commercial potential of Irish-based research and development is a major priority for the Government.  Our aim is to accelerate the commercialisation of research by stimulating and facilitating interaction between industry and the research infrastructure.  Under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s commercialisation fund, 155 projects to support and develop programmes with commercial potential were approved last year.</P>
        <P>We have also taken a special approach to smaller companies, which are, in terms of numbers, the backbone of our enterprise economy.  Earlier this year we established the innovation voucher initiative, specifically for micro-enterprises, on the recommendation from the Small Business Forum.  Already, 350 companies have been awarded innovation vouchers, which they can use to explore business opportunities or problems with institutes of technology or universities.  It is my intention that we will move to expand scope and level of support relating to this initiative.</P>
        <P>European Commission approval of the State aids element of the revised IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland research and development scheme has recently been secured.  The newly designed schemes will be launched early in the new year.  It is intended that the more streamlined schemes, with enhanced budgets proposed, will <Col N="1885"/>facilitate more companies to take a step forward in competitiveness through innovation.</P>
        <P>It is a simple fact that no European country has ever gone so far so fast in respect of developing its research capacity.  Starting from an incredibly low base, we are now getting places.  One small example of this can be seen in the critical area of immunology, where the most recent survey shows that Irish scientists ranked second in the world for citations in international journals.  Developing and using knowledge is core to our competitiveness and we are on the right track in this regard.</P>
        <P>While advanced research is key to competitiveness, so too is the challenge of helping all people to achieve and renew a high level of skills.  Labour markets are changing at an increasingly fast pace.  We can either ignore these changes or support people and businesses in responding to them.  This is why labour market programmes will continue to receive a high level of support.</P>
        <P>Fundamentally, our human resources are at the centre of our competitive advantage.  It was because of the importance of education and skills for our economic development that I launched a national skills strategy.  The latter sets out clear objectives for developing Ireland&rsquo;s human capital, through upskilling, training and education, for the period to 2020. It is estimated that 1.4 million people in our workforce today will still be there in 2020.  The majority of these, in excess of 300,000, currently do not possess a leaving certificate or equivalent qualification.  Our strategy will see an additional 500,000 employees being upskilled by at least one level on the national framework of qualifications by 2020.  Resources allocated to this area have, in only three years, increased by almost 900%.  As a result, this year 55,000 people in employment will be supported in upskilling by F&Aacute;S and Skillsnet.  Under the national development plan, we will invest approximately &euro;2.8 billion on upskilling Ireland&rsquo;s workforce.  This policy is being supported by funding and it is delivering action.</P>
        <P>The competitiveness of the economy also requires the significant upgrading of our physical infrastructure.  This is happening at an unprecedented rate.  The completion of the projects funded under the NDP will significantly raise the productive capacity of our economy and are already having a positive impact.  We are investing close to three times the EU average on physical infrastructure.  We are coming, in historical terms, from a much lower base than our European counterparts in this regard.  However, when travelling from Cork to Dublin I have noticed the difference.  The world does not begin and end in Dublin but there have been significant changes here.  Throughout the country one can see the manifestation of the investment on physical infrastructure.  The plan for the period up to 2010 is also in place.</P>

	<P>Inflation is a concern and we must work to reduce the level at which it stands.  However, people must face reality regarding the origins of inflation.  It is important to distinguish between external factors, which are beyond domestic policy control, and internal factors.  Externally, the main cause is higher mortgage interest payments due to ECB interest rate increases.  Excluding mortgage interest repayments, the rate of increase in the CPI inflation rate would have been 2.6% in 2006.  Mortgage interest is adding approximately 2% to inflation at present.  Foodstuffs and oil have also seen price increases and these too contribute, both directly and indirectly, to inflation.  The Opposition likes to claim that we are to blame for everything that ever goes wrong.  However, to blame us for world commodity prices is stretching it beyond even its own elastic standards.</P>
        <P>Inflation is also higher here because of higher growth in the economy.  If the Opposition wants to argue for lower growth, that is fine, but it should tell us which jobs should not have been created and which investments should not have been made.</P>

	<P>On the European measure of comparable inflation rates, inflation measured 2.7% last year.  The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority expects the figure for this year to be approximately 2.8% this year but to decline to the euro area average next year.  Nevertheless, cost pressures are a concern.  The Government has not increased indirect taxes in three successive budgets in order to help restrain inflationary pressures.  I abolished the groceries order to bring more price competition into the consumer&rsquo;s shopping basket.  On that issue, Fine Gael managed to have three positions in a single day and it now has a policy of reducing prices to consumers by increasing prices paid to producers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude by saying that the responsible fiscal policies we have <Col N="1887"/>pursued have enabled us to deliver the most competitive tax regime in Europe.  In this we have been opposed every year by Fine Gael, which continues the policy of attacking general increases while demanding countless specific increases.  Lower taxes, higher social supports and a falling debt burden are what we have achieved by taking the route of substance over soundbites, and we will continue on that road.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputies opposite for tabling the motion.  The best benchmark of how a country is doing is to look at its capacity to generate new, sustainable jobs and advance the standard of living of its citizens. Ultimately, that is what good macro-economic and sound enterprise policies deliver and we will continue with our work in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>It is opportune and important that we should address the underlying issues which threaten our competitiveness, but we cannot do so by adopting simplistic solutions or right wing views.  We must recognise progress where it is made and ensure that we do not talk down the economy, which must be robust to take on and withstand the challenges ahead.  Competitiveness is a multifaceted subject and we must examine all the factors and inputs in an integrated way to see how they interact.  This will assist us in maintaining our ability to create sustainable jobs.</P>
        <P>A simplistic analysis is fine.  It may well be hammered out on the anvil of right wing solutions, but the Labour Party is not of that view.  We take issue with significant elements of the motion tabled by Fine Gael.  It is amazing that the motion does not refer to construction inflation, house price inflation or anything of that nature.  In recent years, the increase in the price of houses has contributed to significant inflationary pressures.  Many young people are unable to purchase houses or establish themselves on the property ladder.  Mortgage interest has a significant input in this regard.  Why are these inflationary issues not dealt with in the motion?</P>
        <P>Another point I wish to raise relates to the rush to privatisation.  Everyone is in favour of value for money.  The Labour Party has no ideological hang-ups regarding PPPs.  My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, has lead a campaign in respect of Ceannt Station in Galway, the site relating to which comprises 14.6 acres.  As long ago as 2002, CIE suggested giving up nine of these acres for residential development.  What is not needed in this instance is a rush towards privatisation or the giving away of valuable resources which the State needs to serve its people.  A <Col N="1888"/>multi-modal, integrated regional transport infrastructure model is required for cities such as Galway.  What must be done, in the first instance, is to examine the integrated provision required to serve the region.  The idea of giving away a significant proportion of existing assets in a rush to satisfy some need for privatisation is absolutely and fundamentally crazy.  It is also anathema to everything for which the Labour Party stands.  Issues relating to how an integrated regional transport hub can be put in place in Galway must be dealt with first.  That is why Deputy Michael D. Higgins has taken a strong and principled stand and we support him in his efforts.</P>
        <P>I am surprised that the motion refers to public sector pay.  Thousands of public servants are living on the bread line.  At the lower end, 160,000 of them earn less than &euro;35,000 per annum.  How can anyone say that these people are causing a problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>When one takes into account costs relating to housing, accommodation, transport and child care, many public servants are of the opinion that they would be better off on social welfare payments.  I must make clear that the Labour Party cannot support that part of the motion, as drafted by Fine Gael.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to comment on privatisation.  We should look at Great Britain, where there was a headlong rush to privatise everything.  A granny&rsquo;s cat was not safe over there because someone would have privatised it.  Of course the odd Labour Party person was in Tory clothes, which was part of the problem.  I said that in this House and it did not go down too well.  Privatisation of water services and train services in Britain left a trail of destruction.  We had the botched privatisation of Eircom and that is why we are lagging behind in broadband roll-out.  If we had some control of Eircom when it started out, things might have been different.  There were inefficiencies and we must address those in any utility.  However, we have no control over privatised companies, which then rush to the huge urban centres to provide a service while saying goodbye to rural areas.</P>
        <P>Broadband is so important to e-commerce.  Many years ago I attended an IRD in Kiltimagh and I felt very humbled among the high-powered people there.  One man from Mayo was communicating with Moscow and selling his wares there, in Japan and elsewhere.  He had created eight or ten jobs through the telecottaging industry.  That is where the future lies.  Small and medium enterprises in rural areas will save this country.  We must throw down the red carpet before those people.  The IDA does a good job, but it puts the red carpet before the multinational companies.  They are very important, but we must not forget <Col N="1889"/>the individual entrepreneur.  The people living in the back of beyonds who provide six to eight jobs are absolutely crucial in keeping this country alive and in ensuring the sustainability of many rural centres.  We do not want to have anymore to do with this privatisation agenda, which has seen us suffer in the past few years.</P>
        <P>The total number of jobs created is important, as is the quality of those jobs.  Since 2000, about 65% of new jobs created were in construction and the public sector.  There is a decline in the construction industry and the Government states the public sector wage bill is spiralling.  However, I think it is not.  Some people in the public sector earn decent money, but most are only doing okay.  It is not sustainable.  The SME sector is generating 500,000 jobs, which is critically important, but it is clear from declining tax revenues that the jobs currently being created are low-wage, part-time jobs that fall out of the tax net.  Every year the Minister of Finance tells us that many more are out of the tax net.  The reason that is happening is more people are in low-wage, low-skilled jobs.</P>
        <P>The future of competitiveness for Ireland does not lie in these low-cost jobs, but in building a platform of competitive advantage that will create and sustain higher quality jobs.  We need a quantum leap in skills and training for our workforce.  The leaving certificate cannot be the finishing line.  It must be a springboard to further education.  The Minister has acknowledged that in some of his policies, but it is important.  I appreciate there must be a job for everyone, because most of my brothers and sisters did not go beyond the leaving certificate.  However, in a competitive environment we must look at it like that from now on.  It is important for equity, but also to attract investment from high-tech industry and services.</P>
        <P>According to the expert group on future needs and skills, a continuation of the existing skills policy will result in the demand for labour outstripping supply by 310,000 by 2010.  Within that figure, we will have a significant shortage of people in further and higher education and a surplus of low-skilled workers.  That is the challenge.  This dire forecast is presumably why the Government commissioned the national skills strategy in the first place.  It is a pity there is no real co-operation between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Education and Science in implementing its recommendations.</P>
        <P>We need to invest in further and higher education, but also in access to that education.  We need to develop a national framework of qualifications that makes it easy for individuals and employers to see how to build on skills and transfer training.  We need to support people to take annual paid training leave and work with employers to incentivise work-place training, <Col N="1890"/>particularly with low-skilled workers.  We need to stop the waste of human talent and the potential lost through poverty and disadvantage, and wage a war on educational inequality.  This should start with universal preschooling, which is proven to give children the skills to get more from subsequent education.</P>
        <P>We need to get creative about how we fund and develop Ireland&rsquo;s research capabilities.  It is essential that we move from manufacturing and exporting products invented elsewhere to inventing the products and services for the future ourselves.  We need an era of indigenous industrial innovation, driven by Irish entrepreneurs.  We need to switch tax incentives from bricks and mortar to high-tech start-ups that will create jobs in the future.  As well as creating a climate that fosters private investment in domestic innovation, we need to ensure our universities have the resources and capability to compete in the global market for research, investment and talent.</P>
        <P>Employer PRSI is a burden.  Wages of &euro;50,000 cost the employer &euro;56,000.  Energy costs are taxed at 3 cent per litre higher than elsewhere.  Regulation is another bugbear of mine and I could talk all night about it.  The Government has contributed to cost inflation in a number of areas and this must be addressed to ensure we remain competitive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Labour Party for the opportunity to address this important issue, especially when we are facing a downturn in the economy.  I agree entirely with Deputy Penrose.  I have personally seen the IDA hosting prospective foreign direct investors in the lap of luxury.  I could hardly lift the big long-stem wine glasses provided, not to mind drink from them.  There is a stark contrast between the approach by the IDA to those investors and the treatment of indigenous entrepreneurs who have to go through a myriad of offices to find out what is available to them.  Indigenous industry remains the backbone of our economy, in spite of the occasional love affair with FDI.  Like the previous speaker, I am not opposed to FDI and I wish we could have some in every village.  However, those companies do not stay here and they do not have the same commitment to our economy as the indigenous person.  The small operations across this island remain the backbone of the economy.  Those people will not be flying to the cheaper labour economies in eastern Europe or Asia.  They will stay here to drive this economy and it is very important that we look after them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no proper infrastructure to facilitate those people.  The links between here and the west of Ireland are pathetic.  Broadband is not just an issue for places like the west.  In my constituency, parts of places like the Cooley Peninsula, Kilkerley and Hackballscross do not have access to broadband.  Crossmaglen, a rural village <Col N="1891"/>just three miles down the road, has perfect access to broadband.  Why is that?  It is because this Government privatised Eircom and has hampered the rollout of broadband across this State.  It has hampered the development of this economy to anything like its potential.  That is to be regretted.  The current Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has taken a &euro;10 million sum away from the roll-out of broadband and diverted it elsewhere.  There is a dubious question mark over what the Minister has done with that money.</P>
        <P>Education is key to what we must do in the future.  For some considerable time we have argued for three and a half hours of preschool for the year before a child goes into education.  The Government has not taken that up, although it has taken up some of our other suggestions.  The sooner it takes this one up the better.  There are key issues on the third and fourth levels that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>There is no denying that this State has made remarkable economic progress over the past 15 years.  That progress has been marred by the fact that the hard work that brought about such a successful competitive economy has not in all cases been fairly rewarded.  While business generally has reaped the benefits, many workers remain low paid and without essentials such as child care and proper pension plans.  That is an ongoing problem and we are aware of the dangers of the social insurance fund.  This is still not being addressed.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance will improve on some of that tomorrow when he has the opportunity to do so.</P>
        <P>We have failed to use our successful economy for the benefit of society as a whole.  We have one of the highest child poverty rates in Europe and the income disparity between our least well off and our best has widened almost beyond repair.  Nevertheless, we still have the opportunity to use our economy to the advantage of all.  To do that, we must ensure it continues to grow.  We all agree on that but we disagree on how we should go about it.  I have significant reservations on the Government&rsquo;s approach to that.  While Ireland still ranks among the most competitive economies globally, our competitiveness rankings have fallen since 2000, as the motion says, by 17 places, and that is worrying.  There are myriad reasons for this, including increases in consumption and investment rather than strong export growth, the slow-down in Irish productivity growth, particularly in high-tech sectors, the contribution of net exports to economic growth being small or negative in recent years and the high reliance on the construction sector for employment.  Since 2000, 65% of new jobs have been created in public services and construction.  Manufacturing and agriculture lost jobs over the same period.  These are worrying trends.  Improving competitiveness <Col N="1892"/>will not be easy.  It will depend on key decisions in areas such as regulation, finance and social capital and physical and knowledge infrastructure.</P>
        <P>My party has long argued that ending the partition of our country will contribute to the building of a strong, competitive economy.  Much of the business community, North and South, is behind us in this demand.  The Border has only ever served to harm our ability to compete internationally.  We have duplicate government and public service structures, unnecessary administrative burden onthose wishing to do business in both jurisdictions and two currencies.  We are competing with ourselves for economic investment.  A nascent all-Ireland economy already exists.  We need the Government in this State to step up its engagement in joint planning in a number of areas, including energy, communications, tourism, transport, environment, education and health, in other words the &ldquo;common chapter&rdquo; as agreed by the all-Ireland ministerial council.  Some Departments have been energetic on this but more is needed from others.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s physical infrastructure North and South remains a source of acute competitive disadvantage.  Successive Governments over the boom years have failed to introduce the infrastructure needed to attract foreign direct investment and enhance domestic business as well as ordinary people&rsquo;s lives.  It took this State decades to finally begin building the third lane on the M50.  We pay the highest rates for broadband, which is the slowest in Europe.  Our house prices have pushed more and more workers away from cities and have added to personal debt as well as traffic congestion and commuting problems.  In transport, energy, information and communication technology, Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure lags well behind those of comparable countries in the OECD.</P>
        <P>We have a knowledge deficit.  Participation in pre-primary education in Ireland is well below the European average.  Several budgets ago Sinn F&eacute;in proposed the introduction of free preschooling to go towards solving both the child care crisis and beginning the process of lifelong learning from an early age.  We must also deal with the fact that many of our children don&rsquo;t make it through secondary school and the fact that our illiteracy levels are outrageously high for a First World country.  We must examine why none of Ireland&rsquo;s third and fourth level institutions are ranked among the best in the world.  The use of ICT also remains relatively poor in Irish education.</P>
        <P>Our approach to research and development is a concern for Sinn F&eacute;in.  While we have made belated strides in this regard, employment and expenditure on research and development remains well below leading comparable countries in both higher education and enterprise.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants an all-Ireland research and develop<Col N="1893"/>ment strategy, co-ordinated through the enterprise development agencies, central and local government, business, trade unions and educational institutions, including a programme of extra assistance to SMEs and new businesses to develop new research and development business plans.  We must examine how we use our human resources to build competitiveness.  The lack of affordable and accessible child care is hindering our labour force by dragging people away from the workplace and keeping large numbers of predominantly women out of the workforce.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s policies on child care are on record, but as I stated, the introduction of preschool places is a priority.  We also need employers to take up their responsibilities and provide child care facilities in the workplace.  This is a crucial step.</P>
        <P>A large section of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s budget proposal focuses on the issue of welfare to work.  There is a group of people who are ready, willing and able to work, but they are caught in poverty and welfare traps.  We suggest an overhaul of the social welfare system to accommodate people returning to work and that the State&rsquo;s training bodies such as F&Aacute;S lift their game in offering upskilling.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise the serious allegations made by a Finnish pathologist that the pathological laboratory services in Cork University Hospital are in a chaotic situation and the serious implications for patients using these services if the allegations are proven to be correct.</P>
        <P>In recent days, there were disturbing developments about the hiring of the locum specialist at the heart of the review of cancer tests of 166 patients.  These developments raise serious questions about the structures, criteria and standards in place for the employment of locums, especially in view of the fact that glowing references for the locum in question had been provided for Cork University Hospital by University Hospital Galway as well as the news that he had received his licence to practise in Ireland just days after a Finnish investigation put a second negligence file on his record.</P>
        <P>One of the questions that must be answered tonight is why this doctor was employed twice and given a glowing reference despite what happened in Finland.  However, instead of answering questions and providing reassurances for the public, the Government in recent times has put in place approximately seven reviews that seem to go on forever, but they never report.  Even if a <Col N="1894"/>report is near completion, we are told that legal obstacles may prevent or delay publication.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Reilly, yesterday identified seven outstanding reports but despite these reports being in the pipeline, it is becoming more difficult to get answers on what is happening.  The HSE and the Minister have refused to give details of any background checks carried out on the Finnish doctor it hired despite a finding of negligence against him in Finland.  We got no answers to serious questions about the recruitment procedures applied to locum consultants, an issue that Deputy Martin was supposed to deal with during his time as Minister.  We have no details and answers on what safeguards are being put in place for inter-country appointments.</P>
        <P>The front page of today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> carried an article by Ms Catherine Shanahan containing disturbing comments made by the Finnish pathologist about the contrast in standards between University Hospital Galway and Cork University Hospital.  This Finnish consultant has raised serious concerns about the systems in place for checking samples in Cork University Hospital.  He also alleged that there are serious problems with Cork University Hospital&rsquo;s systems for testing samples, which he described as wrong and inferior to systems in place in Galway.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The difference between the systems in Cork and Galway was as different as night and day.  In Cork . . . the checkers and pathologist did not work side by side.  I told them the system could not stand, that the consultant must be in daily contact with the checkers and look at each slide.  They were not happy when I tried to change the system . . .  It was not a happy experience and I resigned.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Every day it seems there are more problems, revelations and inconsistencies.  The one constant aspect is a lack of accountability and answers from HSE management, the Department and the Minister.  Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that the public will have confidence in the service unless we get some straight and immediate answers.</P>
     
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>My questions are as follows.  What system is in place to ensure the hiring of locums is up to an acceptable high standard?  How many misdiagnoses occurred in Cork and does the recheck need to be extended to ally fears?  Have the women of Cork who have suspected cases that were previously misdiagnosed been informed?  When will the report about Cork be finished and will the Minister guarantee that it will be published before Christmas and will not be legally sanitised and news managed?  Will the Minister accept responsibility for systems failures if these are found?</P>
        <P>I am calling on the Minister to give answers as to what went wrong and what steps it is proposed to take to prevent such problems recurring in the <Col N="1895"/>future.  It is the very least that should be done for those women who have already been so badly failed by cancer services in this country.</P>
        <P>I want answers to the allegations made by Finnish pathologist, Dr. Antoine Geagea, that the only contact he has received from Ireland after resigning his job at CUH was a telephone call from someone claiming to be an official from the Department of Health and Children requesting a copy of the reference he received when leaving Galway to take up his post in Cork.  I want answers to the serious allegations made by him, as reported in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i>, about the quality of services at Cork University Hospital.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  </P>
        <P>The allegation made by the person referred to by the Deputy, that laboratory services within Cork University Hospital are in a chaotic situation, is neither credible nor grounded in reality.  The HSE has advised the Department of Health and Children that, to date, three laboratories at CUH have successfully achieved a high level of clinical pathology accreditation, CPA.  These are the biochemistry, microbiology and blood transfusion laboratories.  The histopathology laboratory, which includes cytopathology services, is awaiting assessment for the same accreditation.  It is expected this will take place in mid-2008.  This is a non-mandatory process which was undertaken by CUH with the full support of the executive management board.</P>
        <P>The current position in relation to the review of pathology services in CUH is as follows.  Since last September, hospital management at CUH has been carrying out a review of pathology services at the hospital as a result of concerns about the work of a single pathologist who worked there on a locum basis for a short period in recent months.  Hospital management commissioned an accredited UK laboratory to undertake an independent review of the temporary pathologist&rsquo;s work.  The Minister for Health and Children and her Department were informed of this review on 23 November last.  The Minister understands that, in the course of this review so far, a small number of patients have been recalled for review and appropriate follow-up by their doctor.  The HSE has informed the Department that it will conclude this review shortly.</P>
        <P>The pathologist concerned resigned from his position at the request of hospital management at CUH, when information relating to his work became known.  The HSE has informed the Department that this pathologist no longer works in any of its hospitals.  Steps have been taken to ensure that the regulatory authorities in the jurisdiction where this person now resides have been <Col N="1896"/>informed so that they can take appropriate action.</P>
        <P>The immediate priorities in any review of clinical services are to establish whether the care of any patient has been compromised and, if so, to inform those patients and ensure they receive, as a matter of priority, any necessary clinical assessment and other services and supports.  The Department is working closely with the HSE to ensure that these protocols are applied in the case of the Cork review.</P>
        <P>The events of recent weeks underscore the absolute need for the HSE national cancer control programme to be implemented as soon as possible.  Professor Tom Keane took up his position as director of the cancer control programme last month.  The HSE is putting arrangements in place to enable Professor Keane to take control of all new cancer developments from 1 January 2008 and progressively all existing cancer services and related funding and staffing.  The delivery of cancer services on a programmatic basis will serve to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient outcome irrespective of geography.  The recent decisions of the HSE in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The designated centres for the HSE, southern region, are Cork University Hospital and Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, the Government is committed to continuing to make the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland in accordance with best international standards, including in the southern region.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue.  I ask the Department of Education and Science, the Minister and the Government to outline to the House the progress that has been made as regards the amalgamation of the two schools in Kanturk, St. Colman&rsquo;s boys&rsquo; school and the Convent of Mercy girls&rsquo; school, as this initiative has been ongoing for some time. </P>
        <P>Kanturk, like many provincial towns, has grown considerably and there is a major issue as regards space particularly in the boys&rsquo; national school which is in dire need of extra facilities and space.  In 2005, the current Minister and I took this issue by the scruff of the neck.  The Minister visited the schools in November 2005 and looked at the situation at first hand.  Then a commitment was given and following intervention to the patron of the schools, Bishop John Magee, he decided the amalgamation would go ahead and that the dioceses and the parish would provide the site.  This matter has been ongoing since the <Col N="1897"/>spring of 2006 and to date we have not had any information as regards progress.</P>
        <P>It raised its head during the recent general election when many issues and counter-issues were aired and a number of threatening e-mails were sent in relation to the proposed project.  I understand that the Department has met with the boards of management since.  However, I am asking the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Devins, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, to outline to the House what steps the Department has taken as regards ensuring that the amalgamation will take place as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>We were assured that it was a band 1 project and as such should move through the Department of Education and Science speedily.  As I have outlined to the House, there is a great need for this in Kanturk.  The delays are regrettable and the initiative should be prioritised within the Department.  Very often there are issues as regards amalgamation in schools.  In this case, however, both schools welcome the amalgamation and look forward to it being completed.  I ask the Minister and the Government, through the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, to outline the current position to the House in relation to the amalgamation and to ensure that whatever delays exist are ironed out so that the project is moved to the design and construction stage as soon as humanly possible.  At this stage, it is one of the most worthy and necessary school amalgamations in the country.</P>

        <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and also the position regarding the proposed amalgamation of national schools in Kanturk.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>As evidence of this commitment, over &euro;540 million will be spent on school building and modernisation projects in the coming year on primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  Since 1997, a total of &euro;3 billion has been invested in school buildings and this has delivered over 7,800 school building projects.  The further investment of over &euro;540 million will build on these achievements and will focus in particular on the <Col N="1898"/>provision of school accommodation in areas where the population is growing at a rapid rate.  As further evidence of our commitment, national development plan funding of &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools over the coming years.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that this record level of investment is a positive testament to the high priority the Government attaches to ensuring that school accommodation is of the highest standard possible.  On top of this, to reduce red tape and allow projects to move faster, responsibility for smaller projects has been devolved to school level.  Standard designs have also been developed for eight and 16 classroom schools to facilitate speedier delivery of projects and save on design fees.  The design and build method is also used to expedite delivery where the use of standard designs is not possible.  Taken together with the unprecedented level of funding available, these initiatives ensure that building projects are delivered in the fastest timeframe possible.</P>
        <P>Turning to the specific issue of the proposed amalgamation of the national schools in Kanturk, the position is that the patron of the school has been engaged in identifying and acquiring a suitable site for the proposed construction of a new school building to facilitate the amalgamation of the existing two national schools in Kanturk, namely, St. Colman&rsquo;s boys&rsquo; national school and the convent girls&rsquo; national school and has sought the Department&rsquo;s approval for the proposed site.</P>
        <P>Officials from the school planning section of the Department met earlier this year with a delegation from the two national schools in Kanturk and a representative of the school patron to discuss issues surrounding the acquisition of the proposed greenfield site.  Following this meeting with the Department, officials carried out a technical assessment of the proposed greenfield site and the technical report identified several issues with regard to the proposed site which need to be addressed by the management authority of the school.  These issues were outlined in a letter to the patron in August this year and the Department is awaiting a reply to same.</P>
        <P>Officials in the Department are carrying out an assessment of the long-term projected staffing for the amalgamated school in Kanturk which will be notified to the school authorities as soon as it is completed.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and allowing me to outline the progress being made under the school building and modernisation programme and the specific position of the proposed amalgamation of the national schools in Kanturk.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>During my period as Minister for Defence I had the pleasure of seeing the tremendous work carried out by the FCA, the pride which personnel had in being members of the FCA and the pride in which the community <Col N="1899"/>held these personnel during their service.  I wish to discuss possible accommodation for the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</P>
        <P>I was appalled to read in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> that almost 40% of the membership of the Reserve Defence Force has left the force in the past four years.  Almost 5,000 people have resigned from the RDF since 2003.  It now has only 8,648 members compared with 13,532 in 2003.  We discuss motivating young people in particular to carry out voluntary work and these are alarming statistics.</P>
        <P>B company 62nd reserve infantry battalion in D&uacute;n Laoghaire has been without its own headquarters and training centre since it was evicted from the coastguard station in D&uacute;n Laoghaire on 1 May 2006 after 55 years in this location.  According to the RDF implementation plan, B company was to have its headquarters and training centre in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  The Minister promised no centre would be closed.  However, this is clearly not the case.</P>
        <P>B company has approximately 40 personnel and its challenge is to grow to 133.  Without a permanent base in D&uacute;n Laoghaire this challenge will not be realised and the unit will eventually die.  At present, B company headquarters is based in Bray and personnel parade between Bray and Cathal Brugha barracks.  New recruits are expected to go to Bray, adding an hour each way to their journeys.  No one seems to care about the negative impact on the volunteers of B company losing its base.</P>
        <P>When B company was evicted from the coastguard station in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, through no fault of the local unit, it made every effort to find an alternative location to grow and develop the unit.  Two locations were identified, namely, the Maritime Museum and the scout&rsquo;s den in Seapoint.  The Maritime Museum was rejected on health and safety grounds despite the fact it is undergoing radical refurbishment which will be completed in 2009.  I understand the scout&rsquo;s den in Seapoint was rejected because of the cost of rent.</P>
        <P>Recently, I tabled two parliamentary questions, one in September and one in November asking what is being done about finding an alternative permanent location for B company.  The replies I received were extremely scant.  However, the latest one states arrangements are in place to facilitate training at Oaklands College in Stillorgan.  This accommodation is extremely limited.  It is not adequate for a dedicated RDF recruiting and training centre.  It consists of two classrooms which are not available during the day and the two full-time members of the Permanent Defence Force assigned to B company do not have accommodation.</P>
        <P>I have a number of questions for the Minister who, unfortunately, is not here.  Is he committed to growing the Reserve Defence Force in D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown and respecting the tradition of voluntary military service from communities in <Col N="1900"/>the area through the decades?  How does the Minister intend to honour his commitment to ensure B company has a permanent home from which it can grow and develop?  How does he intend to give evidence of this commitment and when will progress be seen to be made in the short term?  What are his long-term plans for a base in the area?  If 40 personnel give up their time to the Reserve Defence Force, how does the Minister value this time commitment to voluntary public service?</P>

        <P>Numerous other issues are raised but time prevents me from outlining them.  Is voluntary public service no longer valued?  Here are people prepared to give their service to society and after 55 years in their permanent residence in D&uacute;n Laoghaire they are nomads with no proper facilities.  My suggestion to the Minister is that on a temporary basis the scout&rsquo;s den in Seapoint, which is quite close to D&uacute;n Laoghaire, should be used.  When the refurbishment of the Maritime Museum is complete, the trustees of the Maritime Museum are prepared to give permanent facilities to the Reserve Defence Force in the centre of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which is ideal.  Will the Minister give this commitment?  My suggestion is reasonable and will ensure B company can grow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Barrett for raising this matter and I will reply on behalf of the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, who is unavailable at this time.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to set out the position with regard to the provision of accommodation to facilitate Reserve Defence Force training in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Ensuring that suitable premises are available throughout the country to facilitate training by this important element of the Defence Forces, is a priority of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  However, locating suitable premises at an economic price has proved difficult, especially in the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>For many years the coastguard station at D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour was used by the Reserve Defence Force.  However, in recent years, the harbour was transferred to the Minister with responsibility for the marine who then transferred it to the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, a statutory commercial semi-State body, under the Harbours Act 1996.</P>
        <P>The premises were used for the training of B company 62 reserve infantry battalion and the Naval Service Reserve.  Regrettably, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company informed the Department of Defence that it was not in a position to renew the existing letting agreement and a notice to quit was issued on 31 March 2006.  The property was vacated on 28 April 2006.</P>
        <P>The Naval Reserve is based in Cathal Brugha Barracks.  B company, 62 reserve infantry battalion is served from its headquarters at Rockbrae House, Bray, where the cadre staff are located.  Members of B company, 62 reserve <Col N="1901"/>infantry battalion currently train in Cathal Brugha Barracks and Rockbrae House.  This is seen as a temporary measure pending the acquisition of suitable premises in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area.  While Oatlands College, Stillorgan, is used occasionally, it is not considered suitable as a permanent training centre.</P>
        <P>The Department is actively seeking a suitable venue in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  However, it has proved difficult to find properties which are appropriate having regard to the conditions governing their letting, including the cost and the changing requirements of both the lessors and the Reserve Defence Force units.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not accurate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of properties in D&uacute;n Laoghaire have been investigated as possible alternative premises for B company, 62 reserve infantry battalion.  However, none has been found suitable to date.  The property management branch of the Department of Defence continues to actively seek alternative premises for the training of the Reserve Defence Force in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and all efforts will continue until a suitable premises is secured.  As Deputies will appreciate, it is incumbent on the Department to ensure that the most suitable premises are sourced and value for money secured for the taxpayer in respect of any leasing arrangement.  On behalf of the Defence Forces, the Department will continue to pursue any available property considered suitable for training of the RDF in D&uacute;n Laoghaire while ensuring that value for money is obtained and the safety of the members of the company maintained.  I will convey Deputy Barrett&rsquo;s comments in regard to the two premises to the Minister.</P>

      <sTitle>Local Authority Housing.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is fully aware that local authority tenants are treated differently according to the type of accommodation they occupy.  A local authority tenant living in a house is able to engage in a tenant purchase scheme.  Unfortunately, tenants who live in apartments have been prohibited for the past ten years from doing the same.  During the lifetime of the previous Government, the legislative framework was promised but the delay in introducing it has meant that thousands of tenants across the country have been denied the right to buy their own homes.  I raise this matter on the Adjournment to encourage some urgency on the part of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in ensuring the anomaly is corrected.</P>
        <P>For the past ten years, county and city managers have been ready to implement the scheme and there are no difficulties at local authority <Col N="1902"/>level.  The legal difficulties to which the Minister referred when I questioned him on the issue in October were resolved as long ago as 2005, when a working group comprising Cork and Dublin city councils resolved legal difficulties such as sinking funds, freeholds and title holds and management companies.  It is therefore disingenuous of the Minister to claim these problems are currently before the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor gave a commitment that the legislative framework would be put in place by 2005 at the latest.  That has not happened.  During the period from 1997 to 2007 in areas of my constituency such as Ballyphehan, Togher and Greenmount, and throughout the city, the price of property has increased by<?oasys _jy ?>300%, interest rates have climbed and the age profile of those who wish to buy their homes has grown older.  This has resulted in a situation in which many of those who have been denied to right to buy their homes no longer qualify for a mortgage because of the 20 year minimum mortgage period.  People cannot buy their homes because of Government failure and delay.</P>
        <P>Can a specific date be provided as to when the legislative framework will be put in place?  The Minister has referred to the Social Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill as the means of resolving the matter.  Can a ministerial order be passed to fast track this specific part of the legislation?</P>
        <P>People all over Europe purchase their apartments and have done so for more than 100 years, yet it seems to be a major problem for local authority tenants in Ireland.  One must ask where the priorities of this Government lie.  We have seen tax incentives and major changes in planning legislation to facilitate developers in building houses and apartments but legislation to correct an obvious anomaly has been delayed from one Government to the next.  The last commitment we were given was that the matter would be addressed by last summer.  Given that the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor indicated in 2005 that the issue would be finalised during the lifetime of the last Government, it is unacceptable that we are approaching 2008 with the matter still outstanding.  Unfortunately, the Government&rsquo;s track record leaves me with little confidence that a solution will be in place by this time next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Lynch for raising this matter, which gives me the opportunity on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the plans to update housing legislation as part of a programme to reform the social housing sector.</P>
        <P>On foot of proposals prepared by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and approved by the Government, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office is currently drafting a Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to give effect to policy initiatives set out in the <Col N="1903"/>policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustainable Communities, which was published last February.  This statement builds on recent progress in providing social and affordable housing by setting out the fundamentals of the Government&rsquo;s vision for housing policy in the coming years.</P>
        <P>The Bill will be designed to support the creation of a flexible and graduated system of housing supports for those in need of housing, improve customer choice in order to meet changing requirements over a person&rsquo;s lifetime and augment the powers of housing authorities while at the same time making clearer their responsibilities as social landlords and regulators of social housing generally.  Thus, measures in the Bill will include a more developed legislative basis for the rental accommodation scheme, a revised tenant purchase scheme including the sale of local authority apartments to their tenants and revised powers for local authorities to combat anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>As regards the sale of local authority apartments to tenants, previous efforts in this area were thwarted by the difficulties associated with the management of flat complexes, insurance, the cost of maintenance and the transfer of legal title.  Taking account of proposals put forward by local authorities, arrangements are being devised to address these and other issues unique to local authority apartment sales.  The establishment of fair, equitable and proportionate arrangements are needed to give tenant purchasers and the local authority a voice in the management of the apartment complex.  The potential role of a management company representative of all apartment owners, including the local authority, in managing <Col N="1904"/>and maintaining the common areas and services in the complex must be considered.  The need must also be considered for tenant purchasers to contribute through service charges to the ongoing maintenance of common areas and services.  Arrangements must be made for sharing the costs of insurance covering the entire complex.  Finally, a reserve fund will have to be created to pay for major improvement works required in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 69 and 72 together.</P>
        <P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P><Col N="1906"/>
        <P>Carer&rsquo;s allowance, in line with other social assistance schemes, is means tested.  This ensures scarce resources are directed at those in greatest need.  The carer&rsquo;s allowance means test is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes.  The means test has been significantly eased over the years, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  Budget 2007 provided for an income disregard for a couple of &euro;640 per week.  This ensures a couple can earn in the region of &euro;36,000 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance and the associated free travel and household benefits.  This measure surpasses the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>Recently, significant reforms came into force, which allow people in receipt of certain other social welfare payments, who are also providing full time care and attention, to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means.  The maximum payment will be the equivalent of a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of the carer&rsquo;s allowance is to provide income support to low income carers.  Carer&rsquo;s benefit, eligibility for which is based on social insurance contributions, is available as an alternative to carer&rsquo;s allowance for people who are providing someone with full time care and attention but who do not qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance due to the level of their means.  These are income support payments and they are not intended to provide people with a wage for caring which is what a payment along the lines proposed would effectively represent.</P>
        <P>In June 2005, the respite care grant was extended to all people providing full time care and attention regardless of their means or social insurance contributions.  Since then, the grant has also been paid in respect of each care recipient. <Col N="1907"/> Budget 2007 increased the level of the grant by &euro;300 from &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,500 per year in respect of each care recipient.</P>
        <P>One of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; is the development of a national carer&rsquo;s strategy and this commitment is reiterated in the Programme for Government.  The strategy will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community.  While social welfare supports for carers will clearly be a key issue in the strategy, other issues such as access to respite and other services, education, training and employment will also feature strongly.  All relevant departments and agencies will be involved in the strategy and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners.  An inter-Departmental working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, is being established to develop the strategy and I expect it to be completed by summer of 2008.</P>
        <P>The recent improvements in the income supports available from this Department represent major improvements in the supports available to carers.  The development of a national carer&rsquo;s strategy provides us with an opportunity to build further on these improvements and to consider other areas where progress can be made.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>  the measures in place to ensure that all families entitled to receive family income supplement are receiving it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[32280/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Family Income Supplement (FIS) provides income support for employees on low earnings with families. This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments.  There are currently some 21,000 people in receipt of FIS.</P>
        <P>My Department undertakes a number of measures to ensure that people are aware of possible entitlement to FIS.  These include advice to all persons who are awarded one parent family payment and back to work allowance recipients.  All employers are provided annually with information about the scheme.  Information on FIS is contained in all child benefit books and can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also included information on FIS when writing to PAYE taxpayers with their certificates of tax credits. In addition, the scheme is promoted through my Department&rsquo;s network of Local Offices, Citizen Information Centres and Citizens Information Phone Service and by the Citizen&rsquo;s Information Board, the National Information Support Agency.</P><Col N="1908"/>
        <P>In Budget 2006, FIS income thresholds were increased by a range of earnings limits designed to enable more people to qualify.  To ensure that families were made aware of these improvements, my Department undertook a nationwide awareness campaign in March 2006 to promote and encourage take up of the Family Income Supplement scheme.  This extensive week-long campaign included advertising on TV, on national and local radio and in the national and regional press.  A nation-wide poster campaign was also undertaken.</P>
        <P>I am very pleased with the response to the campaign.  In 2006 my Department received 13,700 new FIS claims; this compares with 8,500 received in 2005.  11,000 new claims have been received up to end of October this year compared with 7,000 for the corresponding period in 2005.</P>
        <P>With regard to the level of take up, it is not possible to estimate from administrative sources the number of families who would be eligible but do not apply for their FIS entitlements.  In order to address the issue of FIS take up my department has commissioned a research project to examine factors behind the level of take up for the scheme.  This is at preparatory stage at present and is expected to be completed in July 2008.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>  his policy in relation to relaxing or abolishing the means test for qualified adults on contributory pensions.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>All contributory payments include, where appropriate, an increase for a dependent spouse or partner.  This increase is means-tested with a full increase payable where a spouse&rsquo;s income is less than &euro;100 per week, and reduced rates payable until income exceeds &euro;280 per week.  Unlike the means test for non-contributory payments, a household means test does not apply, i.e. a decision is made on the basis of the income enjoyed by the qualified adult only.  However, where capital or property (other than the family home) is jointly owned, then the qualified adult will be assessed with 50% of any actual/notional income or capital value deriving from that asset.</P>
        <P>As set out in the Agreed Programme for Government, the policy in relation to the means testing of qualified adult payments is to increase the income limits that apply in the means test so that more people will qualify for the allowance.  These limits are kept under review in a budgetary context.</P>
        <P>The issue of means testing qualified adult payments for pensions is discussed in the Green Paper on Pensions, published on 17 October, although this is an issue which cannot be looked at exclusively in a pensions context, as it applies <Col N="1909"/>to all social welfare payments; the consultation process on pensions will provide information which will impact on the future status of qualified adults in the context of social welfare.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70, 95, 125 and 135 together.</P>
        <P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is the main Government funded service which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 53 independent companies nationwide with over 240 money advice staff operating the service.  Many voluntary and statutory bodies, such as the Society of St Vincent de Paul and the credit unions, work closely with the programme.</P>
        <P>Last year, MABS provided services to almost 12,500 new clients throughout the country.  To date, in 2007, some 11,500 new clients have approached the service.  The number of active cases is 19,200.  In 2006, &euro;16.4 million was provided to fund the service and in 2007 the annual allocation was increased to &euro;17.67 million to assist the MABS in dealing with its workload.</P>
        <P>Statistics show that 22% of new clients that approach the MABS are lone parents with children and a further 16% are married with children.  People with mortgages make up 21% of the <Col N="1910"/>MABS clients but there is no statistical data on the number of clients that seek the support of MABS because of house repossessions.</P>
        <P>The issues that give rise to problems of over-indebtedness for people are highly complex.  Research shows that lack of information about money management can be a contributory factor in many cases.  The cost and availability of credit for people on low incomes and the barriers they face in accessing mainstream and cheap forms of credit add to the difficulties people encounter in managing their finances.</P>
        <P>MABS is making a unique and expert contribution to meeting the needs of people with debt difficulties in today&rsquo;s society.  This includes promoting greater awareness about household budgeting and shaping the strategies that need to be put in place, including those of services providers, such as the banks and the credit unions, to ensure greater financial inclusion in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The proposals I am developing for a new structure for the MABS will include initiatives in these areas to improve the situation of people on low incomes in securing access to affordable credit.</P>
        <P>In line with the Programme for Government, my proposals will build on the best features of the MABS model of service to the public.  They will take account of the considerable changes that have taken place in the corporate governance environment since the 2002 MABS Bill.  My objective is to ensure a high quality, coordinated budgeting and advice service that represents value for money for the taxpayer&rsquo;s investment and is geared to meet the challenges posed by the changing face of debt in Ireland.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 140 and 146 together.</P>
        <P>The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the <Col N="1911"/>winter season.  Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person&rsquo;s normal heating expenses.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.</P>
        <P>Improvements to the fuel allowance in recent years include an easing of the means test, extending the duration of payment from 26 to 29 weeks and an increase in the rates of payment.  In Budget 2007, the rate of fuel allowance was increased by &euro;4 from &euro;14 to &euro;18 (&euro;21.90 in designated smokeless areas).  The income threshold for eligibility to fuel allowance was also increased by &euro;49 from &euro;51 to &euro;100 above the state pension (contributory).  Fuel allowances are incorporated in the recipient&rsquo;s weekly social welfare payment.  The Government&rsquo;s objective is to ensure that the recipient&rsquo;s total weekly income, including the fuel allowance, is sufficient to meet all of their income needs, including heating costs.</P>
        <P>Budget resources are concentrated on providing significant real increases over and above inflation each year in all primary social welfare pension, benefit and assistance rates.</P>
        <P>Social welfare rates have increased at a significantly greater rate than price inflation in recent years, which has assisted social welfare households to achieve some increase in their quality of life and in their ability to meet the cost of items such as fuel.  For example, social welfare payment rates have increased by between 61% and 77% since December 2001, while the cost of living as measured by the consumer price index rose by 23% in that time.</P>
        <P>Some 274,000 people benefited from the fuel allowance in 2006 at a cost of some &euro;125m.  As a consequence of the increase in rate and the increase in the income threshold for eligibility as announced in Budget 2007, it is estimated that some 286,200 households will benefit under the scheme at a cost of &euro;161.5m this year.</P>
        <P>The extension of the national fuel scheme to eligible carers, as set out in the Agreed Programme for Government, will be examined by my Department in the context of the overall package of commitments relating to carers contained in the programme.  Any additional costs arising from this or any other improvements to the scheme would also need to be considered in future Budgetary measures having regard to overall resources available for social welfare schemes generally.</P>

	<P>A number of non-statutory <Col N="1912"/>schemes are operated by my Department.  These include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the household benefits package, which includes the electricity/gas allowance, the telephone rental allowance and the free television licence;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the free travel scheme;</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">One advantage of operating on a non-statutory basis is that it allows for flexibility in these schemes so that they can be modified in response to customer needs without the need for legislative change.

        <P>Non-statutory schemes decisions are based on published guidelines setting out the conditions of entitlement in detail.</P>

        <Quest>  the degree of progress for the completion of his Department&rsquo;s technical review of the social welfare code to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act 2000; the cost of the project to date; the reason this review is being handled in part by parties outside his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

	<P>The review of the social welfare code to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act, 2000 (as amended), which is currently being undertaken in my Department, will examine all the schemes and services provided for both in social welfare legislation and the administrative schemes operated by the Department.  It will identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination, on any of the nine grounds under the Act that are not justified by a legitimate social policy objective or where the means of achieving that objective are either unnecessary or inappropriate. </P>
        <P>A decision was taken in my Department that the review would take place in two phases.  Phase <Col N="1913"/>1 involved the undertaking of a scoping exercise to establish the most appropriate approach and methodology to carrying out the main review, which would be robust and verifiable.  Following a tendering process, the contract for carrying out Phase 1 of the project was awarded in February 2006 to Mel Cousins and Professor Gerry Whyte of Trinity College.  That work was completed in September 2006.  The results of Phase 1 have formed the basis of the terms of reference of the main review.</P>
        <P>Following discussion by the Project Board for the review and the Department&rsquo;s Management Committee, a decision was made that the carrying out the main review should be put out to tender.  This decision was taken on the basis of the comprehensive nature of the review and the significant time resources and the legal knowledge necessary to carry out the review in addition to a comprehensive knowledge of the social welfare system.</P>
        <P>The request for tender document issued on 17 April 2007, having been examined and cleared for issuing by the Office of the Attorney General.  It was placed on the Government&rsquo;s e-tender website and in the Official Journal of the EU.</P>
        <P>Consultants Mel Cousins and Professor Gerry Whyte and associates were appointed to carry out the review and a contact was signed on 18 July 2007.  The work commenced in October 2007.  It is due to be completed at the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>An advertisement was placed in the national and regional newspapers on the week commencing 19 November 2007 inviting submissions from interested organisations and individuals as to any areas in which they feel that the social welfare code may not comply with the principles of the Equal Status Acts.  Information regarding the review and inviting submissions has also been placed on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The cost of Phase 1 of the project was &euro;32,800 (exclusive of VAT).  Phase 2 of the project will cost &euro;203,500 (exclusive of VAT).</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 141 and 147 together. </P>
        <P>The living alone increase is an additional payment of &euro;7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and receiving payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes.</P>
        <P>The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone.  It is not intended to cover transport costs which are addressed under the free travel scheme which provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.</P>
        <P>The issue of access to public transport in rural areas is being addressed at present through the Rural Transport Initiative, which is being managed by Pobal, formerly Area Development Management (ADM) on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Transport. My Department contributed &euro;500,000 to the initiative in 2004, &euro;750,000 in 2005, &euro;850,000 in 2006, and will contribute &euro;1.5 million in 2007 to ensure that free travel passholders continue to have access to community based transport services.</P>
        <P>The policy in relation to support for pensioners has been, for many years, to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension rather than supplements like the living alone increase.  The objective is to use resources to improve the position of all pensioners to the fullest extent possible rather than focusing on particular groups.  This approach was continued in Budget 2007 with increases of up to &euro;16 and &euro;18 per week granted on personal rates.</P>
        <P>The needs of older people have been, and will remain, a priority for the Government. Further reforms and improvements will be considered in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions, published on the 17th October.  A major consultation process in relation to future pensions policy is now underway.  Following the completion of the <Col N="1915"/>consultation process, the Government will develop a framework for future pensions policy.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>  his views on removing restrictions imposed on disability benefit recipients who have re-trained and may be able to take up alternative employment; if there are proposals in place to change this restriction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Illness Benefit (formerly know as Disability Benefit) is an income support payment for people of working age who are unable to work due to illness and who satisfy certain social insurance conditions.  Because inability to work due to illness is a condition of receipt of the payment, it is also a requirement of the scheme that the recipient does not engage in employment while in receipt of Illness Benefit.</P>
        <P>However, where it is the case that the recipient wishes to pursue a different category of employment than that which was pursued prior to the onset of illness, the Department does not impose restrictions on the recipient and instead allows for an exemption from the general rule that the person must not be in employment.  These exemptions, which typically last for 12 months, will normally take the form of employment which is deemed by the Department to be both part-time and rehabilitative in nature, or alternatively a community employment scheme or a training course arranged by F&Aacute;S.  An application for such an exemption must be made to the Department in advance of the employment or training course beginning.</P>
        <P>This exemption from the general rules of behaviour was introduced in order to allow recipients to engage in training or part time, rehabilitative employment which would increase the opportunity for them to return to the open labour market.  However, the Department accepts that, in some cases, where a claimant has returned to the labour market they may find that the employment is unsuitable and that they are unable to continue with it.  For situations such as these, I recently made a change to the legislation to ensure that, for a period of 26 weeks following their return to employment, if the person finds they are unable to continue in employment they will be allowed return to illness benefit without the need to re-apply or serve additional waiting days.  In this way, illness benefit recipients are encouraged rather than restricted in finding alternative employment in the labour market.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 127 together.</P>
        <P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P>Recent reforms of the scheme allow people in receipt of certain other social welfare payments, who are also providing full time care and attention to a person, to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means.  The maximum payment will be the equivalent of a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>One of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; is the development of a national carer&rsquo;s strategy and this commitment is reiterated in the Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>I am aware that one of the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs &ldquo;Report on the Position of Full Time Carers&rdquo; which was published in 2003 was that such a strategy should be developed.  I am pleased that we are now in a position to act on that recommendation.</P>
        <P>The strategy will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community. While social welfare supports for carers will clearly be a key issue in the strategy, other issues such as access to respite and other services, education, training and employment will also feature strongly.  Co-operation between relevant Government departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.  For that reason all relevant departments and agencies will be involved in the strategy and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners.</P>
        <P>My officials have been in discussions with their colleagues in other relevant Departments in order to decide on the best approach to the development of the strategy.  In view of the need to ensure that appropriate arrangements and structures are in place to support its development, it will not be possible to complete the strategy by the end of this year as had been intended originally.</P><Col N="1917"/>
        <P>An inter-Departmental working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, will be established in the coming weeks to draw up the strategy and to manage the consultation process.  I expect it to be completed by summer of 2008. The recent improvements in the income supports available from this Department represent major improvements in supports available to carers in the community.  The development of a national carer&rsquo;s strategy provides us with an opportunity to build further on these improvements and to consider other areas where progress can be made.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79, 83, 133 and 144 together.</P>
        <P>The publication this week of the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions figures for 2006 shows an increase in the numbers of lone parents living in consistent poverty. This increase is despite large recent increases by the Government in the upper earnings limit for entitlement to the one parent family payment and increases to the weekly rate of payment. It is clear that for these lone parents and others on low income, social assistance alone does not provide a long term answer to combat the risk of poverty and that financial independence can only be achieved through improved education and training supports leading to quality, sustainable employment.</P>
        <P>That is why the Government discussion paper, &ldquo;Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents,&rdquo; put forward proposals for services for lone parents including the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities; the exten<Col N="1918"/>sion of the National Employment Action Plan; focused provision of childcare; improved information services and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.</P>
        <P>As I have recently reported to the House, the development of any new scheme to support low income parents can only be introduced when the necessary co-ordinated supports and services are put in place on the ground by other Departments and Agencies.</P>
        <P>This is why the non-income recommendations contained in the discussion paper are currently being tested in two areas: Coolock and Kilkenny.  These tests are focused on identifying and resolving any practical and administrative issues that may arise in advance of the scheme being introduced.  The tests are scheduled to run until the end of the year, with a report then being made to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion.  The tests will allow for operational and logistical co-ordination between the relevant Departments and Agencies to be considered and will facilitate the development of the policy and operational details of the new scheme and accompanying supports.</P>
        <P>Issues in relation to the possible poverty traps outlined in the discussion paper are currently being considered in my Department.  Although the exact terms of the new payment have not been finalised, the key to any new payment is to ensure that the necessary financial supports are in place to assist families towards improved employment prospects and that all disincentives to work are kept to a minimum.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 84 and 86 together.</P>
        <P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have <Col N="1919"/>been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P>One of the fundamental qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant is that the person be providing full-time care and attention to a person who needs such care.  The number of hours a person may engage in employment, self employment, training or education outside the home and still be considered to be providing full-time care and attention for the purposes of the schemes was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week in June 2006.</P>
        <P>In September 2007, significant reforms came into force whereby people in receipt of certain social welfare payments other than carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit, who are providing someone with full time care and attention, can retain their main payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be equivalent to a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>These new arrangements apply to people receiving weekly social welfare payments (other than recipients of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or benefit, back to work allowance or those signing for jobseekers credits) and people in receipt of a qualified adult allowance.  This is in line with the arrangements which have applied to receipt of the respite care grant since its extension in 2005.</P>
        <P>In order to qualify for payment under these new arrangements, people must satisfy the qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance, including the full time care and attention requirement.  Recipients of back to work allowance must engage in a minimum of 20 hours work per week and so they do not satisfy the full time care and attention requirement for carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>In 2005, the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme was extended to accommodate care-sharing situations.  Under these arrangements, it is possible for week-on week-off care sharing arrangements to be facilitated.  This means that where two carers are providing care to the same person on alternate weeks the carer&rsquo;s allowance and the annual respite care grant can be split between them.</P>
        <P>I will keep the supports for carers available from my Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure that commitments in relation to income support are delivered.</P>

        <Quest> the position regarding the proposed reforms for the coverage of farm spouses as outlined in the Programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Programme for Government states that &lsquo;The role and economic contribution of spouses working on the farm will be better recognised within the social insurance system, following on from Budget 2007 which allowed recipients of Farm Assist to make PRSI contributions for the first time&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>Spouses working for self-employed contributors are specifically excepted from social insurance contributions. This exclusion recognises the practical difficulties in establishing the nature of a genuine employment relationship in circumstances such as when a person employed under a contract of service by his or her spouse is classed as an &ldquo;excepted&rdquo; contributor under social welfare law. As a result, farming spouses, in common with spouses of other self-employed persons, do not generally pay PRSI contributions. There are, however, three situations where spouses may pay contributions.</P>
        <P>Spouses who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership, as opposed to simply being the joint owners of a property, are treated as individual self-employed contributors and are thus liable to social insurance contributions. These contributions &mdash; made under PRSI Class S &mdash; enable them to build up an insurance record in their own right and to receive accruing benefits. A partnership is commonly understood to be an association of two or more persons for the purpose of gain or of sharing in the work and profits of an enterprise. Liability for PRSI contributions is not contingent on the ownership of property but rather on the nature of the business arrangements between the couple. Co-ownership of property does not in itself create a partnership.</P>
        <P>In the situation where a family business or farming enterprise is incorporated as a limited company, spouses involved in the business can establish a social insurance record as either employees or as self-employed contributors &mdash; depending on whether a contract of service exists.</P>
        <P>Finally, a spouse engaged in &ldquo;off-farm&rdquo; employment, will pay social insurance contributions in his or her own right. This enables farming spouses who might otherwise not be insured to develop a social insurance record on the basis of their &ldquo;off-farm&rdquo; earnings.</P>
        <P>While there are no plans to alter these provisions, an information leaflet is currently being developed between the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business. It has been agreed, with the farming representatives, that their views and input will feed into this process to ensure the new publication meets with their information needs and is customer orientated. It is hoped to publish the new information leaflet by end 2007.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that under the Programme for Government there is a commitment to improve the income limits associated with the <Col N="1921"/>qualified adult allowance to enable more people to qualify for it. The limits will be reviewed in the context of the budget.</P>

	<P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has introduced a revised scheme of grant aid to assist older people in carrying out essential repairs and improvements to their homes. This is the main mechanism for assisting older people maintain their home. The new scheme, which will be administered by the local authorities, will provide grant aid of up to &euro;10,500 to cover works such as structural repairs, replacement of windows and doors, re-wiring, dry-lining, installation of central heating, water and sanitary services, cleaning and painting.

	<P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to the position of people in receipt of social welfare payments who are in the process of taking up employment. </P>
        <P>My department already provides a number of incentives to ease the transition from welfare to work. For example, the back to work allowance scheme is part of my Department&rsquo;s programme of initiatives designed to assist long term unemployed people, lone parents and other social welfare recipients to return to the active labour force. The allowance provides a monetary incentive designed to make return to work financially attractive and viable.</P><Col N="1922"/>
        <P>There are two strands associated with the scheme &mdash; back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) for the self-employed and back to work allowance (BTWA) for employees.  Under the BTEA the self employed person continues to receive 100% of their primary social welfare payment in year one, 75% in year two, 50% in year three, and 25% in year four. In the case of employees who qualify for BTWA, participants receive 75% of their primary social welfare payment in year one, 50% in year two, and 25% in year three. Participants also retain entitlement to certain other secondary benefits.</P>
        <P>In the case of the one parent family payment scheme a single parent, in receipt of one parent family payment (OPFP) , may earn up to &euro;146.50 per week and still qualify for the maximum rate of payment. A reduced rate of OPFP may also apply where the person has earnings between &euro;146.50 and &euro;400.00. Where earnings exceed &euro;400 per week, the single parent will continue to receive OPFP at 50% of their appropriate for a period of 26 weeks provided they continue to satisfy all of the other conditions of the scheme and immediate prior to moving to the 50% rate they were in receipt of OPFP for a period of not less than 52 weeks.</P>
        <P>Budget 2007 provided for improvements in the rent supplement scheme whereby a person in receipt of rent supplement, who was accepted as suitable for accommodation under the rental accommodation scheme, may engage in full-time employment and continue to receive a supplement subject to satisfying the standard means test. These provisions along with other measures I have outlined are directed at removing obstacles to employment and facilitating the transition to work for those who are long term dependant on the social welfare system.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 94 and 111 together. </P>
        <P>The programme for Government includes commitments to reduce long-term reliance on rent supplement. This will be done mainly by keeping the standard means test for rent supplement under review to provide enhanced financial incentives for people taking up employment or other professional options and by providing long-term housing solutions under the rental accommodation scheme and otherwise.		</P>
        <P>Improvements in the means test were implemented in June. Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</P>
        <P>In addition, rent supplement may continue to be paid to a person who engages in full time employment, subject to their satisfying the improved means testing arrangements, as outlined above, and where they have been accepted as having a long term housing need under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).</P>
        <P>I intend to keep the rent supplement scheme under review and my Department will be working closely with the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.</P>

	<P>The social welfare system is designed to provide income supports and access to relevant services in a timely manner to all our customers. The system is neutral with regard to how it treats men and women; receipt of payment is generally dependent on contingency and other conditions being met. A person in receipt of a social welfare payment may claim an increase, known as a qualified adult allowance, in respect of his/her spouse or partner. Levels of payment <Col N="1925"/>and how they apply are exactly the same for men and women.</P>
        <P>However, while there is equity in access to the system, the impact of past labour market experience and the traditional roles of women in the home and the labour market are still reflected in some features of the social welfare system. One such feature is the status of qualified adult, the majority of whom are women.</P>
        <P>Significant changes have taken place in society in the past decades and the social welfare system has changed to reflect these changes, particularly to ensure that as many people as possible qualify for a social welfare payment in their own right. Considerable reform and expansion has taken place in the social insurance system to make it as inclusive as possible. This together with the increasing numbers of women entering employment has meant that more women are establishing their own entitlement to social insurance payments. In the case of State Pension Schemes the qualified adult increase is now paid directly to the qualified adult. The Programme for Government includes a commitment to provide a personal pension payment, set at the level of a full rate State pension (non-contributory), for pensioner spouses in receipt of the qualified adult increase.</P>
        <P>The reform proposals outlined in the &lsquo;Government Discussion Paper: Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents&rsquo; further address this aspect of the social welfare system which impacts mainly on women. As well as abolishing the contingency of lone parenthood, another major aspect of the reform proposals is the departure from the concept of &lsquo;qualified adult&rsquo; within social assistance or means tested payment. Under these proposals, where a household means test is met, all individuals would claim for and receive a payment in their own right, thus ensuring consistency in treatment and equity across the social welfare system and recognising the changing role of women in society and the labour market. This would also mean that supports for education, training and employment would be offered to former qualified adults of working age, who are not currently engaged with.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These reform proposals would represent a fundamental change in the social welfare system, moving away from a derived entitlement to entitlement in the individual&rsquo;s own right. This aspect of the proposals together with the development of a new income support scheme for lone parents and other low income families and the non-income supports necessary to accompany such a payment are currently being examined and developed by my Department in co-operation with other relevant Departments and agencies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 132 together.</P>
        <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.</P>
        <P>A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment (including family income supplement), or Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels. Separately, the Department of Education and Science operates a book grant scheme for primary and secondary schools which is intended to contribute towards meeting the cost of books only.</P>
        <P>The rates of BSCFA have been increased significantly in recent years. From June 2006, the allowance was increased by &euro;40 to &euro;120 in respect of qualified children aged from 2 to 11 years and &euro;190 for those aged from 12 to 22 years. Budget 2006 also increased the income limits for BSCFA by &euro;50 to &euro;100 above the state pension (contributory) rate. All income is taken into account to ensure that households are treated equitably with eligibility based on the amount of income, not the source of the income. In Budget 2007, the rate of payment of BSCFA was increased by &euro;60 per child for children aged 2 to 11 years old and &euro;95 for children aged 12 to 22 &mdash; a 50% increase on the previous allowance. The rates for 2007 are &euro;180 for children aged 2 to 11 years old and &euro;285 for children aged 12 to 22. The annual expenditure on the scheme has increased to over &euro;40m as a result of these measures.</P>
        <P>These improvements in BSCFA are very significant when viewed in the context of clothing and footwear price trends. According to the Consumer Price Index for October 2007, the overall cost of clothing and footwear has fallen by 3.5% over the past twelve months. Since December 2001, clothing and footwear costs have decreased by 18.4%.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of the carer&rsquo;s allowance is to provide income support to low income carers. Carer&rsquo;s allowance, in line with other social <Col N="1927"/>assistance schemes, is means tested. The carer&rsquo;s allowance means test is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes. The means test has been significantly eased over the years most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings. Budget 2007 provided for an income disregard for a couple of &euro;640 per week. This ensures a couple can earn in the region of &euro;36,000 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance and the associated free travel and household benefits. This measure surpasses the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>I consider the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme to be an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain. The improvements to the scheme in recent years have provided a major boost to meeting the financial costs associated with return to school for those who most need assistance.</P>
        <P>The adequacy of back to school clothing and footwear allowance payments will be kept under review. Any changes to the structure of the scheme, rates of payment, income limits or amendments to the qualifying criteria would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of resources available for improvements in social welfare payments generally.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 121 together.</P>
        <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over.  All carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance, regardless of their age, also receive a free travel pass.   It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension.  People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel. 		</P><Col N="1928"/>
        <P>The all-Ireland free travel scheme has been extended since 2nd April 2007.  Under the new arrangements pensioners over the age of 66 and resident here can travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in Northern Ireland.  Likewise, pensioners, aged over 65 in Northern Ireland can travel free of charge on transport services in this State.  This extension of the scheme represents a significant expansion in travel opportunities for older people.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of requests and enquiries in relation to the extension of entitlement to free travel in Ireland to Irish born people living outside the island of Ireland, or to those in receipt of pensions from my Department, particularly those living in the UK, when they return to Ireland for a visit.</P>
        <P>Legal advice indicates that it would not be possible to extend entitlement to free travel simply to Irish born people living abroad as to do so would be contrary to European legislation which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality.  More recently, the European Commission has indicated that to extend the scheme to people in receipt of an Irish pension could also be considered discriminatory.</P>
        <P>I will keep this issue under review in order to determine how best to advance our Programme for Government commitments.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government reiterates the Government&rsquo;s determination to prioritise the interests of people with disabilities over the course of the next five years through a series of significant measures in the social welfare, health, education, employment and environments areas. </P>
        <P>My Department has a pivotal role in providing income support for people with disabilities who may not be in a position to provide for themselves. In 2006, spending on income support, to some 246,000 recipients of disability or caring related social welfare schemes, was in excess of &euro;2.38 billion. In addition, people with disabilities may also benefit from other schemes such as state pensions.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s Disability Sectoral Plan, published in 2006, in accordance with the provisions of the Disability Act 2005 and in line with the National Disability Strategy and Towards 2016, aims to develop services that not only give people with disabilities financial security but also encourage their maximum participation in society. The Department participates in inter<Col N="1929"/>departmental co-ordinating and monitoring structures, including bi-annual meetings between senior officials and stakeholders as required under Towards 2016, in monitoring progress on its Sectoral Plan.</P>
        <P>I, with the support of my Government colleagues, am committed to continuing to prioritise the needs of people with disabilities and their carers over the term of this Government. The Agreed Programme for Government reiterates that the National Disability Strategy will be driven and managed from a whole of Government perspective and will be overseen and supported by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>The commitments relevant to my Department, contained in the Programme, including those relating to people with disabilities, are currently being considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s new Statement of Strategy 2008-2010 which is being finalised and which will be published in early 2008. Progress on these commitments will be reported on in my Department&rsquo;s annual reports.</P>

	<P>The Department administers some fifty separate schemes and makes payments to one million people each week. It relies on other agencies in carrying out some of its business, for example An Post for payments, and the Revenue Commissioners for the collection of PRSI contributions. Information is also provided to other agencies such as the CSO and Health agencies, for various purposes, in accordance with legislation. The nature and volume of its business means that it is heavily dependent on Information Communications Technology (ICT) facilities to carry out the bulk of its business and it has responsibility for a significant amount of data. The Department is fully aware of its obligation to safeguard the security of this data and employs a wide range of measures to protect the confidentiality, availability and integrity of information. Every effort is made to ensure that business is conducted in a secure way by security-conscious staff. </P>
        <P>The Department maintains a central repository of client information. This information is stored on the Department&rsquo;s Central Records system that holds a record, or data set, in respect of each customer. The information maintained can be broadly categorised into customer identity, PRSI contribution history and summary claim activity <Col N="1930"/>information. There are some 6.8 million data sets on this database in respect of current and previous customers. More detailed data relating to particular transactions in relation to these customers are held separately on scheme payment systems.</P>
        <P>The data is generated by Departmental staff or agents entering information onto its internal computer systems and also by receipt of data from external agencies (e.g. the GRO for births). Staff and agents who need access to this data to carry out their duties are granted access in accordance with departmental policies and procedures, including the use of password protection and personal accounts. The data is made available over a secure network through bespoke application interfaces. These interfaces control the level and type of access an approved member of staff can have to the data. Authorisation to use an application is subject to a business case approved by local management. All changes made to a client data set are logged and subject to on-going audit.</P>
        <P>All electronic data is stored in a secure computer room in the Department&rsquo;s primary computer site. The site itself has rigorous control procedures and site perimeter protection. There are arrangements in place for inter-site backup of data.</P>
        <P>Security arrangements are in place to cover the necessary transfer of data to other agencies for service delivery purposes. Backup arrangements for these include encryption.</P>
        <P>Over the last number of years, the Department has strengthened security and data protection protocols. Staff are regularly reminded of their obligations under data protection and security policies and the penalties applied to any breach.</P>
        <P>A dedicated unit has been established to oversee business information protection across the Department and has developed and communicated policies and procedures covering the use of systems and data. These policies and procedures are under continuous review and are updated as appropriate. The most recent policy update took place in June 2007, with the publication of a corporate Information Security Policy.</P>
        <P>Over the past few years, the Department has undertaken a number of information security projects and has established internal structures to implement its policies.</P>
        <P>A High-Level Group has been established within the Department to review access management and control. The primary focus of the Group is to formulate the Department&rsquo;s policy on access to data and to initiate a further work programme to address the issues involved.</P>

	<P>In 1992, my Department and An Post entered into a five year contract for the delivery of social welfare payments. This contract was renewed in 1997 for a further three years to the end of 1999. The Government&rsquo;s decision in 1999, to extend the Department&rsquo;s contractual arrangements with An Post, gave rise to a procurement complaint being lodged with the European Commission in 2000. The complaint was subsequently referred to the European Court of Justice by the European Commission. </P>
        <P>On the 13th November 2007 the European Court of Justice ruled that &ldquo; in entrusting the provision of social benefit payment services to An Post without undertaking any prior advertising, Ireland has not failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 43 EC and 49 EC and the general principles of Community law in connection with a contract for the supply of such services&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Department is studying the judgement and its implications for the current arrangements with An Post and the delivery of payment services.</P>
        <P>An Post and the Department of Social and Family Affairs have been partners in the delivery of social welfare payments since the foundation of the State. I am confident that An Post and its network of local post offices will continue to deliver social welfare payments in the future.</P>

	<P>I understand that the Deputy is seeking information on the commitment outlined in the programme for Government to continue to fully resource the Family Support Agency and its programmes.</P>
        <P>The Family Support Agency was established on 6 May 2003 by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and brings together programmes and services to support families introduced by the Government in recent years.  Its mission is to promote family and community well being through the provision of appropriate supports and services to families.</P>
        <P>The Family Support Agency is responsible for over &euro;35million of Government funding to support families in 2007.  This represents an increase <Col N="1932"/>of 25% in funding year-on-year and is more than 40% up on the funding allocated for 2004.</P>
        <P>The Agency itself is going from strength to strength.  It achieved the target set in the last National Development Programme with the achievement of 100 family resource centres around the country.  Indeed, the NDP for 2007-2012 will see a further expansion of the Family Resource Centre programme.</P>
        <P>The Agency is also responsible for the provision of grant aid to voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling and supports.  For 2007, almost &euro;10 million was provided by the Family Support Agency and a total of 561 organisations countrywide received funding under the scheme.  This record investment &mdash; an increase of one third in just 4 years &mdash; has been informed by research launched earlier this year which indicated that up to 70,000 people across the country benefit each year from counselling funded by the Family Support Agency.</P>
        <P>The Family Support Agency has also overseen the expansion of the national Family Mediation service which now has 16 centres nationally and assists over 1,500 couples each year.</P>
        <P>I am committed to further supporting the excellent work of the Family Support Agency and I am confident that the Agency will continue to have the resources to further expand its services to the benefit of families across Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>An integrated occupational pension scheme is one where the pension payable, or the design of the benefit promise made, takes into account the state pension (contributory) or other similar contributory benefits payable by the State. Integrating occupational and social welfare pensions is a common practice and most defined benefit or final salary schemes are structured in this way. The practice is not generally subject to legislation but derives from the rules of individual pension schemes.</P>
        <P>The manner in which integration operates can vary and depends on the rules of individual schemes. However, in a typical private sector scheme guaranteeing a total pension of two thirds of final income, salary is reduced by one and a half times the state pension payment to arrive at pensionable salary. When the pension is paid, the combination of the occupational scheme and the state pension will provide the overall target of two thirds of final salary.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of the Pensions Act 1990, integration may only take place at the point when <Col N="1933"/>a pension is first paid. Legislation does not permit reductions to be made to occupational pensions in payment to take account of subsequent increases in the state pension. The legislation also provides for a minimum level of benefit to be paid from an occupational scheme based on the total contributions made by the employee to that scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99, 102, 116 and 391 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can be accommodated within the social welfare pensions system, with due regard being paid to the contributory principle underlying entitlement to contributory payments and, in the case of non-contributory payments, the need to ensure that resources are directed to those who are most in need. In this regard, over the last 10 years, means tests have been improved and qualifying conditions for contributory payments made easier.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, I published the Green Paper on Pensions on 17th October which addresses the issue of women who had to resign due to the marriage bar or who were caring for children or incapacitated adults before the introduction of the homemakers scheme in 1994. The Green Paper sets out a range of approaches that could be considered to deal with these issues, including universal pensions, replacing the homemakers disregard system with credits and back-dating the homemakers scheme.</P><Col N="1934"/>
        <P>A consultation process on the Green Paper is now underway and will remain open until mid 2008. The Government will respond to the process by publishing a framework for future pensions policy and I expect it to be available towards the end of next year.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos 100, 122 and 379 together. </P>
        <P>The appropriateness of benchmarking Disability Allowance and other social welfare rates was examined in 2001 by the Social Welfare Benchmarking and Indexation Group.  The Group published its final report in September 2001 but did not achieve a consensus position on the desirability of establishing a formal benchmark, including the 30% of Gross Average Industrial Earnings benchmark.</P>
        <P>However, the report did provide a valuable resource for the assessment of the implications of adopting particular approaches to the up rating of social welfare payments and was considered by Government as part of the review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS) in 2002.  Recognising that the exact rate was a matter for Government, the Strategy set a target of &euro;150 per week (in 2002 terms) for the lowest social welfare payments, including Disability Allowance to be met by 2007.  This target was achieved in Budget 2007.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, commits the Government and social partners to working together to achieve the NAPS target and to maintaining the value of Disability Allowance and other social welfare rates <Col N="1935"/>at this level over the course of the agreement, subject to available resources.</P>
        <P>In addition to its income support role, Disability Allowance also acts as an incentive to employment or training though the income disregard for rehabilitative employment. Prior to 1 June 2006, this income disregard operated on the basis of a flat income limit of &euro;120 meaning that, once a person exceeded earnings of &euro;120 per week, payment of their Disability Allowance was withdrawn on a euro for euro basis. This approach provided no incentive to increase earnings from employment above that level and conflicted with one of the underlying policy principles relating to incentives to work; that there must be a reward for working.</P>
        <P>A review published by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in 2003 of the Illness and Disability Payment Schemes suggested that continually increasing the income disregard level is not the most appropriate answer to the disincentive problem. Instead, that Review favoured introducing a mechanism which would allow for the gradual reduction of social welfare benefits as earnings increase, thereby allowing people who increase their earnings or employment potential to see an increase in the overall income level.</P>
        <P>It was in this context that a change to the income disregard was introduced, as of from 1 June 2006, with the result that there is no longer a flat income limit of &euro;120 but instead a tapered withdrawal rate between &euro;120 and &euro;350. The effect of this is that all income up to &euro;120 is disregarded as means when assessing entitlement, while income between &euro;120 and &euro;350 is assessed on the basis of 50 cents for every euro earned. For a person on the maximum personal rate of Disability Allowance, this means they can now earn up to &euro;420 before their payment fully ceases.</P>
        <P>The Review of the Illness and Disability Payment Schemes, referred to above, was a wide-ranging and comprehensive review which, when examining Disability Allowance, also recommended a further review of the significant increase in the number of recipients of Disability Allowance since my Department took over responsibility for it in 1996. It is now my intention to undertake this review in order to look at this increase in numbers as well as at how best the allowance can support the objectives of my Department&rsquo;s Disability Sectoral Plan, especially in the area of activation and participation.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference for this review are currently being finalised within my Department. However, the forthcoming publication by the Central Statistics Office of findings from the National Survey on Disability in Ireland carried out in 2006 will be central to this review as it will allow the Department, for the first time, to &lsquo;match&rsquo; the incidence of disability in Ireland against the numbers in receipt of disability allowance.  Publication of this survey by the Central Statistics Office is not expected until early 2008 <Col N="1936"/>and this will impact on the final production of my Department&rsquo;s review.</P>
        <P>All issues in relation to Disability Allowance, including changes to either the rates of payment for Disability Allowance or the income disregard, or recommendations emerging from future reviews, will be considered within the context of the overall social welfare budgetary package.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 129 and 134 together. </P>
        <P>The Agreed Programme for Government contained a series of welfare reforms aimed at prioritising the interest of families and children.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of an earlier Social Partnership agreement the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) was asked to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement with qualified child increases with a view to creating a single second tier child income support. Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low-income families without creating significant disincentives to employment. This commitment to examining such a change was subsequently embodied in the current social partnership agreement &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>It is still unclear when the outcome of their deliberation on the issue will be made available by the NESC. What is clear, however, is that there are complex policy and technical challenges to be overcome if these two payment instruments are to be amalgamated. This document will, no doubt, confirm this and will be of assistance in informing developments in this area.</P>
        <P>The importance of targeted income support to families and children continues to be a high priority for me and for this Government and recent changes have seen substantial improvements in this area. These include increased weekly income thresholds for all FIS family sizes with additional resources being directed at larger <Col N="1937"/>families, as research has shown that this is where poverty is more likely to exist.</P>
        <P>Also this year all three rates of qualified child increase, which had remained unchanged since 1994, were consolidated to a single rate of &euro;22 per week. In addition, significant improvements were made to the annual back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which provides income support for the poorest families at a particularly difficult time of the year.</P>
        <P>These changes represent a more selective approach to child income support through targeting children in poorer households while at the same time limiting the extent to which employment disincentives are increased. Maintaining this balance will remain a priority in consideration of future policy changes in this area.</P>

        <Quest> the reason Section 39 of the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002 has not been fully commenced; when he will do so; and when he will commence the remaining parts of the Act. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 39 of the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002 provides for the insertion of a new section 56A into the Pensions Act 1990. Section 56A provides for the consideration of index-linked increases in rates payable in defined benefit pension schemes. It only applies to schemes where the rules do not provide mandatory indexation and does not require that indexation be introduced, only that it be examined. The intention of the provision is that it would encourage trustees to provide indexation of pensions in payment.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, the Green Paper on pensions policy was published on the 17th October and a major consultation process in relation to future pensions policy is now underway. Following the completion of the consultation process, the Government is to respond to the views expressed by publishing a framework for future pensions policy. As part of this process, the situation in relation to section 39 of the 2002 Act will be kept under review, in consultation with the Pensions Board, and section 39 commenced at an appropriate time.</P>
        <P>Section 3 of the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002 provided for the insertion of a new Part 10 into the Pensions Act to establish the framework for the introduction of Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs). This amendment has been commenced in full with the exception of section 122. Section 122 provides for the replacement of buy-out bonds with PRSAs. A buy-out bond is a pension bond into which you can <Col N="1938"/>transfer your fund if you leave your company pension scheme. Originally, the intention, in line with the National Pensions Policy Initiative, was that new buy-out bonds would cease when PRSAs became available.</P>
        <P>However, due to the 15 year tax rule on transfers from occupational pension schemes to PRSAs, buy-out bonds will have to remain, at least in the short to medium term. While there are no immediate plans to commence this section of the Act, I will continue to keep it under active consideration.</P>
        <P>Section 43 of this Act provides for new sections, 59D to 59F, to be inserted into the Pensions Act 1990. Sections 59D and E provide additional requirements for disclosure and consultation prior to finalisation of the winding-up of a pension scheme, actuarial certification of funding levels and disclosure to scheme members prior to bulk transfers. Section 59F provides that changes in scheme rules and the exercise of any discretionary power to augment members&rsquo; benefits may be deemed null and void in certain circumstances. All of these sections require the making of Regulations some of which are currently being drafted. When these Regulations are finalised, the enabling powers will be commenced.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 143 together.</P>
        <P>There has been a range of reforms to the social welfare system over recent decades which are making it easier for people, and women in particular, to qualify for contributory pensions.</P>
        <P>Social insurance coverage has been extended to include new categories of employment such as part-time workers, qualifying conditions for pensions have been eased and the Homemakers scheme introduced to limit the impact periods spent out of the workforce on caring duties can have on pension entitlements. The effect of these reforms, combined with increased workforce participation, will be to ensure that, in future, most people will qualify for a contributory pension in their own right.</P>
        <P>The Government has also taken action to improve the position of those who do not qualify for a pension in their own right, but are supported <Col N="1939"/>as qualified adults on the pension of their spouse or partner. The Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to increase the rate of the qualified adult payment to the level of the State Pension (non contributory) and, in the case of pensions claimed since the September of this year, the payment will issue direct to the spouse or partner. Voluntary arrangements for separate payments, which have been available since 2002, remain open to existing pension recipients.</P>
        <P>There are, of course, many older women who, for various reasons, cannot benefit from the many changes outlined. The position of these women, together with others not covered by the social welfare pensions system, and the implications of making provision for them, is discussed in the Green Paper on pensions which I published on the 17th October. Overall it is estimated that there are some 47,000 people, including 30,000 women, who are not receiving a pension payment in their own right or as a qualified adult on the pension of their spouse or partner. In the main these are former public servants, self-employed and their spouses. Decisions in this area will be made in the context of the framework for future pensions policy which will be developed when the consultation process on the Green Paper is completed.</P>
        <P>The Department is also carrying out a technical review of the entire social welfare code to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act 2000 (as amended). This will identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination, on any of the nine grounds under the Act, including: gender, sexual orientation, marital status and family status that are not justified by a legitimate social policy objective or where the means of achieving that objective are either unnecessary or inappropriate.</P>
        <P>The findings of this review and the conclusions in the social welfare pensions area arising from the publication of the Green Paper, will contribute to informed planning and policy making to ensure that the social welfare system, and the pensions system in general, reflects the needs and expectations of all citizens and is equitable in meeting those needs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Child benefit may be paid in respect of every child under the age of 16 years, who is ordinarily resident in the State. Payment can be extended to the 19th birthday if the child is in education, or incapable of self-support. The benefit is paid to the qualified person with whom <Col N="1940"/>the child resides and the qualified person must satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Habitual Residence Condition (HRC), introduced in May 2004,  is to allow access to our social welfare schemes to people who are genuinely and lawfully making Ireland their habitual residence, while preventing unwarranted access by persons who have little or no connection with the State.</P>
        <P>Persons without a right to residency in Ireland, such as Asylum seekers and those awaiting a residency decision are not considered to be habitually resident in the state.  Amongst the factors considered in deciding if a person is habitually resident are a person&rsquo;s future intentions to live in the country.</P>
        <P>If a person has not yet received permission to reside in Ireland, they are not considered to be able to establish their future intentions to live in the country.</P>
        <P>Those who do not satisfy the HRC condition because they are in the asylum process have direct provision available to them; in certain cases they may also avail of exceptional needs payments from the local Health Board for the period that their asylum application is being processed, and in this manner the rights and welfare of the child is protected.  As soon as refugee status or right to remain is granted to such persons, they are accepted as habitually resident and they therefore are entitled to child benefit in respect of their qualifying children.</P>
        <P>The operation of the habitual residence condition in my Department continues to be monitored on an ongoing basis.  The rationale behind the introduction of the HRC in May 2004 &mdash; to ensure that persons who have not worked in Ireland or who have not established their habitual residence in Ireland should not avail of assistance schemes or child benefit &mdash; continues to be relevant. As a result there is no proposal to change the current arrangements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to &lsquo;Increase the basic State pension by around 50% to at least &euro;300 per week by 2012&rsquo;. Changes to pension rates are considered each year in a budgetary context and any changes proposed for 2008 would be announced in the forthcoming Budget.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that the cost of increasing contributory pensions, which are financed through the Social Insurance Fund, to &euro;300 would be &euro;1,705 million in a full year.</P><Col N="1941"/>
        <P>The exact effect of such an increase on the Social Insurance Fund would be contingent on the sequencing of changes to pension rates in the period to 2012 but, in the short term, the Fund has sufficient resources to provide for this increase and increases to other benefit schemes.</P>
        <P>The second Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, which was required under Section 10 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 was published on 17th October 2007 in conjunction with the Green Paper on Pensions.</P>
        <P>The findings of the Review include:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />That the Fund will move from being in surplus to running a deficit in 2009; and</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />That on foot of the annual deficits from 2009, the accumulated surplus will be exhausted by 2016.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In this context it should be noted that legislation provides that the Exchequer is the residual financier of the Fund and Exchequer contributions to cover shortfalls in contributions were the norm for over forty years.</P>
        <P>Any shortfall in the cost of benefits paid would, in the normal way, be addressed by Exchequer subvention. Other approaches to such an annual deficit would be a matter for the Government to consider in a future budgetary context.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department actively assists and encourages lone parents to return to work, training or further education through a range of measures including earnings disregards and back to work and education incentives. </P>
        <P>For example, a single parent getting one parent family payment (OPFP) may have earnings from employment or self-employment of up to &euro;146.50 per week and still receive the maximum rate of OPFP. If their earnings are between &euro;146.50 and &euro;400 per week they may continue to receive payment but at a reduced rate. Where weekly earnings exceed &euro;400 they can continue to receive payment at 50% of the appropriate rate of OPFP payable to them for a period of 26 weeks subject to their satisfying all of the other conditions of the scheme and where, immediately prior to their earnings exceeding &euro;400 per week, they have been in receipt of OPFP for a period of not less than 52 weeks. The back to work allowance scheme allows single parents to return to work and receive an allowance equivalent to their weekly rate of OPFP on tapered basis. For those engaging in self-employment, the weekly allowance is 100% in year 1 and 75%, 50% and 25% <Col N="1942"/>respectively over the following 3 years. In the case of employees, the allowance is payable at 75% in year 1, 50% in year 2 and 25% in year 3. Currently there are 1,305 lone parents availing of the back to work allowance scheme, 392 of whom are self-employed.</P>
        <P>Lone parents may also avail of the back to education allowance programme which provides support to long-term social welfare recipients including lone parents who need to obtain educational qualifications before re-entering the labour market. Lone parents participating under the programme receive a standard weekly allowance equivalent to the rate of OPFP payable to them prior to participation.</P>
        <P>The Department has received funding under The National Development Plan 2007-2013 to develop an active outcome-focused individual case management of all social welfare customers of working age including lone parents who are not progressing into employment or accessing training or education opportunities. The objective is to establish a rights with responsibilities concept in social welfare supports by moving from a passive approach to active case management on an individual basis.</P>
        <P>The Government discussion paper &ldquo;Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents&rdquo; includes proposals or a range of services to assist lone parents with the transition to employment including the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities, the extension of the NDP, the focused provision of childcare and improved information services. The development of these services is currently being addressed by the relevant Departments and Agencies in co-operation with the Seniors Officials Group on Social Inclusion.</P>
        <P>The Department is committed to examining broader social policy reforms directed at the removal of existing obstacles to employment and educational opportunities for those most vulnerable in society. The measures outlined form part of this approach and provide positive support in assisting lone parents in the transition for welfare to work or education. In that regard, I not see any additional benefit in providing for the establishment of a participation fund as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

        <P>The current range of payment options offered by my Department to customers includes payment to a bank or building society account, or at a local post office.  Customers opt for a particular payment option having regard to their own circumstances.</P>
        <P>My Department administers a variety of schemes which have weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual payment cycles.  For operational and administrative reasons, and to facilitate the distribution of payments through the bank and Post Office networks, each scheme is assigned a day of the week for payment.  In this way, payments through Post Offices are spread across the week thus avoiding overcrowding and allowing for better management of queries.  In addition, customers can collect payments on the due date or on a day that suits their needs thereafter.  Customers receiving two payments from the Department can collect both social welfare payments at a Post Office on the same day.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government features a number of commitments in relation to social welfare pensions. These include the commitment to pay the over 80 allowance in respect of the qualified adult portion of the pension. The allowance was increased in 2006 to its present level of &euro;10 per week. There are approximately 4,500 qualified adults of contributory pensioners aged over 80 years.  Extending the over 80 allowance to this group will cost in the region of &euro;2.4 million per annum. This measure will be addressed over the lifetime of the Government. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 126 together. </P>
        <P>My Department has taken a lead role over the years in developing and implementing identity management policies and procedures based on the use of the Personal Public Services (PPS) number. This number was previously known as the Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number. The name was changed to indicate the broadening of its role to one which supports delivery of a broader range of public services but it is also still used for its original core purpose of providing a common identifier for the Revenue Commissioners and this Department.</P>
        <P>As well as facilitating wider-scale exchange of information, the PPS number also has a role in the development of on-line services for individuals. My Department provides identity related services to a number of agencies in accordance with legislation. Building on these services, the Department constructed Public Service Identity (PSI) services to assist agencies in basic on-line identity management. The initial deployment of PSI services, through the Reach agency, supports the registration and authentication functions of the Revenue Commissioners PAYE on-line services.</P>
        <P>The overall Government strategy is to realise the potential of the Information Society through innovation and modernisation of public services. As part of this, the Standard Authentication Framework Environment programme, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Finance, builds on PSI Services to provide the basis for a consistent set of registration and authentication services for customer interaction with public services. The Revenue Commissioners are also participating in this programme of work and we will continue to develop PSI and other relevant services in conjunction with them.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners are currently engaged in finalising a renewed Memorandum of Understanding between our organisations concerning co-operation and mutual assistance. The objective of the proposed revised Memorandum is:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to provide a basis for the continuance, enhancement and expansion of the existing administrative and operational arrangements;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to better reflect the missions, modern operating realities and totality of the relationship between the two organisations;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to recognise the growing interdependencies between the two organisations in achieving the delivery of services to the highest standard; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to strengthen liaison structures with a view to monitoring service delivery and control aspects.</P><Col N="1945"/>
<P FLI="0" el="5">It is expected that the Memorandum will be finalised before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>My Department will of course continue to explore on the basis of these significant ongoing developments how greater data and money transfer efficiencies could be realised in the future.</P>

	<P>In line with EU Regulation 1408/71, workers with families are entitled to family benefits such as Child Benefit (CB) and Early Childhood Supplement, even if the children are resident in the workers home country.</P>
        <P>In advance of the opening up of the labour market 2004 to workers from the EU accession states it was not possible to estimate the rate at which people would take up employment here and the impact that would have on the number of claims for family benefits. Indeed, in the years since accession, the number of claims being received on a monthly basis has fluctuated from a high level of over 400 per week to 150 in the last four weeks. Furthermore, it is not yet clear how long workers remain in this country having taken up employment, a factor which impacts on the estimated cost of the scheme.</P>
        <P>My Department has been developing its claim processing procedures and appropriate control activities in respect of family benefit claims from non-Irish applicants. These procedures are being developed in the light of experience processing claims in recent years and it is expected that over time a clearer picture will emerge of the work patterns and residency of non-Irish nationals which will facilitate more accurate estimation of future claim levels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Child Benefit paid for non-resident children in 2005 was &euro;1.6m and in 2006 amounted to &euro;2.9m. The Early Childcare Supplement commenced in April 2006 and amounted to just under &euro;400,000. The 2007 estimate for child benefit is &euro;4.2m and &euro;570,000 for the Early Childcare Supplement.</P>
        <P>In view of the uncertainties regarding the likely number of applicants and the duration of their claim, it is not possible at this stage to give precise estimates of costs for 2008.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Combating poverty and building an inclusive society are key priorities for the Government. The National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion), launched in February 2007, and the social inclusion commitments in the National Development Plan were drawn up in consultation with the social partners and after a wide ranging consultation process with other stakeholders.  The NAPinclusion adopts a lifecycle stage approach, in line with Towards 2016, with specific, measurable goals set for each group: children; people of working age; older people and people with disabilities; and their communities. It sets out a demanding and detailed programme of action to meet these goals and targets during the period 2007-2016. </P>
        <P>The overall goal in the NAPinclusion is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty to between 2 per cent and 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016.  Income support payments are central to achieving this objective.  Priority goals in the NAPinclusion relate to income support payments for children, for people of working age and for older people.</P>
        <P>Considerable investment has been made in income support for children in recent years. This year alone, the Government provided some &euro;240 million for a range of measures to combat child poverty. These included significant increases in Child Benefit, a new single high rate Qualified Child Allowance, improvements in the Family <Col N="1949"/>Income Supplement, the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance and the school meals programme, and higher earnings thresholds for One Parent Family Payments.  Improvements in child and family support payments have again been prioritised in the Programme for Government for the coming years.</P>
        <P>Children growing up in low income or jobless households are the most vulnerable to poverty.  Employment is the best route out of poverty and in line with the NAPinclusion further improvements in support for lone parents are planned. These  include a new case management approach to assist them in getting into employment, or to take up training to provide them with better skills, and a new social assistance payment, being developed by my department, to facilitate lone parents achieving financial independence through employment.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to maintaining the basic rates of welfare payments in line with the targets in the NAPinclusion. This can be seen in the level of increase in social welfare expenditure which is up from &euro; 5.7 billion in 1997 to over &euro;15 billion in 2007.</P>
        <P>Removing disincentives and barriers to taking up employment are important policy considerations in this regard.  A new Social and Economic Participation Programme to be introduced by my Department will focus on active engagement with people that are furthest from the labour market with the objective of supporting 50,000 people including lone parents and long term unemployed people over the next few years. People with disabilities are a particular priority and the immediate objective, working with FAS and other relevant agencies, is to have an additional 7,000 people with a disability who do not have difficulty in retaining a job, in employment by 2010.</P>
        <P>Support for carers and increasing the State Pension rate are ongoing priorities for the Government in implementing the NAPinclusion.  Further improvements in eligibility for the Carers Allowance are planned in the Programme for Government. The basic State Pension is now &euro;200 a week and the Government is committed to increasing it further to &euro;300 over the next few years.</P>
        <P>The NAPinclusion 2007 -2016 builds on the considerable progress achieved in the past decade in tackling poverty and reducing the number of people experiencing material deprivation in Ireland. Sustained investment by the Government in anti-poverty measures is yielding significant results. The latest results from the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions, released last week, indicate that the rate of consistent poverty in the population in 2006 was 6.5 per cent having reduced from 8.2% in 2003.  Most notably the rate of consistent poverty among older people has come down to 2.2% in 2006. The first annual Social Inclusion Report 2006-2007 prepared by the Office for Social Inclusion of my department <Col N="1950"/>and published in mid November shows that this progress is continuing and that the social inclusion targets are on track.</P>
        <P>My plan, in working with Government to deliver the programme over the coming years, is to build on the significant and visible progress already made in reducing poverty and material deprivation and to deliver real improvements in living standards and well-being for the most vulnerable in our society.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The term secondary benefits normally refers to those additional payments available to social welfare recipients who need extra help with meeting the cost of their rent, heating or other expenses. I understand the Deputy is referring principally to Fuel Allowance, Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) and Rent Supplement.</P>
        <P>All social assistance payments are subject to a means test. While there are similarities in the specific tests for these secondary benefits, they are designed to meet the objectives of each category of benefit and to ensure that the maximum amount of support is targeted at those most in need. For that reason, it is simply not possible or indeed desirable to have a single means test for all secondary benefits.</P>
        <P>The main conditions that apply to the fuel allowance scheme are that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and must either be living alone or only with a qualifying dependant. People who already qualify for means-tested pensions or allowances such as state pension (non-contributory), long-term jobseeker&rsquo;s assistance or one-parent family payment do not have to undergo a further means test to qualify for fuel allowance. The majority of people who receive fuel allowance qualify because they satisfy the relevant means test for their primary weekly payment.</P>
        <P>A person may qualify for payment of BSCFA in respect of a qualified child or children if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment or Health Service Executive (HSE) payment, or participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels. In this case, any family income supplement payable to the family is disregarded for means assessment purposes.</P>
        <P>The purpose of rent supplement, administered under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accom<Col N="1951"/>modation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. A person may qualify for rent supplement if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment or Health Service Executive (HSE) payment, or participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels . In this case, any family income supplement payable to the family is taken into account for means assessment purposes.</P>
        <P>The means test is structured to ensure that a rent supplement recipient is always better off if they take up work. It is necessary to take changes in family income supplement into account to achieve this outcome.</P>
        <P>Means tests are there to ensure that maximum support is targeted at those most in need of the support of the particular secondary benefit. The operation of means tests across all social welfare schemes is constantly under review. Any changes to the way means tests operate would have significant cost implication and would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My department administers a number of schemes designed to help working families on low incomes. </P>
        <P>Family income supplement is the principal in-work income support for people in low-income employment with children. It is designed to provide the incentive to remain in, or take up, employment rather than be fully welfare dependent. To qualify for payment, a person must be engaged in insurable employment for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight. However, a couple may combine their hours of employment to meet this criterion.</P>
        <P>Improvements to FIS include the change of assessment from a gross income basis to net income, the increase to &euro;20 per week in the minimum payment and, in recent years, the re-focusing of income thresholds to include additional gains for larger families.</P>
        <P>If a low income worker is not employed at a level appropriate to claim FIS, there are a range of other payments which may be more appropriate. For instance, people working up to three days per week may instead apply for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, provided they are unemployed for the remainder of the week and continue to seek full-<Col N="1952"/>time work. Entitlement can be either insurance based (jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit) or means-based (jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance).</P>
        <P>The part-time job incentive scheme is available to those who were previously on a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for 15 months or more and are now working under 24 hours per week while seeking full-time employment. This payment is not means-tested.</P>
        <P>Farm assist is a weekly means-tested payment for low income farmers, including those who may have off-farm employment or self-employment.</P>
        <P>In addition, many social welfare payments, including one parent family payment and disability allowance provide for earnings disregards and tapered withdrawal of payments as earnings increase. Information on all my department&rsquo;s schemes is available from any social welfare local office or the department&rsquo;s website, www.welfare.ie.</P>
        <P>As any relaxation of FIS qualification criteria on the lines suggested would not be consistent with the objectives of the scheme, I have no plans to proceed in this way.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 145 together.</P>
        <P>The Citizens Information Act 2007 provides for the establishment of a Personal Advocacy Service for certain people with disabilities to be administered by the Citizens Information Board.</P>
        <P>The Personal Advocacy Service will assist the individuals concerned in identifying and understanding their needs and options with regard to a broad range of social services including health, social welfare, education, family support, housing, taxation, citizenship, consumer matters, employment and training, equality, asylum and immigration.</P>
        <P>The development of advocacy services is a priority for my Department and in this regard additional funding of &euro;1.9m has been provided for the Citizens Information Board in 2007 for the development of a personal advocacy service for people with disabilities and for the implementation of the Disability Sectoral Plan.</P><Col N="1953"/>
        <P>An organisational structure has been developed by the Citizens Information Board to meet the needs of the Personal Advocacy Service.  Discussions between my Department, the Department of Finance and the Citizens Information Board are ongoing in relation to these structures and the additional staffing resources required for the service.  Temporary accommodation has been identified to facilitate the immediate needs of the service.</P>
        <P>The commencement order for all sections of the Citizens Information Act, 2007, other than part of Section 4 and all of Section 5 has been signed into law.  It is envisaged that the post of Director of the Personal Advocacy Service will be advertised shortly. The service will commence when the Director is appointed and the appropriate structures have been put in place.  The establishment of the new service is on target to be up and running in the early part of 2008.</P>

	<P>Information on poverty levels, deprivation and social exclusion are provided in the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU&ndash;SILC), which is conducted on an annual basis by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and which commenced in Ireland in 2003. The most recent results are for the year 2006, which were published on November 27 2007.</P>
        <P>In 2006 the percentage of households &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; and whose principal economic status was &lsquo;at work&rsquo; was 6.5%.  This rate was significantly lower than that for the total population, which was 17.0% in 2006.  However, households whose income falls below the 60% median income threshold are classified as being &ldquo;at risk of poverty&rdquo;, but are not necessarily in poverty.  An indicator has been developed by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), called &ldquo;consistent poverty&rdquo;, which identifies the proportion of people &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo;, who are also classified as being in consistent poverty due to being deprived of certain goods or services considered essential for a basic standard of living.  This measure was recently updated and revised by the ESRI. It is now used in the National <Col N="1954"/>Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion) 2007-2016.</P>
        <P>In 2006 the percentage of persons whose principal economic status was &lsquo;at work&rsquo; and who were in &ldquo;consistent poverty&rdquo; was 1.6%.  This compares with a rate of 6.9% for the total population.</P>
        <P>The issue of families where the head of the household is in low income employment has been raised in several fora, in particular with reference to the issue of childcare as experienced by one parent families.  While this specific issue is being addressed by my colleague the Minister for Children, my department administers a number of schemes designed to help working families on low incomes including transitional payments for people moving from welfare to work.</P>
        <P>Family income supplement is the principal in-work income support for people in low-income employment with children.  It is designed to provide the incentive to remain in, or take up, employment rather than be fully welfare dependent.  Recent improvements to family income supplement include the change of assessment from a gross income basis to net income, the increase to &euro;20 per week in the minimum payment and, in budget 2007, the continued re-focusing of income thresholds to include additional gains for larger families.</P>
        <P>People working three days a week or less may instead apply for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, provided they continue to seek full-time work.  Entitlement can be either insurance based (jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit) or means-based (jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance).</P>
        <P>The part-time job incentive scheme is available to those who were previously on a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for 15 months or more and are now working under 24 hours per week while seeking full-time employment. This payment is not means-tested.</P>
        <P>Farm assist is a weekly means-tested payment for low income farmers, including those who may have off-farm employment or self-employment.</P>
        <P>Recipients of various social welfare schemes may also qualify for a transitional payment under the back to work programme, which provides for a phased level of income support over a number of years when taking up employment or self-employment.  This payment is not means-tested, with more relaxed qualification criteria for people aged 50 or older.</P>
        <P>Full details of my department&rsquo;s schemes are available from any social welfare local office or my department&rsquo;s website, www.welfare.ie.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Programme for Government features a number of commitments in relation to <Col N="1955"/>social welfare pensions, including a commitment to increase the basic State pension to &euro;300 per week by 2012. </P>
        <P>Over the last number of Budgets, pension increases have been well ahead of inflation ensuring that not only is the real value of pensions maintained but that they are significantly improved in real terms.</P>
        <P>The Department monitors regular statistical releases such as the EU Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC) to track the effectiveness of income policies. The 2006 EU-SILC report, published last week, showed that the position for older people improved significantly from 2005 to 2006, with the &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate falling from 20.1% to 13.6%. Furthermore the number of people aged 65 and over at risk of poverty was significantly lower than for the general population which stood at 17%. There was no significant difference between the rates for men and women, with 13.6% of men aged 65 and over at risk of poverty and 13.7% of women aged 65 and over at risk of poverty.</P>
        <P>For many years now, the Government has been anxious to ensure that as many people as possible should qualify for pensions in their own right. In this regard, qualifying conditions for contributory pensions have been eased and special pensions such as the pre-53 payment have been introduced.   In the last two Budgets a particular emphasis has been placed on non-contributory pensions with significant improvements in the means test and a higher rate of increase being granted than that given on the contributory side. These improvements are of particular benefit to older women who make up the majority of recipients of non-contributory pensions.</P>
        <P>In the case of contributory pensions and most other contributory and non-contributory social welfare payments, a qualified adult increase is payable in respect of a spouse or partner who is wholly or mainly maintained by the claimant. Since 2002, pensioner couples can opt for a payment to be made to a spouse or partner by requesting that the qualified adult portion of the pension be paid directly. This has provided a direct payment for many spouses without their own pension entitlement. Since 24th September, paying the pension and qualified adult increase separately is the default option for new pension claims unless the spouse/partner indicates that they do not wish to receive a direct payment.</P>
        <P>The Government has committed itself to complete the process begun in Budget 2007 to bring payments to qualified adults up to the level of the State pension (non-contributory) over a period of three years. The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to extend payment of the over 80 allowance to qualified adults, which will benefit some 4,500 people who are receiving support as qualified adults on the pension of their spouse or partner.</P><Col N="1956"/>
        <P>The needs of older people have been, and will remain, a priority for the Government. Further reforms and improvements will be considered in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions, published on the 17th October. The Green Paper sets out a range of suggestions in relation to social welfare pension reform. This includes discussing the use of universal entitlements, back-dating the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, examining the means test for qualified adults on contributory pensions and changing the basis of assessment from average to total contributions for contributory pension entitlement. A major consultation process in relation to future pensions policy is now underway. Following the completion of the consultation process, the Government will develop a framework for future pensions policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The recommendation of the Law Reform Commission arose from one of two important pieces of work which have been completed regarding different types of partner relationships and how they should be treated and recognised in Irish society. The first report an &lsquo;Options Paper, presented by the Working Group on Domestic Partnership&rsquo; to the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, focuses on different types of cohabiting relationships, both same and opposite sex, and presents a range of options with regard to giving legal recognition to these relationships. Officials from my Department contributed to the work of this Group.</P>
        <P>The second report &mdash; the &lsquo;Report of the Law Reform Commission on the Rights and Duties of Cohabitants&rsquo; &mdash; makes substantial recommendations for reform of the law concerning cohabitants including both opposite sex or same sex couples who live together.</P>
        <P>These reports come at a time of wide public debate on the question of according legal status to cohabitants generally, and same sex couples in particular, and have contributed to the informed debate on these important topics.</P><Col N="1957"/>
        <P>They will also inform the preparation of a General Scheme of a Civil Partnership Bill as approved by Government on 31 October 2007.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently carrying out a technical review of the entire social welfare code to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act, 2000 (as amended).  The review will examine the schemes and services provided for both in social welfare legislation and the administrative schemes operated by the Department. It will identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination, on any of the nine grounds under the Act, including: gender, sexual orientation, marital status and family status and whether these are justified by a legitimate social policy objective or whether the means of achieving that objective are both necessary and appropriate.</P>
        <P>This work, together with the reports I have referred to, will contribute to informed planning and policy making to ensure that the social welfare system reflects the needs and expectations of citizens and is equitable in meeting those needs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) is an important part of the social welfare system. Social Insurance provides a range of benefits to customers at certain specified times in their lives. The integrity of the PRSI system is dependent on timely, appropriate contributions being made to the Social Insurance Fund by employers, employees and the self employed as laid down in social welfare legislation.</P>
        <P>Contributions due to the Social Insurance Fund are collected in the main by the Revenue Commissioners, together with income tax due. My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, appointed under Section 250 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 is responsible, inter alia, for ensuring that employers and self employed people comply with the Act in relation to Pay Related Social Insurance contributions. Employer compliance, in this regard, is monitored through inspections include detailed examinations of employers&rsquo; records to ensure that correct PRSI payments are being made in respect of all employees. In addition, any irregularity in a customer&rsquo;s PRSI record detected at claim processing stage or reported directly by the customer, is referred to the Inspectorate for follow up action.</P>
        <P>My Department currently employs some 290 Social Welfare Inspectors throughout the country <Col N="1958"/>whose duties involve the investigation of eligibility to a broad variety of means tested schemes, as well as enforcing the law in relation to employers&rsquo; responsibilities in regard to PRSI matters. In addition, my Department has over 90 officers in it&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit which is dedicated to combating fraud. These officers also work with Revenue and the new E.T. &amp; E. Inspectorate in carrying out joint investigations of employment records.</P>
        <P>Employer inspections carried out by my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate are comprehensive and involve:</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />detailed examination of employer records to ensure that accurate records of employees are being maintained and that correct PRSI payments are being made in respect of all their employees and that the correct PRSI class is being applied;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />checks to ensure that employees are not concurrently working and claiming social welfare payments;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />outlining employers responsibilities with regard to Social Welfare legislation and where Revenue staff are part of the inspection team, tax legislation;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />general advice and information to employers on matters such as the operation of the PRSI system, incentives available to employers, the correct classes of contributions, employees&rsquo; entitlements etc.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Where PRSI undercharges are confirmed, the Inspector sets out PRSI arrears/underpayment in respect of each employee for each tax year and issues a demand to the employer for payment. Should the employer fail to respond satisfactorily, a statutory demand will issue by registered post and the employer given 14 days to respond. If the employer fails to respond the case is considered for prosecution.</P>
        <P>In the absence of wage records, an employee statement (Form IN12) detailing evidence of employment and payment of earnings is obtained. Based on confirmation of employment, either by way of wage inspection or employee statement, my Department&rsquo;s Central Records Unit is advised to update the employee&rsquo;s PRSI record for the period of employment in question. Where a benefit claim is pending the relevant Local Office/Section is similarly advised.</P>
        <P>The number of employer inspections initiated this calendar year (up to 30/11/07) is some 4550, of which 4190 have been completed. The remaining cases are still under active investigation.</P>
        <P>21 employer cases, for offences relating to non-compliance with PRSI legislation, were forwarded to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office for prosecution in 2006, 7 cases were finalised in court.</P>
        <P>In the first ten months of 2007, 13 employer cases for offences relating to non-compliance <Col N="1959"/>with PRSI legislation were forwarded to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office for prosecution. 11 cases were finalised in court.</P>
        <P>My Department is committed to delivering an effective and efficient regime of employer inspections, and ensuring that PRSI deductions and remittances are made in an accurate and timely manner.</P>

	<P>Family income supplement (FIS) is the principal in-work income support for people in low-income employment with children. It designed to provide the incentive to remain in, or take up, employment rather than be fully welfare dependent. In 2006, some 33,000 claims were received for FIS. 13,000 of these were first claims while 19,400 approx. were renewals. For the same period in 2005 there were 22,740 claims received, 7,780 of which were new claims while 14,960 were renewals.</P>
        <P>Recent improvements to family income supplement include the change of assessment from a gross income basis to net income, the increase to &euro;20 per week in the minimum payment and, in budget 2007, the continued re-focusing of income thresholds to include additional gains for larger families.</P>
        <P>For example, since 2002 the FIS threshold for a one child family has increased from &euro;362 to &euro;480, an increase of 32.6%.</P>
        <P>In my view this represents a significant commitment to low income families which I hope to carry forward into the future.</P>

	<P>In line with the recommendations of the Final Report of the National Pensions Board, Section 12 of The Social Welfare Act 1997 (now incorporated in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005) provides for amendments to the contribution conditions for the purposes of State contributory pensions.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the legislation, from April 2002 the paid contributions requirement was standardised at 260 contributions and this will increase to 520 contributions with effect from April 2012. The planned contribution requirement has, for a number of years, been included <Col N="1961"/>in the Department&rsquo;s standard information material on pensions.</P>
        <P>The Department is at present assessing the likely impact of the change on those who will reach pension age in 2012. The need for promotional work and other measures related to the planned change will be considered when this examination is complete.</P>

        <Quest> if he is satisfied that the high number of Irish nationals who have been refused a social welfare payment under the habitual residency rule continues to be warranted; and the basis on which he is making this judgment. </Quest>
        <QRef>[32208/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1st of May 2004.</P>
        <P>The basis for the restriction is the applicant&rsquo;s habitual residence. The restriction is not based on citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor. The question of what is a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; has been decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims.</P>
        <P>These grounds are now specified in Section 30 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007. Decisions to the effect that applicants satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition are made in the majority of cases at claim acceptance stage by Deciding Officers at local level throughout the country. Complex cases that require detailed consideration are sent to a central section in Dublin or are examined in more detail in the scheme areas.</P>
        <P>For the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 October 2007, the number of applications decided in respect of Irish citizens was 15,788, of which 1,629 (10%) were disallowed.</P>
        <P>Each case received for a determination on the Habitual Residence Condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. Any applicant who disagrees with a decision has the right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
        <P>EU legislation prohibits discrimination between nationals of EU Member States in the context of freedom of movement of workers and their access to social security or social assistance entitlements. Therefore national legislation must not differentiate between Irish nationals and other EU nationals in the application of the habitual residence legislation.</P>
        <P>However, Irish nationals returning to live here on a permanent basis should experience no diffi<Col N="1962"/>culty in meeting the requirements of the Habitual Residence Condition.</P>
        <P>Amongst the factors governing a decision in this matter are an assessment of the claimant&rsquo;s main centre of interest and future intentions as it appears from all the circumstances.</P>
        <P>The Habitual Residence Condition is being operated in a careful manner to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s social welfare system is protected, while at the same time ensuring that persons whose cases are appropriate to the system have access to it when they need it.</P>
        <P>The reason for the introduction of the Habitual Residence Condition in May 2004 was to ensure that persons who have not worked in Ireland or who have not established habitual residence in Ireland should not avail of assistance schemes or child benefit. The operation of the condition was reviewed by my Department in 2006 and it is not intended to introduce any changes to the current policy in this regard as the original reason for the policy is still valid. The review recommendations relate in the main to increasing the efficiency of administrative procedures concerned with the application of the Habitual Residence Condition.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary objective of my Department&rsquo;s information policy is to ensure that all citizens are made aware of the wide range of schemes and services available and that they are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur.</P>
        <P>My Department operates a network of approximately 130 local and branch offices throughout the country. Each Local Office has officers who are dedicated to providing information and are available to explain supports and services to people. Access to information services and the quality and range of services have been enhanced in recent years. In addition, for general enquiries a LoCall Information Line (1890 66 22 44) is in operation in my Department, which enables customers, regardless of their geographic location, to get information on schemes and services.</P>
        <P>My Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets which <Col N="1963"/>are available in a wide range of outlets across the country, including all local Social Welfare Offices, Citizens Information Centres, Post Offices and from my Department&rsquo;s LoCall Leaflet Line at 1890 20 23 25. Information is also provided on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.welfare.ie.</P>
        <P>A pro-active approach is taken in advertising new schemes and services, or changes and improvements to existing schemes and services, by using an appropriate mix of national and provincial media, information leaflets, fact sheets, posters and direct mailshots.</P>
        <P>Presentations and talks are given by staff of my Department to various interest groups relevant to their needs and my Department also attends exhibitions and seminars throughout the country promoting information on social welfare rights and entitlements.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14- ?><P>The Citizens Information Board, under the remit of my Department is the national support agency responsible for supporting the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy on the broad range of social services which includes social welfare services. The Board supports the provision of information to the public through three information channels: the Citizens Information website (www.citizensinformation.ie), the Citizens Information Phone Service and the nationwide network of Citizens Information Services. There are 42 Citizens Information Services offering information from 254 locations throughout the country, comprising 105 Citizens Information Centres (51 full-time and 54 part-time) and 149 outreach services. The Citizens Information Phone Service provides information by telephone at Lo-Call rates, operating from 9am to 9pm, Monday to Friday.</P>
 <?oasys _dc0- ?>
        <P>MABS, which is funded by my Department, provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems. MABS offices are located in 65 locations nationwide. The National Telephone Helpline 1890 283 438 (1890 BUDGET) is available Monday to Friday from 9am to 8pm and information about budgeting and a self help money management facility is also available online at the MABS website www.mabs.ie.</P>
        <P>My Department works in co-operation with F&Aacute;S in encouraging people to participate in work, training or education through the National Employment Action Plan.</P>
        <P>The Employment Action Plan is a preventative strategy in which the Department refers unemployed people to F&Aacute;S on reaching specified duration thresholds on the Live Register. It is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s labour market policy. The purpose is to enable the person to access the range of employment, training and education opportunities afforded by F&Aacute;S. It is based on the well established principle that early <Col N="1964"/>intervention reduces the likely duration of unemployment.</P>
        <P>There is a significant amount of day-to-day inter-agency co-operation in the provision of information and services to citizens. While there are no plans at this time to establish a one-stop information centre, as suggested in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, opportunities for greater synergy between the various bodies will be kept under review.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> his plans to amend legislation to allow welfare payments to be backdated on a standard basis by more than the current six months; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislative provisions relating to late claims for social welfare benefits are set out in Section 241 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, and in Regulations made under that section. These provisions set out the times within which a person must claim, the disqualifications which apply where a claim is made late, and the circumstances in which the time limits may be extended.</P>
        <P>Since 1997 a number of improvements have been made to the provision relating to late claims for social welfare payments. For example, prior to 1997 arrears of state pension contributory claims were limited to either three months or six months before the date of claim. Regulations made in 2000 put certain extra-statutory provisions that had applied in the case of late claims under certain schemes on a statutory basis. All late claims are now determined in accordance with the legislation.</P>
        <P>The legislation also provides for payment to be made on foot of late claims in the case of a range of other schemes for a period of 6 months prior to the date of claim provided there was good cause for the late claim.</P>
        <P>The legislation now also provides for relaxation of the restrictions on backdating late claims under all schemes apart from Unemployment Benefit, <Col N="1965"/>Unemployment Assistance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance, and for further payment to be made, up to the level of full retrospection where the circumstances would warrant it, where:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the delay was due to incorrect information having been given by my Department, or</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />illness or a force majeure prevented a person from claiming earlier or,</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the person is dependent on the arrears of payment to relieve financial hardship.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is generally accepted that there is an obligation on people to claim their social welfare entitlements in time. However, cases will inevitably arise where they fail to do so and the legislative provisions are designed to cater for such situations. I am satisfied that the current provisions strike a reasonable balance between, on the one hand the need to exercise supervision and control of claims and the requirements of sound financial management and control of public expenditure and, on the other hand, the need for appropriate recognition to be given to cases of genuine hardship or difficulty.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150, 152 and 153 together.</P><Col N="1966"/>
        <P>My Department has not carried out a study of opening hours of the public offices under its control.  However, the Deputy will be aware that access to public services and choice in how those services are delivered (including opening) are two of the core principles of the Quality Customer Service Initiative.  My Department uses customer surveys on a regular basis to establish customer needs and to feed this information into its customer charter and customer actions plan, to meet any service gaps that may be identified.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s business hours are 9.00am to 7.00pm from Monday to Friday and the Department&rsquo;s switchboard operates during this time.  My Department does not close for lunch.  There are normally Departmental staff on duty and available outside normal hours in addition to a 24 hour security presence.   My Department is open to the public between 10.00am and 2.30pm every Saturday for the tours of Government Buildings.   There are a number of other channels available which can be utilised by our customers to communicate with my Department, such as e-mail, website feedback forms, post and fax.</P>
        <P>The opening hours for the CSO offices in Cork and Rathmines are 9.15am to 5.30pm Monday to Thursday and 9.15am to 5.15pm on Friday.  These opening times were reviewed when the CSO updated its Customer Service Action Plan for 2007 to 2009.  The outcome of this review was to increase the opening times for the library in the Rathmines office, which is open from 9.30am to 5.00pm Monday to Friday and is closed for lunch each day from 1.00pm to 1.30pm.  CSO telephone lines are open at the above times.</P>
        <P>The CSO website (www.cso.ie) plays an ever-increasing role in publishing statistics and provides &ldquo;always on&rdquo; access to all the CSO&rsquo;s statistical releases and publications.  The CSO Customer Service Action Plan 2007-2009 is also published on the website.</P>
        <P>The offices of the National Economic and Social Development Office are open from 9.00am to 5.00pm Monday to Friday. They are closed for lunch between 1.00pm and 2.00pm. A receptionist is on duty while the office is open and answers telephone calls coming in to NESDO&rsquo;s direct line (01- 8146300). If the receptionist is off duty for any reason, there is a system in place where the caller is presented with options to select one of the constituent bodies (NESDO, NESC, NESF or NCPP) by dialling a digit.</P>
        <P>The call is automatically forwarded to staff in the body selected. After 5.00pm, NEDSO has a pre-recorded message informing the caller that the office is closed, the official opening hours and inviting the caller to leave a message if they wish. Messages are monitored by the receptionist the morning of the following working day and relayed to the relevant staff.</P>
        <P>NESDO has a direct dial in facility i.e. if the caller knows the extension of the person they wish to talk to, they can phone that number <Col N="1967"/>directly without going through reception. While the official opening hours are 9.00am to 5.00pm as stated above, there are normally staff in the office from 7.30 am through to 6.30 pm as the office operates flexitime. It also has a recorded message facilities on all staff phones. Staff can access these messages when they return to their desks, or indeed by phoning in to their extension from outside.</P>

	<P>While my Department has a relatively low level of interaction with the general public and the business sector, we encourage feedback via our Customer Service Feedback form.

        <P>There is a facility on the Department&rsquo;s website whereby a Freedom of Information application can be completed and submitted on-line.  Freedom of Information applications can also be made to my Department by written/postal request.</P>
        <P>The Information Society Policy Unit (ISPU), on behalf of my Department, manages the Access, Skills and Content (ASC) Initiative.  The ASC Initiative has provided funding for community and voluntary groups and not-for-profit organisations.  The application form for this funding initiative can be downloaded from the Department of the Taoiseach website and can also be obtained directly from the ISPU office.  The form cannot currently be completed on-line, as the relatively low level of use of this scheme is considered to be insufficient to justify the expense of providing a full on-line facility.</P>
        <P>Suppliers of goods and services to my Department are required to complete an official form that facilitates payments being made directly to their bank accounts via electronic fund transfer. <Col N="1968"/> Suppliers can have the form forwarded to them through either email, fax or post.   Once completed, the form can be returned by email, fax or post.  This form cannot be completed on-line as an original signature is required from each company when setting up an electronic fund transfer facility.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works is currently actively engaged in a strategy to reduce Carbon Dioxide emissions and the State&rsquo;s dependency on fossil fuels.   A major element of this strategy is an Energy Awareness Campaign by the Office of Public Works, which will be rolled out in 2008, in which my Department will be actively involved.</P>
        <P>During the summer of 2007, the Office of Public Works installed web-based energy monitoring units throughout Government Buildings which monitor and record electrical and heating fuel consumption every 15 minutes.   The target is to reduce carbon emissions in each building by 15% through local energy conservation campaigns, energy workshops and close monitoring of the performance of heating/air conditioning equipment.  Staff will be able to monitor the energy reductions in their building via the Internet site.</P>

	<P>ERDF-funded INTERREG programmes are intended to address the economic and social disadvantage that can result from the existence of a border, either land or maritime.  During the period 2007-2013 these programmes will take place under the EU&rsquo;s European Territorial Cooperation Objective 3; and that also during this period Ireland will participate in all of the three strands of the Objective 3 programmes, cross-border, transnational, and interregional.  These programmes will address issues in all parts of the EU.</P>
        <P>Ireland will participate in two cross-border programmes, the Ireland/Northern Ireland/Western Scotland Programme, and the Ireland/Wales Programme.  The programme of most relevance to Ireland in terms of scale and expenditure will be the Ireland/Northern Ireland/Western Scotland Programme.  This Programme is designed to support strategic cross-border cooperation for a more prosperous region and will improve access to services to enhance the <Col N="1972"/>quality of life.  This Programme will have EU funding of &euro;192 million.</P>
        <P>The Ireland/Wales Programme, which is primarily a maritime cross-border programme, will be aimed achieving a sustainable development by a progressive integration of local economic, social and environmental development.  The Programme will have EU funding of &euro;52.7 million.</P>
        <P>Ireland will also participate in three transnational programmes.  These are the Atlantic Area Programme which will include Ireland, UK, part of west France, northern Spain and Portugal.  The programme will have EU funding of &euro;104 million.</P>
        <P>The North West Europe Programme will include Ireland, the UK, northern France, Benelux countries, part of Germany and part of Switzerland.  The programme will have EU funding of &euro;335 million.  For the period 2007-2013 Ireland will for the first time also participate in the Northern Periphery Programme which will include the south and west coast of Ireland, Northern Ireland, part of Scotland, parts of Sweden and Finland and the non-Member States of Greenland, Iceland and Faroe Islands.  This programme will have EU funding of &euro;35 million.</P>
        <P>Finally, Ireland will participate in the interregional Programme which covers all 27 EU Member States as well as Norway and Switzerland.  The programme will have EU funding of &euro;321 million.</P>

	<P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that correspondence and meetings in this case date back to 1998.  The individual expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that his name had been incorrectly associated with a particular vehicle.  As deletion of the entry was not an option at the stage Revenue were advised of the matter, a specific endorsement was added to the vehicle record, which clearly stated that the individual was not the owner of the vehicle at the time of registration by the Revenue Commissioners. This entry was made for the purpose of addressing the specific concerns expressed by the individual.  This action was the correct and only course of action available.</P>
        <P>The individual remained dissatisfied and was invited to meet with another Revenue official to resolve his dissatisfaction. The individual was invited to prepare text for insertion into the registration file that would reflect his view of the factual position and address his concerns about the adequacy of the original note.  The text provided <Col N="1973"/>by the individual now appears as an endorsement on the vehicle record.</P>
        <P>No action taken by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners breached the Constitution.  Over the space of nine years the Office of the Revenue Commissioners has at all times addressed the concerns raised by the individual in a consultative and cooperative manner.</P>

	<P>In 2005, on foot of commitments in Sustaining Progress, management and unions reached agreement on the integration of the Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) for the Civil Service with wider HR policies and processes, including assessment systems.  In particular the ratings resulting from annual assessments will, in addition to their use for staff development purposes, now be linked to the awarding of annual increments, assignments to higher scales and access to promotion competitions.  The annual assessment is based on a uniform five-point scale for all grades.</P>
        <P>The integrated Performance Management and Development System was introduced in 2006 for training and familiarisation purposes only.  Ratings based on assessments for 2007 (which have not yet been completed) will inform decisions relating to increments, higher scales and promotion.  There is no target allocation for each rating.  It would be expected that the greatest number of staff would be in category three, the middle bracket, with remaining staff falling into the other categories.</P>
        <P>In any event, I consider that it would be inappropriate to specify by Department the number, or even the proportion, of staff who fall within the various categories. This could compromise both the operation of the Performance Management Development System within the civil service and the management function within individual Departments.  In accordance with the arrangements agreed with the civil service unions, a formal evaluation of the revised model will commence in 2009.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Pilot Project on Resource Allocation, Business Planning and Performance Measurement was presented to me in August 2005, the same month that the inter-departmental working group completed its work. The conclusions and recommendations of this report informed Government thinking on reform of the Estimates and Budget process, in particular in relation to the presentation of Annual Output Statements by each Minister, as I announced in Budget 2006.</P>
        <P>The Annual Output Statements were presented for the first time earlier this year to assist the D&aacute;il Select Committees with their consideration of the 2007 Estimates.  The original template for these Annual Output Statements was developed by the inter-departmental working group referred to by the Deputy and set out in its Report.  The Annual Output Statements for 2007 set out performance output targets by programme area linked to the high level goals in Departments&rsquo; Strategy Statements and, for 2008 onwards, will set out actual performance against the previous year&rsquo;s output targets, as well as setting out new targets for the year ahead.</P>
        <P>While the Report of the Pilot Project was not formally published, copies were widely circulated at the time to Ministers and their Departments, to Opposition Finance spokespersons and to Committee chairpersons to assist them in understanding a major element in the thinking behind the Government&rsquo;s Budgetary reforms.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 to 175, inclusive, together.</P>
<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the exact information sought for all taxes on a county basis is not available.  Revenue Sheriffs, County Registrars or their officers operate for the purposes of enforcement of tax debt within certain geographical boundaries known as a &ldquo;bailiwick&rdquo; which equates geographically with &ldquo;county&rdquo;. Data on the net receipts of most taxes can be linked to bailiwicks to provide an estimated breakdown of receipts on a county basis.</P>
        <P>The following tables set out the estimated breakdown of net receipts for Income Tax (PAYE &amp; non-PAYE), VAT (Domestic), Corporation Tax, and Capital Gains Tax.  Basic data is not recorded in such a manner as would enable a breakdown by county to be provided in respect of the yield from Stamp Duties, Capital Acquisitions Tax (including Inheritance Tax), Customs, Excise and VAT at the point of Import.</P>
        <P>In considering the data it should be noted that the amount of tax attributed to a county may not necessarily be an indication of economic activity in that county for any of the following reasons:</P>
        <P el="5">1.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />The liability of a trader to VAT is generally dealt with by reference to the location of the trader&rsquo;s registered office even though the economic activity may be carried on in another county.</P><Col N="1979"/>
        <P el="5">2.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />An employer&rsquo;s liability for PAYE is normally attributed to the county in which wages and salaries are paid, even though the employees may work in different counties.</P>
       <P el="5">3.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />Companies are associated on the tax record with the county address of the head-office or branch with which contact is established for <Col N="1980"/>tax purposes, which may be different to the city or county addresses of other branches. The distribution of corporate tax between regions can also vary from year to year as companies relocate.</P>
         <P el="5">4.<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />Self-employed persons are associated on the tax record with the address at which the business is located, which may be in a different county to the home address.</P><Col N="1979"/>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if tax relief is claimable by a person in respect of the cost of any out of pocket costs of a home care package approved by a public health nurse or a discharging hospital. </Quest>
        <QRef>[32117/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Home care packages deliver a wide range of services and may vary according to the care needs of the person so that, for example, there might be a greater emphasis in some packages on home care assistants while other packages may require a greater level of therapy and nursing.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the context of care for elderly or ill individuals, the question of tax relief arises, generally, under three main headings &mdash; (a) tax relief in respect of health expenses;  (b) tax relief, in cases of serious illness, where qualified nurses are engaged on the advice of a medical practitioner to provide constant nursing care in the patient&rsquo;s home; and (c) a tax deduction for employing a person to take care of an incapacitated individual.  In all cases the relief may be claimed in relation to unreimbursed health expenses only.  In the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, therefore, these reliefs do not arise if the costs are met by a home care package from the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The normal health expenses rules under section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 apply in respect of the costs incurred by an individual in respect of qualifying health expenses, including where the individual has to incur such expenses in the context of a home care package.  Tax relief may be claimed on qualifying unreimbursed health expenses paid by an individual and, for tax years up to 2006 inclusive, this relief is restricted to those health expenses incurred by the individual in respect of himself or herself, and his or her qualifying dependants.  However, this <Col N="1988"/>requirement for a defined relationship is abolished in respect of claims for 2007 and subsequent tax years meaning that an individual can claim tax relief in respect of health expenses paid by him or her on behalf of any other individual.  For tax years up to 2006 inclusive, the first &euro;125 of any health expenses incurred by the taxpayer, or in the case of an individual claiming relief in respect of two or more persons the first &euro;250, does not qualify for relief.  However, for 2007 and subsequent tax years, relief is available in respect of all qualifying health expenses.  Medical expenses relief may be claimed by logging onto the Revenue website <i>www.revenue.ie</i> and accessing PAYE self-service.  Alternatively, an individual can make a manual claim using Form MED 1 (available on the Revenue website).  More detail on the tax relief on health expenses is contained in Revenue&rsquo;s Explanatory Leaflet IT 6 (available on the Revenue website).</P>
        <P>Tax relief in respect of the cost of qualified nurses are engaged on the advice of a medical practitioner to provide constant nursing care in the patient&rsquo;s home.  In cases of serious illness, where qualified nurses are engaged on the advice of a medical practitioner to provide constant nursing care in the patient&rsquo;s home, tax relief under the heading of health expenses may be allowed in respect of the costs incurred where the following conditions are satisfied:</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p10" />(i)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />a medical certificate is provided which&mdash;</P>
       <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p10- ?>(a)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />shows the nature of the patient&rsquo;s illness,</P>
        <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p10- ?>(b)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />states that constant nursing care by fully-qualified nurses in the patient&rsquo;s home is required, and</P>
      <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p10- ?>(c)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />covers the full period for which home nursing is being claimed;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p8" />(ii)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />the nurses providing the nursing care are fully qualified and their full names, addresses and qualifications have been supplied;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p6" />(iii)<Miles com="is0p4" /><Miles com="ix" />details of all payments to the nurses is provided.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Section 467 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a tax deduction at an individual&rsquo;s highest rate of tax in respect of the costs incurred by that individual of employing another person (including a person whose services are provided by or through an agency) to take care of himself or herself, a spouse or a relative who, throughout the relevant tax year, is totally incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity.  More detail is contained in Revenue&rsquo;s Explanatory Leaflet IT 47 (available on Revenue&rsquo;s website).  The amount of the tax deduction is &euro;50,000 for the tax years 2006 and 2007 and &euro;30,000 for previous tax years at the claimant&rsquo;s highest rate of <Col N="1989"/>tax or, if lower, the actual amount expended in the relevant tax year in employing the person at the claimant&rsquo;s highest rate of tax.  Where a person employs an individual, he or she will have certain legal obligations under tax law as an employer (e.g. the operation of the PAYE system).</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer in question filed a self-assessed CGT return in respect of the tax year 2005 and duly paid the resulting liability.  Specific information relating to the disposal was not supplied at the time.  Retirement Relief is available for CGT purposes on disposals of business assets/part of the business assets and full relief is available where the consideration does not exceed &euro;750,000 (&euro;500,000 in 2005) from gains accruing to an individual aged 55 years and over, on such disposals.  In the case of business assets, they must have been owned and used by the individual in the business throughout a ten-year period ending on the date of disposal.  The Revenue Commissioners do not hold any evidence that the person concerned carried out a farming business prior to the disposal of the site in 2005.  If the person considers himself eligible for the relief as outlined above he should contact Clare Revenue District, Kilrush Road, Ennis in this regard.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A list of out-of-pocket expenses payable to Oireachtas Members and Officeholders is set out below.  The rates supplied are the rates that applied in 2002 and there have been no increases in the rates to date.  Also set out below are the mileage rates payable to Oireachtas Members and Ministers of State for the years 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006.  There was no increase in the mileage rates in 2004.  Members of the Oireachtas are also entitled to other allowances; 1,750 prepaid envelopes per month, the cost of tele-messages up to an annual limit of &euro;952.30; free telephone calls from Leinster House, provision of &euro;750 every 18 months to support the purchase of mobile phones including a car kit and <Col N="1990"/>the recoupment of the cost of non-personal mobile telephone costs while Members are abroad on official business up to a maximum of &euro;25 per day.  Finally, it should be noted that while the Minister for Finance is the regulatory authority for these allowances the day-to-day administration and payment of the expense allowances are dealt with by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, and are not matters in which the Minister has a direct function.</P>
        <P>A general expense allowance is payable to Officeholders, TDs and Senators.  This allowance is designed to reimburse Oireachtas members for the additional expense of being an Officeholder, TD or Senator not already encompassed by the other allowances/expenses.  The current annual rates are: TDs, &euro;5,482.73; Senators, &euro;4,112.68; Taoiseach, &euro;14,595.64; T&aacute;naiste, Ministers and Ceann Comhairle, &euro;13,390.66; Ministers of State and Leas-Cheann Comhairle, &euro;12,170.44; Cathaoirleach, Leas-Chathaoirleach and Leader of the Seanad, &euro;9,128.15.</P>
        <P>The overnight allowance is available to TDs and Senators, in certain circumstances, who live more than 15 miles from Leinster House and who are not in receipt of the daily travel allowance.  The allowance is intended to provide a Member with accommodation where they propose to attend a meeting the next day or attend a meeting which terminates too late to allow the member to return home on the same day.  The current rate is &euro;139.67 per night.  A member who lives within 15 miles of Leinster House is entitled to claim a flat-rate daily travel allowance for each day on which the Member attends Leinster House.  The current rate is &euro;61.53 per day.  The constituency office allowance provides a one-off grant towards the cost of setting up a constituency office and an annual grant for the running cost of the office.  The current rates are &mdash; one-off grant, &euro;8,888.17; and Annual Grant, &euro;8,888.17 per annum.  The purpose of the Constituency Travel Allowance is to compensate D&aacute;il deputies for travel which they are obliged to undertake within their constituencies by virtue of their position as public representatives.  Three different rates of allowances are provided to reflect the different travel requirements of constituencies: Category A, &euro;2,745.17 per annum; Category B, &euro;5,489.08 per annum; and Category C, &euro;8,782.78 per annum.  The Constituency Office Telephone Allowance provides Members of the Oireachtas with an allowance toward the telephone costs incurred by virtue of their position as public representatives.  The Current Rate for TDs is &euro;6,348.69 per annum and for Senators is &euro;4,761.52 per annum.  New arrangements regarding the payment of the Special Secretarial Allowance were put in place by Statutory Instrument 84/2005.  Depending on which option the Member chooses under Statutory Instrument 84/2005, a Member may be entitled to retain the <Col N="1991"/>unvouched portion of the Special Secretarial Allowance.  The Current Rates are: TDs, <Col N="1992"/>&euro;8,888.17 per annum; and Senators, &euro;6,666.12 per annum.</P><Col N="1991"/>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States.  In the Irish context, these derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.  While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However, the European Commission, who are the deciding authority, have to date refused all such requests.  The Commission maintain that, in keeping with the EU Energy Tax Directive, Member States must apply at least the EU minimum rates of excise on fuels in such circumstances and that any further favourable excise treatment is not allowable.  In this regard, the Commission&rsquo;s decision was published on its website in March 2007.  At the Commission&rsquo;s behest my officials have indicated that Ireland will avail of the forthcoming Finance Bill to make the necessary legislative changes to conform with the Directive.  In the circumstances, the relevant line Departments who have primary responsibility in this regard are, in conjunction with my Department, exploring alternative non-tax support mechanisms that could be put in place where appropriate to maintain the assistance currently being provided, subject of course to compatibility with EU State Aid requirements.  In the interim the reduced rates applicable to fuel used will be maintained.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 473 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for relief from income tax for an individual who pays rent in respect of a tenancy of a residential premises which is his/her main residence.  The definition of &ldquo;tenancy&rdquo; in the tax legislation excludes tenancies in respect of which the person beneficially entitled to the rent is &ldquo;a housing authority for the purposes of the Housing Act 1966&rdquo;.  Therefore, tax relief cannot be claimed in respect of rent paid to a local authority.  With regard to extending the relief, it is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the Budget on any tax or expenditure matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.</P>

        <Quest> if in the circumstances of capital acquisition tax and stamp duty on inheritances where the case refers to the child of a deceased child, if the child in question has to be under 18 years of age to benefit from reliefs or if there is an age limit involved. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Stamp Duty is not chargeable on inheritances of property.  The Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) code includes group thresholds, below which no CAT is liable.  The indexed group thresholds applying to an inheritance by a grandchild for 2007 is &euro;49,682 (Group B).  However, in the case of a minor child of a deceased child (under 18 years on the date of the inheritance), a higher threshold of &euro;496,824 (Group A) applies.   Any other gifts or inheritances that might have been received within the same group by an individual since 5 December 1991 are also taken into account when applying the thresholds for the pur<Col N="1995"/>poses of calculating CAT.  If the total value of all inheritances and gifts received since this date is above the relevant threshold, then a 20% CAT will apply on the difference.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is referring to the re-introduction of Capital Gains Tax roll-over relief.  It was announced in the 2003 Budget that no roll-over relief would be allowed for any purpose on gains arising from disposals on or after 4 December 2002.  This relief was introduced when CGT rates were much higher than the current levels of 20%.  The abolition of this relief was in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low.</P>

	<P>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Under the VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services, which have been in place since 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to other goods and services.  It is therefore not possible under EU law to apply a zero VAT rate to the provision of road safety products.  In addition, Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive.  While Annex III does specifically list the supply of children&rsquo;s car seats, it does not include other road safety products.  The reduced rate cannot therefore be applied to such goods.  Therefore the only VAT rate that can apply to the supply of road safety equipment, under EU law, is the standard VAT rate which in Ireland is 21%.</P>

These works were carried out on foot of a Universal Access Audit of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in undertaken by OPW.  The Commissioners of Public Works have also implemented an Energy Conservation Programme in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in that included the installation of a Building Management System to optimise start/stop programmes and temperature controls resulting in lower energy costs.  A replacement programme of existing light sources within the building to reduce energy requirements has been completed.  Our Historic Properties Division has undertaken various surveys of habitat, wildlife, geology and soils.  Tractors in use at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in are now biofuel compatible.  Horticultural practices there are compatible with good environmental management.  A Sustainability Report has been completed and many of the suggested actions contained therein that are environmentally friendly will be implemented in 2008.</P>

	<P>As part of an Office of Public Works initiative, my Department will undertake an energy awareness campaign early in 2008 which will include raising awareness among staff of the need to conserve energy, identification of possible improvements in heating systems, and an energy audit. To facilitate the monitoring of the effectiveness of the campaign, monitoring software has been installed in Government Buildings.  In the interim, a survey is currently under way of the windows and exterior doorways of the Department&rsquo;s offices in Government Buildings to identify and put in place any necessary measures to reduce heat loss or energy wastage.  My Department&rsquo;s new building in Tullamore which opened in 2006 incorporated advanced environmental measures including an intelligent lighting system, heat exchange units, fan coil systems rather than air conditioning units, and a building management system which controls heat output dependent on the ambient temperature in the building.</P>

	<P>The draft National Energy Efficiency Action Plan sets out the measures that Government may take to achieve at least 20% energy savings across the economy by 2020. The public sector is expected to make a major contribution to achievement of that target, by reducing its energy demand by 33%.  As part of this commitment the Office of Public Works is pursuing a three-pronged strategy to reduce Carbon Dioxide emissions from buildings for which the OPW is responsible.</P><Col N="2000"/>
        <P>The OPW is embarking on a Heating Fuel Conversion Programme to convert the heating systems in approximately 20 large state buildings from their existing fossil fuel burners (oil/natural gas) to biomass burners.  The biomass fuel will be in the form of Wood Pellets.  It is estimated that this will result in an equivalent reduction of half a million litres of oil being consumed per annum.  The tender process is under way and the programme is due for completion in September 2008.  The use of biomass in new buildings is also considered in the design process and where appropriate, is being used as the energy source.</P>
        <P>The OPW has invited tenders for the provision of services for an energy awareness campaign for staff in Civil Service offices for which the OPW has a maintenance responsibility.  Following assessment of the tenders it is intended to start the campaign early in 2008.  It is planned to run the programme for two years by which time it is expected that good practices will be established in the buildings, which it is hoped will lead to ongoing savings in the energy costs.  The target is to reduce carbon emissions in each building by 15% through these local energy conservation campaigns, energy workshops and close monitoring of the performance of heating and air conditioning systems, when measured against the data collected by the OPW&rsquo;s web-based energy monitoring system over the past three years.  The staff concerned will be able to monitor the energy reductions in their building via an Internet site.</P>
        <P>In respect of the Energy Efficient Design of New Buildings, the OPW has a policy of designing naturally ventilated buildings whenever possible.  Properly designed naturally ventilated buildings can use up to 66% less energy than equivalent fully air-conditioned types.  The use of computer modelling also facilitates the proper design of naturally ventilated buildings by accurately predicting airflows, internal temperatures and internal comfort conditions.  This technology is being used by the OPW to optimise energy performance in all new large building projects including the Decentralisation programme.</P>

	<P>The tables that follows this reply list the pay rates in place in 2000 and all subsequent pay increases &mdash; those arising from national wage agreements, recommendations of <Col N="2001"/>the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector and recommendations of the Benchmarking Body &mdash; for the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, Ministers and Ministers of State.  Report No. 40 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector recommended an interim increase of 7.5% for the posts and grades within the ambit of its terms of reference.  The Government decided to implement the increase on a phased basis, one half from 1 July 2005 and the balance from 1 January 2006.  Report No. 38 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector recommended that the salary of a TD should be set at the ordinary maximum of the grade of Principal <Col N="2002"/>(standard) in the civil service and should be revised for the future on that basis.  Following implementation of this recommendation the salary of TDs in no longer examined by the Review Body.  The salaries of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, Minister and Minister of State are made up of two elements: the office holder&rsquo;s salary plus the Deputy&rsquo;s basic salary.  While the Deputy&rsquo;s element of the salary is determined in the manner set out above the office holder&rsquo;s element is examined from time to time by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration.  The office holder&rsquo;s salary does not attract increases recommended by the Public Service Benchmarking Body.</P><Col N="2001"/>

	<P>The Office of Public Works is awaiting the final report into the collapse of a staircase in the Museum of Natural History.  This report will inform the scope of works to be undertaken.  The Government has allocated &euro;15 million in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 for the refurbishment of the Natural History Museum.  This is a complex conservation project in a protected structure and will involve a major refurbishment of the building and the provision of access for disabled persons.  In parallel to the refurbishment of the building, the museum will undertake a detailed programme of conservation and restoration works to the exhibits and artifacts in the Museum.  It is the view of the <Col N="2008"/>National Museum, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Office of Public Works, that the most practical and effective approach is that the Museum remain closed until the refurbishment and conservation works are complete.  It is estimated that the refurbishment and conservation process will take 24 months.</P>

	<P>I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that I have not increased the rates of excise on petrol and diesel in the last three Budgets. In the Finance Bill 2005, I marginally increased the rates for auto-LPG, non-auto-LPG and fuel oil to comply with the minimum rates provided for in the EU Energy Tax Directive.  In Budget 2006, I reduced the excise rates for kerosene, the primary fuel used for home heating as well as LPG also used for home heating by 50%.  In Budget 2007, I further reduced both these fuels for home heating purposes to a zero rate.  The increase in revenue is therefore primarily a reflection of the increase in demand for petrol and diesel.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the increase in revenue from mineral oil tax for the requested period is as follows:</P><Col N="2007"/>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, tax <Col N="2008"/>relief is available for donations to certain sports bodies for the funding of capital projects.  To be eligible for the relief the sports body must be an Approved Sports Body and the donation must be for the purposes of an Approved Project.  To be regarded as an Approved Sports Body, a sports body must obtain from the Revenue Commissioners both a valid tax clearance certificate and a statement that, in accordance with section 235 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the body is exempt from tax because it is established solely for the purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports and its income is applied solely for that purpose.  Approved Projects are capital <Col N="2009"/>projects approved by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  The types of projects which are eligible to be approved are the purchase, construction or refurbishment of a building to be used for sporting or recreational activities; the purchase of land for such activities; the purchase of permanently based sports equipment (excluding personal equipment); and the improvement of pitches and playing surfaces.  The estimated aggregate cost of the project must not exceed &euro;40 million.  The minimum qualifying donation for relief purposes for an approved project is &euro;250 per annum and there is no upper limit on the amount which can be donated.  The relief on the donation will be at an individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax.  As regards the case for extending the relief, it is the longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the Budget on any tax or expenditure matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.</P>

	<P>The legislation governing the Mid-Shannon Tourism Infrastructure Investment scheme provides for the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, to issue guidelines for the scheme.  The development of these guidelines has been the subject of ongoing consultations between the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism and my Department.  The guidelines are now at an advanced stage and will be completed very shortly.  When the guidelines are finalised the scheme will be notified to the European Commission for approval.  The establishment of the Mid-Shannon Tourism Infrastructure Board, which will approve applications and certify projects under the Scheme, is a matter for the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism.  It is understood that the Board will be established in advance of the commencement of the Scheme.</P>

	<P>During construction works on the Kilkenny Flood Relief Scheme some inter<Col N="2010"/>ference was caused to properties at John&rsquo;s Quay.  Property owners who had contacted the Office of Public Works in relation to reputed damage were advised by the Commissioners to forward details of any losses/damage that may have been occasioned by the drainage works as the OPW wanted to either put in place remedial measures against such losses/damage or to provide funds to the property owners to cover the cost of mutually agreed remedial works.  On a strict application of the compensation rules, it is unlikely that OPW would be liable to make any compensation payments in respect of damage to properties at John&rsquo;s Quay resulting from the drainage works. This is because the benefits gained by property owners, whose properties are now protected from flooding and therefore much more valuable as a result of the scheme, are significantly greater than any damage caused and the Arterial Drainage Legislation provides for offsetting benefit against damage.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, that while they are engaged in a wide ranging consultation process with stakeholders, with the objective of expanding use of the Revenue On-line service for the filing of Tax Returns and payments, they have no plans to make this compulsory for all taxpayers.  Last September the Revenue Commissioners announced they were beginning a detailed and wide-ranging consultation process with tax practitioners, industry representative bodies, software providers and customers with a view to introducing a requirement that tax returns and payments for specific categories of taxpayers would be made electronically through the on-line service.  In its press release the Revenue Commissioners explicitly stated that they accept that mandatory electronic filing and payment would be inappropriate for the smallest businesses.  At the outset the Revenue Commissioners stated that, although the service has achieved significant return filing and payment rates, a considerable number of fully computerised businesses remain outside it.  The current consultations are focused on businesses which have the capacity to carry out their interactions with the Revenue Commissioners electronically, but do not do so.  The Revenue Commissioners also stated in their press release that they accept that the smallest businesses will not be required to use electronic filing and payment.  Indeed, one of the benefits of mov<Col N="2011"/>ing the larger firms to mandatory electronic filing and payment was that it allows Revenue to devise a simplified paper return for such small businesses to make their tax compliance easier.  The consultation process around mandatory filing is not about the age of the businessperson but about the economic size and complexity of the business and its capacity to submit returns and payments to Revenue electronically.  The vast majority of larger businesses use professional tax agents who have access to the on-line system to file their tax returns.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the anti avoidance rules of Section 499(2) has the effect of extending to seven years the redemption date under BES if the investor makes an investment in two consecutive years; and his views on whether this represents an undesirable restriction on the use of BES. </Quest>
        <QRef>[32577/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that, in general, an investor may dispose of BES shares after the specified five-year holding period without impacting on the relief previously granted in respect of those shares. Where shares are disposed of before that time, relief may be reduced or withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Where, however, as mentioned in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, an investor has invested for two consecutive years in the same BES company, redemption by the company of the first holding of BES shares would have consequences for the relief available on the second holding.  Where the consecutive investments are not in the same company or a connected company, there are no such consequences.</P><Col N="2012"/>
        <P>Section 499 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 operates to discourage an individual from withdrawing capital in any form (including a redemption of shares) from the company in the period beginning two years before and ending five years after the making of the investment. Consequently, where a company redeems an individual&rsquo;s BES share capital and that individual makes a second investment in the same company within two years, the BES relief on that second investment will be reduced by the amount of the capital withdrawn. This is to prevent an individual from withdrawing his/her capital after five years and immediately reinvesting the same amount, thereby availing of a second tranche of relief without any consequent increase in the company&rsquo;s capital.</P>
        <P>If the company does not redeem the individual&rsquo;s shares but instead he/she disposes of the shares to an unconnected third party and the share capital of the said BES company is not, as a consequence, reduced, the provisions of section 499 would not apply. A second immediate investment by the same individual would thus qualify for relief.</P>
        <P>I believe that Section 499 is generally working as intended. The BES rules seek to strike a balance between the needs of business and the targeting of relief where it is most needed.  The purpose of the BES is to attract long-term risk capital into certain small to medium-sized enterprises that would otherwise find it difficult to attract investments.  Additionally, the scheme is designed to provide that relief is given only in respect of additional money coming into the company.</P>

	<P>Adoption in Ireland is regulated by the Adoption Board, which is an independent, statutory body. On foot of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, a report was sought from the Adoption Board on this matter, and the information supplied is as follows.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;The Adoption Board, as a quasi-judicial body, is not generally in a position to comment on individual cases currently before the Board for consideration and adjudication. The Board can, however, confirm that it is carrying out an examination of the adoption laws of Ethiopia to determine, inter alia, if they meet the legal requirements set out in the 1991 Adoption Act for the recognition of adoptions from abroad. This examination has raised certain legal issues related to the compatibility of Ethiopian adoption law with Irish law. In the circumstances, and in order to protect the adoption process, the Board has decided as a precautionary measure, to suspend the granting of Declarations of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt abroad in respect of Ethiopia until the above investigations are complete. The Board has continued to accept applications for an <Col N="2016"/>entry in the Register of Foreign Adoptions, but a final decision on these applications cannot be taken until the Board&rsquo;s review is completed. The Board issued a Circular in this regard in October 2007, and is dealing with this issue as a matter of priority. The Adoption Board can also confirm that the Ethiopian authorities advised the Irish Embassy in Ethiopia on 21st November, 2007, that Ethiopia has stopped the processing of Irish adoption applications pending the outcome of the Adoption Board&rsquo;s review.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I have requested the Adoption Board to keep me updated on the progress of the review, and I am satisfied that the Board&rsquo;s decision is an appropriate one in the circumstances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 to 217, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I introduced the GP visit card in November 2005 as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children who do not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  Details of the numbers of GP visit card holders are provided each month to my Department by the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s (HSE), Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS).  The figures are provided on a net basis showing the balance after new cards have been issued and other cards, as appropriate, have been deleted from the Executive&rsquo;s database, e.g. following a review of an applicant&rsquo;s circumstances.  The most recent figures provided to my Department show 74,671 GP visit card holders as at 1st November, 2007.  I am satisfied that this outcome in terms of numbers issued to-date justifies the introduction of this benefit.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005, substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.  The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs.  In June 2006, I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards.  These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards (previously 25%).</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government commits to the following:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Indexing the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage;</P><Col N="2018"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Doubling of the income limit eligibility of parents of children under 6 years of age, and trebling them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Allowing people with disabilities to work without losing key essential medical card cover after 3 years;</P>
<P el="5" FLI="0">Implementation of an annual publicity campaign and making applications easier so as to increase uptake amongst those who are eligible for Medical Cards and GP Visit Cards.</P>
  
        <P>My Department is at present considering the most appropriate approach to the implementation of these commitments.</P>

	<P>Forms falling within the core remit of my Department are available on line, but cannot at present be completed on line. However, the number of such forms is quite small.  The General Register Office (GRO), which is the central civil repository for records relating to Births, Deaths and Marriages in the State, administers a significant number and volume of forms, and I understand that these cannot be completed on-line at present. The GRO is scheduled to transfer to the Department of Social and Family Affairs with effect from 1st January next.</P>
        <P>I have asked that the situation regarding on-line completion of the forms remaining in my Department&rsquo;s area after January next should be reviewed in line with our commitment to provide the best possible level of service to our customers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 to 225, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>
        <P>Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</P>
        <P>With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced <Col N="2020"/>from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated &euro;153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P>
        <P>In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a weekly subvention in respect of their child.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.</P>
        <P>It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged <Col N="2021"/>parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 is being used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data received this month.  Where appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>
        <P>The question as to how services can plan over three years, when their parental profile may change over that period misses the point that, in the case of each childcare place, the cost of that place will be met by the fee charged to the parent, less the relevant subvention, making the profile of parents, revenue neutral under the new scheme.  This represents an improvement on the previous scheme, where there were tiered fees, but no variance in grant aid to compensate services for such changes.</P>
        <P>A number of stakeholders were consulted in the Value for Money Review of the EOCP, including community providers, private providers (who are outside the remit of both schemes and who have often claimed displacement of their services occurred under the EOCP), parents, and Government Departments, including my Office and the Department of Finance.  It was the report of this Review which recommended that, in the period 2007-2010, the current scheme be replaced by a more transparent system based on direct targeting of groups, notably socially disadvantaged groups.  My Office has, since the scheme was announced, used the 12-month lead-in time to consult widely with the community and childcare sectors on the best way to improve the implementation of this framework, and that is ongoing.</P><Col N="2022"/>
        <P>Given the level of grant aid is increasing, and given middle and higher income parents in these services will now be paying the cost price of childcare, I would hope that services will be in a position to honour any contracts they have entered into. As the Deputy will be aware, this should be lower than in the private sector, due to capital grant aid and the not for profit nature of the service.</P>
        <P>Under the scheme, the Parent Declaration can be signed by a guardian who is responsible for the care of that child, and I can assure the Deputy that homework clubs are catered for under the new scheme.  Where a place is for less than 2 hours 15 minutes, this is counted as a &ldquo;half session&rdquo; for grant purposes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The scheme does not impact on the eligibility of parents to receive F&Aacute;S or VEC childcare allowances, however such parents attract a reduced &ldquo;B and B&rdquo; subvention under the scheme.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware the new reimbursement pricing arrangements for drugs and medicines under the GMS and community drugs schemes were announced by the HSE on 17th September 2007.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>I have previously outlined in detail to the Oireachtas the legal provisions under competition law which prevent the Health Service Executive (HSE) from negotiating with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU) on fees, prices or margins for their members. When it became clear that the HSE could not negotiate with pharmacists or wholesalers on fees or margins, a detailed, fair and transparent consultation process, including independent economic analysis and public consultation, was carried out to inform the final determination of the new reimbursement pricing arrangements for drugs and medicines under the GMS and community drugs schemes. 161 submissions were received by the HSE, of which 143 were from community pharmacy contractors.</P>
        <P>The new price arrangements for community supply were planned to take effect from 1st January for wholesalers and, due to the structure of the reimbursement system, would have come into effect from 1st December 2007 for community pharmacists. The independent economic analysis was carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants and was published by the HSE on 13 November 2007. All aspects of the Indecon analysis were considered by the HSE in making its determination. Full consideration was also taken of public submissions received.</P>
        <P>All the evidence available to the HSE-led team dealing with this issue indicated that the State was paying a premium for this service and that the new arrangements will save the HSE about &euro;100m in 2008. The evidence available also indicates that the impact on individual pharmacies will not be detrimental, having regard to the totality of fees and mark-ups under the GMS and community drugs schemes. That evidence, when considered in conjunction with the detailed analysis in the Indecon independent economic report, all points to the poor value for money being obtained by the State under the existing arrangements.</P>
        <P>In regard to the reimbursement prices for drugs and medicines under the GMS and community drugs schemes, the main wholesaler companies have confirmed to the HSE that they will comply with the new arrangements by charging pharmacists the new reimbursement price that the HSE will pay pharmacists. I would also point out that arrangements between wholesalers and community pharmacists are a private matter. As the HSE will be paying the market value for distribution services, the Executive feels that there is no justification for wholesalers to reduce service levels to pharmacists, nor for patients not to continue to obtain the same level of service from their community pharmacist as before. The HSE has received no formal notification from any <Col N="2026"/>community pharmacist regarding cessation of services under the GMS and community drugs schemes. Any such cessation of services would require three months notice.</P>
        <P>In order to address concerns by community pharmacists regarding the implications of the legal advice on competition law, a process of dialogue was established under Mr Bill Shipsey, S.C., to examine available options for advancing pharmacy contractual negotiations in compliance with Irish and EU competition law. The HSE and the IPU recently met under the auspices of Mr Shipsey. I am also exploring, in consultation with the Attorney General, relevant Government Departments and the Health Service Executive, the best way of progressing the development of a new contract with pharmacists. In view of the ongoing positive engagement between the HSE and the IPU, under the auspices of Mr Shipsey, the HSE has decided to defer the implementation of the new reimbursement rates, planned to take effect for community pharmacists on 1st December 2007, to a later date.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.  The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their child care costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment, which is in recognition of the higher child care costs of preschool children, is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone amounts to expenditure of over &euro;400m in a full year.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of child care they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government child care policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.</P>
        <P>Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit child care providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</P>
        <P>With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community child care services to provide affordable child care to <Col N="2029"/>disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated &euro;153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community child care services to provide reduced child care fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P>
        <P>In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a weekly subvention in respect of their child.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Where places are half-day (between 3 hours 30 minutes and 5 hours) or sessional (between 2 hours 15 minutes and 3 hours 29 minutes), the subvention is paid on a pro-rata basis.  Where a place is of less than 2 hours 15 minutes, this shall be calculated as half a sessional place.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their child care service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.</P>
        <P>It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community child care services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under <Col N="2030"/>the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing child care services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 is being used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data received this month.  Where appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for child care services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Group in question has applied for transitional funding under the NCIP Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS).  A letter from the Childcare Directorate of my Office will issue this week to the Group, informing them that subject to the return of a completed fees worksheet, their application will be approved for transitional funding.  This funding will, for the first six months of 2008, be based on the level of funding currently being provided to the Group under the EOCP staffing support grant scheme and subject to the necessary contractual arrangement with Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the EOCP and NCIP.</P>

	<P>The vast majority of patients in this country receive effective and safe treatment from the health services.  However, international studies show that a minority of patients can be harmed through their care either in hospital or in the community.  A very large number of people are treated in the health services each year in our country.  There are over 1.1 million emergency presentations, a further 1.1 million in-patient discharges (including day cases) and in excess of 2.8 million out-patient attendances.  Based on international trends, there will be a certain level of adverse incidents ranging in severity, including potential misdiagnoses.  Clearly it is not possible to itemise every analysis, investigation or review of each potential or actual misdiagnosis, or adverse incident, more generally.</P>
        <P>Patient safety is an issue that requires clear leadership at all levels in the system.  We must be satisfied that there is continuous improvement in the quality of the service being delivered.  We must achieve a sustained reduction in adverse events together with appropriate follow-up support and care for all those involved when an incident does occur and that the system must have the confidence of patients, health care providers and the public.</P>
        <P>I have asked the HSE to ensure that the reporting arrangements to my Department are clear and comprehensive regarding significant adverse events.  I am also awaiting a report from the HSE Board relating to recent events which will inform this process.</P>
<P>I also established this year a special Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance which is scheduled to report to me by July 2008.  The overall objective of the Commission is to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure that quality and safety of care for patients is paramount within the health care system.

The HSNPF was established in 1999 on foot of the provisions of Partnership 2000, the national agreement on social partnership then in place.  It has continued to promote a partnership approach to change and problem solving in the health services under the subsequent national partnership agreements, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, Sustaining Progress and the current agreement, Towards 2016. The HSNPF assists health agencies in the deepening of workplace partnership to achieve the highest quality service, care and working arrangements, by continuous improvement involving management, staff and trade unions working together. </P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) is conducting a fundamental review of how transport services are provided which will take into account the recent decisions made in relation to the designation of managed cancer control networks and cancer centres under the National Cancer Control Programme.  The HSE is also putting in place a structured programme of quality assurance, support and information services to underpin the re-organisation of cancer services to ensure that cancer patients will receive quality services as close to home as possible.</P>
        <P>The specific question raised by the Deputy regarding transport for cancer patients relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the matter raised.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest> the reason persons (details supplied) in County Longford have lost their general practitioner visit card; and the reason, in view of the severity of their condition, they have not been granted a medical card. </Quest>
        <QRef>[32238/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In <Col N="2037"/>2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The most recent data published by this Department is the 2005 Long Stay Activity Statistics which records that there were 2,298 limited stay beds in 2005 available in Long-Stay Units.  The survey indicates 471 of these were rehabilitation beds (326 public, 108 voluntary and 37 private).  This data should be interpreted in the context of the survey response rate of 80% for 2005.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Health Service Executive is currently reviewing how rehabilitation beds are defined and accounted for.  I further understand that the HSE wrote to the Deputy on 16th October to explain that it is working towards standard definitions for information collation and reporting and that the Executive would forward the information requested by the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.  As this is a matter for the HSE I have asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>In January 2007 the Minister for Health and Children published a new set of draft national standards which will apply to all nursing homes. The standards were developed by a working group chaired by DoHC and included the Health Service Executive, Social Service Inspectorate and the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board.     </P>
        <P>As the Health Act, 2007 provides that the enhanced inspection function will be taken over by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), the draft standards were formally referred to HIQA for consultation and finalisation.  The Authority established a wide-ranging Working Group to finalise the draft standards.   The terms of reference of the Group were to:</P><Col N="2041"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />review and develop the draft standards;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />establish a process for targeted and public consultation;</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />consider feedback from the public consultation process;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />finalise the draft standards for publication and inspection.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">HIQA published draft standards on 8 August, 2007 for public consultation.  Members of the public, service users, their families, service providers and all those with an interest in residential care for older people were invited to submit their views on the draft.  The results of the public consultation were discussed at the most recent meetings of the HIQA Working Group.  It is proposed to hold one further meeting of the Working Group to finalise the standards.  The next step will be to refer the standards to the Minister, following which Regulations will be drafted to give statutory underpinning to the Standards.</P>

	<P>Teenspace, the National Recreation Policy was launched last September. Funding provided in the OMC Vote in 2007 for recreation related to printing, launch and dissemination of the policy which has been taking place since September. My Office has contacted the relevant agencies and departments, advising them of the actions appropriate to them and seeking their inclusion in statements of strategy, business plans, and spending plans for 2008.</P>
        <P>There are already a number of youth caf&eacute;s in operation around the country funded in different ways. At this stage, my focus is to bring better coherence to the approach taken to date, retaining the strong inter-agency element and identify an appropriate model(s) for youth caf&eacute;s for future developments. Since September my office has undertaken a small survey of some of the existing caf&eacute;s looking at mission/objectives, management and organisation, service levels and the role of young people. I have recently requested the National Children&rsquo;s Advisory Council&rsquo;s advice on the development of a youth caf&eacute; model and contracts to undertake this work will be signed shortly.  This work will ensure that funding is targeted and co-ordinated most effectively on a model or models of youth caf&eacute;s which meet the needs identified by young people themselves. Discussions are underway with my Cabinet colleagues regarding a youth caf&eacute; programme and appropriate funding mechanisms. I am considering which agency could best lead on the programme and how to ensure any funding which might be made available augments, without displacing, the existing inter-agency resources.</P>

	<P>Availability of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) is not governed by legislation. The Report of the Task Force on Sudden Cardiac Death, published in March 2006, makes recommendations on the prevention of sudden cardiac death and on the detection of those at high risk.  </P><Col N="2043"/>
        <P>The Task Force supports the establishment of first responder programmes and recommends that priority should be given to programmes, geographical locations and facilities identified as having the greatest need.  All programmes should be coordinated by the HSE ambulance services, with best practice guidance from the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council.  The Task Force also recommends that Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) should be placed in facilities where the incidence of cardiac arrest is high, including in-patient health facilities; G.P. surgeries and primary care facilities; airports, shopping centres, major sports venues and golf courses, bus/rail terminals, ferries/ferry terminals, concert and conference venues; universities and colleges; gyms and fitness clubs, and other venues for major public events.</P>
        <P>The HSE Ambulance Service will be developing an AED register via the National Pre-Hospital First Responder Coordinator in the first half of 2008. The HSE will be establishing the numbers of AEDs currently available in both public and private premises. This will be completed during the first half of 2008. With the appointment of the first responder coordinators and pre-hospital resuscitation training officers in 2008, the HSE will be promoting programmes in priority areas which will increase the availability of AEDs for use by trained members of the public.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>
        <P>Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</P>
        <P>With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated &euro;153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in <Col N="2049"/>the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P>
        <P>In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a weekly subvention in respect of their child.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.  The group in question received &euro;430,838 in capital grant assistance under the EOCP.</P>
        <P>It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments neces<Col N="2050"/>sary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 is being used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data received this month.  Where appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Group in question has been approved for transitional funding under the NCIP Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS), and a letter of approval issued from the Childcare Directorate of my Office.  This funding will, for the first six months of 2008, be based on the level of funding currently being provided to the Group under the EOCP staffing support grant scheme and subject to the necessary contractual arrangement with Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the EOCP and NCIP.</P>

	<P>The Primary Care Strategy aims to increase health service capacity through the development of services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.  It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.</P>
        <P>The provision of the appropriate infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of primary care services is being considered by the HSE, having regard to a number of factors.  These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 275 to 279, inclusive, and 282, 283 and 285 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</P><Col N="2054"/>
        <P>The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment, which is in recognition of the higher childcare costs of pre-school children, is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone amounts to expenditure of over &euro;400m in a full year.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.</P>
        <P>Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</P>
        <P>With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated &euro;153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P><Col N="2055"/>
        <P>In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a weekly subvention in respect of their child.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.</P>
        <P>It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the <Col N="2056"/>transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 is being used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data received this month.  Where appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that six of the Groups in question have been approved for transitional funding under the NCIP Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS), and letters of approval have issued from the Childcare Directorate of my Office.  This funding will, for the first six months of 2008, be based on the level of funding currently being provided to the Groups under the EOCP staffing support grant scheme and subject to the necessary contractual arrangement with Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the EOCP and NCIP.  The other two Groups have applied to enter the new scheme and letters will issue from the Childcare Directorate of my Office this week requesting them to forward outstanding information.</P>

The Groups however may apply under new CCSS, which is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated &euro;153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</P>
        <P>In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a weekly subvention in respect of their child.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.</P>
        <P>It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone. <Col N="2061"/> Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</P>

        <P>Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 is being used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data received this month.  Where appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</P>

	<P>Under the new scheme, people who require long-term residential care will contribute up to 80% of their assessable income per week, whether for public or private nursing home care.  Depending on the amount of a person&rsquo;s assessable income, there will also be a contribution of up to 5% of a person&rsquo;s assets.  The portion of the contribution relating to assets, such as a person&rsquo;s house, may be deferred.  This means that it does not have to be met during the person&rsquo;s lifetime and can be payable on settlement of the person&rsquo;s estate instead.  The deferred contribution will be based on the actual number of weeks spent in residential care and on the cost of care and, consequently, may be less than 5% per annum.   Where the spouse or certain dependants are living in the principal residence, the contribution may be further deferred until after the death of that spouse or dependant. </P>
        <P>In addition, where the deferred contribution applies to the principal residence, it will be capped at a maximum of 15%, or 7.5% in the <Col N="2064"/>case of one spouse remaining in the home while the other enters long-term residential care.</P>
        <P>It is important to emphasise that no one will ever pay more than the cost of their care.  In the case of a married couple, each person will be assessed on the basis of half their combined assessable income and assets.  However, we will ensure that a spouse who remains in the family home retains a sufficient income to live on.  At the very least, such a person will never be left with less than the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements have been made in several regions to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of any arrangements for community chiropody services and the level of service provided were a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  I understand that priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE. </P>
        <P>I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.   My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service.  While considerable work has taken place to develop arrangements which would ensure that no top-up charges are applied, it is necessary to ensure that any such arrangements and the process by which they are arrived at comply with the terms of the Competition Act 2002.  In this context consideration is being given at present to the most appropriate way in which to put in place contractual arrangements for the provision of services by self-employed health professionals.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services. <Col N="2065"/> The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme element of Transport 21.  The implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Act, 1993 in conjunction with the relevant local authorities. </P><Col N="2072"/>
        <P>Both Transport 21 and the National Development Plan committed the NRA to carrying out a feasibility study on the Orbital Route. Earlier this year, the NRA completed an updated feasibility study which built on a 2001 study which considered, in particular, the costs and benefits of such a route.  The updated NRA study finds that there is merit in constructing an Orbital Route linking Drogheda, Navan and Naas.</P>
        <P>As part of the study, various possible route corridors were examined in detail.  A corridor linking Drogheda to Navan to Naas was identified as the optimum route having regard to the policy objectives set out in the various policy documents on the route.  The study is under detailed consideration within my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The securing and maintaining of routes is a matter for the relevant Airport Authority.  Since the announcement by Aer Lingus of its decision to withdraw from the Shannon Heathrow route the Shannon Airport Authority has been actively engaging with airlines with a view to securing new services that would redress the reduction in connectivity that will follow from withdrawal of the Aer Lingus service.  With a view to promoting the development of new services the airport has published a European Hub Airport Incentive Scheme for services to come into operation in 2008. </P>
        <P>The Airport Authority has specifically identified airline services to the key European Hub airports of London-Heathrow (LHR), Paris <Col N="2073"/>(CDG), Amsterdam (AMS) and Frankfurt Main (FRA) as being of key strategic importance to its ongoing development.  The Scheme also provides for significant discounts in airport charges and for the possibility of marketing support to be provided by Shannon Airport for new services.</P>
        <P>Separately, I have also asked my Department to consult with the EU Commission on the options for facilitating the provision of air services to meet the connectivity requirements of the west of Ireland in a liberalised, competitive aviation market.</P>

	<P>My Department disposes of redundant information technology by donating it to charitable organisations or in some cases by offering it to staff as part of a wider policy to facilitate increased ICT skills within the Department.  Where neither of these is appropriate, an external company is engaged to dispose of the equipment in an environmentally acceptable manner. </P>
        <P>In all cases, the information stored on the equipment is erased to the DOD 5220.22M standard which was established by the US Department of Defence (DoD) in 1995 and is, I am informed, today, one of the most widely accepted methods of expunging data from magnetic media.</P>

        <Quest> the proportion of buses in the Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann fleets that run on alternative fuels or on hybrid engines; his plans to ensure that buses commissioned in the future rely on such technologies; the improvements that have been made in the fuel efficiency of the Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann fleets through replacement of older vehicles; and the future plans that exist in this area. </Quest>

	<P>I am working to achieve emissions reductions in the public transport fleet. I have requested CIE to move to using a 5% biodiesel blend in current CIE vehicles and to plan for a 30% blend in new vehicles. My Department is working with CIE to establish how these targets can be achieved in the shortest time frame possible. </P>
        <P>Dublin Bus will be leasing, with financial support from my Department, a prototype hybrid electric double-decker bus in 2008 on a trial basis. It is estimated that this vehicle can achieve 34% less fuel consumption than a standard bus.  Dublin Bus will consider the further acquisition of hybrid electric vehicles as part of future fleet replacement.</P>
        <P>Both Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus have been undertaking trials on the use of biofuels.  Bus &Eacute;ireann announced in April 2006 its decision to pilot the use of biodiesel produced from recovered vegetable oil (RVO) in part of its Cork City tours fleet. In May 2006 Dublin Bus announced that it would use bio-diesel made from RVO on a trial basis in five open-top tour buses, which have been operating without any technical difficulties.</P>
        <P>The completion of projects identified in Transport 21 will, for example, see public transport <Col N="2076"/>capacity in the Greater Dublin Area almost double by 2016. Modelling of the impacts of Transport 21 in the Greater Dublin Area shows a reduction of almost 20% in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions during rush hour in 2016, compared to a situation without Transport 21 in place, with the complementary implementation of demand side management (DSM) measures.  Transport 21 also provides funding for fleet replacement. All 239 Transport 21 coaches/buses currently on order, or about to be ordered, will have Euro IV engines; 160 in the first phase of Transport 21 and 79 in the second phase. Bus &Eacute;ireann will also purchase 60 coaches with Euro IV engines which have lower emissions.</P>
        <P>I have also announced the preparation of a Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan, which will set out a broad suite of policies and measures to help the transport sector progress along a more sustainable trajectory and make a further contribution to reducing emissions to 2020.</P>

	<P>European Council Regulation (EEC) No 684/92 as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 11/98 provides for the granting of International Authorisations enabling bus operators to provide regular international road passenger services between EU member states. </P><Col N="2077"/>
        <P>Polonia Transport applied to the Polish Authorities for two International Authorisations to provide regular international road passenger transport services from Bialystox and Rzeszow to Dublin.  The Polish Authorities in accordance with Article 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 684/92, as amended, forwarded the applications to all Member States in whose territories the service passes through, regardless on whether passengers are picked up or set down, for their approval.</P>
        <P>My Department considered the applications received from the Polish Authorities in accordance with the relevant Regulations and informed them that we had no objections to the granting of the Authorisations to Polonia Transport to provide regular services between Poland and Ireland. However it was indicated to the Polish Authorities that the company would be required to seek bus stop approval from the Garda for any bus stop they proposed to use before they could begin operating the service.  My Department understands that an agreement was reached between Polonia and the Garda in this regard.</P>
        <P>My Department has been advised that the Polish Authorities granted two Authorisations as applied for by Polonia Transport.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 313 and 329 together. </P>
        <P>I welcome this report to the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body and commend the members of Committee D for focusing on the Irish Community in Britain. Most of the recommendations in the report are addressed to the British Government, but of course the Government views them with great interest.</P>
        <P>The Chairman, Lord Alf Dubs, and the other members of Committee D have been widely congratulated on their report on the Irish Community in Britain.  The report&rsquo;s conclusions include that some among the elderly Irish Community in Britain remain vulnerable and more <Col N="2078"/>susceptible to a number of problems, including drug and alcohol abuse, heart disease, isolation, mental health issues and even suicide.  While the Committee&rsquo;s findings did not reveal any particularly new data, their report supports the view that the British government has a duty of care to the Irish community, and reflects the almost unanimous agreement by the British members of the Committee that the Irish community in Britain should be given more support by the British government and local authorities.  Reaching out to and strengthening links with the Irish community in Britain and with those of Irish ancestry has been, and continues to be, a cornerstone of Government policy. The establishment and operation of the Irish Abroad Unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs has greatly enhanced our capacity to develop and implement our policies in this regard.</P>
        <P>Britain is home to the largest and most significant population of Irish born people outside of our own island.  They remain the recipients of the vast majority of the funding which the Government provides to assist our communities overseas.  Total funding in Britain this year will exceed &euro;11.5 million.  This represents an increase of more than &euro;1 million over the funds made available in 2006. Approximately &euro;50 million has been provided since the Government commenced funding Irish community organisations in 1984.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The primary emphasis of Government funding in Britain continues to be directed at supporting frontline welfare services. I am pleased, however, that the additional funding available in recent years has made it possible for me to broaden the range of projects and extend the reach of our activities in Britain.  The support for front line agencies in their social outreach programmes helps them to assist our most vulnerable fellow countrymen and women, including the elderly members of the community susceptible to health and social problems. In this regard, the report states that &ldquo;the Committee were pleased to learn that the number of Irish people in Britain who are homeless is falling&rdquo; and stated that &ldquo;this must be, at least in part, due to the work of the Irish Community groups who are funded by the Irish Government&rdquo;.  This also reflects the findings of the Simon Community who attributed the decrease in Irish homelessness in London to Government funding.  They said &ldquo;the number of Irish people on central London streets is at a record low.  We do an independent head-count twice a year and in 1999 over 600 Irish were on the streets of central London now there are only about 100, and most of them are young&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report also recommends that attention be paid to maintaining and encouraging closer links with second and third generation members of the Irish Community in Britain.  The expansion this year of the Government&rsquo;s funding of Irish heritage, through the provision of grants to the <Col N="2079"/>British Provincial Council of the GAA and to Comhaltas Ceoltoir&iacute; Eireann, is aimed at addressing that very point.  I hope that this funding will assist future generations of Irish in Britain, the children and grandchildren of emigrants, to maintain strong links with their Irish identity through our culture, heritage, music and sport.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 315, 317 and 318 together. </P><Col N="2080"/>
        <P>My Department has a number of public offices and telephone services available to the public.  The Passport offices operating in Dublin and Cork have public opening hours from 9.30 until 4.30, Monday through Friday.  There is also an &lsquo;out-of-hours&rsquo; emergency service which operates in the evenings and at weekends.  The telephone lines responding to regular Passport queries operate from 9.00 until 5.00, after which phone calls are re-directed to information about the emergency services provided.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides a Consular Services office for document authentication, certificates to marry abroad, applications for citizenship through Foreign Births registration. The public office is open 9.30 &mdash; 1.00 and 2.30 &mdash; 4.00.  Telephone queries are also answered from 9.30 &mdash; 1.00 and 2.30 &mdash; 4.00, Monday through Friday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The telephone service to the Department of Foreign Affairs is operated on a 24 hour basis, seven days a week.  Ireland currently has a network of 75 resident diplomatic and consular Missions abroad and 87 Honorary Consulates.  The opening times of these public offices vary from location to location, in accordance with local custom and practice. Our diplomatic Missions also operate an &lsquo;out-of-hours&rsquo; emergency service which operates in the evenings and at weekends.  There are no agencies or State bodies which operate under the control of my Department. There are however a number of advisory groups operating under its aegis: the Advisory Board for Development Cooperation Ireland; the Development Education Advisory Committee; and the D&iacute;on Committee (which advises on support for our emigrant communities in Britain).  As advisory bodies, they do not operate public offices or independent phone lines.</P>
        <P>The Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange (the Fulbright Commission), has autonomy of management and administration in accordance with the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1991.  I understand that they operate a telephone service from 9.00 until 5.15, Monday through Friday, but that they do not have a public office.  My Department has not carried out a specific study of opening hours of public offices under my control or remit.  However, opening hours are kept under regular review, to ensure optimum service to customers.</P>

	<P>There are a wide variety of forms issued by my Department for use by both the public and other organisations. I have set out below a table of the forms and their on-line completion status. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The application forms issued by the Passport Office are of particular importance as they are used by such a large number of citizens.  The Passport Office provides passport application forms in both Irish and English.  While specimen copies are available on the Department&rsquo;s website www.dfa.ie, applicants must complete a pre-printed form.  This is available at post offices and <Col N="2082"/>Garda stations throughout the country and at Embassies and Consulates abroad.  Completion of a pre-printed passport form is necessary for a number of security related reasons, including the transfer of the applicant&rsquo;s signature to the form and the authentication of the official stamps of witnesses.  In view of these requirements, the provision of an on-line application facility would present particular challenges; however, the matter will be kept under continuing review.  At the same time, an innovative online tracking system, which was introduced in late 2006, enables applicants to track the progress of their passport applications.</P><Col N="2081"/>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the conditions in state homes in Bulgaria which accommodate children and adults with intellectual disabilities; if he will he press the <Col N="2082"/>Bulgarian Government, as a fellow EU Member State, to take measures to alleviate these conditions; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I share deep concerns regarding the welfare of vulnerable people in institutional care in Bulgaria.  The need for action to address this dis<Col N="2083"/>turbing legacy of past policies and attitudes was highlighted during Bulgaria&rsquo;s negotiations for accession to the EU  While some progress was made before accession, the Bulgarian authorities recognise that more needs to be done.  The EU continues to support this reform process and some &euro;5 million of EU funding will next year be directed towards the development of alternative care arrangements for people resident in such institutions.</P>
        <P>Providing an alternative to large-scale institutional care is a process that requires careful planning and adequate funding.  There is a general recognition amongst those dealing with this situation on the ground that the solution must be well thought out, be applicable generally throughout the system, and have the interests of the children as the driving force behind it.</P>
        <P>With regard to the institution which featured in a recent BBC documentary, I am advised that the Bulgarian authorities are working closely with a group of Non-Governmental Organisations and UNICEF in the implementation of an agreed action plan.  As a result, medical evaluations of the children have been carried out and a number of them have received hospital treatment.  The children are also being assessed to determine the full extent of their problems with a view to producing detailed plans for their futures.  The local authorities have authorised additional funding and supplies to immediately improve the welfare of those living there.  A new Director has been appointed to the institution and the rest of the staff are receiving training by a group of specialists in this field.  Ultimately, it is planned to close the orphanage and to provide specialist care through the creation of smaller group homes.</P>
        <P>In light of the BBC documentary, I have asked our Ambassador to Bulgaria to convey my concerns regarding the welfare of these vulnerable people to the appropriate authorities in Bulgaria, and to request an update on the situation.  The Ambassador and other officials in the Embassy will also inform the Bulgarian authorities of the strong public interest in Ireland in seeing a dramatic improvement in the standards of care given to people in institutional care in Bulgaria.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s engagement and concerns are also expressed in other ways.  In recent years, the Department of Foreign Affairs has supported NGOs active in Bulgaria on the protection of children at risk and the rehabilitation of people with intellectual disabilities.  Organisations supported include the Bulgarian Association for People with Intellectual Disabilities.</P>
        <P>The Irish Embassy in Sofia maintains close contact with organisations working to improve the living conditions of the children and young adults in such institutions.  A number of Irish citizens and organisations are also involved and the <Col N="2084"/>Embassy supports them in their work whenever possible.  The Deputy can be assured that we will continue to urge the speedy implementation of the necessary reforms.</P>

	<P>The Department of Foreign Affairs disposes of all redundant information technology equipment in accordance with the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations.</P>
        <P>I recently decided that my Department should donate the bulk of its redundant PCs at Headquarters to the charity Camara for reuse in developing countries and this process is underway.  The storage media in these PCs are subjected to an overwrite programme which is run seven times to ensure that all data is removed.  This is in excess of international best practice which recommends the programme is run three times.</P>
        <P>In some situations, it is necessary for security reasons to destroy rather than recycle certain computer equipment.  In these situations, all media which store information are removed prior to disposal.  In the presence of an official from my Department, these media are processed so as to render any data irrecoverable.  These media devices are then escorted to a registered recycling centre, where they are shredded immediately to 4mm fragments.  These fragments, and the remaining parts of the equipment, are then recycled in accordance with WEEE and EPA rules.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that these measures provide assurance that any stored information on the Department&rsquo;s ICT equipment has been removed prior to the reuse or disposal.</P>

        <P>I understand from the OPW that these buildings incorporate significant environmentally friendly design elements, such as low energy light fittings.  Furthermore, the building in Limerick will have natural ventilation, which reduces the need for energy consuming air handling systems, and the building in Dublin is equipped with an air conditioning heat recovery system, which reduces energy demand.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 324 and 326 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the seriousness of the current situation in Somalia.  Somalia has been without an effective government since 1991, and the situation there has worsened in recent months following initial stability after the December 2006 Ethiopian invasion.  An upsurge in violence was triggered at the end of October by the killings of Ethiopian soldiers, whose bodies were later dragged through the streets.  There has been intense fighting in the capital Mogadishu between Ethiopian and Transitional Federal Government (TFG) forces on the one hand, and clan militias and Islamists on the other hand, prompting many to flee the capital.</P>
        <P>UNHCR estimates that more than 200,000 people have fled Mogadishu since the start of November.  It is now estimated that 60% of the population of Mogadishu, or 600,000 people, have been displaced from there since February.  This brings the total number of people displaced since the start of 2007 to approximately one million and up to one and a half million need humanitarian aid.  Most of those fleeing Mogadishu have sought shelter in temporary settlements near Afgooye.  A UN inter-agency mission which visited a small number of these sites noted critical requirements for shelter materials, water &amp; sanitary facilities, <Col N="2087"/>health care and livelihood interventions.  The problems faced by humanitarian organisations who are attempting to assist those displaced include lack of access to and from air strips, administrative impediments,  TFG &lsquo;taxes&rsquo; on relief goods, and the arrest of personnel (the Director of Operations of the World Food Programme was detained from 17-23 October).</P>
        <P>The situation in Somalia was discussed at the UN Security Council in October.  The Special Representative of the Secretary General, Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, will brief the Security Council in December, following his ongoing visit to Somalia, where he has held discussions with President Yusuf, and the new Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein, on the need to resolve the ongoing crisis by peaceful means.  Mr Ould-Abdallah also met with NGOs and members of the Somali opposition in Djibouti last week.</P>
        <P>Somalia was discussed by senior EU officials in Brussels on 21 November.  The next General Affairs and External Affairs Council on 10-11 December is likely to take up the issue of Somalia, and agree Council Conclusions on the way forward.  I will ensure that these Conclusions stress the need for a political solution to the violence in Somalia, without which there is no prospect of putting an end to the suffering of the Somali people.  I also believe that the issue of humanitarian access is critically important, and that the EU should use its influence in this regard.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid support to Somalia amounted to over &euro;5 million in 2006, and over &euro;7 million so far this year.  This funding is channelled through Irish and international NGOs, as well as UN agencies such as OCHA, UNDP, the World Food Programme and UNICEF.  I will continue to follow this tragic situation closely.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the ongoing humanitarian tragedy in Congo; the details of discussions he has held at international level, be it EU or UN, with counterparts with regard to trying to offer assistance to those innocent persons so terribly afflicted; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The renewed conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and the major humanitarian emergency to which it has given rise, poses a serious threat to the transition process in that country and needs to be addressed urgently.  A number of armed militias are preying on the population in North and South Kivu provinces, and attempts by government troops to resolve the situation by force risk visiting further suffering on the people of the region.  Ethnic viol<Col N="2088"/>ence between Hutu and Tutsi factions has further heightened tensions.</P>
        <P>Closer regional cooperation in addressing this situation is vital.  I therefore very much welcome the recent communiqu&eacute; between the DRC and Rwanda, signed on 9 November in Nairobi, vowing to tackle the problems in the east of the DRC in an integrated fashion.  It is important that the DRC Army, the FARDC, should act impartially, and carry out its operations with full respect for human rights and the rule of law, ensuring that it is not seen as being aligned with any particular ethnic group.</P>
        <P>My EU colleagues and I last discussed the situation in the east of the DRC at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in October.  Following our discussion, the EU issued a Declaration calling for an end to the violence and expressing its deep concern in particular over the concentration of military forces in the region and urging a constructive dialogue between all concerned parties.</P>
        <P>In the period 2005 to date Ireland has provided over &euro;16.75 million in humanitarian assistance to the DRC.  Almost &euro;8 million has been provided thus far in 2007. I am extremely concerned about the humanitarian impact of the fighting this year in North Kivu, which has forced more than 370,000 civilians to flee their homes.  Also many tens of thousands of displaced people in the province of South Kivu face serious food shortages in the coming months after their crops were destroyed by heavy rainfall in the region.  Ireland remains committed to continuing to support the DRC, including through provision of emergency and recovery assistance as well as any other forms of assistance deemed appropriate.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, an end to the conflict in eastern DRC will only be found by the creation of stability and the establishment of the rule of law throughout DRC. Security sector reform, demobilisation and disarmament, ending impunity, and establishing an effective, fair and transparent system of justice are all urgently required.  The European Union, including Ireland, is fully committed to helping the Congolese government to tackle these problems.  On the ground, the EUPOL DR Congo mission is assisting in police reform, and the EUSEC DR Congo mission is offering guidance on army integration and other security issues.  In 2006, Ireland provided &euro;500,000 to support demobilisation and disarmament in the wider Great Lakes region.  Establishing stability and justice will be a slow process, but the EU is committed to providing assistance in the long term.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The international community is also attempting to address the ongoing conflict in DRC.  I fully support the work of the United Nations in the DRC, especially the contribution that the UN&rsquo;s peace-keeping mission, MONUC, has made to ensuring stability in the Ituri region in the north.  The DRC is also one of four country situations <Col N="2089"/>where the International Criminal Court (ICC) has currently decided to act, and two individuals from DRC have been arrested and will stand trial in The Hague.  The ICC Chief Prosecutor is currently in the process of selecting a third case from the DRC.</P>

The British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body has played an important role in developing mutual understanding and strengthening relations among the people of these islands.  As a former co-chair of the BIIPB I have long been an admirer of its work.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that the changed context arising from the positive developments in Northern Ireland will present new opportunities for the Body, but its future direction is a matter for consideration by the Body itself.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to the establishment of the East West Parliamentary framework, and the North/South Parliamentary forum, as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement.  In this context I welcome the motion adopted by the BIIPB at its meeting last month &lsquo;to initiate consultations with the Northern Ireland Assembly, the governments and the other relevant elected institutions with a view to making recommendations as to the formation of the inclusive East-West inter-parliamentary framework which will embrace all interests, as envisaged in the St. Andrews Agreement&rsquo;.</P>

        <P>Secretary of State Woodward spoke with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr Brian Lenihan T.D., by telephone on 13 November regarding the ongoing criminal investigation.  Minister Lenihan reviewed progress on the case with Secretary of State Woodward&rsquo;s colleague with responsibility for criminal justice, Minister Paul Goggins, when they met in Dublin on 27 November.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 and 333 together.</P>
        <P>The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey records jobs gained and lost in companies supported by the Industrial Development Agencies.  Data is compiled on an annualised basis and is aggregated at county level only. Data in relation to 2007 will not be available until mid 2008.  The number of jobs created in Enterprise Ireland supported companies in counties with Hub and Gateway towns was 15,281 and 30,319 respectively for the years 2003 to 2006.  A breakdown of these figures is set out in the following tabular statement.</P>

	<P>The establishment of the thirty-five County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) pre-dated the development of the National Spatial Strategy.  The CEBs were set up in 1993 to provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local<?oasys _jy6 ?>level.</P>
        <P>As the geographical structure of the CEBs is not in accordance with the geographical structure of the National Spatial Strategy, and as the CEBs do not have a defined role in the roll-out of the Strategy, the manner in which the CEBs present statistical data in respect of their geographical area of responsibility does not automatically correspond to the regions designated as Gateways under the National Spatial Strategy.  However given their inherent regional structure and their remit of stimulating local economic development any success by the CEBs in fulfilling this remit has a positive impact on overall balanced regional development which is a key aim of the National Spatial Strategy.</P>
        <P>The statistical information set out below is based on activity by individual CEBs in their geographical areas of responsibility within which there are areas designated as Gateways under the National Spatial Strategy.  In the case of Dublin, Cork, Limerick/Shannon, Galway and Waterford all CEB activities are shown.  In the other cases only CEB activities in these particular towns are shown. Figures for 2007 to date are provisional at present.</P>

	<P>The establishment of the thirty-five County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) pre-dated the development of the National Spatial Strategy.  The CEBs were set up in 1993 to provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.</P><Col N="2098"/>
        <P>As the geographical structure of the CEBs is not in accordance with the geographical structure of the National Spatial Strategy, and as the CEBs do not have a defined role in the roll-out of the Strategy, the manner in which the CEBs present statistical data in respect of their geographical area of responsibility does not automatically correspond to the regions designated as Hubs under the National Spatial Strategy.  However given their inherent regional structure and their remit of stimulating local economic development any achievements by the CEBs have a positive impact on overall balanced regional development which is a key aim of the National Spatial Strategy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The statistical information as follows shows CEB activity in areas designated as Hubs under the National Spatial Strategy.  These figures are a subset of the County-wide activities of the CEBs in question.  Figures for 2007 to date are provisional at present.</P><Col N="2097"/>

	<P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>For the majority of clients participation on CE is capped at three years.  However, in November 2004 I revised the 3 year CE capping to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE (based on participation since 3rd April, 2000).  This measure was introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</P>
        <P>The criteria for participating on the Community Employment programme are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments.  In line with Government policy, participation on employment schemes for all participants has an upper age limit of 65 years of age i.e. F&Aacute;S may provide funds to community based employers to cover participant costs until the day before their 66th birthday.</P><Col N="2124"/>
        <P>Any individual, including widows over 55, can participate on CE up to their 66th birthday provided they have not reached their participation limit in terms of years spent on the programme.</P>
        <P>In this regard, CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  The operation of the scheme is kept under constant review.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the proposal of the European Commission, in terms of goods only economic partnership agreements due to be signed by 31 December 2007, which will mean that countries who did not sign the interim agreements will not have preferential access to the EU market from 1 January 2008 onwards and that article 3 of the Cotonou Agreement says that economic partnership agreements shall refrain from any measures liable to jeopardise development objectives which are poverty reduction, long term poverty eradication consistent with the objectives of sustainable development, gradual integration of the African Caribbean and Pacific countries into the world economy; the alternatives to goods only agreements he will support in order to meet these obligations while accepting that many African, Caribbean and Pacific countries call for more time to negotiate; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The current trading arrangements under the Cotonou Agreement must come to an end on the 31st of December 2007 if the EU and our Africa Caribbean Pacific (ACP) country partners are to meet our international obligations in the World Trade Organization.  Accordingly, the EU and the 6 ACP regions agreed some years ago to negotiate new arrangements, namely Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), to replace the existing Cotonou arrangements.</P>
        <P>Recently, however, some of the ACP regions have indicated that it will be difficult for them to agree the terms of a full EPA by that deadline.  For those cases, the Commission has issued, in October last, a Communication setting out its proposals for a two-step approach.  This approach is to put in place new arrangements to deal with trade in goods after the 31st of December and to continue with negotiations for all other aspects of a full EPA into next year.  Without such interim arrangements, some of the ACP countries will only be able to depend on the Generalised System of Preferences from the start of 2008.</P>
        <P>Ireland believes that the negotiations must be conducted in a spirit of goodwill, flexibility and <Col N="2125"/>understanding.  We have always said that any resulting agreements must be supportive of ACP countries&rsquo; development needs and their poverty reduction strategies.  In particular we have said that we do not want to see any ACP country suffer a diminution of its preferential access to the EU.</P>
        <P>At the EU General Affairs Council of the 21st of November last, the Development Ministers considered the current state of the negotiations for EPAs and the Commission&rsquo;s proposals for a two-step approach.  In its Conclusions, the Council described the Commission&rsquo;s proposals as pragmatic and endorsed the approach as an interim solution.  On the issue of continuing negotiations for full EPAs into 2008, the Council called for a flexible and phased approach.  Finally, the Council called on the Commission to report back to the December General Affairs Council with recommendations to address the situation of those countries that risk having their trade with the EU disrupted.</P>
        <P>I, along with my colleagues in Council, will give serious consideration to any proposal that meets our two objectives, namely to continue preferences for ACP countries and to comply with our WTO obligations.</P>

	<P>We are price takers when it comes to buying energy needed to run our economy. We are subject to the same fossil fuel cost pressures experienced in other economies. </P>
        <P>The Government is very aware that both energy supply and cost is of strategic, competitive importance.  Our approach to tackling the issue of supply and cost is clearly set out in the Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy that was published earlier this year.  This aims to encourage alternative and renewable energy supplies, promote efficiency in the energy market (for example through the All Island Electricity Market that came into effect on 1 November) and encourage conservation and fuel saving through behaviour.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government recently launched an important and extensive campaign to highlight the importance of energy saving in the context of climate change.  This is in addition to the Power of One campaign that identifies where business and consumers can reduce energy consumption and cut their energy costs.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) vigorously promotes and advises on energy efficiency through a range of programmes and is eager to provide its knowledge on energy conservation and cost control to the SME sector.  The Government has provided considerable funding to SEI to enable the agency to significantly expand their work in this area.  Under my own Department, Enterprise Ireland provides support for companies that through their innovation strategies, identify energy saving opportunities.</P>

	<P>The Minister for <Col N="2127"/>Environment, Heritage and Local Government has overall responsibility for guidelines and schemes in relation to local authority charges.  In the first five-year period of operation of the Development Contribution Scheme the amount collected in development contributions increased significantly.  This reflected, in part, the increasing demand for infrastructure arising from our unprecedented levels of economic growth.  </P>
        <P>Arising from concerns raised by the Small Business Forum and others about the level and range of Development Contributions levied by Local Authorities, I raised this matter with my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>An Inter-Departmental Committee was set up to look at the broad operation of locally-determined Development Contribution Schemes and the related Development Contribution Guidance.  It was recognised that securing future income streams from development contributions depends on achieving the appropriate balance between the necessary levels of funding now, and the need for local authority areas to continue to represent an attractive location for future investment.</P>
        <P>The Report of the Interdepartmental Committee was published in April 2007, and Guidance reflecting the findings of the Report was issued to Local Authorities in May 2007.  The revised Guidance to Local Authorities, furthermore, emphasised the importance of consultation with local interests and, in addition to the consultation process required by legislation, all draft Development Contribution Schemes must now be submitted to the relevant County Development Board for comment.</P>
        <P>I should also add that an appeals process already exists whereby businesses can appeal Special Development Contributions and the application of a development levy where a developer feels the scheme has not been applied in accordance with the terms set out by the Local Authority.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to work with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure fairness in the imposition of Local Authority charges on the business community.</P>

Switch off all their computer equipment (base units, monitors and peripheral devices) at the end of each working day; 2. Switch off their PC monitors at lunch time and while attending meetings etc; 3. Ensure that the last person leaving each individual office switches off all electric lights, printers, photocopiers and heaters; The Department ensures that recycled paper is available for use in the Department; The Department provides recycling facilities in some of its buildings for newspapers, magazines, and paper generally; The Department ensures that IT equipment including toners, is recycled and makes arrangements to have mobile phones/chargers/batteries also recycled; The Department also provides recycling facilities for plastic bottles/aluminium cans in some of its buildings.

        <P>As I explained to the House on 28th November last, the use to which IDA property can be put is prescribed by legislation and the disposal of property for any alternative use requires the consent of the Minister of the day.

        <P>The extension of the Reading Room opening hours is an objective of National Archives management and they are currently working towards delivery of a commitment of extended opening to the public of at least three hours per week during 2008 in the context of the Department&rsquo;s Action Plan under Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the National Archives has concentrated on expanding the resources available on its website.  This is reflected in the very high levels of traffic on the site.  In the six months from 1 May to 31 October 2007 there were just under 9 million hits on the National Archives website, or an average of 48,342 hits per day, which makes the National Archives website one of the busiest in Ireland.  Online access to the 1901 and 1911 Census returns, which will be provided incrementally over 2008, and which began with the launch of the Dublin 1911 returns on Monday of this week, is expected to increase these figures exponentially.</P>
        <P>The opening hours of agencies under the control of my Department are a matter for the agencies themselves.  Information on opening hours and telephone line availability are available directly from the agencies or from their websites.</P>
        <P>The mark Culture Night 2007 I invited all of the Cultural Institutions funded by my Department to look at extending their opening hours.  My officials are currently pursuing the matter and I hope to make an announcement early in the New Year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are currently three buildings occupied by my Department, two of which are located in Dublin at Kildare Street and South Frederick Street where my Department is not the main tenant in either building.  This limits to some extent the action that can be taken directly by my Department to make them environmentally friendly.  The third is at Fossa in County Kerry, which accommodates an advance party of 70 staff in the context of decentralisation of my Department to Killarney.</P>
        <P>During 2007, an Energy Efficiency Committee was established in my Department in the context of the Partnership process to examine energy usage and raise awareness among staff of the need for energy efficiency. In conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s Power of One campaign, the committee organised a number of presentations for staff to outline tips on energy saving actions, both at work and in the home. An Efficiency Suggestions Scheme competition was also held, which invited staff members to make suggestions on making the Department more energy efficient.</P>
        <P>I was delighted to personally present the prizes for the best suggestions to staff in July last. All suggestions submitted have recently been published and provided to all staff in my Department.</P>
        <P>These initiatives resulted in notices being placed at electrical equipment and light switches in my Department to remind staff to switch off lights and equipment to save energy. In this context, staff are requested to switch off information technology and any electrical office equipment when not in use and particularly at the end of the working day. Furthermore, all personal computer monitor screens purchased by my Department in 2007 are flat-screen technology, which are far more energy efficient than the old Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitors used.</P>
        <P>Where my Department is the only tenant, in the building in Fossa, it is in the process of switching over to Airtricity. This will provide wind-generated electricity to this building.   My Department has also requested that the OPW carry out works on the exterior lighting of the building to ensure that as soon as the building and car park has been vacated of staff, all the exterior lighting can be switched off, with just a single light over the front door remaining on all night for security purposes. Previously the full exterior lights had remained on throughout the night.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of the implementation of decentralisation, construction is currently under way on a new headquarters in Killarney, which will be a &ldquo;green&rdquo; building, which will provide a pleasant working environment and yet be economical to run.  The design of the building, which has been carefully conceived in line with an exacting brief provided by the Office of Public Works, makes use of many environmentally friendly and energy <Col N="2137"/>saving features in line with best practice, nationally and internationally.</P>
        <P>It is also my Department&rsquo;s policy to promote the increased usage of recycled paper as much as possible. My Department also has a system in place in all of its locations to ensure that all used waste paper is issued for recycling.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s new IT Strategy for 2008-2010, which is currently in preparation,  will address all possible means of maximising IT facilities and communications in terms of energy efficiency and making my Department more environmentally friendly.</P>

	<P>As I have previously informed the House, the nationwide audit of sports facilities has commenced and is being carried out in stages to help speed up the availability of information.  Phase One, which focuses on national and regional sports facilities, has now been completed within my Department.  A database of sports facilities of national or regional significance has been compiled including details of facilities at third level educational institutions and swimming pools.  Phase Two of the audit, which will commence shortly, is a more complex undertaking to establish a record of existing sports facilities at local level and identify the need for future provision.</P>
        <P>The audit is part of a wider exercise to put in place a more strategic approach to the provision of sports facilities in Ireland.  Work on the National Sports Facility Strategy is now underway with the assistance of a firm of consultants involving both national and international experts in the area of sports facilities.  The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment/grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  It is intended to identify the facilities requirement for sport so that participation at reasonable cost is feasible for those who wish to engage in sport at either amateur or elite level.</P>
        <P>A key objective in relation to the preparation of the National Sports Facility Strategy is to ensure consistency on a nationwide basis in relation to the completion of the audit facility so that inter-regional planning can be undertaken.  With this in mind, the preparation of a guidance pack and audit toolkit for use by Local Authorities and /or Local Sports Partnerships to assist them in carrying out local audit has been prioritised as part of the Sports Facility Strategy.  This element of the strategy will greatly help in the completion of the audit and the compilation of a comprehensive database on the range and nature of sporting facilities at national, regional and local level.</P>
        <P>The Sports Capital Programme is the primary means of providing Government funding to sport and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  It has operated on an annual basis and is part funded from National Lottery funds.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;568m has been allocated in sports capital funding since 1998 to 6,716 sports projects across the country.  Additionally over &euro;107m in capital funding has been provided towards the redevelopment of Croke Park.  In 2007 &euro;85m was allocated towards 935 separate projects.</P>
        <P>The Programme, as it currently operates, requires that applicants either own the site or premises of the proposed facility or that they hold it under a lease of at least twenty-two years, with at least fifteen years remaining on the lease.  Pri<Col N="2139"/>marily, this condition is to ensure that the sporting organisation is in a position to make a commitment that the grant-aided facility will remain in sporting use for a significant period.</P>
        <P>In addition, it is necessary because grantees in receipt of funding over a specified level must enter into a Deed of Covenant and Charge in order to protect the Minister&rsquo;s interest and ensure that the property remains in sporting use.  This places a charge on the grantee&rsquo;s property and in this regard, my Department is advised by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office (CCSO) that a lease of twenty-one years is required in law to create a legal estate capable of supporting a charge.  However, where a lease is required to be registered in the Property Registration Authority, and a solicitor fails to register the lease in time and part of the twenty-one year term then expires, the Property Registration Authority will not register the lease, and the charge that is required cannot be secured.</P>
        <P>It is to ensure, therefore, that the lease may be registered within the timeframe required, so that the charge can be secured, that my Department, acting on the advice of the CSSO, has requested a lease of not less than twenty-two years.  In this regard, it provides a safeguard for organisations that apply for capital funding under the Sports Capital Programme.</P>
        <P>These stipulations apply to new unregistered leases only, as existing registered leases of twenty-one years or more are capable of supporting a charge.  In such instances, the applicant must provide evidence that the lease has been registered with the Property Registration Authority with a minimum of 15 years remaining.</P>
        <P>I should point out to the Deputy that this condition does not apply if the application is for equipment only.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P>
        <P>Most recently, significant reforms came into force, which allow people in receipt of certain <Col N="2140"/>other social welfare payments, who are also providing full time care and attention, to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means.  The maximum payment will be the equivalent of a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>One of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement Towards 2016 is the development of a national carer&rsquo;s strategy and this commitment is reiterated in the Programme for Government.  I am aware that one of the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs Report on the Position of Full Time Carers, which was published in 2003, was that such a strategy should be developed.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that we are now in a position to act on that recommendation.  The strategy will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community.  While social welfare supports for carers will clearly be a key issue in the strategy, other issues such as access to respite and other services, education, training and employment will also feature strongly. Co-operation between relevant Government departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.  For that reason, all relevant departments and agencies will be involved in the strategy and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners.</P>
        <P>My officials have been in discussions with their colleagues in other relevant Departments in order to decide on the best approach to the development of the strategy.  In view of the need to ensure that appropriate arrangements and structures are in place to support its development, it will not be possible to complete the strategy by the end of this year as had been intended originally.</P>
        <P>An inter-Departmental working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, will be established in the coming weeks to develop the strategy and to manage the consultation process. I expect the strategy to be completed by summer of 2008.</P>
        <P>The recent improvements in the income supports available from this Department represent major improvements in supports available to carers in the community.  The development of a national carers strategy provides us with an opportunity to build further on these improvements and to consider other areas where progress can be made.</P>

	<P>The Family Income Supplement (FIS) is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families. FIS is paid for 52 weeks provided a person continues to meet the qualifying conditions and a claim for renewal may then be made. With regard to the level of take up, it is not possible to estimate from administrative sources the number of families who would be eligible but do not apply for their FIS entitlements. There are currently over 20,800 people in receipt of FIS. </P>
        <P>Entitlement to FIS is based on an applicant satisfying a means test and on certification of employment by the employer. The Department has consistently publicised the scheme in order to maximise uptake by qualified families, and undertakes a number of measures to ensure that people are aware of possible entitlement to FIS. These include advice to all persons who are awarded one parent family payment and back to work allowance recipients.</P>
        <P>All employers are provided annually with information about the FIS scheme. Information on FIS is contained in all child benefit books and can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website. The Revenue Commissioners have also included information on FIS when writing to PAYE taxpayers with their certificates of tax credits.</P>
        <P>Following significant improvements in the qualifying income limits in the 2006 budget, the Department undertook a week-long, nationwide awareness campaign in March of that year to encourage increased take up of the scheme. This, combined with the improvements in the income limits, resulted in a strong upward trend in the level of new claims and consequently, claims for renewals.</P>
        <P>To date in 2007, the Department has received some 36,000 new and renewal FIS claims and has finalised a total of almost 30,000 cases. The average time it currently takes to award a FIS claim or renewal is close to 15 weeks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department is taking action to improve the efficiency of claim processing to ensure that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible. Among the following measures being taken, a review of existing processes and procedures has been completed by the Department with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing; and improvements are being implemented. Priority is being given to renewal claims to ensure continuity of payment; overtime working is being done. Staffing requirements were recently reviewed and are being monitored on a ongoing basis in the light of the current volumes of claims and renewals. These measures will lead to more efficient processing and reduce the <Col N="2142"/>number of claims on hand. The position is being closely monitored and kept under review by the Department.</P>

	<P>The Respite Care Grant is payable to all carers, irrespective of means or contribution record, but subject to certain conditions, relating notably to employment. </P>
        <P>The person concerned was refused a Respite Care Grant on the grounds that the Deciding Officer in her case was not satisfied that she was providing full-time care and attention. This decision was based on information supplied by the person concerned on her application form</P>
        <P>She was recently notified of this decision and of her right to appeal it. To date, according to my Department&rsquo;s records, no such appeal has been lodged. However, the Deciding Officer will now review the entitlement of the person concerned taking into account the additional details of care supplied in connection with this Question. A fresh decision will be issued to the person concerned as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>State Pension Non-Contributory is a means tested payment with entitlement to pension decided based on the income or means of the customer.  In determining the means of a customer items such as cash income, including <Col N="2143"/>British Pensions, the value of any property (excluding a person&rsquo;s own home) and the value of any savings and investments which a person may have are taken into account.  Customers are obliged to declare all of their means, and to inform my Department of any change in their circumstances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where it is determined that a customer has, directly or indirectly deprived him or herself of any income or property in order to qualify for receipt of the State Pension Non Contributory or a higher rate than he or she would otherwise be entitled that income or the value of that property shall be taken to be part of their means.  The assessment of means in such circumstances is provided for under Rule 2 (3) of the Third Schedule of the SW Consolidation Act 2005.</P>
        <P>Where the income or the value of the property assessed under this rule has reduced since the date of decision, the customer may apply to have their entitlement reviewed.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The most recent national independent customer survey, Consulting With Our Customers, carried out in 2005, indicated that 81% of customers who visited Local Offices were happy with the opening hours.  Only 1% of the overall number of customers surveyed identified opening hours as an area that required improvement.</P>

The facility to complete scheme application forms on-line does not currently exist on the website. Customers can however use an on-line form to notify the Department that they are unemployed and wish to make a claim for Jobseekers Benefit. The customer is subsequently contacted by the Department and arrangements are made for them to make a claim at their Local Office. Each month some 450 customers use this on-line facility. The Department&rsquo;s website is currently being redeveloped and the new website will be deployed mid 2008.

	<P>The supplementary allowance (SWA) scheme, including rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The Executive has advised that it has no record of an application for rent supplement from the person concerned. The Executive has further advised that if the person concerned wishes to make an application for rent supplement then he should contact the Community Welfare Officer at his local health centre to discuss his entitlement to rent supplement. </P>

        <Quest> the amount it would cost to extend the fuel allowance scheme to those persons previously in receipt of short term social welfare who take up community employment schemes. </Quest>

	<P>People in receipt of short-term social welfare payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, illness benefit or occupational injuries benefit are not normally eligible to receive a fuel allowance.  People in receipt of short-term jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (i.e. less than 13 weeks) do not qualify for fuel allowance.  After 13 weeks, they may be eligible to receive the allowance and to retain it while on a CE scheme.</P>
        <P>There is a special arrangement in place to pay the smokeless fuel allowance element (&euro;3.90 per week) to people who live in one of the designated urban smokeless fuel areas and who have been receiving one of these social welfare payment types for 13 weeks or more.  To be eligible for this &lsquo;supplementary fuel allowance&rsquo;, applicants must satisfy the other standard conditions of the fuel allowance scheme, in particular that the combined weekly household income must not be more than &euro;100 above the reference old age contributory pension rate applicable to the family size. As with the standard fuel allowance, only one smokeless fuel allowance is payable per household.  Applications for this smokeless fuel allowance should be made through the local social welfare office.</P>
        <P>Allowing recipients of short term social welfare payments to receive fuel allowance on taking up <Col N="2151"/>a community employment scheme would be a major policy change.  The additional annual cost would be &euro;2.5m in respect of approximately 4,800 short term social welfare recipients on CE schemes at present.</P>
        <P>However, if policy was changed to allow short term social welfare recipients on CE to receive fuel allowance, the issue of extending the allowance to all 123, 000 people on short term benefits would have to be addressed.  While not all of these would satisfy all the conditions for receipt of fuel allowance, the cost of even half of these becoming eligible would result in additional annual expenditure of the order of &euro;32m.  Any changes in relation to the conditions for eligibility for fuel allowance would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in a Budgetary context and in the light of resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> his views on restoring child benefit to all children; the number of children who would be affected; the estimated cost of granting universal child benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Child benefit may be paid in respect of every child under the age of 16 years, who is ordinarily resident in the State. Payment can be extended to the 19th birthday if the child is in education, or incapable of self-support. The benefit is paid to the qualified person with whom the child resides and the qualified person must satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Habitual Residence Condition (introduced in May 2004) is to allow access to our social welfare schemes to people who are genuinely and lawfully making Ireland their habitual residence, while preventing unwarranted access by persons who have little or no connection with the State.</P>
        <P>Those who do not satisfy the HRC condition because they are in the asylum process, have direct provision available to them. In certain cases they may also avail of exceptional needs payments from the local Health Board for the period that their asylum application is being processed. In this manner the rights and welfare of the child are protected.  As soon as refugee status or right to remain is granted to such people, they are accepted as habitually resident and they would therefore be entitled to child benefit in respect of their qualifying children.</P>
        <P>The operation of the habitual residence condition in my Department continues to be monitored on an ongoing basis.  The reason for the introduction of the HRC in May 2004 &mdash; to ensure that people who have not worked in <Col N="2152"/>Ireland or who have not established their habitual residence in Ireland should not avail of assistance schemes or child benefit &mdash; continues to be relevant. As a result there is no proposal to change the current arrangements.</P>
        <P>Approximately 2000 claims to Child Benefit for some 3400 children have been refused since May 2004 as the applicant did not satisfy the habitual residence condition.  Those who were refused were mainly persons whose claims to asylum were not yet finalized, who did not have a work permit or who had no attachment to the workforce in Ireland.  In the same period, a total of over 160,000 new claims for Child Benefit was received and awarded.</P>
        <P>The total number of children affected and the cost of paying Child Benefit if the Habitual Residency condition was not applied is not known. This is because the numbers of children in the state, in respect of whom child benefit has not been claimed due to an awareness of the HRC conditionality, is unknown.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to providing a quality customer service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  These conditions vary from scheme to scheme and may involve, among other things, the need to establish the customer&rsquo;s social insurance record, verify medical incapacity for work, establish a customer&rsquo;s identity or their place of habitual residence and to assess means where appropriate.  In some cases there is an unavoidable time lag involved in making the necessary enquiries with outside agencies to enable decisions to be made.  Time can also elapse where applicants fail to supply all pertinent information in support of their application.</P>
        <P>In any given year my Department processes nearly 1.9 million application forms in respect of some 50 separate welfare schemes and issues about 68 million payments. Details of the number of new applications processed for the principal welfare schemes in respect of the month of October 2007 together with the average times to award such applications are set out in the appended tabular statement.</P><Col N="2153"/>
        <P>In the past few years my Department has coped with increasing demands arising from significant changes to the social welfare code and in the numbers of persons accessing the system.  While these factors have impacted on processing times, continuous efforts are made to improve these times. Operational procedures and the organisation of work continue to be reviewed and restructured to maximise the benefits of technology and new developments in processing techniques and business information.</P><Col N="2154"/>
        <P>There is also a continued emphasis on providing staff with the necessary training and development so as to ensure they have the requisite knowledge and skills to carry out their work.  I am conscious of the need to provide a quality service to our customers, and with my officials, I am working towards ensuring that my Department continues to deliver a first class service.</P><Col N="2153"/>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs. A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive (HSE) payment, or are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at below standard levels. </P>
        <P>Family Income Supplement (FIS) which is a weekly tax-free payment for families, including one-parent families, at work on low pay is also one of the qualifying payments for the purposes of the BSCFA scheme. This enables families, not normally in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment to avail of the BSCFA scheme. Self-employed people are not precluded from receiving BSCFA. If a person is self-employed, s/he may qualify for Jobseekers Allowance (JA), depending on the income from their business. As JA is a qualifying payment for BSCFA a self-employed person may then qualify for payment of BSCFA subject to meeting the other qualifying criteria of the scheme.</P>
        <P>FIS payments in certain instances are available to self-employed people or the spouses of self employed people, subject to certain scheme criteria being satisfied. Where self-employed people (or their spouses) are in receipt of FIS they too are eligible to apply for payment under the BSCFA scheme.</P>
        <P>I consider the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme to be an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain. I am satisfied that improvements to the scheme in recent years, namely an increase in income limits and an increase in the rates of payment respectively, provide a major boost to meeting the financial costs associated with return to school for those who most need assistance.</P>
        <P>Any changes to the structure of the scheme, rates of payment, income limits or amendments to the qualifying criteria would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of resources available to me for improvements in social welfare payments generally.</P>

	<P>People in receipt of Disability Allowance may work while in receipt of the allowance, however income earned is assessable as means.  The first &euro;120 of weekly earnings and 50% of earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 from employment or self-employment of a rehabilitative nature are disregarded in any means test. Any earnings in excess of this amount are assessed as income and entitlement to Disability Allowance reduced accordingly.</P>
        <P>One of the conditions for receipt of Invalidity Pension is that a person will not undertake any work.  However, a person may receive an exemption from this condition in order to retrain for alternative employment or for rehabilitative purposes.

        <P Just="Left">If a person on Invalidity Pension wishes to participate in a community employment scheme they should contact their F&Aacute;S Employment Services Officer regarding the availability of a place on a suitable scheme and if successful they should submit an application for an exemption to this Department through F&Aacute;S.

	<P>The Invalidity Pension is a payment for persons who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and who satisfy certain medical and social insurance conditions, namely: have been incapable of work for at least 12 months and be likely to be incapable of work for at least another 12 months, or</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be permanently incapable of work (in certain cases of very serious incapacity, a person can transfer directly from another social welfare payment or from employment to the Invalidity Pension), or</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have a total of 260 paid PRSI contributions (or 520 PRSI contributions from 6 April, 2012 onwards), and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have 48 paid or credited PRSI contributions in the last complete tax year before the claim is made.</P>
<P el="5" FLI="0">Only PRSI paid at Classes A, E and H count towards the Invalidity Pension. </P>
        <P>The qualification conditions that govern entitlement to and receipt of the Invalidity Pension are set down in Chapter 17, Sections 118 to 122, of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005, and no plans are being considered at present to alter them.</P>

	<P>With very few exceptions, a person aged 16 years or over who is either a part-time employee, a full-time employee or a self-employed individual with a minimum annual income must pay Pay-Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions.</P>
        <P>In general, PRSI contribution classes are decided by the nature of the employment and the amount of the employee&rsquo;s reckonable earnings in any week. Employees who earn less than &euro;38 per week (from all employments) or are aged 66 years or over, as well as certain people engaged in subsidiary employment, pay PRSI at Class J.  These people are covered for Occupational Injuries Benefits only.  There are no plans to extend the entitlements of people covered by Class J1 contributions.</P>

	<P>In the past 12 month period a total of 348 Invalidity Pension applications were refused on the grounds of insufficient insurance contributions.  The PRSI contribution conditions for Invalidity Pension require that the claimant must have a total of 260 contributions paid at the appropriate rate (class A, E or H) since entry into insurable employment and 48 paid or credited contributions in the governing contribution year, which currently is the 2006 tax year. Where a claimant has no reckonable contributions paid or credited for two consecutive years, he/she is not entitled to the payment of Invalidity Pension until 26 qualifying contributions have subsequently been paid.  </P>
        <P>If a person does not satisfy the PRSI conditions for Invalidity Pension based solely on their Irish social insurance record and they have worked in another country covered by EU regulations, periods of insurable employment in that country can be taken into account to help satisfy the qualifying conditions.  Periods of insurance in a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement can also be taken into account to help qualify for an Invalidity Pension.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Family Income Supplement (FIS) provides income support for employees on <Col N="2161"/>low earnings with families. This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments.  The position regarding FIS, for families described by the Deputy, varies depending on the family situation. In general, the person&rsquo;s net average weekly income would be established. Any financial support to another child would then be deducted and entitlement to FIS would be assessed in respect of the appropriate family size, in this case three children. However in some cases it may be necessary to investigate the position more thoroughly depending on specific circumstances of the family.</P>

        <P>As regards the matter referred to in the Question, I have received preliminary information about the incident and I have asked my officials to meet with the HAI to discuss the matter further.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that while my statutory powers currently extend only to farm animals, matters such as those involved here are governed by the Wildlife Acts and the Protection of Animals Acts.  I am fully committed to promoting good practices that respect the welfare of all animals and my Department is cur<Col N="2171"/>rently progressing a number of animal welfare-related commitments from the Programme for Government including consolidation of responsibility for the welfare of all animals (including non-farm animals) within my Department and the introduction of a comprehensive Animal Welfare Bill to update existing animal welfare legislation.</P>

	<P>My Department has greatest interaction with customers in relation to the following areas: direct payments under the Single Payment Scheme and Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS); animal traceability including registration of animal births and movements; Forestry grants and premiums; and Fisheries catch recording.</P>
        <P>The majority of the interactions relating to these key areas with the exception of REPS can now be carried out online through www.agriculture.gov.ie.  These online facilities are fully integrated with our processing systems, thereby obviating the need for input of information that we already hold.  They also provide extensive validation, thereby assisting customers in avoiding the types of errors that can cause delay in the processing of their applications.</P>
        <P>The online application facilities made available by my Department are quite extensive.  The online application facilities mentioned below relate to the Department&rsquo;s key schemes and processes, SPS, Forestry, Fisheries and Animal Health and Traceability.  At present, the only major scheme which is not available online is REPS.</P>

        <Quest> if she will provide this Deputy with a full detailed report covering the history of the fireblight disease here, cases over the past five years, her Department&rsquo;s and local authority policy in relation to replanting semi mature trees and felling trees and specifically cover the recent outbreak in Dublin; the reason the disease only hit parts of Dublin 13; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>On the basis of annual surveys the disease is said not to be established in the Country and Ireland has a protected zone for the disease.  Fireblight was first found in Ireland in 1986 on a <i>Cotoneaster sp.</i> in Clanbrassil St, Dublin 6, and sampling of suspect material by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has continued each year since then.</P>
        <P>As I indicated to the deputy in PQ Ref No: 21077/07, in latter years there are at least 1,500 samples submitted for laboratory testing and upwards of a dozen positive findings principally in Dublin and Cork Suburbs, along with a <Col N="2175"/>number of findings on nursery stock are detected each year.</P>
        <P>More specifically in 2003, in excess of 1900 samples were taken from host plants in nurseries, garden centres, public parks, private gardens, roadside hedges etc, and 8 positives  were found in Cork, 6 in Dublin (Dublin 7, 9 and 12), 1 in Laois, 3 in Tipperary and 1 in Wicklow.</P>
        <P>Over 2000 samples were taken during the 2004 survey with 13 positives at 11 sites, 1 nursery site in Clare, 6 sites in Cork, 1 in Kerry, 1 in Wexford and 2 in Wicklow.</P>
        <P>Of the 1555 samples tested in 2005, there were 25 positives at 15 locations throughout the country, namely Cork with 3 public areas and 2 private gardens, Dublin in 3 public areas, Galway in a public area and  in a nursery in Kildare, 2 nurseries in Tipperary, 1 nursery in Waterford and Wexford and a public park in Wicklow.</P>
        <P>In 2006 there were over 1600 samples taken which lead to 19 positives findings at 15 locations, 7 sites in Cork, 1 in Galway, 1 in Kildare, 1 in Kilkenny, 1 in Limerick, 2 in Monaghan, 2 in Tipperary and 1 in Waterford.</P>
        <P>The 2007 Survey to date has taken over 2000 samples with 45 positive findings, Laois at 1 site, Cork at 2 sites, Dublin at 15 sites (more specifically Markievicz park, Merrion sq., Donaghmeade, Baldoyle, Killbarrack, Sutton, Bayside, Portmarnock, Malahide, Howth and Swords results (these Dublin results have been previously forwarded to the Deputy), Galway at 1 site, Wicklow at 2 sites, Cork at 3 sites, Donegal at 1 site.</P>
        <P>In the case of all positive findings, the affected plant and associated host material is removed and destroyed in an effort to remove inoculum and prevent further spread of the pathogen as required by EU and domestic legislation for harmful organisms including Fireblight.</P>
        <P>As can be seen from the results over the past 5 years, the disease has not only been found in Dublin 13, but with positives now been recorded in South Dublin, the Fingal area and also plantings in residential areas of Cork, Galway and Wicklow.</P>
        <P>The policy re replanting of semi mature trees is a matter for the Local Authority where the outbreak occurs and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has no responsibility in the matter.</P>

The person named did not receive payments under the Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid Schemes during the reference years and, therefore, no Single Payment entitlements were established for him.

	<P>In June 1998, the Council of Fisheries Ministers took a decision to ban drift netting for tuna with effect from 1 January 2002, a decision which was provided for in EU law by Council Regulation 1239/1998. </P>
        <P>As part of the transition process to new methods of fishing this valuable species, Bord Iascaigh Mhara provided substantial EU-assisted <Col N="2178"/>support to interested fishermen to develop alternative fishing techniques.  A variety of fishing gears and techniques were tested and the results of trials undertaken in this regard have shown that it is possible to catch tuna with non-drift netting techniques.  Irish fishing boats have been fishing for albacore tuna since 2002 mainly by means of mid-water trawl but also with trolling.</P>
        <P>In 2003 and 2004 BIM undertook trials with a surface longline system in conjunction with the French Coop&eacute;rative Maritime Des Marins P&ecirc;cheurs on board two Irish vessels.  These trials, however, showed this method not to be economically viable due to the poor catch rates achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">BIM continues to work on improving our understanding of this species.  During 2005 BIM undertook trials in conjunction with a Spanish research institute (AZTI) and the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation in order to improve our understanding of the migratory and daily patterns of movement of this species.</P>
        <P>During 2006 and 2007 BIM have continued this tagging programme in conjunction with an effort to assess the possibility of developing other alternative methods of fishing including using a dead baiting technique used in South Africa. Further work is planned with this method in 2008.  BIM is also carrying out new product development trials on albacore tuna in association with local processors in order to develop new value added markets.</P>
        <P>The aid package put in place in 1998 was specifically designed to facilitate the development of alternative fishing techniques to drift netting.  No funding was allocated to the Irish fleet as  compensation for the introduction of the ban on the use of driftnets.</P>

	<P>Earlier this year the heating of my Department&rsquo;s office in Johnstown Castle in Wexford was switched over to a Woodchip boiler.  Following a survey carried out by the Office of Public Works it has been decided to <Col N="2180"/>install biofuel heating systems in the following Offices of my Department; Ballina AES Office, Cavan Regional Office, Castlebar Office, Ennis Local Office, Enniscorthy Local Office, Longford Local Office, Mullingar Local Office and Nenagh Local Office.  It is envisaged that the Office of Public Works will have these heating systems installed early next year.</P>
        <P>Building Management Systems have been installed in recent years at all Department Offices (including Agriculture House) with a floor area greater than 1,000 sq meters.  These systems are set up to avail of off peak/low rate electricity where possible.  They also control use of electricity, gas and oil in all such Offices and centrally controls temperature in these Offices.</P>
        <P>High efficiency fluorescent lighting is in place in all DAFF Offices.  This lighting is considered by the OPW to be five times more energy efficient than conventional lighting.  In more recently built and refurbished Department Offices lighting control systems have been installed which automatically switch off lighting in Office areas that are unoccupied.  During 2007, the Department has continued its desktop computer upgrade programme, which involves the replacement of older models of computer with more environmentally friendly models resulting in reduced demand for electrical power.</P>

	<P>The sheep sector is an important part of the overall agri-food sector and its future depends on its ability to meet the needs of the market.  The downward trend is production and an ageing consumer profile are major factors which the industry felt should be examined in order to develop a way forward.  With this in mind the industry established the Sheep Industry Development Strategy Group which included representatives from all interested parties including the relevant state bodies and my Department.  The Group&rsquo;s report set out a series of recommendations covering areas such as production, research, advice, processing and marketing.</P>
        <P>I established an implementation Group to see how the recommendations could best be implemented and it reported to me last April.  The objective is to facilitate the development of a more profitable sheep sector in Ireland covering the lamb production, lamb processing and marketing sectors of the industry.  Most of the recommendations in the Strategy report fall to be implemented by the industry itself and it is too early at this stage to assess their impact.  The recommendations are supported by my Department through assistance for breeding and management, processing facilities, mechanical grading and quality assurance.</P>
        <P>In addition, and in line with the Group&rsquo;s report, sheep farmers are major beneficiaries of various schemes being operated by my Department. Under REPS 4, a new supplementary measure aimed at sheep farmers has been introduced.  A budget of &euro;28m a year has been allocated to fund the proposed new supplementary measure at an overall cost of over &euro;170m for the period to 2013.</P>
        <P>In addition to the measures being taken at producer and processor level, Bord Bia&rsquo;s marketing and promotional efforts will be critical.  Bord Bia will continue to organize strategic marketing campaigns in selected European markets.  The downward trend in lamb consumption within the EU presents a real challenge.  To address this challenge, Bord Bia is collaborating with its French and British counterparts to develop a 3 year generic lamb promotion on the French market to promote lamb to younger consumers.  This campaign, which amounts to a major new initiative on the European Lamb market, is due to commence early in 2008.</P>
        <P>Following the decoupling of market supports and the introduction of the Single Farm Payment, it is not possible to provide direct support for pro<Col N="2183"/>duction.  I believe however that, with the cooperation of all stakeholders and in line with the approach set out above, the sheep sector can continue to make an extremely valuable contribution to the agri-food sector and to the economy as a whole.</P>

	<P>The Directives mentioned in the question refer to the proposals of the EU Commission on the sustainable use of pesticides which are currently under consideration.  These proposals are subject to the Co-decision process, involving both the EU Council and the EU Parliament working in parallel.  The EU Parliament adopted a position on these proposals at its plenary session on 23 October last.  I am aware that the European Parliament&rsquo;s adopted position refers to &ldquo;use reduction&rdquo;, prohibitions or severe restrictions in relation to use of certain plant protection products.  My Department is actively participating in the discussions at Council, and is aware of the possible negative consequences for Irish crop production of the EU Parliament&rsquo;s agreed position.  </P>

	<P>The correspondence referred to by the Deputy relates to Circular 0044/2007 on Language and Literacy in the infant classes in Irish medium schools.  It requires such schools to implement arrangements under which minimum timeframes set out in the curriculum are provided for, and the introduction of English as a second language is not delayed beyond the start of the second term in junior infant classes.   </P>
        <P>The revised primary curriculum was launched in 1999 after extensive consultation with the partners in education.  Page 27 in the Introduction to the Curriculum states &ldquo;It is a particular feature of Irish primary education that children, from the beginning of schooling, have experience of language learning in two languages.&rdquo;  It also sets out a suggested minimum weekly time framework for tuition.  This provides that where a first language is being taught, there should be four hours instruction per week, and 3 hours per week where there is a shorter day for the infant classes.  Where a second language is being taught, the suggested minimum timeframe is 3.5 hours per week, and 2.5 hours per week for infant classes with a shorter day.</P>
        <P>Some time ago my Department sought the advice of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on issues relating to emergent literacy in Irish medium schools.  The NCCA produced a series of reports on the matter, including a consultation paper, a literature review of research, and a report on the consultation process.  The Council presented its final advice in February 2007.</P>
        <P>Having considered the advice in full, I have determined as a public policy issue that the position as set out in the curriculum, and in previous Parliamentary Questions, should remain unchanged i.e that the minimum recommended timeframe set out for a second language in the curriculum should be adhered to.  The fundamental issue in this case concerns upholding the rights <Col N="2186"/>of all children to access the full curriculum from the earliest possible stage.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s inspectorate recommended the distribution of the Judging Dev publication on receipt of an application from the History In Service Team (HIST) to collaborate with the Royal Irish Academy and RTE to make the Judging Dev book available to all post primary schools, and I was happy to support this initiative. </P>
        <P>The release of the book, which reassesses the career of Eamon de Valera in the light of the recently catalogued De Valera Archive, coincides with the 70th anniversary of the 1937 Constitution.  The book brings together many documents/photographs/posters from archives around the country and abroad to shed light on de Valera&rsquo;s central role in the history of the Irish state.</P>
        <P>It was considered that Judging Dev would assist students in their study of modern Irish History, especially as the emphases in the new syllabuses are on documentary study and individual research. This initiative is right in the centre of such methodology and study.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provision of this book to second level schools should be seen in the context of my Department's practice of providing resources to teachers in relation to in-service training.  In addition, an accompanying RTE Radio One Series, an online exhibition, podcasts of the series, a website, www.dev.ie and teacher-developed class plans support the use of this material in the classroom.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Lisbon Convention and the EU Directive on Mutual Recognition of professional qualifications, Ireland is committed to giving appropriate recognition to qualifications from other countries. The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland hosts a network of qualifications and quality assurance agencies from Ireland, Northern Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland, and this network has agreed a ready reckoner showing how levels of qualification in Ireland and the UK align with each other. This provides useful information for employers, learners and education and training providers for comparing qualifications. In addition the Authority is a national recognition centre for qualifications which is linked with similar national centres throughout the EU.</P>
        <P>The teaching profession is regulated for the purposes of employment as a teacher in the public sector in Ireland. EU Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications came into force on 20th October 2007 and ensures that professionals from any of the EU <Col N="2189"/>member states proposing to enter a regulated profession will have their qualifications and experience recognised appropriately. The Teaching Council of Ireland is the competent authority for the regulation of the teaching profession in Ireland and holds the register of teachers approved to teach in publicly funded schools in the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a general principle, persons recognised to practice a regulated profession in their Member State of origin must be given recognition to practice that profession in a host EU Member State. However if there are shortfalls or significant gaps in the applicant&rsquo;s qualifications or experience <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> those required in the host Member State, the host State may require a compensatory measure -- either an aptitude test or an adaptation period under supervised practice which addresses the shortfall. Therefore, such qualifications are examined on a case by case basis to ensure that the person concerned is appropriately qualified to teach in Irish schools. This is in line with normal practice under the EU Directive. While the Teaching Council is familiar with the majority of teacher training programmes provided in Northern Ireland, there are some instances where the matter has to be referred to an assessor for further examination. In addition, there is a large volume of applications for recognition of qualifications gained in other jurisdictions, and this may sometimes lead to delay.</P>
        <P>Primary teachers trained in another jurisdiction, whose qualifications have been recognised by the Teaching Council, but who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification are granted provisional recognition to teach in national schools, but are required to gain competency to teach Irish within a 5 year period. In order to satisfy the Irish language requirement such teachers must pass an Irish language examination (Scr&uacute;d&uacute; C&aacute;il&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge) before being granted full recognition.</P>

	<P>In 1998, the George Mitchell Scholarship Programme was established and the Government agreed to contribute an endowment of IR&pound;2 million to the Programme. The purpose of the Programme is to enable highly qualified American students to attend third level institutions in Ireland for post graduate studies.</P>
        <P>The George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Act was enacted in December 1998 and it   empowered the Minister for Education and Science to establish the Fund in the United States and to enter into agreement with persons to manage and con<Col N="2190"/>trol the Fund.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 458 and 459 together.</P>
        <P>The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority &mdash; i.e. the local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.</P>
        <P>If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
        <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.</P>
        <P>Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>

	<P>An application for capital funding towards the provision of an extension at the school referred to by the Deputy has been assessed and the long term projected enrolments has been determined.  In order to determine how best to provide for the school&rsquo;s future accommodation needs, a technical assessment of the existing school buildings will have to be carried out in order to finalise the schedules of accommodation. The building project required to meet the school&rsquo;s accommodation needs will be considered in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, a new <Col N="2195"/>general allocation system was introduced in May 2005, under which schools have been provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. </P>
        <P>The general allocation system means that rather than schools having to make individual applications to this Department for resources for such pupils, resources are provided in advance to the school. The school attended by the pupil referred to by the Deputy has been allocated 0.9 teaching posts (22.5 hours) to provide for the educational needs of the pupils with high incidence special needs and learning support needs.</P>
        <P>The board of management may decide how these hours are divided among the pupils in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some pupils with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource/learning support teachers to work with pupils in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the pupils then have to catch up on work done by the rest of the class in their absence.</P>
        <P>My Department issued a comprehensive circular, SP ED 02/05 to schools which provides guidelines on the manner in which they should use the resources that have been allocated to them to best effect.  As the pupil in question has been diagnosed with dyslexia her special educational needs should be catered for within the general allocation granted to the school.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The assessment of means under <Col N="2196"/>my Department's third level student support schemes is based on gross income from all sources of the candidate and his/her parents/guardians, where applicable, with certain social welfare and health service executive payments being exempt.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Clause 13 of the Higher Education Grant Scheme deals with the declaration of income and other information. The clause includes the following: &ldquo;A declaration of reckonable income shall be made by the candidate and the candidate&rsquo;s parents or guardians or, in the case of an independent mature candidate, by the candidate and the candidate&rsquo;s spouse, if applicable, and they shall submit to the Local Authority such information and documentation as may be required by it to process the application in full. It will be the responsibility of candidates to ensure that the statement of income and other details sought is full and complete in every respect. If a candidate&rsquo;s failure to provide this full and complete information be the result of a deliberate material omission or inaccuracy, the candidate(s) shall be liable to prosecution, loss of grant and repayment, with interest, of any portion of a grant already received.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>It is necessary, therefore, that information regarding all income, including that from after school/weekend employment, is accounted for when completing the grant application form. However, in the assessment of means allowance is made for &ldquo;holiday earnings&rdquo; on the part of the candidate. Under the terms of the Schemes holiday earnings are considered as a candidate&rsquo;s reasonable earnings from employment outside of term time. At present holiday earnings of up to &euro;3,810 are regarded as reasonable and are, accordingly, excluded in the calculation of reckonable income for grant purposes.</P>

	<P>The Fund for Students with Disabilities has witnessed exponential growth over the last few academic years. The Fund continues to grow by approximately 20% per annum. Between 2003-4 and 2006-7 there has been an increase of 63% in the number of applications. Most categories of disabilities are increasing as the volume increases year on year, however, applications from people with specific learning difficulties (SLD) / dyslexia have increased by 116% between 2003-4 and 2006-7. Applications from students with dyslexia continually account for 50-55% of all applications to the Fund each year. In 2006-7 over 2,400 students were approved for funding. </P>
        <P>The Fund is co-financed by the government and the European Social Fund. Applications to the Fund are made to the National Access Office (NAO) by the institution on the student&rsquo;s behalf. The funding approved would be paid directly to the institution, who would use the funding to put in place the supports approved for each student. Institutions are required to complete financial returns in relation to the expenditure on the Fund for each academic year.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of each academic year applications which were approved in previous years are automatically renewed (renewal applications) by the NAO. Payment of these applications is followed up shortly afterwards. This ensures that each institution has a certain level of funding available at the beginning of the academic year while first-time applications that have been submitted can be assessed by the NAO.</P>

	<P>I would refer the House to my reply to Question No. 300 of 21 November 2007.</P>
        <P>The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) is a second &mdash; chance education initiative, which is funded by my Department, for unemployed persons who are at least 21 years of age and in receipt of certain social welfare payments for at least six months. It is operated through the Vocational Education Comitttees. The aim of the Scheme is to give unemployed people education and training opportunities which will develop and prepare them to go into paid employment, or on to further education opportunities leading to paid employment.</P>
        <P>A training allowance is paid by the VECs to students who previously drew unemployment benefit or assistance. The student ceases to receive an unemployment payment and, instead, <Col N="2199"/>receives a VTOS training allowance at a rate equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit, plus a payment for an adult or child dependant, if appropriate. VTOS students also retain their social welfare secondary benefits.</P>
        <P>The allowances for VTOS students for meals and travel referred to in the question are equivalent to these paid to participants on F&Aacute;S training courses. VTOS students are entitled to a meal allowance of &euro;0.80 per day. They may be entitled to a travel allowance if they reside more than 3 miles from a centre. This weekly allowance ranges from &euro;4.60 for a distance of 3 to 5 miles to &euro;32.60 for a distance of 40 to 50 miles from a centre. These allowances are increased periodically in line with increases in F&Aacute;S rates. The current rates are in operation since 2002. An increase in the F&Aacute;S rates will be necessary before VTOS rates can be increased.</P>

	<P>There are 33 vocational education committees (VECs) established under the Vocational Education Acts, 1930 to 2001.  Each VEC is a statutory body with its own corporate status.  The functions and responsibilities of the VECs, including their requirements to report to the Minister for Education and Science, are defined in the governing legislation.</P>
        <P>VECs provide a broad range of educational services.  In addition to providing post-primary education, further and adult education, they also have responsibilities in areas such as community education, training for early school leavers, basic literacy courses, traveller education and the provision of youth services.  My Department provides the majority of the funding required by VECs for the delivery of these programmes.</P>
        <P>Under statutory provisions VECs are responsible for the recruitment, appointment and the payment of individual teacher salaries up to the allocation limit as outlined to the VEC by my Department. The type of contract offered to individual teachers whether full time or part time is also a matter for the individual VEC.</P>
        <P>In the school year 2006/07 a total of 8,548 whole time equivalent teaching posts were allocated to VECs and funding is made available to VECs to pay this number of teachers.</P>
        <P>Statistical returns from VECs indicate that teachers employed by VECs are approximately 62% female and 38% male. A summary of these returns is published in the annual statistical report of my Department.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Department is aware of the current and planned housing developments for the area to which the Deputy refers and that additional accommodation will be required at the school in question to cater for a consequential increase in enrolments.  As the Deputy will know, <Col N="2201"/>all applications for large scale capital funding are assessed against published prioritisation criteria and assigned a Band rating.  Progress on individual projects is then considered in the context of the multi-Annual School Building and Modernisation Programme consistent with the assigned Band rating.  This is the case for the project in question.</P>
        <P>The new National Development Plan (NDP) includes funding of &euro;4.5 billion for investment in school building infrastructure.  This will be the largest investment programme in schools in the history of the State and it will enable the Department to ensure that school places are available where needed as well as continuing to upgrade existing school facilities. This investment will allow the Department to continue the acceleration of the school building programme which commenced during the lifetime of the last NDP when well over &euro;2.6 billion was invested on school development, delivering over 7,800 projects.</P>

        <Quest> her views on the fact that a person who wishes to begin primary teacher training upon completion of secondary school has no option available to them here but to attend a Catholic or Church of Ireland training college; if this violates the rights of teachers not of these faiths; her plans to establish non-denominational primary teacher training colleges; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, Mary Immaculate College, Froebel College and Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino were established as denominational training colleges. However, they each now have links with third level colleges (DCU, UL and TCD respectively) and accept students of all faiths and none. Religious affiliation is not used by any of the Catholic Colleges of Education as an entry requirement. </P>
        <P>The Church of Ireland College of Education, Rathmines, was established to provide an adequate supply of primary teachers capable of upholding and maintaining the distinctive ethos and spirit of Protestant national schools. Appropriate numbers of places on the B. Ed. Degree programme are reserved for students who are members of recognised Churches in the Protestant tradition.  Remaining available places are made available to other candidates.</P>
        <P>Hibernia College is now a major provider of primary teacher training and has no religious affiliation.</P>
        <P>The Department has no intention of establishing a new teacher training college. However, following a request from Educate Together, a working group was formed earlier this year to <Col N="2202"/>explore the issue of teacher education in the context of the greater plurality of school patronage that now exists. The Department, the Colleges and Educate Together are members of the group.</P>
        <P>It has emerged in the work of the group that the content of primary teacher education is inclusive and broad and teaches recognition and respect for all faiths and backgrounds and the valuing of diversity. The &lsquo;Learn Together&rsquo; ethical education curriculum provided in Educate Together schools is also frequently specifically addressed. The focus of the religious education modules is largely on methodology to enable teachers to teach this area of the curriculum confidently and competently.</P>
        <P>Separate to the above, Colleges may also offer undergraduates an optional &lsquo;Certificate in Religious Studies&rsquo; particular to the denominational nature of the particular college. The working group continues to examine this issue.</P>

	<P>The request for recognition to which the Deputy refers is associated with an application from the organisation in question for inclusion in the Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) pilot scheme which is funded by my Department. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children including those with special needs can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes (IEPs), fully qualified professional teachers who have received <Col N="2203"/>additional training in autism, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of methods so their broader needs can be met.</P>
        <P>In excess of 275 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level by my Department in conjunction with National Council Special Education (NCSE), while more are being set up as required. At primary level there are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants. Extra assistants are provided where the children need them on a case by case basis.</P>
        <P>The scheme referred to by the Deputy was established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools. She will be aware that the Programme for Government commits to the long-term funding for the centres that are currently in the ABA pilot scheme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable the Department to support them as primary schools for children with autism. I am pleased to advise that the issue is being actively progressed.</P>
        <P>In terms of autism provision in other locations, we will continue to work to ensure that all children can have access to a broad programme, with provision for ABA as appropriate, in special classes.</P>

	<P>Energy saving lighting (using passive infra red fittings) has been installed in my Department&rsquo;s Athlone offices. The OPW are to investigate the suitability of using these fittings in the Dublin and Tullamore offices. Long life CFL lamps (energy efficient lighting) are used throughout my Department&rsquo;s offices where light fittings are suitable.  In addition my Department has recently re-tendered for the provision of an expanded recycling service covering the confidential destruction and recycling of office waste paper, newspaper, cardboard, glass bottles, aluminium cans, plastics, wood and electrical items in respect of my Athlone, Dublin and Tullamore offices.  All Regional, NEPS and Inspectors&rsquo; Offices have local arrangements in place for the <Col N="2205"/>recycling of paper, etc. The amounts here are not substantial and would be uneconomical to include in my Department&rsquo;s recycling contract.</P>
        <P>My Department is reviewing renewable options for energy generation in schools through a number of research projects including, Tory wind turbine project, Interreg solar hot water heating projects and Biomass wood pellet / wood chip boiler and solar projects. The Tory Island project involves the supply and installation of two wind turbines to provide electrical energy to serve the existing community facility and Vocational School situated on Tory Island.</P>
        <P>My Department would encourage schools to consider the use of wind generated electricity which is available nationally through the National Grid. This in effect allows the school to benefit from the environmental and lower cost benefits of wind generated electricity without being exposed to operating and maintenance issues and reliability of supply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With respect to energy programmes that would complement environmental work currently taking place under the green flags initiative for the past nine years the Planning and Building Unit within my Department have been using a process called the DART approach (Design, Awareness, Research, and Technology) to develop sustainable and energy efficiency in educational buildings. The policy is driven by technical guidance documents, informed by building unit professional and technical staff, external partnerships and updated by continued energy research and development.</P>
        <P>Rather than develop a unique focus on energy design my Department has taken a more holistic approach and have developed their technical guidance on energy efficiency in school designs as an integral part of the suite of technical guidance documents. These guidelines encourage the design team to take a complete design team approach from project conception.</P>
        <P>The incorporation of low energy design has been done on a hybrid basis by maximising natural resources and utilising technologies. This involves focusing on areas such as natural ventilation, passive solar design, day lighting and reducing infiltration, enhanced insulation, lighting and heating controls and water efficiency.</P>
        <P>The focus to date on sustainability in schools has been to reduce the energy demand in schools. This has proven quite successful with modern day schools typically using three times less energy than schools built ten years ago and also using less than half the energy than what is termed as good international practice for schools.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, a new general allocation system was introduced in May 2005, under which schools have been provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. </P><Col N="2207"/>
        <P>The general allocation system means that rather than schools having to make individual applications to this Department for resources for such pupils, resources are provided in advance to the school. The school referred to by the Deputy has been allocated 2.8 teaching posts (2 full posts and 20 hours) to provide for the educational needs of the pupils with high incidence special needs including dyslexia.</P>
        <P>The board of management may decide how these hours are divided among the pupils in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some pupils with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource/learning support teachers to work with pupils in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the pupils then have to catch up on work done by the rest of the class in their absence.</P>
        <P>My Department issued a comprehensive circular, SP ED 02/05 to schools which provides guidelines on the manner in which they should use the resources that have been allocated to them to best effect.</P>

	<P>The revised primary curriculum was launched in 1999 after extensive consultation with the partners in education. </P>
        <P>Page 27 in the Introduction to the Curriculum states &ldquo;It is a particular feature of Irish primary education that children, from the beginning of schooling, have experience of language learning in two languages.&rdquo;  It also sets out a suggested minimum weekly time framework for tuition. This provides that where a first language is being taught, there should be four hours instruction per week, and 3 hours per week where there is a shorter day for the infant classes. Where a second language is being taught, the suggested minimum timeframe is 3.5 hours per week, and 2.5 hours per week for infant classes with a shorter day.</P>
        <P>Some time ago my Department sought the advice of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on issues relating to emergent literacy in Irish medium schools. The NCCA produced a series of reports on the matter, including a consultation paper, a literature review of research, and a report on the consultation process. The Council presented its final advice in February 2007.</P>
        <P>Having considered the advice in full, I have determined as a public policy issue that the position as set out in the curriculum, and in previous Parliamentary Questions, should remain unchanged i.e that the minimum recommended timeframe set out for a second language in the curriculum should be adhered to. Accordingly, Circular 0044/2007 requires that Irish medium schools should provide for a minimum provision in English of 3.30 hours per week, or 2.5 hours per week where there is a shorter day for infant classes, no later than the start of the second term in Junior infants.</P><Col N="2209"/>
        <P>I met the National Parents&rsquo; Council and a range of Irish language organisations to discuss the matter, and my officials met the Chief Executive of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.

This investment will allow the Department to continue the acceleration of the school building programme which commenced during the lifetime of the last NDP when well over &euro;2.6 billion was <Col N="2210"/>invested on school development, delivering over 7,800 projects.</P>

	<P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses to enrol a student; suspends a student for a cumulative total of more than twenty days in an academic year; or expels a student from the school.  In the year up to 19 September 2007, the number of appeals under S29 of the Act against expulsions is 44 in post Primary Schools and 2 in Primary schools. however,not all students who are excluded by way of expulsion resort to section 29 of the act.</P>
        <P>Many children who are excluded from school benefit from the Home Tuition Scheme which provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.  A total of 628 children have been sanctioned for Home Tuition in the 2007/08 school year.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single statutory body with responsibility for school attendance.  The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P>My Department has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling the issue school attendance. We established the National Educational Welfare Board to monitor attendance and help to get young people back to school.  The Board runs promotional campaigns on the importance of attendance and finishing school and provides a service locally through its Education Welfare Officers to parents, children and schools.</P>
        <P>In addition to the NEWB there are some 620 staff, within the education sector, deployed in <Col N="2212"/>education disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion which provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) are preventative measures designed to combat issues of poor attendance and early school leaving.  Children at risk of early school leaving are targeted under the School Completion Programme for a variety of extra supports aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. The supports cover both educational and non-educational interventions and are provided during and outside of school time. The Home School Community Liaison Scheme works to involve parents in their children&rsquo;s education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education. Consequently work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration and to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed.</P>
        <P>This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that funding to the Board for 2007 amounted to &euro;9.808 million.  This represents an increase of 20% on the 2006 allocation and of 50% on the 2004 level.  This substantial increase in funding is a clear indication of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk.  Through increased investment and improved services we are determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.</P>
        <P>I will be keeping the issue of resources for the NEWB under review in light of the rollout of services, the scope for integrated working and any proposals that the Board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs.</P>

	<P>The teacher referred to by the Deputy is currently on secondment approved by her Board of Management.  The scheme of secondment is designed to facilitate the temporary release of a permanent teacher from his/her teaching post and the procedures for secondment arrangements are set out in Department Circular 11/02.</P><Col N="2213"/>
        <P>Under these arrangements a Board of Management, in framing a policy position on secondments is required to ensure that the welfare and educational needs of pupils take precedence over all considerations.  The Board of Management must ensure a fully qualified temporary replacement teacher can be obtained to replace the teacher on secondment and retains the right to terminate the secondment should it encounter difficulties in filling the vacant teaching post.  The replacement teacher will be paid on my Department&rsquo;s payroll as outlined in Primary Circular 0032/2007.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has indicated in the details supplied that the qualified applicant for the post of replacement teacher is on career break. If this is the situation I would like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to Primary Circular 10/03, Career Breaks for Primary Teachers. Section 8.1 of this circular states, &ldquo;a teacher on career break should not normally engage in any type of primary teaching. In exceptional circumstances, however, a teacher on career break may be employed in a short term temporary, substitute or part time capacity.  It should be noted that teachers on career break who take up a teaching post in a temporary capacity are paid at the unqualified rate of pay&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is of course open to any teacher on career break to resign his/her post to take up another teaching position.</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />All ATCP (Aid to the Civil Power) and ACA (Aid to the Civil Authority) requests were met.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />We continued to meet Ireland&rsquo;s international commitments with a total of 828 Defence Forces personnel serving overseas at 31 December 2006.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Major equipment purchased during 2006 included the first two medium-lift AW139 helicopters for the Air Corps (a further two are due for delivery this year). In December, an option in the contract to purchase an additional two AW139&rsquo;s (bringing the total to 6) was exercised.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A major inter-agency emergency response exercise was conducted in the Curragh in November.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Work on the National Emergency Coordination Centre was practically completed and a contract was placed for a robust communications system.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Work commenced in preparing for an Information and Public Awareness Campaign on Emergency Planning.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />As part of the commemoration of the 90th Anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising, the traditional Easter Military Parade recommenced. Both the parade and other associated commemorative events generated great public approval and support.</P>
<P el="5" FLI="0">Later in the year, a ceremony was held to mark the 90th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The legislative changes necessary to enable participation by the Defence Forces in EU Battlegroups were enacted.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A Bill to amend the Defence Act (Part V) was published in December. This part of the Act provides for disciplinary procedures under military law and needed to be brought in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Office of the Defence Forces Ombudsman was established during the year.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force continued during the year in accordance with the Implementation Plan approved by me in late 2005.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />During 2006, I took two significant initiatives towards improving female participation in the Defence Forces.  I reduced the <Col N="2216"/>minimum height requirement and I initiated research in the area of attracting more women to enlist in the Defence Forces.  The report of this research was published in April 2007. This will contribute to the formulation of policy and practice in this area for the future.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the construction of a scheme which would allow asylum seekers, many of whom have skills which could be put to good use in the labour force here, to work while they are awaiting residency visas. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not proposed to allow asylum applicants to take up paid employment pending a final decision being made on their applications.</P>
        <P>Section 9(4)(b) of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) provides that an applicant for asylum shall not seek or enter employment.  It must also be borne in mind that under the 1996 Act asylum seekers only have temporary permission to remain in the State pending the determination of their applications.  However, we must face the fact that, despite its humanitarian purpose, people seek protection under the 1996 Act (which gives effect to the State&rsquo;s obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention) for the purpose of avoiding legitimate immigration controls in order to gain a foothold in the State for economic reasons.  Similar trends have been experienced by other EU States.</P>
        <P>I believe that extending the right to work would have a very negative impact on the number of asylum applications, as was experienced in the aftermath of the July 1999 decision to do so.  The immediate effect of that measure was a threefold increase in the average number of applications per month leading to a figure of 1,217 applications in December 1999 compared with an average of 364 per month for the period January to July 1999.</P>
        <P>Any proposal to grant asylum seekers access to the labour market would also undermine the current and effective work permit system which provides a comprehensive channel for legal migration to the State. It would further widen the gap in a negative manner in terms of reward  between those who access the labour market legally through the work permit and visa channels and those who simply abuse the asylum process to gain entry.</P>
        <P>It is a well established fact that those engaged in trafficking and those seeking to access the labour market without going through the appropriate legal channels are very quick to identify any perceived attractiveness of a country as a preferred or easily accessed destination.  It is clear from the profile of applicants, and the results of <Col N="2221"/>the determination process, that a significant number of people have sought asylum in Ireland with a view to seeking work.  Many people are already working illegally.  It is my very strong belief that any extension of the right to work along the lines proposed by the Deputy would be portrayed abroad by people traffickers to potential victims as a guarantee of a right to work.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> if he will introduce a scheme to require prisoners to contribute to the cost of their imprisonment if they can afford to do so; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no plans to implement any mechanism whereby prisoners would be expected to contribute to the overall cost of their imprisonment.</P>
        <P>Access to certain services in prison are currently provided without charge and it is not intended to begin charging for these services.  For example no charge is currently made for the making of a certain amount of phone calls.  Prisoners are currently entitled to a daily phone call including calls to their legal advisor, and this will continue to be the position.</P>
        <P>However, section 37 of the Prisons Act, 2007 provides a statutory basis for a number of provisions in the Prison Rules, 2007 which allow a Prison Governor to charge for access to certain services over and above the standard provision to all prisoners, such as use of the videolink, telephone calls and access to materials relating to current affairs (e.g. newspapers, magazines etc.) not related to their imprisonment.  The Act also <Col N="2234"/>allows for the provision of charges to be made to prisoners for goods or services that are not generally available or on an unlimited basis.  This includes access to electronic devices, private medical treatment or escorts provided outside the prison for matters not related to their imprisonment.</P>
        <P>Prisoners are provided with access to healthcare services on an equivalent basis to citizens in the general community who are covered by the GMS (Medical Card) service.  Section 37 of the Prisons Act, 2007 allows for the Prison Rules to provide,  where it is deemed necessary (on the basis of non-convicted status) to facilitate a prisoner with access to elective health care outside the public system,  that the prisoner will be responsible for the costs associated with facilitating such provision.  Provision of necessary healthcare to all prisoners on an equivalent basis to that provided under the public health system will continue to be funded by the State.</P>
        <P>In addition to the escorts costs that would arise in the facilitation of access to elective healthcare outside the public system, prisoners are charged for escorts outside of their place of detention in relation to civil proceedings against third parties.  It is not proposed to charge for escorts where the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or an individual governor is listed as a defendant or co-defendant in such proceedings.  It is also not proposed to charge prisoners for appointments <Col N="2235"/>relating to any matters before the Residential Institutions Redress Board.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 22 September, 2003 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, he was informed by letter dated 19 September, 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a <Col N="2237"/>deportation order. Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>This person&rsquo;s case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement), as amended.  I expect the file to be passed to me for decision in due course.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 527 and 560 together.</P>
        <P>For obvious reasons I cannot comment on specific security measures.  Close co-operation is maintained with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in respect of combating the threat from all paramilitary groups.  Appropriate assistance is being provided in relation to the recent shootings of two PSNI officers currently under investigation in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>In relation to the murder in County Monaghan referred to in both Questions, I share the abhorrence with which all right-minded people will regard this vicious crime.  The very intensive investigation into this incident is active and ongoing and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is receiving full co-operation and assistance from the authorities in Northern Ireland in this regard.  A Family Liaison Officer has been appointed to liaise with the family of the victim, to ensure that they are kept fully informed of developments.</P>
        <P>Enquiries are being conducted at local level on both sides of the border and information is being exchanged on a Police-to-Police basis through established procedures.  Garda management is satisfied that sufficient resources are allocated to the investigation.  The Garda&iacute;, in co-operation with the PSNI, will continue to pursue the perpetrators of this crime with the utmost vigour.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no routine recording of foreign nationals on their entering or exiting the State.  There is, however, the facility for an immigration officer to record the arrival of a person and the question of whether or not to record an arrival is decided on a case by case basis.  All non-EEA nationals over 16 years of age, if they are staying in the State in excess of 3 months, must register their presence with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>
        <P>With regard to integration, the Deputy will be aware that  Mr. Conor Lenihan, T.D, was appointed Minister of State at the Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform (with special responsibility for Integration Policy).  Minister Lenihan has established the Office of the Minister for Integration and has a cross Departmental mandate to develop, drive and co-ordinate integration policy across other Government Departments, agencies and services.  In this context, the Minister will have a close relationship with Ministers and policy makers in other Departments.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be involved in the development of a long-term national policy on integration which will be informed by widespread consultation at a national level, properly structured objective research and international experience and best practice. The Minister intends to establish a Task Force on Integration in early 2008 to identify key issues affecting immigrant communities; consult widely with immigrants and Irish people; visit communities; examine previous research and report back with recommendations.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Minister for Integration will also be involved in setting up new funding lines, that will build on existing initiatives, to address integration priorities; developing &ldquo;principles&rdquo; of integration; bringing all stakeholders together to co-ordinate integration activities and helping all parties (Government Departments, service providers, local communities/local authorities/trade unions/religious groups etc.) to play their part in building an integrated Irish society.</P>

	<P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to instances of temporary release pursuant to section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960 as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.  Periods of temporary release may be granted during a prisoner&rsquo;s sentence for health or other humanitarian grounds (e.g. a funeral), to assist the Garda&iacute;, to assess a person&rsquo;s ability to reintegrate into society or to prepare a prisoner for release. The overriding issue in considering any application for temporary release of a prisoner is the safety of the public.  In addition, all releases are subject to conditions.    Any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>A prisoner may receive multiple instances of temporary release while serving his or her sentence and most prisoners will receive a short period of temporary release at the end of their sentence to facilitate their reintegration into society.  The compilation of statistics in the form requested by the Deputy would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and expense to prepare and could not be justified in the current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</P>

	<P>The granting of sentence remission is a feature of many prison systems worldwide and has been a feature of the Irish criminal justice system since the foundation of the State. Prisoners sentenced to imprisonment (other than the categories listed below) are entitled by law to remission of one quarter of sen<Col N="2241"/>tence provided they are of good behaviour during their time in custody.</P>
        <P>There are a number of categories of prisoner who are excluded from standard remission of sentence under the Prison Rules and these are as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Life sentence prisoners</P>

        <P>Finglas and Cabra Garda Stations are part of the Blanchardstown District.  The total personnel strength of the Blanchardstown District as of 31 October 2007 was 331.</P>
        <P>Garda personnel assigned throughout the Country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.

        <P>The Garda Commissioner has also informed me that local Garda Management has discretion to allocate members to patrols as local policing needs arise.  Garda&iacute; employed on bicycle patrol are engaged in routine patrols in residential and business areas in the Division to prevent and detect crime, anti-social behaviour and to address public order and traffic problems.  Community Garda&iacute; also use mountain bikes to patrol on their community beat.  Members on mountain bike patrols perform duties as directed by their supervisors which include active patrolling of public-order hot-spots, the detection of crime and other offences, including the prevention of anti-social activity.  Members on these duties may also be employed on duties at venues or sporting events which are likely to attract large numbers of members of the public.</P>

	<P>The person concerned and her daughter arrived in the State on 17 May 1998 and claimed asylum.  Their application was refused following consideration of their case by the Asylum Division and, on appeal, by the Asylum Appeals Unit.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was informed by letter dated 15 August 2000 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her and afforded her three options in accordance with Section 3 (3) (b) (ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.</P>
        <P>Her case was examined under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations submitted on her behalf for permission to remain temporarily in the State.  On 24 May 2001 the then Minister refused permission to remain temporarily in <Col N="2248"/>the State and instead signed Deportation Orders in respect of the person concerned and her daughter.  A notice of these Orders dated 8 June 2001 was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present herself and her daughter at Mill Street Garda Station, Mill Street, Galway on Friday 15 June 2001, in order to make travel arrangements for their deportation from the State.  She failed to present herself and her daughter as required and they were classified as evading their deportation.</P>
        <P>Subsequently the person concerned took Judicial Review proceedings challenging the decision of the then Minister to deport her. The basis for the review was that the details of the daughter of the person concerned were not included in the notice of intention to deport letter dated 15 August 2000.  The case was settled on 23 October 2001 and the terms of the settlement were complied with. The outcome of the settlement was that the deportation orders made in respect of the person concerned and her daughter were revoked by the then Minister and Revocation Orders were signed by him on 26 February 2002.  In addition the Minister exercised his option to serve a new notice of intention to deport letter dated 28 February 2002 on the person concerned and her daughter.  Said notice was served by registered post.</P>
        <P>A supplementary application for temporary leave to remain in the State was made by the Refugee Legal Service on 25 February 2004 on behalf of the person concerned.  Subsequent to this application, consideration was again given to the person concerned under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, for permission to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>On 26 August 2004, my immediate predecessor refused permission to remain and instead signed Deportation Orders in respect of the person concerned and her daughter.  Notice of these Orders was served by registered post requiring her to present herself and her daughter to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, on Thursday 23 September, 2004, in order to make travel arrangements for their deportation from the State.  She failed to present herself and her daughter as required and they were classified as evading their deportation.  I would urge the person concerned to come forward and begin presenting herself, and her daughter, at the offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau without further delay.  The effect of the Deportation Orders is that the person concerned and her daughter must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the applications made on behalf of the person concerned and her daughter for asylum and for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport them is justified. <Col N="2249"/> The enforcement of the Deportation Orders remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> the action taken to date to implement the recommendations contained in the report of the Joint Committee on Child Protection published in November 2006; and the action he proposes to take during the next 12 months. </Quest>
        <QRef>[32427/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The recommendations contained in the Report of the Joint Committee on Child Protection cover a number of issues which are the responsibility of several Departments and Agencies. The Office of the Minister for Children (OMC) has overall responsibility to ensure that the recommendations are addressed.  A number of the recommendations contained in the Report fall within the remit of my Department, either completely or in part, and I have put in place a structure to ensure that those recommendations are addressed in a coordinated manner.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, in 2006 the Government published a Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill.  The trafficking provisions contained in that Bill have been extracted and are now provided for in the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill currently before this House.  I proceeded in this way in order to expedite the enactment of the trafficking provisions.  The trafficking provisions are in conformity with the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P>The provisions relating to the protection of children will be expanded to take account of the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations and other developments since the Bill was originally published.  It is intended to include these in a new Sexual Offences Bill which is currently being prepared in my Department.  Legislation arising from the recommendations for an amendment to the Constitution to permit the Oireachtas to enact laws providing for absolute or strict criminal liability in respect of offences against or in connection with children will be considered in the light of the outcome to any referendum.  Other recommendations requiring possible legislative changes are being studied by my officials.</P>
        <P>Work on the upgrade of the video link system in five courtrooms in the Four Courts complex has been completed.  It is now policy to install video conferencing/video link facilities in all larger new or refurbished courthouses.  Work is also progressing on the installation of video viewing equipment in nominated courtrooms.</P>
        <P>The Courts Service is also working on a number of initiatives which will assist in the tak<Col N="2250"/>ing of evidence and the efficient running of court proceedings, including those involving children.  Digital audio recording (DAR) will be implemented nationwide.</P>
        <P>Childcare cases are taking an increased amount of time in District Courts throughout the country and in Dublin in particular.  Their number and complexity is continuing to increase.  In order to address this, the Courts Service has been working with my Department, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Department of Finance to provide a number of additional Judges to deal specifically with childcare cases.  These judges would be able to devote the time to working with all the parties involved, including childcare professionals and families to achieve solutions in the best interests of the children involved.</P>
        <P>Records relating to persons subject to the provisions of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 are recorded on a database kept by the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  This system has previously been upgraded.  The Garda authorities are currently carrying out work to integrate the system for recording persons subject to the requirements of the Act into the PULSE system.  This work is scheduled for completion in 2008.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Evidence Act, 1992 provides for the recording of a statement made by a person under 14 years of age (in respect of whom a sexual offence and/or an offence involving violence is alleged to have been committed) during an interview with a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or any other person who is competent for the purpose.  It provides that such a recording shall be admissible at a trial as evidence.</P>
        <P>Work on setting up these facilities in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health Service Executive and the Office of Public Works with a view to having the provision commenced is at an advanced stage.  A number of Garda&iacute; and HSE social workers have undergone training in the specialist interviewing skills necessary for interviewing such victims.</P>
        <P>The Children Act 2001 came fully into operation on 1 March, 2007.  The Courts are now in a position to consider disposal of cases by a range of community sanctions.  Recommendations to the Court by Probation Service Officers, trained in assessing risk posed by young offenders, including those convicted of sexual offences, include age appropriate options.  The introduction of the Harris risk assessment instrument to complement ongoing risk assessment and risk management has been pledged by the Probation Service.</P>
        <P>The Service keeps the interest of victims to the fore in all its work with offenders.  Assessment of risk of re-offending, ongoing risk assessment in the community together with preparation of Victim Impact Reports are all carried out by officers trained in ensuring sensitivity to the victim.</P><Col N="2251"/>
        <P>The Probation Service has recently restructured its service delivery to prisons and formed one region &ldquo;Prisoners, Risk and Resettlement&rdquo; [comprising 48 staff].  The staff of this region provide dedicated services to twelve prisons as well as a dedicated High Risk Offender Team.  This team will be developing a &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; model for the Service&rsquo;s interventions with sex offenders.</P>
        <P>In keeping with international best practice in this area, the programme is a structured, offence focused programme, employing a cognitive behavioural approach with a relapse prevention component.  The Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service continually review their processes to determine what measures may be taken to increase the number of offenders participating on the programme.  My Department and the relevant agencies are continuing our examination of how the treatment and supervision of sex offenders can be enhanced and in that context the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Child Protection are under consideration.</P>
        <P>Protocols are in place within the Probation Service to ensure effective data and risk management to fulfil its statutory responsibilities under the Sex Offenders Act 2001.  These include obligations on Probation teams to notify the HSE of sex offenders who are due to be released from custody.</P>
        <P>I should also advise the Deputy, that the Probation Service are working with the Probation Board for Northern Ireland to develop an assessment instrument specifically applicable to sex offending.  The introduction of an All Ireland Risk Assessment Psychometric Instrument will facilitate an enhanced quality of assessment and associated post release intervention.  This instrument will also form the basis for community based risk management.</P>
        <P>In addition, community based intervention programmes are currently operated by the Probation Service in conjunction with the Granada Institute under the Lighthouse project.  These group based programmes operate in Dublin and target those who have been convicted of sexual offences against children.</P>
        <P>The Commission for the Support of the Victims of Crime was established with a remit to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future and to disburse funding for victim support measures.  In the context of devising that framework, I have been informed by the Commission that they would welcome any further study of victim responses to the criminal justice system and of the means that might be available to alleviate any unnecessary hardship caused to victims by the operation of the criminal justice trial process, as recommended by the Committee.</P>
        <P>In general. implementation of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations, relevant to my Department <Col N="2252"/>and associated agencies, is the subject of ongoing consideration by my officials.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the issue of residential ground rents.  The law already provides a statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple in dwellinghouses which is set out in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978.  Part III of that Act provides a special procedure, operated by the Property Registration Authority, whereby a person may acquire the fee simple in their dwellinghouse. </P>
        <P>A legal challenge to the constitutionality of certain provisions of existing ground rents legislation was heard in the High Court during 2005.  While the Court&rsquo;s judgment upholding the constitutionality of the legislation was delivered in early 2006, it has since been appealed to the Supreme Court.  Operation of the law in relation to ground rents continues to be reviewed in my Department. However there are no proposals for changes pending the outcome of the appeal that I have mentioned.</P>

She continued to reside in the State without permission for a period of some seventeen years.  On 31 July, 2007, she was notified in writing that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her because she was unlawfully present in the State.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order.  Representations were received on her behalf.  </P>

Permission to remain in the State under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended is temporary and the duration of that leave is entirely at the discretion of the Minister.</P>

	<P>Under section 17(3) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, it is an offence for a licensee, with intent to evade the conditions of the licence, to take intoxicating liquor from the licensed premises for the purpose of its being sold on the account, or for the benefit or profit, of the licensee, or to permit any other person to do so.  The penalty on conviction is a fine of up to &euro;1,500 for a first offence and up to &euro;2,000 for a second or subsequent offence.  Concerns in relation to specific premises should be brought to the attention of the Garda&iacute;.  Moreover, section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (as amended by the Intoxicating Liquor Acts of 2000 and 2003) provides for offences relating to the sale and delivery of intoxicating liquor to persons under the age of 18 years.  </P>
        <P>It is an offence under section 31(2) for a licensee to sell or deliver, or permit any other person to sell or deliver, intoxicating liquor to any person for consumption off his or her licensed premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person&rsquo;s parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission.</P>
        <P>The penalty on conviction for this offence is a fine of up to &euro;1,270 for a first offence and up to &euro;1,904 for a second or subsequent offence.  In addition, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 provides for the mandatory temporary closure of licensed premises in cases where a licensee is convicted of an offence under section 31 of the 1988 Act (up to 7 days for a first offence, or at least 7 and not more than 30 days for a second or subsequent offence).</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that on 9 November, 2007 nine incidents of criminal damage to cars in the area referred to by the Deputy were reported.  Two juveniles have been arrested in relation to the incident and an investigation file is being prepared for the direction of the Law Officers.  I am also informed that following a Garda investigation into a similar incident on 19 November, 2006 four persons were arrested and subsequently convicted.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that the personnel strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Central Division on 30 November, 2007 was 707.  The personnel strength of the Bridewell Garda Station on 30 November, 2007 was 185.  Two Community Garda&iacute; are specifically assigned to the area referred to.  This service is augmented by regular uniform and plain-clothes patrols, including the Detective Unit, the Divisional Task Force and the Divisional Drugs Unit.  Special operations are put in place when deemed necessary by Garda management.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel taking all aspects of policing into account.  Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.  The situation will be kept under review by the Commissioner and when additional personnel next becomes available the needs of the Bridewell Garda Station will be fully considered by him within the overall context of the needs of Garda Districts/Divisions throughout the country.</P>

        <P>The creation of the Unit is intended to facilitate a coordinated and effective approach in tackling the problem of human trafficking. The Executive Director will be a key member of the High Level Group being established to develop effective mechanisms and strategies to deal with the issue of human trafficking and to prevent such activity taking place in this jurisdiction.  The Executive Director, and the Unit, will also have a key role to play in finalising the National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking which is being prepared at present.  The Unit will, of course, work closely with both governmental and non-governmental organisations.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the CCTV system referred to in Parliamentary Question No. 597 of 27 November 2007 is one which is proposed to be developed under the Community-based CCTV Scheme, which is designed to support local communities who wish to install CCTV systems in their area in order to enhance public safety and reduce the risk of anti-social and criminal activity.</P>
        <P>The group involved applied under the Scheme and its proposal was evaluated by Pobal, which operates the scheme on behalf of my Department, and approved in the normal way.  The application was successful and I have announced the award of the grant to the group of &euro;200,000, which comprises &euro;100,000 from my Department and matching RAPID area funding of &euro;100,000 from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The grant will enable the group involved to progress the implementation of its proposed CCTV system.</P>
        <P>It is now a matter for the group to conclude contracts for the supply of the system, to establish a time frame and to proceed to implement its <Col N="2258"/>CCTV system.  The overarching aim of the scheme is to empower local groups, in partnership with the local authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to develop their own CCTV systems and have ownership of them.  As I have indicated previously to the Deputy, full details of the Community-based CCTV Scheme, which includes the approval process for award of the grants, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website (www.justice.ie) or from the Pobal website (www.pobal.ie).</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 568 and 604 together. </P>
<P>The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is designed to cater for the accommodation needs of persons in receipt of rent supplement who have a long-term housing need.  It is a collaborative project between my Department, local auth<Col N="2260"/>orities, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Health Service Executive. </P>
        <P>Good progress is being made in meeting the objectives set for the scheme by Government.  In particular, it is helping to bring about improvements in the quality and standards of rented accommodation, is enabling local authorities to provide greater social mix and tenant choice, and is helping to reduce dependency on rent supplement.</P>
        <P>My Department is constantly monitoring the implementation of RAS and has recently commenced a Value for Money and Policy Review to evaluate its operations in the light of the objectives set for it.  This review involves a formal evaluation of the scheme, including the financial arrangements under which it operates, and covers the period September 2005 (when the first transfer of cases took place) to the end of 2007.  It is planned that the review will be completed by March 2008.</P>
        <P>Following the completion of the review I will look again at the relevant eligibility and qualification criteria.  In this respect I should point out that local authorities have discretion in admitting tenants to the scheme who are less than eighteen months on Rent Supplement and have been assessed as having a long-term housing need.  In addition, certain homeless persons, who are capable of independent living and have a long-term housing need, are eligible for consideration under the scheme even if they have been less than eighteen months on rent supplement.</P>

        <P>The making and amending of rent schemes is the responsibility of local authorities as an integral part of their housing management functions subject to the following broad principles laid down by my Department: the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households; allowances should be made for dependent children including those under 21 years of age in full-time education; a contribution towards rent should be required from subsidiary earners in the household; provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship; and appropriate local factors should be taken into account including the costs of the maintenance and management of the stock of rented dwellings and the adequacy of the rental income to meet such costs.</P>
        <P>Decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual local authority and I have no function in such matters.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 573 and 574 together.  </P>
        <P>Under the Local Government Act 2001, responsibility for compliance with the ethics framework in local government rests with each councillor and relevant employee of a local authority.   The Act also gives the role of overseeing the operation of the framework to a person in each local authority, known as an Ethics Registrar, assigned for this purpose.   The duties of an Ethics Registrar include (a) reminding each councillor and relevant employee annually of their obligations in relation to annual declarations; (b) keeping a public register containing the particulars contained in the declarations provided by <Col N="2272"/>councillors and relevant employees; (c) drawing the attention of such persons to any minor errors or omissions in such declarations; (d) bringing the attention of the Cathaoirleach or the Manager of the Council to any possible contravention of the ethics framework with a view to considering what action should be taken.</P>
        <P>Under the Act, the public register, which is kept at the offices of the local authority, is available for public inspection and a copy of any entry in it can be obtained on request at a reasonable cost.</P>
        <P>The operation and effectiveness of the ethics framework in local government are being kept under review and consideration will be given to appropriate improvements that could be made to it in the context of the commitment in the Programme for Government relating to the reform of local government.</P>

	<P>Section 18 (1) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 enables a planning authority, at any time, to prepare a local area plan for any particular area within its functional area.</P>
        <P>Section 19 (1) (b) of the Act requires that a local area plan be made in respect of an area which: (i) is designated as a town in the most recent census of population, other than a town designated as a suburb or environs in that census; (ii) has a population in excess of 2000; and (iii) is situated within the functional area of a planning authority, which is a county council.</P>
        <P>As Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I am a statutory consultee in relation to local area plans since March 2007.  My Department is currently collecting and collating information on local area plans in place in each planning authority, including the definitive number in place countrywide.  The information requested will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> if his Department have sanctioned new waste water treatment systems for rural once off houses in the countryside where ground conditions are unsuitable for standard accepted septic tanks or raised percolation systems. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no function with regard to the approval of particular waste water treatment systems for individual houses in any ground conditions. The suitability or otherwise of any particular system in any particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local planning authority. </P>
        <P>With regard to general standards for waste water treatment systems, clear and comprehensive best practice guidance in regard to Groundwater Protection and the Planning System was issued to all planning authorities by my Department in July 2003.   The Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines for Planning Authorities, which issued in April 2005, emphasised the need for adherence to best practice in order to protect water quality. These guidelines were issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 which requires planning authorities to have regard to such guidelines in the performance of their functions.</P>
        <P>Septic tanks installed on or after 1 June 1992 must comply with Part H of the Building Regulations which requires septic tanks to be so sited and constructed that they do not pollute, so as to endanger public health, any water (including groundwater) which is used as a source of supply for human consumption.  The related Technical Guidance Document H provides guidance on how to comply with Part H.  Guidance on septic tank drainage systems for single houses is contained in Irish Standard Recommendations S.R. <Col N="2277"/>6: 1991 for Domestic Effluent Treatment and Disposal from Single Dwellings issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).  For septic tanks serving groups of houses, British Standard B.S. 6297: 1983, a Code of Practice for the Design and Installation of Small Sewage Treatment Works, issued by the British Standards Institute applies.</P>
        <P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently developing a comprehensive Code of Practice on Waste Water Treatment Systems for Single Houses.  The EPA intends to publish the Code of Practice under section 76 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and this code will then be cited in the Annex to Technical Guidance Document H of the Building Regulations which is to be revised next year.</P>

	<P>While appropriate statutory protection by way of a preservation order has been extended to the buildings in question under the National Monuments Act, 1930, as amended, day-to-day protection and upkeep are primarily the responsibility of the buildings&rsquo; owners. </P>
        <P>My Department is ensuring that the buildings&rsquo; owners, and the agents preparing proposals for the re-development of the area in which the buildings are located are fully aware of the legal protection extending to the buildings and of their obligations in this regard.  My Department is also available to provide any relevant advice sought by the owners or agents on matters relating to the conservation and protection of the buildings.</P>
        <P>Some informal discussions have taken place, on a without prejudice basis, between my Department and the agents responsible for preparing the development proposals, with a view to ensuring that they are fully aware of and responsive to the legal requirements attaching to the preservation order. They have also been advised that any proposed works affecting the national monument require my prior written consent. Before giving any such consent I am required to consult with the Director of the National Museum of Ireland.</P>

	<P>I understand that the question refers to a statement, in a letter of October 1997 from the Heritage Service (now the National Parks and Wildlife Service) of the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, to the effect that there was no desire on the part of the Heritage Service to interfere in the workings of a particular quarry. This statement was not an undertaking, but an assertion of good faith at that time.</P>
        <P>Quarrying activities in general are regulated under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2006.  It is the responsibility of any person seeking to carry out or continue development on their land to obey such planning and environmental rules as apply when seeking the relevant permission.</P>

	<P>My Department is examining the feasibility of introducing a set of arrangements under which a local authority would agree to its clawback charge ranking in second place behind a new or topped-up mortgage charge to facilitate re-mortgaging.  In the case of shared ownership transactions, the arrangements will ensure that the clawback will not kick-in when a purchaser simply wishes to buy out the local authority&rsquo;s share, while still facilitating its enforcement by the local authority if <Col N="2281"/>the purchaser sells the house within the normal 20-year period.   The practicalities of any such arrangements will have to be considered in consultation with the local authorities and the lending institutions.  </P>
        <P>It is likely that any new set of arrangements that may be introduced will require enabling legislation and the requirements in this regard are being considered in the context of the Housing (Miscellaneous) Bill, the drafting of which is currently underway.</P>

	<P>It is policy in my Department for all official information to be stored on the Department&rsquo;s network rather than on the hard drives of individual PCs.  All broken IT equipment (mainly Desktop and Laptop PCs and printers) which is not reusable is sent for recycling under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE directive).  My Department requires the company recycling the equipment to furnish a certificate confirming either that all data have been erased from all PC hard drives or, where the hard drives <Col N="2282"/>are inoperable, that they have been physically destroyed.</P>
        <P>In the case of equipment that is obsolete but not broken, it is the Department&rsquo;s policy to make such equipment available for reuse to schools and staff and to charities specialising in the preparation of equipment for reuse. In the case of equipment supplied to charities, the charity is required to certify that the hard drive has been erased to specific standards. In relation to equipment supplied to schools and staff, the hard drives are repartitioned and fully formatted.</P>

	<P>In accordance with its Environmental Policy Statement, my Department is fully committed to the conservation and effective management of our consumption of resources, including energy, waste, paper, equipment and other consumables.  This is a critical element of our ongoing accreditation to ISO 14001, which we achieved for our Headquarters in the Custom House.</P>
        <P>My Department promotes conservation measures within the Department on an ongoing basis.  Staff are encouraged to avail of all opportunities to reduce wastage within offices.  A number of strategies guide our activities in this regard, including prevention and reduction in the amount of waste generated and maximising all opportunities for the re-use and recycling of waste arising.  A contract is in place for the collection and recycling of paper and cardboard packaging from my Department&rsquo;s main offices. All paper used within the Department for photocopiers, printers etc is made from 100% post consumer waste based products. In relation to redundant electronic IT equipment, the Department arranges for the reuse of suitable equipment and where this is not possible avails of the take back facilities under the WEEE Regulations for the dismantling and recycling of such equipment.  Arrangements are in place in the Custom House under which cans and bottles are collected and recycled by Dublin City Council. There are also arrangements in place for recycling glass and for the safe disposal of batteries.  My Department is also availing of the recently introduced brown bin collection scheme being run by Dublin City Council, which provides for the segregation of organic kitchen waste for composting.</P>
        <P>As regards energy consumption my Department&rsquo;s policy is to use a number of energy saving devices such as energy efficient lights, powersave function on electrical office equipment and photocopiers with duplex facilities.  A Building Energy Management System is in place in the Custom House which is connected to the heating system, enabling more efficient heating management.  Thermostatic valves were installed where possible on radiators.  As regards water conservation, water efficient spring loaded taps have been installed in the Custom House and water saving devices have been installed in some of the cisterns.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s office in Ballina has participated in a pilot project under the auspices of OPW during 2007 with a view to achieving reductions in energy consumption.  At the end of July 2007 a reduction of 3% in electricity consumption had been achieved.  It is intended that the lessons learned in the pilot project will be <Col N="2284"/>rolled out to all Government Departments shortly and my Department&rsquo;s Headquarters is included in the first phase of the roll out.</P>
        <P>My Department has also committed to obtaining its electricity from renewable sources and, following a tender process under the auspices of the OPW, a contract is now in place with Energia for the supply of electricity from renewable sources to the Department&rsquo;s main offices.</P>
        <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, the bulk of my Department&rsquo;s Dublin based operations are being decentralised to four locations in the South East.  In collaboration with the OPW, my Department has set very high environmental specifications for its decentralised offices.  It is intended that the new offices will incorporate many of the latest developments in sustainable construction, energy conservation and use of renewable energy sources.</P>

	<P>Article 9.1 of the EU Water Framework Directive requires all Member States to take account of the principle of water services cost recovery, including environmental and resource costs, in accordance with the polluter pays principle.  The Directive is being implemented in Ireland in relation to the non-domestic sector, including educational premises, on the basis of recovery of all non-domestic water services costs from non-domestic users of the services by means of a meter based volumetric water charge to ensure charges accord with actual consumption.  This requires the installation of water meters in all non-domestic premises, including schools.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Policy and legislation on packaging waste, including beverage containers, at European Union and national level, are based on the principles of minimising harm to the environment and maximising the efficient use of resources, and seek to achieve <Col N="2285"/>these objectives through the promotion of packaging waste prevention and minimisation, reuse and recycling.  The question of which packaging materials (e.g. glass or aluminium), products or packaging systems are environmentally preferable is complex.  While life cycle analyses have been undertaken in relation to packaging materials in a number of European countries, Member States are constrained in terms of the measures they can adopt to promote the use of one packaging material type over another.</P>
        <P>Article 9 of European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste provides that packaging may not be placed on the market within the European Union unless it satisfies the provisions of the Directive i.e. it complies with the essential requirements on the composition and the reusable and recoverable nature of packaging as provided for in Annex II of that Directive.  In this regard, Annex II of the Directive explicitly provides that packaging shall be designed, produced and placed on the market in such a way as to permit its reuse or recovery, including recycling and composting.  Under article 18 of the Directive, Member States are prohibited from impeding the placing on the market of packaging which satisfies these essential requirements.</P>

	<P>In law the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority.  It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.  In their work in this area, local authorities do not compile data which would permit specific conclusions to be drawn relating to levels of overall registration for electoral purposes.</P>
        <P>In working to compile the Register for 2007/2008, which is currently in force, local authorities undertook and completed the most extensive registration campaign in decades.  On the basis of the work undertaken, I am satisfied that local authorities have achieved a significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register compared to previous years.</P>
        <P>My Department has advised local authorities that the approach this year should be to maintain <Col N="2286"/>and build on the progress they have made to date.  Looking ahead, the Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Electoral Commission.  The Commission&rsquo;s responsibilities will include taking charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register.</P>

	<P>The Salmon Hardship Scheme adopted by the Loughs Agency is intended to provide a measure of relief to individuals in line with the level of hardship likely to be experienced on foot of the cessation of fishing for salmon arising from the closure of the interceptory fishery seaward of Lough Foyle and the reduction of commercial licences within the Lough.

        <P>SEI invited applications earlier this year under the Programme for a limited number of demonstration projects suitable as &ldquo;model solutions&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>While the evaluation process has taken longer than originally anticipated SEI expects to conclude same shortly.  SEI expects to be corresponding with all applicants and prospective grantees on the outcome of this evaluation process in early December.  I have no role in the evaluation process.</P>

	<P>An indicative &euro;435 million of Exchequer funds has been provided for the Communications and Broadband Programme in the 2007-2013 National Development Plan (NDP).  &euro;35 million has been spent to date on broadband initiatives during 2007 including Phase II of the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) Programme and the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  It is anticipated that the full &euro;435 million will be fully utilised over the lifetime of the NDP.  It is not possible at this stage to give a detailed breakdown of the approximately &euro;400 million that remains to be allocated over the period of the Plan.  Some of this allocation will be expended in the NBS and commitments under Phase II of the MANs.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently undertaking a Value for Money and Policy Review of Phase I of the MANs programme.  This review will help to inform decisions on the  future allocation of the NDP envelope for broadband infrastructure.</P>

        <P>The provision of broadband services is primarily a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</P>
        <P>There are a number of platforms for delivery of broadband, and service providers are now offering broadband by wireless, satellite, fibre or standard telephone cable in all areas of the country. My Department operates a dedicated website, www.broadband.gov.ie where potential broadband customers can ascertain the availability of services in their area.</P>
        <P>ComReg is responsible for the compiling of statistics on broadband uptake.  I understand that these statistics are collected on a national basis only.  Details are available on www.comreg.ie.</P>
        <P>The Central Statistics Office collected data on the uptake of broadband at local authority level in the 2006 census.  This information is available at www.cso.ie/census.</P>

	<P>My Department is conscious of both its security and environmental responsibilities when organising the disposal of old information technology equipment.</P>
        <P>When a PC is no longer fit for purpose in the Department, the hard drive is wiped using software acquired for this purpose.  It overwrites the hard drive multiple times with random patterns thereby eliminating any trace of the original hard drive contents.</P>
        <P>Following erasure, PCs are sent to Camara, an Irish charity, who provide a recycling certificate for the equipment.  Camara use software to wipe the contents of the hard drive a second time.  They then install a new operating system and ship the PC for re-use in schools and colleges in Africa.</P>
        <P>Peripheral PC equipment such as printers is disposed of through one of the certified recycling companies.</P>

	<P>European Union policy seeks to ensure secure and competitively priced electricity markets into the future. Better interconnection between electricity systems is a key aspect of this policy and the White Paper &ldquo;Delivering a sustainable energy future for Ireland&rdquo; underlines Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to a more sustainable energy future through a range of measures including increased electricity and gas interconnection.</P>
        <P>The Single Electricity Market for Ireland came into effect on 1st November this year. As part of this market development, and to promote competition and better sharing of resources, EirGrid is developing a second North South electricity interconnector.  The increased capacity provided by this interconnector is also intended to facilitate <Col N="2294"/>fuel savings, lower emissions and increased integration of wind generated energy.  In addition to the benefits on an all island basis, EirGrid is strengthening the high voltage network in Counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, thereby adding to the availability of bulk high quality power in the North East.  Strengthening of the network in this way will greatly improve the electricity infrastructure in these areas and their attractiveness for investment.</P>
        <P>The planning and development of these 400kV lines is an operational matter for EirGrid and I have no statutory function in this matter.  I have, however, received the following advice from EirGrid on the undergrounding of 400kV power lines:</P>
        <P>Internationally, high voltage electricity lines are placed underground only in heavily built up areas.  This does not apply in this case and overhead lines are the most technically feasible solution to providing a secure and reliable supply of high voltage electricity to the North East.  Overhead lines are also by far the most economic way of transporting power, with underground lines costing between 6 and 10 times as much as standard overhead lines.  This is important bearing in mind that electricity networks are financed by all electricity customers.  In addition, finding and repairing a fault on an overhead line can usually be done within hours, whereas the same process for an underground line can take weeks if not months to effect.  A time delay in repairing a fault in a high voltage power line could cause a lengthy and significant loss of power to a large number of customers.</P>
        <P>To the best of EirGrid&rsquo;s knowledge, there is no 400kV Alternating Current (AC) line of the length proposed in these two projects placed underground in any part of the world.  Some 97% of the onshore high voltage transmission network in Europe is of high voltage alternating current carried by overhead lines.</P>
        <P>In routing overhead lines EirGrid aims to keep as far away from communities and houses as possible, and a minimum clearance of 50 metres is the routing aim.</P>
        <P>The possible routes for the two 400kV power lines are currently the subject of public consultation by EirGrid.</P>

	<P>Section 3 of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007, enacted and commenced in April of this year, amends RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s public service remit by requiring the national public service broadcaster to provide a television and radio service to Irish communities abroad and stipulating that any such <Col N="2296"/>television service must be representative of the existing RT&Eacute; One, RT&Eacute; Two and TG4 channels.</P>
        <P>Section 14 of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007 empowers RT&Eacute; to utilise the public funding it receives in respect of television licence fee income in pursuance of this amended public service remit.</P>
        <P>RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s initial focus in fulfilling its new mandate is on ensuring the provision of a television service to Irish communities in Britain.</P>
        <P>RT&Eacute; is currently planning the establishment of an international service for such a purpose and has an active group working on the project.</P>
        <P>This group is currently reviewing the various options available, including the cost and availability of space on the broadcasting transmission platforms of third parties, and the cost and the acquisition of certain rights associated with the broadcast of programmes outside of Ireland.</P>
        <P>On completion of this process RT&Eacute; will outline its specific proposals to meet the mandate set by the Oireachtas under section 3 of the 2007 Act.</P>
