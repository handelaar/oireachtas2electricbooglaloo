    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I request the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of local and national importance, namely, the threatened closure of Seamount College, Kinvara, County Galway.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Science to intervene and prevent the closure of this college that provides an excellent standard of education for a large catchment area that includes Lisdoonvarna, Fanore, Ballyvaughan and New-Quay, County Clare.  The projected growth in the area will not be accommodated in Gort Community College or Calasanctius College, Oranmore, where there is no spare capacity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I request the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter requiring urgent attention, namely, the need for the Taoiseach to intervene with the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance to approve funding for the Clonmel flood alleviation scheme in view of the fact that Clonmel has been devastated by four major floods in the past ten years, that millions of euros of damage has been done to homes and businesses, that insurance cover cannot be obtained in flooded areas, that the completed proposal is currently with the Minister for Finance for approval and in view of the fact that the Minister of State has in this House promised that the scheme would commence in September 2006 and again in spring 2007, promises he has failed to keep.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate to go beyond the notice submitted to the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>This is in the notice.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1470"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The notice I received finished with &ldquo;spring 2007&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek leave to move a motion for the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of national importance and concern, namely, the huge price increases in meat, vegetables, fruit, gas and electricity and the 15% increase in rents for Dublin City Council tenants, particularly those living on the north side of Dublin and pensioners.  I call on the Government to do something as a matter of priority to assist our elderly, our disabled and working people in general as they must put up with these huge price increases which are affecting everyone&rsquo;s quality of life.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of extreme importance, namely, that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources immediately intervene with the management of An Post to stop the policy of closing and downgrading rural post officers, such as the recent downgrading of Kilmaley post office in County Clare to post point status, and the closure of Liscannor, Kilamona, Carran, Kilnaboy, Inagh, Kilbaha, Cross, Querrin, Moyasta and Lisdeen post offices in recent years because of the devastation this has caused in local communities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.  An Post has decimated the postal service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised, I have found that they are not in order under Standing Order 31.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, while I have great respect for the Minister, this is a contemptuous snub to this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order.</P>

	<P>Neither the Taoiseach nor the T&aacute;naiste is here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order so I ask Deputy Kenny to allow the Minister to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand they are attending social partnership meetings but this is the primary legislative body in this country and we have no representation from either the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1471"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order and I ask the Deputy to accept the ruling of the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is out doing the Taoiseach&rsquo;s dirty work in respect of the tribunal.  We have good cop, bad cop, with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government saying the tribunals should be closed down while the Taoiseach says they should go ahead.  This is contemptuous treatment of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point and he has been ruled out of order by the Chair.  It is important no one shows contempt for the rules of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Neither the Taoiseach nor the T&aacute;naiste is here to answer questions today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny has made his point and I ask him to resume his seat.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a snub to the primary legislative body.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an absolute disgrace.  The three amigos are sitting in place of the two boys who should be here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Durkan to allow the Minister to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 12<i>a</i>, Finance Bill 2007, allocation of time motion for select committee; No. 12<i>b</i>, Finance Bill 2007 &mdash; Financial Resolutions, No. 24, statements on the national development plan; and No. 4, the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>
        <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 6 p.m, Nos. 12<i>a </i>and 12<i>b</i> shall be decided without debate and, in the case of No. 12<i>b</i>, Financial Resolutions, Nos. 1 to 36 shall be moved together and decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair.  The proceedings on No. 24 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to conclusion after 65 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: the statements shall be confined to a Minister or Minister of State and to the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order and who may share their time, which shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case, and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed five minutes.  The Second Stage of No. 4 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 6 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are four proposals to put to the House.  Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed to?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose that we sit until 6.30 p.m. and that there be a full statement from the Government in respect of its intentions relating to the Mahon tribunal.  We are in a situation where the Taoiseach says it should go ahead, the T&aacute;naiste says it should close down and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government says we cannot go on like this.  The tribunal was set up by the Oireachtas and given a specific remit.  Everyone understands it should do its work expeditiously but the truth should be known.  We are now in a state of classic Fianna F&aacute;il confusion, where the T&aacute;naiste is out like a lapdog doing the dirty work of the Taoiseach.  He should be in here giving a full explanation of Government intentions for the tribunal and I propose we sit until 6.30 p.m. to allow him to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.  Where are they now?  Let them speak for themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion for an amendment to the Standing Orders to allow the Government to clarify its position given that we have one version from the T&aacute;naiste and another from the Taoiseach.  Will the Minister clarify this position?  I had always believed the Oireachtas or the D&aacute;il could not stop a module that had already commenced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I would prefer if Deputy Rabbitte would wait until the Order of Business and I will allow him to raise this matter then.  It is out of order on this proposal and we want to go through the proposals first.  Perhaps when we come to the Order of Business he can raise it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am just explaining why we are looking for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We are discussing the late sitting.</P>

	<P>Deputy Kenny has proposed its extension to permit the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s proposal is not in order because the Opposition cannot propose new business.  That is the prerogative of the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Durkan to behave himself when the Chair is speaking.  I ask Deputy Rabbitte to wait until the appropriate time on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I saw you getting that advice, Sir.  I remember many times when this side of the House proposed a change to Standing Orders and when it was, on occasion, accepted on the other side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Not to propose new business.  That is a matter for Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>We have no Taoiseach.</P>

	<P>We have no Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Gormley on the late sitting.  The other matter can be raised on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We should certainly extend the late sitting to give people the opportunity to make their views clear.  There is a lack of clarity on the other side of the House on the tribunals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has already ruled on that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We have the T&aacute;naiste&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>For the benefit of the House, an amendment which introduces a new matter is not in order as it is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s prerogative to list the business to be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>May I make a point of order?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will hear the Deputy on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a point of order.  Will the Ceann Comhairle allow a private notice question on the issue and make the time available to discuss this serious issue.  Obviously the T&aacute;naiste&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not arise at this stage.  Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for clarification, Sir.  I proposed an extension to the sitting on Tuesday, which was effectively for new business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it was time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It was new business because the Taoiseach refused to answer questions about the Moriarty tribunal, which was new business as far as I am concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  The Deputy proposed an amendment on business that was proposed before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I proposed an extension of time for new business, namely answering questions about the Moriarty tribunal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not for new business.  It was for business that was before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a new element of that business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a proposal before the House on how that business would be dealt with.  The Deputy was entitled to propose an amendment to change the proposal that was before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>And to bring in an element of new business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no proposal today on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The new business was to get the truth out of some people here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is out of order.  It is quite clear.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 65 minutes has been allocated to debate a very important issue, namely, the national development plan.  The problem is that in the past we have not had a plan.  This is the reason we now have tribunals and bad and corrupt planning.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is now trying to shut down the tribunals as a consequence.  I will not dwell on that matter now though I hope we will have an opportunity to debate it.  </P><Col N="1476"/>
        <P>We need more time to debate the national development plan which does not face up to climate change, the biggest challenge facing humanity.  It has not been climate change proofed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The time devoted today for statements on the national development plan and the <Col N="1477"/>time devoted yesterday to the Moriarty report means two fundamental issues of importance to this country and our democracy were not properly debated.  As Deputy Gormley stated, the &euro;184 billion to be spent under the national development plan will be fundamental to every region in Ireland.  We are all aware from the Moriarty report of what went wrong when one man put his hand in the till.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with the proposal re statements on the national development plan.  The Deputy should make a brief comment on why she opposes the time limit in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We are now asked to debate the spending of that &euro;184 billion in 65 minutes.  The Labour Party will get an allocation of 15 minutes <Col N="1478"/>to be shared between myself and Deputy Quinn.  That is not adequate.  It is not an insult particularly to this House, it is an insult to the voters who for the first time in Irish history will pay the bulk of that &euro;184 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot debate the content of the plan at this stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not a plan which will be sent by post to Brussels.  It is a plan for which our taxpayers will pay for the next seven years.</P>

	<P>At the beginning of the Order of Business, I attempted to raise the fact that I regard the absence of the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste as a contemptuous snub to this House, which is the primary legislative body in the country.  </P>

	<P>After a decade, we had a short series of statements on the Moriarty tribunal.  The Progressive Democrats were not present in the House and there was no comment from the leader or the deputy leader of that party.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>While the House was endeavouring to comment on a culture of corruption and the necessity to break it, the very same T&aacute;naiste who said we do not want single party government in this country was outside the gates of this House undermining another tribunal.  </P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>First of all, I believe we should have an opportunity to hear a full statement from the Government about its intentions with regard to the Mahon tribunal.  I know that neither the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, nor the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, can stop this.  It was set up by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform increased fees for lawyers on a number of occasions.  The Taoiseach says he wants to go ahead with it; the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government wants it closed down; and the Tanaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Miche&aacute;l bocht, has his own views on this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe we should have a full statement from the Government.  The people are very confused <Col N="1480"/>about all these tribunals, but they know one thing.  They would like to have the truth, which apparently reaches into the very highest echelons in this country in this day and age.  We like to see tribunals do their work expeditiously.  A number of judges were appointed.  If they are unable to do their work in parallel, that is a problem for the Government.  Everybody knows these things cannot run indefinitely, but the truth is central to what we must do to restore some sense of probity and integrity to Irish politics.  Will the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, who is a decent man, comment on what are the Government&rsquo;s intentions in respect of the Mahon tribunal?</P>

	<P>There is minimal opportunity in the House to hold Government to account.  The rolling of an omnibus leaders&rsquo; question to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs by the Ceann Comhairle does not do justice to the Opposition in terms of our capacity to hear what the Minister has to say and pursue him by way of supplementary question.

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Why has he been sent in here to deal with the Order of Business this morning?  When we had a vote in the Chamber, we saw a number of other Ministers appear from behind the arras.  What is this snub to the House, although I mean no disrespect to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister indicate if my understanding of the matter before the House is correct?  I believe that if a tribunal has commenced a module of investigation, the Oireachtas cannot close it down without exposing the taxpayer to serious potential claims for damages.</P>
        <P>Why has the new fees regime not been applied?  The T&aacute;naiste is quite properly concerned about runaway costs, but the T&aacute;naiste as Attorney General negotiated the increase in fees for his colleagues in the Law Library at the various tri<Col N="1482"/>bunals.  He negotiated and sanctioned them, as well as getting the sanction of the Minister for Finance for the higher fees.</P>

	<P>He put them up by 50%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance, having sanctioned the higher fees, stated the process to be a gravy train that should be stopped.  No action was ever taken.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform brought in legislation in 2004 to curtail the fees but turned a blind eye with regard to implementing the new fees, which have never been put in place.  If the T&aacute;naiste is so concerned about fees, why has action never been taken by the Government to control them?</P>
        <P>If it is true, as alleged on radio this morning, that there are 12,000 orders for discovery at &euro;13,000 a go, with &euro;400 million being the alleged cost, who sanctioned it?  Who is in control of the purse strings and who sanctioned the transfer of &euro;400 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money to the banks for orders of discovery?  It seems the Government speaks with forked tongue on this issue.</P>

	<P>I would have preferred to hear the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on the issue and put supplementary questions to him having regard to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s request for extended time to allow the Government to clarify the issue, make a statement and allow questions and answers.  As Deputy Kenny stated, tribunals clearly cannot go on forever and they are inordinately expensive.  There are clear fundamental issues of public interest involved as well.  Where modules have been opened, my understanding is that a halt cannot be called by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Government as a whole or even by this House.</P>

	<P>Is the Deputy happy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is many years since it became clear that not just the Mahon tribunal but other tribunals were making far more new millionaires than there were old millionaires being investigated.  What we had yesterday from the T&aacute;naiste in particular and also from the Taoiseach is an exercise in the most monumental hypocrisy.</P>
        <P>We pointed out many years ago in the D&aacute;il the incredible level of fees which lawyers were able to command at will.  Who are the lawyers but the friends of the T&aacute;naiste himself?  In other words, it is the very system he has been part of for decades that has seen him make a very good career for himself and his friends.  At the same time, it has put the law in this country out of the reach of ordinary working people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a system they were silent about for decades and while ordinary working class people were pushed out and could not afford justice, the lawyers were rolling in it from those who could afford to pay them, such as the big corporations, etc.  When they saw an oppor<Col N="1484"/>tunity where the taxpayer would foot the bill, it was nirvana.</P>
        <P>For years, the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach have refused to lift a finger in opposition to that system.  We now have, in the most cynical, political and opportunistic way, the T&aacute;naiste raising this issue for his own reasons.  It was as if his party was not in Government for the past ten years.  It is similar to the crime issue, where the T&aacute;naiste is adopting the Taoiseach&rsquo;s methodology of pretending to be in Opposition when his party is in reality in Government.</P>
        <P>We should get real on the issue.  These investigations have shown up the corrupt underbelly that existed with planning in this country and the interface between politics and business in this country, which was rotten to the core and which needed to be brought out and exorcised.  Such circumstances can never again occur.</P>
        <P>It is not a question of shutting the tribunals down but bringing them to a conclusion where the full truth will out, no matter whom that affects or embarrasses.  It can be done and, if necessary, we should bring in levels of remuneration for those involved that will allow the process to continue at a reasonable cost.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>All parties have agreed that is necessary.  As the House is aware, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is engaged in correspondence with the tribunals and as soon as that has been completed the Government will look again at the matter.</P>

	<P>The House will be aware that when the tribunal was contacted in 2004, it indicated it would have its work completed by March 2007.  On that basis the then current rates continued to apply to counsel for the tribunal, up to and including that date.  The current rates apply up to March 2007.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2001, when three additional judges were appointed to the tribunal &mdash; at that stage it was called the Flood tribunal &mdash; it was expected at that time it would sit in individual divisions.

	<P>In regard to legal costs, the new schedule of fees has been applied to a number of tribunals, namely, the Barr, MacEntee and <Col N="1487"/>Smithwick tribunals.  A lower level of fees now attaches to these tribunals.  As agreed with the tribunal, at the end of March 2007 we will see how the discussions conclude with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The Government will then consider the matter.  I wish to say in the strongest possible terms both the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste are together of the view that there is no question of interference, no legislation was postponed and there is not a single Member in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Jesus, you are fierce cranky, there is no doubt.  Many people are unhappy about the lack of protection for children from sex abusers.  Today, it emerged there are fears about an abuser who may be in the jurisdiction and the fact there is not a proper register here to protect children.  Under the North-South Ministerial Council, recommendations were made for legislation to be produced for a register of persons considered unsafe to work with children.  I have no doubt everybody would feel a lot happier if that register were in place.  Will the Minister acknowledge we need this legislation?  It is not acceptable to read, &ldquo;Publication expected &mdash; not possible to indicate at this stage&rdquo;.  Surely this is a priority.  We have heard lots of talk from the Government about protection of children from sex abuse.  There is talk of a constitutional referendum.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Under what legislation will this measure be implemented?  Will it be done by ministerial order?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is expected to publish the social welfare Bill tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>We have only three days to examine it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same point, a Cheann Comhairle.  That does not answer the question that has been legitimately raised by Deputy Stanton.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair intends to answer that question when it gets a chance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Chair going to answer it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The convention is two weeks but there is nothing formal about the timeframe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>So convention applies against us on the Opposition side but not in our favour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on the matter now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>On that point of order, how are we expected to examine and debate legislation when we only have less than a weekend to do so?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Can convention be enforced?  You rightly very often enforce convention here.  Can you not act in this case to help Members in such circumstances?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Members wish to devise a standing order on this issue, it is a matter for the House to implement it.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1490"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does that convention apply?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>We can discuss it on the social welfare Bill next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill itself is the issue.  We do not have time to examine it in detail.  We only have a weekend, in effect.  It is not fair on Members and the people we represent to do this.  Do you have any ruling on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have told the Deputy what is the ruling.  The convention is two weeks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is two weeks.  Does that mean&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;but there is nothing formal in place.  If the House wants to put something formally in place, the Chair has been advocating reform of Standing Orders for a long time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister postpone the hearing of the Bill in the House until we get a chance to examine it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Boyle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot, because the increases come into effect in April and the Bill has to be passed by the end of March.  The Deputy is aware of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Minister delay publishing the Bill until now?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on it.  I call Deputy Boyle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>In support of Deputy Stanton, the two week convention referred to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not having a debate on the issue.  We are moving on. I call Deputy Lynch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a second point in regard to the MacEntee tribunal.  As a point of order I wished to inquire about briefings to allow us to perform our job as spokespersons in this House.  The Minister is offering a briefing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is how we do our&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have to raise that with the Minister in another way.  The Minister, Deputy Brennan, is representing the Government this morning on the Order of Business.  It is 11.30 a.m. and the House is complaining <Col N="1491"/>about no business being done but Members are holding up business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue will be raised in CPP.  My second question relates to the MacEntee tribunal where the sole member has asked for a ninth delay.  The report is now meant to be published on 13 March next.  On previous occasions when delays were given for this tribunal&rsquo;s report the Taoiseach made statements asking for an extension of time and indicated when the report would be made.  Can the Minister for Social and Family Affairs give any assurance there will not be a tenth or eleventh postponement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It relates to a motion of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister to reply on the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have any role in that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Lynch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Previously the Taoiseach came to the House and moved motions for the extension of time.  We have now been told, through the media, that there is a ninth postponement but there has not been any mention of that fact in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is a motion promised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We will consider the matter and come back to the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Under what legislation will the new measure governing the collection of social welfare payments within a ten day period be introduced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest Deputy Lynch submits a question to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It has nothing to do with the Chair.  I call Deputy Durkan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>How do we find out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The way to find out is to contact the Minister or submit a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Social Welfare Bill is being taken tomorrow&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is being published tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1492"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not being taken tomorrow.  We cannot discuss the content of the Bill.  It is 11.30 a.m. and the Deputy&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Burton, is waiting patiently.  I would like to call her but if Deputy Lynch hogs the Chamber we will move on to the next item.  I call Deputy Durkan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The broadcasting Bill is listed for publication in the early summer.  Is it necessary to bring that Bill forward in tandem with the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill to provide for all the requirements envisaged during e-consultation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is set for early summer 2007.  That is the current position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the firm position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the OECD report that proposes to abolish the home carers tax credit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question on legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer also to the Social Welfare Bill.  What is the situation regarding the proposal to have a lower rate of child benefit for parents who remain at home?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not arise on the Order of Business.  We will proceed to item 12<i>a</i>, Finance Bill 2007, allocation of time motion for select committees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will there be an opportunity to debate this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, to move the motion.  We will not discuss the report now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am entitled to know if there will be a debate on it.  The Minister is nodding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister can nod all he likes but he must obey the Standing Orders like everyone else.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to open this debate on the new national development plan.  The plan sets out a vision of how Ireland can be transformed over the next seven years and how we can provide a better quality of life for all.  It is an ambitious, fully costed, multi-annual blueprint for sustainable development.  It encompasses a broad and comprehensive approach to our economic priorities but also to regional development, social inclusion and environmental sustainability.</P>
        <P>The objective of a better quality of life for our people informs the national development plan.  This objective will be delivered in particular by the following measures and strategies in the plan: an investment of some &euro;88 billion in our economic and social infrastructure; a major programme of social inclusion measures costing some &euro;50 billion over the period, including services for children, the elderly and the disabled; a major focus on environmental sustainability backed up by total investment of &euro;25 billion in key areas, including a quadrupling of investment in public transport over the levels in the last plan; a model for regional development that, through the framework of investment and complementary land use policy, can assist all regions to achieve their potential and promote a better environment and quality of life; and strong and tangible all-island co-operation implemented in a co-operative way to the benefit of all citizens on the island.</P>
        <P>This national development plan, the fourth since 1989, will build on the solid foundations of its predecessors.  It worth recalling the progress we have made since we adopted, in response to EU requirements for Structural Funds assistance, the process of formulating national development <Col N="1499"/>plans to progress this country&rsquo;s development.  When the first plan was launched in 1989, unemployment was at 15%, the national debt was 107% of GNP and Ireland experienced net emigration of some 208,000 people in the 1980s.</P>
        <P>By contrast, the backdrop to the launch of the new plan in January 2007 is one of virtually full employment, a debt-GNP ratio of 25% and a population increase of almost 609,000 over the past decade.  The three previous national development plans, funded in significant part by EU Structural Funds, have played a significant role in this remarkable turnaround.  Investment under these plans, especially in employment creation, training, education and in infrastructure combined with other successful economic, budgetary and taxation policies and underpinned by the social partnership process, has helped transform Ireland.</P>
        <P>Unlike its predecessors, the new national development plan has not been prepared to meet EU requirements and thus draw down the limited amount of EU Structural Funds now available to Ireland.  Nonetheless, the Government considers that a new plan was necessary for the following four reasons.  We need a comprehensive, coherent, costed and integrated investment blueprint that sets out how we will deliver sustainable economic and social development into the future, thereby improving quality of life for all.  We need to send a signal to private sector investors, both indigenous and international, that Ireland has a comprehensive blueprint for investment in areas that will influence and impact on their commercial decisions.</P>
        <P>Public bodies also need medium-term policy and financial frameworks within which to plan investment.  We need to promote balanced regional development and promote environmental sustainability and underpin all-island co-operation.  Finally, we need to demonstrate to taxpayers that there is a comprehensive plan in place that will invest their money on strategic priorities and will do so in a value for money manner.</P>
        <P>The plan will involve an estimated expenditure of &euro;184 billion over seven years.  This investment will be rolled out within a framework of economic and budgetary stability and in full compliance with the requirements of the EU Stability and Growth Pact.  The economic framework underpinning the plan assumes annual average economic growth over the period of 4-4.5% and it is affordable on that basis.</P>
        <P>The period to 2013 represents a major window of opportunity in resource terms to tackle our infrastructure deficits before population-related expenditure pressures in health and pensions appear on the horizon.  We must use our favourable demographic situation to boost the productive capacity of the economy to meet the long-term demographic challenges.  The Government commissioned a study by the Economic and <Col N="1500"/>Social Research Institute on the investment priorities for the plan.  The plan accords with the prioritisation recommended to capital investment by the ESRI, notably in areas such as transport.  The Government is of the view that the quantum of investment required over the period is considerably in excess of that recommended by the ESRI.  Accordingly, Government investment under the plan is &euro;2 billion per year higher than that recommended by the institute.</P>
        <P>In determining the levels of Government capital investment, the Government took account in particular of the following key factors: the need to decisively tackle economic and social infrastructure deficits, demographic projections which estimate a population of in excess of 5 million in 2021, the window of opportunity in resource terms; and the economic rate of return on infrastructure investment.  The Government believes that the construction industry has the capacity and flexibility to deliver the increased investment without causing an inflationary impact as occurred at the outset of the previous plan.  Lessons have also been learned from programme and project management problems which surfaced in the early part of the previous national development plan.  Key implementing agencies, such as the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency, have had significant enhancement of resources and are now well geared to deliver the programmes and projects in the new plan.  Recent experience, especially in the transport area, is very positive in this regard.</P>
        <P>The plan was the subject of extensive consultation involving submissions from and meetings with social partners, regional bodies and other interested groups.  This consultative process overwhelmingly endorsed an ambitious level of capital investment in the new plan.  The plan launched by Government shows that account has been taken of the priorities and concerns raised in the process.  The plan also contains provision for commitments under Towards 2016 and sets out a new multi-annual integrated blueprint for the implementation of these and other commitments.</P>
        <P>The new plan adopts a whole-of-Government and cross-departmental perspective to resource allocation, following the successful format which has been the hallmark of previous EU-funded plans.  The plan sets out an integrated strategy under the five priority areas of economic infrastructure; enterprise, science and innovation; human capital; social infrastructure; and social inclusion.  An investment of &euro;54.7 billion in economic infrastructure will include the completion by 2010 of the major inter-urban road routes; significant enhancement of the Atlantic road corridor; a quadrupling of investment in public transport compared with the previous plan, including major expansion in rail capacity in the greater Dublin region and enhanced rail services outside the greater Dublin area; 15% of electricity supply will be generated from renewable energy by 2010; and <Col N="1501"/>significant ongoing investment in the electricity network is envisaged.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;20 billion will be invested in the promotion of enterprise, science and innovation and will include a radical enhancement in the quantity, quality and commercial use of research and development.  There will also be investment in potential start-up and growth-potential companies.  We intend to invest in attracting more tourist visitors; and a more efficient, competitive and environmentally friendly farming sector and agri-food sector is a necessary objective.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;25.8 billion will be invested in training and education under the human capital priority.  This will support the continuing up-skilling of the workforce and improvement of employment prospects for groups such as lone parents and people with disabilities, the provision of new schools in rapidly developing areas and a comprehensive information and communications technology programme for schools are planned.  There will be a further increase in the numbers attending third level colleges, especially from disadvantaged areas and there will be major reform and modernisation in the third level sector.</P>
        <P>A sum of &euro;33.6 billion will be invested in the area of social infrastructure to include 60,000 new social housing units and 40,000 new affordable housing units as per the NESC report; 500 primary care health teams will be established by 2011; there will be an expansion of the range and quality of sports facilities throughout the country, including the Lansdowne Road and Abbotstown projects; and there will be nationwide investment in arts and cultural facilities, including a new National Concert Hall in Dublin and a new National Theatre.</P>
        <P>Approximately &euro;50 billion will be provided to promote social inclusion, particularly for the creation of an additional 50,000 new child care places by 2010, and there will be progress towards the target of halving the proportion of children with serious literacy problems in primary schools serving disadvantaged communities.  We will seek to assist 7,000 additional people with disabilities into employment by 2010 and to provide an additional 550 teachers as language support for the integration of migrants.  A total of &euro;9.7 billion will be provided for older people, both to support them living independently in their own homes and, when they can no longer live at home in independence and with dignity, to support the provision of high quality residential care.</P>
        <P>The plan also sets out a strong framework and commitment to investment in key horizontal policy areas including regional development, rural economy, all-island co-operation and environmental sustainability.  The regional development strategy set out in the plan will give a major impetus to the implementation of the 2002 national spatial strategy, although investment under the previous plan also reflected, and was consistent with, that strategy.  With the <Col N="1502"/>regional planning guidelines adopted, the national development plan provides the specifics in terms of programmes and resources to implement the vision of the spatial strategy.</P>
        <P>We need to invest to assist all the regions to reach their potential.  Lopsided economic growth which sees the capital and its hinterland as the primary driver of all activity is not in anybody&rsquo;s interests, least of all those of the people of Dublin and its surrounding counties.  Balanced regional development is a precondition to sustainable national development.  If we are to enjoy a high quality of life alongside, and in support of, a high level of national income, every region and every community must be able to reach its potential for success.  It is vital to delivering a better quality of life for all.</P>
        <P>While recognising the importance of maintaining Dublin as Ireland&rsquo;s international gateway, the plan sets out an investment strategy for the development of the other gateways with a view to promoting better balance in economic development.  This approach is about a better quality of life for citizens in all regions, including the greater Dublin area.  The plan sets out investment priorities in each of these gateway areas.  This investment will be complemented by appropriate planning and land use strategies to maximise the sustainable impact of these and other investments.  In this way the regional development strategy will complement the goal of environmental sustainability.  We must optimise the use of our improved infrastructure.  In particular, we must promote settlement trends that allow people to live nearer their workplace and have access to excellent public transport, schools and other facilities.</P>
        <P>A special gateways innovation fund will be established to assist development of the gateways in line with the spatial strategy&rsquo;s framework.  An initial &euro;300 million is being provided by the Exchequer for 2008-10 for this fund.  This funding is intended to leverage significant additional funding from the private sector and or other parts of the public sector so that the total quantum of investment will be greater than the Exchequer contribution.  The fund will finance local infrastructure such as urban regeneration projects, transport initiatives, in addition to those under Transport 21, and quality of life projects.  A key consideration will also be the existence of close co-operation between local authorities in gateway areas.</P>
        <P>The regional development strategy will support and complement the development of the rural economy.  The plan sets out a general framework and key initiatives to develop the rural economy.  The broad objective is to sustain the continuing process of growth and diversification in rural areas.  Priorities include enhanced accessibility, communications infrastructure and activation of potential in areas such as local enterprise and services, tourism and the natural resource sectors. <Col N="1503"/> Key plan interventions to assist the development of the rural economy will include investment in the modernisation and enhanced competitiveness of the farming sector; the roll-out of broadband in rural areas, particularly those areas where the commercial provision of broadband would otherwise be uneconomic; investment in non-national roads and rural water services; and an expanded rural transport initiative.</P>
        <P>The promotion of environmental sustainability is a more central theme in the new plan than in previous plans.  The framework for action in this area is set out in Chapter 6.  We face major environmental challenges over the period of the plan and beyond, including climate change, waste management and the maintenance and improvement of water quality.  The plan provides for investment of some &euro;25 billion in programmes which will directly protect the environment.  We are more than quadrupling public transport investment as compared with the period 2000-06.  Other key investments in the context of the climate change challenge include a major commitment to the promotion of renewable energy sources for efficient energy use.  This is complemented by the regional development strategy based on a land use strategy which will be more environmentally sustainable.</P>
        <P>The plan sets out a major new proposed framework for all-island co-operation.  The plan contains proposals for significant Irish Government investment in North-South projects, notably in the transport area, and initiatives for mutual benefit.  The Government wishes to agree and implement these with the British Government and a restored Northern Ireland Executive in the period 2007-13.</P>
        <P>Value for money is also a central theme in the delivery of the planned investment.  Most of the capital projects, notably in the key area of transport, are being delivered on or below budget and, in some instances, ahead of schedule.  Building on this performance, all expenditure under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 will be subject, as appropriate, to a robust value for money framework.  Among the key elements of this framework are that all projects will be subject to project appraisal, all capital projects over &euro;30 million will require a full cost benefit analysis, the introduction of new procurement arrangements which will deliver greater cost certainty and evaluations under the value for money and policy reviews will be published and submitted to the relevant select committees of the Oireachtas.  In the coming period, my Department will be elaborating on the monitoring process to be put in place to measure progress under the plan.  We envisage a streamlined, focused approach whereby progress can be readily assessed by reference to relevant financial and physical indicators.  We will avoid the bureaucratic, committee-laden reporting process under previous plans, <Col N="1504"/>which was a source of dissatisfaction as expressed in the consultation process.  The emphasis will be on efficient delivery and transparent reporting.  A key new feature is the formal submission of an annual report on plan progress to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The plan can only become a reality if the economy generates the necessary resources.  The success of the plan will be determined by the continuation of sound economic and budgetary policies.  A strong economy is the bedrock on which this plan can be built.  That is why the Government is emphasising the importance of continuing the successful and stable economic and budgetary policies of recent years.</P>
        <P>This plan addresses Ireland&rsquo;s current development needs directly.  It sets out a roadmap for the next phase of our country&rsquo;s transformation and will deliver a better quality of life for all our people.  Its implementation will help to secure our prosperity and make Ireland a better country, with stronger communities throughout the island.  We have the plan and the resources.  We must now proceed with the work of delivery, thereby improving the quality of life for this and future generations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There can be no doubt regarding the level of need in the context of building a successful infrastructure for the future.  In every area one might care to mention, be it buses, houses, hospitals, ports or schools, there are huge needs and these continue to grow.  The real issue that arises in respect of the NDP is whether the Government has the capacity to deliver.  Judging by its record, one would have to strongly question its capabilities in that regard.  For example, the Government produced the health strategy in 2001 and less than 30% of it has been delivered to date.  Less than 40% of the targets relating to the housing strategy produced in the context of the previous NDP and other policy statements have been met.  Up to last year, less than 50% of the projects under the roads programme had been delivered.  Less than 25% of the commitments relating to the programme of PPPs introduced in the previous NDP have materialised.  Only 40% of what we were promised under the water programme has been delivered.  In the area of e-commerce, only 15% of what was envisaged has been delivered.  Ireland is now one of the worst countries in Europe in the context of access to broadband as a result.  The list goes on.  Less than 7% of the commitments made under decentralisation have been met.</P>
        <P>Where are the grounds for believing that the Government has suddenly changed and that it can deliver strategic planning when it has failed to do so for a decade?  It has also failed to deliver in areas of great importance, such as health and housing, to the people we are here to serve.</P>
        <P>This plan is not a gift from the Government.  It will be funded, in its entirety, out of taxpayers&rsquo; <Col N="1505"/>money.  Approximately &euro;120,000 for every family will be invested in the plan.  That is a substantial amount.  A major change is required in the way strategic planning is carried out in order that we will not look back in five or six years and behold the same litany of failed promises that marked the end of the previous NDP.</P>
        <P>There is a serious lack of strategic vision underpinning the Government&rsquo;s approach to planning in areas in which we face major challenges.  Anyone who engages in even a casual examination of the economic situation could not fail to perceive the looming challenge we face in remaining competitive.  A total of 50% of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland jobs that were in place five years ago have since disappeared.  That is a massive rate of attrition.  There has been a decline in manufacturing and the once unassailable elements of manufacturing, such as Pfizer and Motorola, are being affected.  Huge infrastructural gaps are emerging and we have fallen behind in areas that are crucial to our competitive sectors.  The National Competitiveness Council outlined some of the areas in which we are lagging and its statistics are startling.  Out of 30 countries, Ireland is 28th in respect of port infrastructure, 26th in respect of energy infrastructure and 23rd in respect of broadband infrastructure.  These infrastructures, which are the responsibility of Government, are the bases on which we seek to compete.  Ireland has not, despite the Minister&rsquo;s boast regarding &euro;55 billion of investment in infrastructure, kept pace with other countries and has, in fact, lost ground.</P>
        <P>We have also failed to address the serious strategic challenge of breaking the link between economic growth and increases in carbon emissions.  This matter was highlighted again recently when the latest figures showed that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions are increasing more rapidly than those of any other country.  We have manifestly failed to deliver on our Kyoto commitments.  In addition, we are repeating the worst errors of urban sprawl.  The Minister stated we must make changes in this regard but the Government has not put forward any solid policy changes that will transform patterns of development.  Developers choose the cheapest greenfield sites, pay no regard to the lack of transport infrastructure and commit people to endless commutes that are extremely burdensome in terms of resource use.  In so far as the Government has done anything, it has been to encourage more one-off developments, which it knows run contrary to what it is supposed to be promoting under a policy that addresses the issues of urban sprawl.</P>
        <P>The Government permitted tax reliefs that did not focus on strategic priorities to remain in place in the construction sector long beyond their sell-by dates.  No cost-benefit analysis was carried out until the Minister entered office.  The Government allowed these reliefs to remain in place for at least five years too long.  The most recent fig<Col N="1506"/>ures indicate that approximately &euro;5 billion in taxpayers&rsquo; money was used to fund the reliefs to which I refer.  The subsequent cost-benefit analysis &mdash; I give credit to the Minister for undertaking this &mdash; showed that much of this money was wasted.</P>
        <P>The review of the previous plan, which is contained in its successor, does not, by any stretch of the imagination, represent an honest appraisal of what happened on the last occasion.  It reads more like a PR brochure than anything else.  For example, reference is not made to underperformance on projects, failures in respect of cost control, the failure to carry out proper cost-benefit analyses in order to rank projects and apply a strategic framework in respect of the choice of such projects, the manifest failure to put in place accompanying policy change in some areas to ensure we obtained value for money from the investments made, or the fact that the national spatial strategy arrived as an afterthought.  As the ESRI&rsquo;s mid-term review illustrated, no change was made to the strategic direction of the NDP after the spatial strategy was introduced.  These are serious issues and I do not know how it was possible to produce a chapter which was supposed to review the past but which failed to address any of them.  If we are to learn anything, we must examine the mistakes that have been made.  There is no evidence that the latter has happened.</P>
        <P>In my view, a new NDP must operate within an entirely new framework.  As stated previously, we must publish the cost-benefit analysis before we commit to allocating the funds.  The Minister is wholly wrong in keeping information in this regard secret.  There must be a gateway system under which people will be held accountable for the performance of these projects.  This must be done in public in order that we can see what is happening.</P>
        <P>A new set of strategic priorities is required.  I do not see any evidence that breaking the link between carbon emissions and economic growth, addressing the decline we are experiencing in competitiveness or planning sustainable communities are to the fore in this plan.  No strategic thinking has been done in respect of these serious challenges.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt> <P>It is extraordinary that under the programme for climate change contained in the plan, only one sub-programme of investment is mentioned, namely, the &euro;270 million to buy carbon credits.  In other words, the only purpose of this programme is to delay the serious decisions that must be made in this area.  In the meantime, areas in which there are many opportunities to perform better are being left unfunded.</P>
     
        <P>We must get to grips with this matter in a way that the Government has failed to do.  This is a major global challenge and the countries that are slow to respond &mdash; Ireland is proving to be one <Col N="1507"/>of them &mdash; will pay a much higher cost.  There is a clear advantage for those who move quickly to respond to these challenges.  However, nothing is happening in that regard in this country.  We have made no efforts to make our patterns of development sustainable.  Under those patterns of development, approximately 500,000 homes were built in the past decade.  The level of emissions per house, even when one adjusts for climate, is almost double the EU average.  The emissions per car are 50% higher than the European Union average.  Despite our natural advantage in renewables we are trailing in the development of renewables.  There is no evidence that the Government is addressing this in a serious or concerted way.  The plan states that the Government wants all developed countries to commit to a cut from 50% to 30% by 2020.  It is hypocritical to call for that when we are not taking the measures at home that must be taken to address that problem.</P>
        <P>We must get real on this issue.  Firm targets must be set as to what we will achieve and decisions must be made such as, for example, that on the interconnector.  There is no public money committed to the interconnector.  Everyone knows that is the key to expanding the renewables in our generation sector but there is no commitment to the date or the money.  Reference was made to 2012 but there is no explicit commitment of funds.</P>
        <P>Energy research will be a key element if we want to make our homes, traffic and systems more energy efficient.  Less than &euro;1 in every &euro;40 goes to energy research.  It is near the bottom of the list.  The Minister referred to the shift to public transport but under the next programme five times as much money will be spent on road as on rail.  We must set serious targets, which are absent, and have policies linked to those targets.  That thinking, which is the core to a proper strategy, is not in evidence in the plan.</P>
        <P>Competitiveness is the other major area we must square up to but I do not see it in this plan.  There is reference to all the traditional sectors taking the lion&rsquo;s share of moneys that will go under enterprise, research and innovation funding but there are no plans or programmes for the areas where we must look to the future &mdash; financial services, software, biotechnology, audiovisual, nanotechnology and so on.  Those are the areas where we ought to develop the programmes of the future that will provide employment for the young people in our schools now.  Instead, the programmes are for long-established sectors and they dominate the moneys.</P>
        <P>On the research funds, it is right that we should invest more in this area but only &euro;1 in every &euro;5 of the research budgets the Government is providing will be for enterprise-led research and innovation.  That is the defect because even foreign owned companies are devoting less than <Col N="1508"/>1% of their turnover to research and development where best practice would indicate it should be close to 4%.  Irish companies are not much better in that regard.  We must drive the notion that industry and networks of employers must be at the heart of these research and development strategies.  It is all very well to fund programmes in universities but we must ensure that trickles down to where it is needed but we have failed in that regard.  A recent Competitiveness Council report stated we are one of the only countries that has seen a deterioration of the linkage between the ivory towers-type university and enterprise in research and development.  We have deteriorated while all the other countries are improving.</P>
        <P>The other major challenge is broadband coverage.  The metropolitan area networks have not achieved the reach intended.  They are not reaching ordinary homes.  They may be available to multinational companies in these towns but they are not getting the broadband reach.  Northern Ireland made the investment and decided to opt for 100% coverage.  There are no new ideas in this national development plan about how we will achieve broadband coverage on the required scale.  Everyone realises we cannot continue to lag at the bottom of those league tables.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed in this NDP.  There is much that is welcome.  No one will complain about commitments to social and affordable housing or any of the other areas but we must get the framework right.  We must build social and affordable houses in sustainable communities and we must have strategic thinking about the development of areas, including schools, but that has not happened.</P>
        <P>On the strategic development zones, about which Deputy Burton would know more, Adamstown is the only case where the SDZ power has been used.  We are not using the planning framework we passed in this House to impose the coherent and sustainable patterns of development we need.</P>
        <P>This is a case of one cheer for the NDP.  I welcome the investment commitment but we have much to learn about taking a strategic approach to the use of public money, ensuring we deliver value for money and the necessary changes in key areas.  We must face up to the challenges in competitiveness and climate change early.  If we do not, we will face them at huge cost.</P>

	<P>I understand the launch of the national development programme cost in the region of &euro;300,000 for the brochures and leaflets accompanying the plan.  At the staging of the launch, we saw the ambassadors to Ireland, the social partners, the great and the good lined up. <Col N="1509"/> It reminded me of the politburo in the 1950s when they lined up to listen to the next great five year plan.  If there was an official artist to the Government, as in Stalin&rsquo;s day, the artist would paint the event in all its glory.</P>
        <P>The national development plan is a collection of party political election promises dressed up in the language of national rather than party targets.  At 400 pages, it is probably the longest election leaflet in the history of the democratic world.  As election leaflets go it is pricey, at &euro;300,000, but despite containing 400 pages of electioneering, surprisingly, it has less than ten pages of costings.  In that context it should be judged as a political document because its motivation and timing is entirely political.</P>
        <P>We should bear in mind that if the previous national development plans and the proposals of Ministers opposite had been believable in terms of the rhetoric delivered, we would have a functioning metro serving the airport, which was announced for 2007 by the then Minister, Deputy Brennan.  We would have the longed-for reorganised functioning hospital system.  We would have a decentralised public administration in addition to the hubs, the gateways and so on, all of which were promised for 2007.  The guarantee given for the 90th anniversary of the rising that all children under nine would be in classes of 20 or fewer would be implemented.  That was another target for 2007.  Our young people would have the reasonable expectation that they could aspire to buying a home of their own.  After nine and a half years of Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government, much of the nation&rsquo;s infrastructure, to quote the letter the Taoiseach wrote to Brussels on the Civil Service, is not fit for purpose.</P>
        <P>On the costing and funding of the programme, we debated the Moriarty report yesterday.  Do the Taoiseach and Fianna F&aacute;il operate in a world of blank cheques?  The crucial difference between this plan and others is that it is the taxpayer who will foot almost the entire bill.  I note the Minister acknowledged that today when he stated the plan does not have to be approved by Brussels.  There has been no external evaluation of the costings and the reasonableness of what is contained in the plan.  The plans in 1989, 1994 and 2000 were effectively submissions to the European Union on the way Ireland planned to spend EU money within a Community support framework.  That does not apply now.</P>
        <P>There are no seven year tax projections in the plan.  I asked the Minister about that and he gave me tax projections for the next two years.  I was delighted to find they were largely in line with the projections the Labour Party used at the conference at the weekend about which the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, appeared to have a problem on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;.  An inflation impact study should have been done because Ireland <Col N="1510"/>now has the highest cost of living and we are joint second in the euro inflation league with Slovenia, behind Greece and drifting upwards.</P>
        <P>Neither were there carbon costings to the plan.  Ireland faces a serious challenge with carbon costings.  In 2013, at the end of this plan, the full impact of our Kyoto agreements will kick in.  The &euro;270 million set aside in the plan will be peanuts compared to the penalties we will incur unless we get our act together.  Before the budget, I put forward a proposal that all public spending should be carbon-costed for its carbon imprint.  The Minister will be aware of the notion of examining the carbon footprint.  He is Minister Bigfoot when it comes to the size of the carbon footprint he is leaving.  Ultimately, the taxpayer foots the bill for Kyoto fines.  If the Kyoto process is expanded, Ireland may face charges that could well constitute a new and severe national debt on our children and grandchildren.  This is not included in the plan.</P>
        <P>Who is Mr. National Development Plan?  Is there a plaque in the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance or the other various Departments which states the responsibility for the national development plan stops here?  Are there rewards if matters go well or punishment and change if not?  There is no evidence of who has ultimate responsibility for the plan.</P>
        <P>Of the &euro;184 billion proposed spending over the next seven years, some &euro;78 billion or 42% of the total expenditure, is capital spend on infrastructure, the real meat in the sandwich.  That is what will allow us to buy and spend on a functioning public transport system, improving the hospital infrastructure and addressing the carbon fund issues.  It will allow us to address issues such as ensuring a couple or single person, working and paying tax, can look forward to purchasing a home.</P>
        <P>Social housing, public health and education all feature in the plan but after ten years of a Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government, we now have the first well-educated and hard-working young generation, on modest and moderate incomes, who cannot purchase a home.  This generation are up at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning and returning home at seven in the evening.  That generation&rsquo;s work ethic leaves that of many Members in the shade.  Although they belong to a hard-work culture, where does the plan state young people can reasonably expect to have a home while the builders and developers are coining it?  What about those parents of children of four years of age in west Dublin, Meath and Kildare who ask me where will their children go to school?</P>
        <P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s response to the recent report published by Urban Forum?  It correctly stated that a series of high speed rail links between Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick are needed.  Where is the visionary thinking that will <Col N="1511"/>stabilise the growth of the Dublin region and improve the growth of other major cities?  The plan implies that the decentralisation programme announced by the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, is dead.  There is a proposal for renewed centres and gateways but the flesh on the bones of the proposals is weak.</P>
        <P>Labour, as part of an alternative incoming Government, will go through the plan to determine what is in the public interest and what is socially just and equitable.  The plan will need dramatic revision to develop the country to the standards our young people deserve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance must be disappointed so little attention is being paid by the House to the national development plan.  I would like more time, before and after the election, to debate the plan.</P>
        <P>I am saddened we have learned nothing from the first national development plan.  The new plan fits into the straitjacket of the expenditure profiles that Brussels demands.  It has even adopted a seven year timeframe, which is an arbitrary timeframe related to the EU budgetary process and not to Ireland&rsquo;s needs.  This is not a plan but a series of programmes of expenditure.  The plan contains three maps of a loose and non-indicative kind.  Is it possible to examine an overall map of the integration of all local authority development plans in the Department of Finance?  Is there a collective picture of what Ireland might look like if those plans were implemented in the next five years?  If the Minister cannot answer these questions, then it cannot be called a plan.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Burton has pointed out it seems no one is in charge.  Is it listed in the IPA yearbook or any other directory?  The Department of the Taoiseach is supposed to have nominal responsibility for the plan.  Deputy Martin, when Minister for Health and Children, indicated that the real project manager of the implementation of the plan is the Taoiseach.  However, he is a busy man and project implementation at this scale is a full-time job.</P>
        <P>The main reason Members on this side of the House are critical about this massive amount of expenditure is the failure to properly implement the last plan.  The main reason for that lay in the lack of project management.  The Minister claimed the NRA had got its act together and improved its project management.  It will, however, not get its act together until it communicates with the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science and the energy sector.  Some 42% of the plan is capital expenditure.  The synergy required for such large scale projects will not be created unless the planning of the expenditure is connected between the various agencies involved.  There is no connection between the plans of the Department of Education and Science and population forecasting <Col N="1512"/>sections in local authorities.  There is no connection between the Department of Health and Children and the provision of health facilities ahead of demand.</P>
        <P>The key revealing phrase that has bedevilled successive Administrations is contained in the report.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . removing the remaining infrastructure bottlenecks that constrain our economic development and inhibit balanced regional development and environmental sustainability.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is the bottleneck culture that has created the monster referred to by the Urban Forum.  We are following the traffic jams.  As Dublin expands further, more land is released for development.  The plan must be fundamentally reviewed.  The Department of Finance must recognise that its method of integrated physical planning has failed.  There is no synergy and it must be reconnected.  Is the Department of Finance the right body to act as the financial controller and the innovator of the plan?  That is an inherent contradiction and it does not work.</P>
        <P>The global climate conditions in which the plan was formulated have dramatically changed.  The plan does not refer to the Stern report or the UN scientists&rsquo; report on global warming.  It does not refer to the unsustainability of current development trends.  The plan represents an unsustainable economic and physical model unless it is radically altered.  I do not know whether the Minister intends to review this or how that might be done.</P>
        <P>The document comprises a series of programme spending proposals but there is no accountability or methodology for assessing results.  There is no indication, for example, that the Department of Education and Science will be informed in advance when new roads are being constructed.  There is no mechanism whereby that Department could be informed of planning permissions for new housing so that it will not be surprised, four or five years later, that 300 or 400 young children need places in local schools.  There is no initiative to link such issues.  That lesson was clearly not learned from the last plan.</P>
        <P>I hope my party, Fine Gael and the Green Party will be in government after the next election so that we can completely rewrite this plan in a manner that makes sense in the context of present needs and the wonderful background of limitless resources the current Government enjoys.  Managing those resources in the wrong way introduces unlimited costs that will be unsustainable into the future.</P>

	<P>This debate is inadequate, consisting merely of statements and no motions.  Given the scale of the plan and the proposed expenditure, a two-day session should have been allocated, including a vote on a motion.  This would impart a sense of ownership that what is before us has been scrutinised to some extent.</P>
        <P>What the Government has presented as a national development plan falls far short of such.  This is a nakedly political document, the longest election manifesto in the history of Irish politics.  For this reason, it must be treated cynically.  There has been no meaningful engagement with social and political actors.  This is the plan of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government; it is hardly a plan of the Irish people for the Irish people.  That would become more clear if we were to have an effective debate.</P>
        <P>What was presented by the Minister in his speech as a fully costed document is nothing of the sort.  A recent question I put to him on the lack of a strategic environmental assessment of the plan, something that is a feature of the national plans of other EU countries, met with the response that such was not required because the costings were purely indicative.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  It is either a fully costed document or it is purely indicative.  This is the flaw at the heart of the plan.  The assessments that underline it in terms of future inflation trends mean that the total figure of &euro;184 billion will likely be exceeded.</P>
        <P>The main problem with the Government&rsquo;s proposals is that the balance which the last national development plan failed to put in place is also missing in this plan.  The underspend on regional development in the last plan was disgraceful.  The imbalance in terms of transport infrastructure is a price we continue to pay.  The Minister may point to the figures for the roads and public transport elements of the plan.  An examination of the proposals for public transport, however, show they are not being brought forward as a mechanism for improving regional development.  There is little in the national plan that allows public transport infrastructure to be developed in Galway, Limerick and Cork.  The summary document of the national development plan contains the legend, in the second sentence about public transport, that the money will be spent especially in the greater Dublin area.  How can a Government present a national development plan that contains such clauses?  The Government either believes public transport is something the entire country needs or it will continue to make the mistakes it has made in the last ten years.</P>
        <P>I repeat calls made by other speakers in this debate that this can only be seen as a working document.  If and when a new Government is established, once the people have been consulted, there are many elements of this plan that must be modified or deleted.  The essential factor is that this development plan represents business as <Col N="1514"/>usual.  Despite the Minister&rsquo;s boast, there is no give on environmental sustainability.  It is merely r&aacute;im&eacute;is and public relations talk.  That the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government repeats this r&aacute;im&eacute;is shows that the Government&rsquo;s interest in the environment and sustainability is merely a cynical exercise in reheating press releases about actions it has not taken and continues not to take.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although the proposals to finance infrastructure spending in Northern Ireland are welcome, why are all those infrastructure links based on roads?  Why does the national development plan not seek to enhance public transport links between the two parts of this island?  The Government still does not understand what sustainability is all about and how it can be achieved.  This, above all else, is the reason that the people will make the decision to elect a new Government. This is a flawed document that fails to meet the needs of the State in the coming decade.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have sufficient time to address this plan in any substantial way.  Instead, I will address a local issue that arises from this plan and its predecessor.  I am sure I will be accused of being parochial but I make no apology for that.</P>
        <P>I make a plea to the Minister for Finance on behalf of the people of Carrick-on-Suir, which was absolutely abandoned in this and the previous plan.  Some 890 people are unemployed in Carrick-on-Suir &mdash; an unemployment rate of<?oasys _jy ?>25%, or six times the national average.  The Minister&rsquo;s party has been in government for 18 of the past 20 years and this is simply not good enough.  Despite the hundreds of billions of euro allocated under this and the last plan, 890 people are unemployed out of a total population of 5,000.  This is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to prioritise Carrick-on-Suir by creating a jobs task force that will help put some of these people back to work.  They were annoyed recently when the Minister for Social and Family Affairs suggested that they should start signing on for training at an earlier date.  These people are blue in the face from signing on for training.  They want the Government to create employment for their town.  We cannot allow the situation to continue where there is a rate of 25% unemployment in a small town like Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I absolutely support planning that is effective in the sense that there is a connection between where people live, how they travel and the support services available in their communities.  This plan, however, essentially offers a system of individual development plans on a county-by-county basis.  I cannot see any relationship between those individual plans and the delivery of critical services.  There are lists of schools, public transport projects and other com<Col N="1515"/>munity projects, but the only amenities that are delivered are those that are attractive to the market.  It is basically a system of development with some planning controls rather than a system of planning.</P>
        <P>Unless we deal with the underlying problem, we will not find a solution.  The definition of madness is taking the same action repeatedly and expecting a different result.  I do not have any expectation that this plan will be delivered in full because it offers no change in how we plan and implement development projects.  If changes are not made to rectify the pattern of non-delivery, costly overruns and time delays that were a feature of the last two development plans, we will not reach a solution.</P>
        <P>The largest single public transport initiative in the greater Dublin area is the interconnector.  Provision is made for this in the plan under Transport 21 but there is no expectation it will be delivered for a further two years after the plan is completed.  I see no reason that key public transport component, which would make such a difference to Dublin and the surrounding counties, cannot be advanced.</P>
        <P>Child care is heavily dependent on building facilities but the underlying costs have not been addressed.  Schools are provided on the basis of crisis management.  In the area of disability, an amount of money has been identified without an assessment of what we need to spend to give people the rights to which they are entitled and, in many cases, to turn them into taxpayers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Transforming Ireland &mdash; A Better Quality of Life for All is ironic when one considers that for many people, their quality of life has not improved significantly during the Government&rsquo;s time in office.  That is why the new national development plan and all its promises must be approached with extreme scepticism.  People&rsquo;s quality of life has not improved precisely because of a failure to manage economic growth and to plan for, and meet, the needs of a changing State.  </P>
        <P>There has been a failure to make the necessary interventions to prevent urban sprawl and to ensure employment is created outside the greater Dublin area.  Delivery of infrastructure has been delayed by the insistence on using public private partnerships.  The sell off of State assets has continued apace regardless of the future implications for the State&rsquo;s strategic interest.  While the population has expanded rapidly, public services, such as health, education and public transport, have not been expanded to meet our population&rsquo;s needs.  Commitments in respect of public transport are among those not met in the last plan.</P>
        <P>Policies pursued by the Government have contributed to a situation where, in most families, both parents must work to pay enormous mortgages.  We have failed to develop child care infra<Col N="1516"/>structure and a system of pre-school education which these new parents need.</P>
        <P>While action to tackle climate change has begun to be taken elsewhere across the globe, this Government has again done almost nothing.  Urban sprawl has accelerated and we have become a society ever more dependent on cars.  Traffic congestion is choking this city and the recent upsurge in emissions output has been linked to the transport sector.</P>
        <P>Employment remains concentrated in the Dublin region and we are precariously over dependent on foreign multinationals.  Our competitiveness is being undermined by the failure to roll out key communications infrastructure, namely, broadband, as a consequence of the privatisation of Eircom.  Our manufacturing base continues to decline with the food sector coming under increasing pressure from foreign multiples.</P>
        <P>Privatisation is also a part of this plan.  It is proposed that public private partnerships comprise 39% of spending on public transport.  Such partnerships make no economic sense if a structure delivered in this way costs more and takes longer to deliver because of the complex procurement procedures.</P>
        <P>As we look at this plan, we cannot be expected to forget that many of the targets in the previous NDP were not achieved on time or on budget, that many programmes remain unfinished and that it failed, in particular, in respect of the objective to achieve balanced regional development and tackling inequality.  The latest UNICEF figures, which rank Ireland 19th out of 21 industrialised countries in respect of the proportion of children who experience poverty and hardship, confirm the findings of other reports.  The gap is widening between rich and poor and Ireland is one of the most unequal societies in the world.</P>
        <P>Other speakers spoke about the all-Ireland dimension to the plan.  Sinn F&eacute;in lobbied for an increased focus on cross-Border development.  We look forward to the implementation of commitments such as re-opening the Ulster Canal and the construction of the bridge at Narrow Water for which Sinn F&eacute;in has actively campaigned.  While the plan is not a genuinely national, fully integrated all-Ireland development plan, which we would like, this must be a goal for any future plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank those who contributed to the debate.  We have a sustainable and achievable framework.  Programmes in the past were maintenance rather than capital ones.  We now have a substantial capital investment framework going forward.  It is not only a capital framework in that this structure of the plan is in keeping with the Towards 2016 ten-year framework agreed with the social partners.  They are meeting in plenary session this morning and the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste are attending.  I was surprised that there was some criticism of <Col N="1517"/>them not being in this House this morning.  I do not believe anyone would contend that they should be anywhere else this morning other than at the social partnership plenary forum.</P>
        <P>It is a question of pursuing economic policies which will also bring us a greater degree of social justice and social inclusion and greater participation by everyone in our society with people contributing to their greatest potential.  A vision is outlined within the social partnership context of an internationally competitive economy which seeks to promote social justice, increase participation and deal with the historic infrastructural deficits that can be addressed in the window of opportunity which presents itself before higher social costs, particularly in the areas of pensions and health, will perhaps deny us the opportunity to move forward.</P>
        <P>As a percentage of GNP, we have set out an annual capital investment programme of approximately 5.4%.  That is not a ratcheting up to the extent one saw at the beginning of the previous plan when we did not have a programme of this magnitude.  With the increased capacity in the construction industry and the ability of international consortia to bid and tender for and carry out major complex jobs, particularly in the transport area, due for completion during the course of this plan, one would not expect to see the inflationary impact on the construction side which unfortunately was a feature of the early years of the last plan given that tender inflation on construction contracts has been 3% to 4% in recent years.</P>
        <P>The Government strongly contends that we can proceed with the five priority areas identified, namely, economic infrastructure; social infrastructure; human capital; enterprise, technology and innovation; and social inclusion.</P>
        <P>On the level of integration, the spatial strategy came out in 2002.  Regional policy guidelines are now in place.  As people know, there is an improvement in development planning at county and at local area planning levels.  At all times, cognisance has been taken of the larger strategic framework that has informed the decisions which have now been finalised at local government level so we can proceed.</P>
        <P>We have a gateway formula for the purpose of creating critical mass in the regions.  It is undoubtedly the optimal fashion in which we can effect regional development more effectively and efficiently than has been the case in the past.  We have reached a stage in our economic and social development to make that an attainable objective on the basis of the resources we are creating and the objectives which have been agreed in terms of a shared vision at social partnership level.</P>
        <P>I thank those who contributed to the debate, some of whom have been critical.  I do not accept the contention that this is a party political document.  It is the result of a consultation process.  I attended consultations and I spoke to people and <Col N="1518"/>listened to what they had to say.  The social partnership process ensures we have a far wider consultative and structured process than may have been the case in the past.</P>
        <P>The process works and is recognised for its value in terms of ensuring we get the greatest possible buy-in to the strategic objectives we have outlined and the cross-cutting objectives, for example, in regard to all-island co-operation, which was mentioned.  These are important new facets of this plan which we hope can be partnered with a devolved administration in the North and the British Government because many of our strategic interests coincide.  I hope that during the course of this plan, we will see a deepening of that shared approach so the logic of an island economy can complement the social and policy objectives both sides of the island share.</P>

    <Title>Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007: Second Stage. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am pleased to bring the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007 before the House.  In doing so I propose to give effect to a key recommendation of the task force on student behaviour that section 29 of the Education Act 1998 be revisited with a view to amending it to stress the rights of the compliant majority to learn while at the same time protecting the rights of the individual student to an education.</P>
        <P>I established the task force on student behaviour in early 2005 to examine the issue of disruptive behaviour in our second level schools, to consider effective strategies already employed, to advise on best practice in fostering positive behaviour and to make recommendations on how best to promote an improved climate for teaching and learning in our schools.  The report of the task force, School Matters, put forward a number of recommendations to place schools in a stronger <Col N="1519"/>position to meet the challenges of motivating and catering for their entire student cohort, including those whose troubling behaviour was reflective of a wider societal breakdown of acceptable norms of courtesy and civility.</P>
        <P>At the core of the recommendations of the task force was the putting in place of a national behaviour support service, NBSS.  The NBSS is now in place and has already commenced its engagement with schools and intensive work will begin shortly with a number of schools most in need of its intervention.  As part of this initial engagement, the NBSS invited schools across the country to formally make application to benefit from its services.  As a result of this process, the NBSS has now completed its consideration of 124 applications that were received from individual schools for support, including the establishment of behaviour support classrooms.  The applicant schools are drawn from each of the school sectors and represent a good geographic and gender profile mix.</P>
        <P>Based on careful consideration of each application, 50 schools have now been identified to receive support as part of a phased roll-out of activity under the new service.  Each of these 50 schools will now be shortly notified of their participation and a progressive roll-out of services to these schools will commence immediately after the forthcoming mid-term break.</P>
        <P>The task force report, in its recommendations to schools, also provided valuable insights into strategies and approaches for dealing with disruptive students.  It set these in the context of a whole school approach to the issue of discipline and I am sure that the report itself will be a useful tool for schools in developing their responses to this issue.  It is inevitable, however, that some students by their behaviour will leave their schools with little option but to use the last resorts of long-term suspension or permanent exclusion.  It is vitally important that these sanctions remain avenues of last resort and are not taken lightly.</P>
        <P>In such circumstances, the appeal system under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 has, since it commenced in 2001, provided parents and students over the age of 18 with an avenue of independent review when this difficult rubicon is to be crossed.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides that an appeal may be made to the Secretary General of my Department against a decision by a school&rsquo;s board of management to permanently exclude a student, suspend a student for more than 20 days cumulative in any school year or refuse to enrol a student.</P>
        <P>The task force, in dealing with section 29, outlined the concerns expressed by school representatives regarding their experience with what it termed &ldquo;this evolving aspect of the new legislative framework&rdquo;.  However, the task force also drew particular attention to the view of the National Educational Welfare Board that the <Col N="1520"/>advent of the appeals system had been positive for schools and had prompted schools to re-examine and review their policies, and to ensure, as far as possible, that policies and procedures were balanced, fair and transparent.  In this respect I am glad to report that the National Educational Welfare Board is currently finalising comprehensive guidelines for schools on developing and implementing effective codes of behaviour.</P>
        <P>The task force recommended that my Department revisit section 29 of the Education Act 1998 with a view to amending it to stress the rights of the compliant majority to learn while at the same time protecting the rights of the persistently disruptive student to an education.  Following a review of the legislation, officials of my Department provided briefings for all of the education partners on the changes which were being considered to the Education Act 1998 and, in particular, the redefinition of section 29 of the Act.  There was a general welcome for the proposals, as outlined, and the partners indicated broad support for the proposals at the briefing sessions.  I propose, in this Bill, to amend section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to take account of the task force recommendations on the appeals process.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007 will require a section 29 appeal committee dealing with an appeal relating to expulsion or long-term suspension to take account of the educational interests of other students in the school, as well as the interests of the student who is the subject of the appeal, when deciding on the case.  The Bill sets out a range of factors that an appeals committee will have to consider in dealing with expulsions and long-term suspensions, including the nature, scale and extent of the student&rsquo;s behaviour which gave rise to the suspension or expulsion, the reasonableness of efforts made by the school to enable the student to participate in and benefit from education, the educational interests of the student concerned and the desirability and practicality of enabling the student to continue to participate in and benefit from education with his or her peers in the school setting.  They will also have to take into account the educational interests of the other students in the school and the maintenance of a classroom environment which is supportive of learning.</P>
        <P>The safety, health and welfare of teachers, students and staff of the school will be also among the factors to be considered.  The school&rsquo;s code of behaviour and any other relevant policies will also be looked at.</P>
        <P>The aim of the Bill is to provide a clearly stated statutory framework within which an appeals committee must determine an appeal and provide for a balancing of rights between the educational interests of the student who is taking the appeal and the educational interests of the school community as a whole.</P><Col N="1521"/>
        <P>The task force also recommended that a protocol be provided to assist school boards in the preparation for an appeal.  This recommendation will be given effect to in the revision of the procedures for hearing and determining an appeal.  These procedures,  currently required and in place under the Act, provide the administrative framework within which appeals are dealt with.  The procedures will be revised and expanded to reflect a level of detail which would not be appropriate to the primary legislation but which will be of practical assistance to all parties to an appeal.  Consideration will also be given to putting the procedures into the more formally structured framework of a statutory instrument.  Further consultations with all of the education partners will inform this process.</P>
        <P>The Bill allows the Minister to regulate for the suspension of the time limit for hearing an appeal during periods of school closures, for example school holiday periods.  This was also a specific recommendation of the task force.  Currently appeals are dealt with on a year-round basis.  This provision will be expanded upon in the proposed revision of the procedures for hearing and determining an appeal.</P>
        <P>The Bill allows for a section 29 appeals committee to refuse to hear an appeal, or to continue with an appeal, which may be frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process and to draw inferences from the failure of parties to an appeal to comply with requirements made of it, for example on requests for information or clarity of a position.  This may arise in particular in respect of refusals to enrol where there may be a dispute as to whether or not a formal application was made or a definitive decision was taken on an application.</P>
        <P>Specifically with regard to refusals to enrol, the Bill will extend the application of section 29(1)(<i>c</i>) to situations where a child is refused enrolment to an all-Irish division of a school.  This addresses an anomaly which exists at present in respect of schools which contain a separate all-Irish division or Aonad.  At present, a child could be refused enrolment to the Aonad but would not have a right of appeal if offered a place in the English language stream within the school.  This provision will now permit an appeal, in its own right, in respect of a refused enrolment to an all-Irish division of a school.</P>
        <P>The Bill also ensures that a section 29 appeals committee does not hear an appeal which is being or has been dealt with under the appellate functions provided under section 10 the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and <i>vice versa</i>.  The Bill ensures however, that the National Council for Special Education, like the National Educational Welfare Board, will be able to make submissions, as it considers appropriate, to an appeals committee dealing with an appeal under section 29.</P>
        <P>A number of minor amendments to other parts of the Education Act 1998 are also contained in <Col N="1522"/>the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007.  Section 53 of the Education Act currently permits the Minister to restrict access to information which would enable the compilation of school league tables based on students&rsquo; academic performance and to information relating to the identity of examiners involved in the State examinations.  As the State Examinations Commission, SEC, has operational responsibility for the conduct of State examinations, the Bill will extend section 53 to the SEC.</P>
        <P>The Bill will address procedural matters relating to the functions of the chief inspector and will change some of the functions of the inspectorate under section 13 of the Education Act. Certain functions of the inspectorate in respect of examinations and psychological assessments are now performed by the State Examinations Commission, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the National Educational Psychological Service respectively and the Bill will amend the inspectorate&rsquo;s functions to reflect this.  The Bill also amends section 13 of the Education Act 1998 to allow the chief inspector to delegate his or her functions to another inspector and permits the Minister to appoint an acting chief inspector in the event of illness or incapacity of the chief inspector.</P>
        <P>The Bill will also give effect to the Government decision to establish the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork as a national cultural institution within the remit of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  In this regard, the Bill provides that the Minister can order the transfer of the lands and property of the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork from the City of Cork Vocational Education Committee to the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P>I hope the Deputies will agree with me regarding the positive benefits of this Bill and I look forward to listening and debating the various provisions with the Members of the House.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>A year ago, when this House debated a Fine Gael motion on school discipline, the Minister for Education and Science minimised the extreme difficulties that schools have faced in dealing with discipline problems due to section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.  Referring to the debate as alarmist, she said that schools could overcome difficulties with the 1998 legislation if they had proper procedures in place.</P>
        <P>The penny has finally dropped.  I welcome this legislation, late as it is, and the attempt that is finally being made to address the imbalance in the legislation to give schools more authority in how they deal with challenging or unacceptable behaviour.</P>
        <P>There are several aspects to this legislation but clearly the most important purpose of this Bill is to amend section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.  For this reason, I do not propose to concentrate on the amendments this Bill makes to the 1998 <Col N="1523"/>Education Act to take account of the enactment of the 2000 Education Welfare Act, and the later establishment of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the National Educational Psychological Service, the State Examinations Commission and the National Council for Special Education, although I may table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the 1998 Education Act sets out the mechanism by which a parent or student who has reached the age of 18 may appeal against a decision of a school to expel, suspend or refuse to enrol same student.  This appeal must be made to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science, with the existing legislation stipulating that an appeals committee, comprising at least one inspector, will be appointed by the Minister to hear the case.  For some considerable time, however, there have been difficulties in the operation of the legislation.  Most seriously, schools have been placed in the most unacceptable situation where valid and necessary expulsions have been overturned.</P>
        <P>The Irish Vocational Education Association highlighted this problem when commenting that some previously expelled pupils returned to their schools &ldquo;with a swagger, having achieved a victory against the school authorities&rdquo;.  This situation undermines the authority of individual teachers, and of the school itself, to insist on a reasonable level of proper behaviour.  Also, the message this sends out to young people is that there is no action that can be taken against unacceptable behaviour.  This is a very unwise message for our school system and for broader society.  In 2005 alone, the Department of Education and Science overturned eight expulsions and three suspensions at post-primary level.</P>
        <P>A further problem with section 29 of the 1998 Education Act is that the legislation fails to refer to the behaviour of the student which may have lead to the problem in the first instance.  In addition, the legislation does not mention the needs of all pupils at the school, and how they are being adversely affected by poor behaviour, or even to the health and safety needs of teachers, students and other people employed at the school.</P>
        <P>These are serious legislative lapses and I was surprised to hear the Minister minimise the problems that schools face in ensuring acceptable discipline when I raised this matter last year.  It was all the more surprising given that the interim report of the task force on student behaviour, which was available to all of us last February, made it clear that section 29 was being used to undermine the authority of schools in expelling seriously disruptive students, and found that this was leading to schools being forced to accept as students young people previously expelled for seriously disruptive behaviour.  The task force also noted that in these cases, the student returns <Col N="1524"/>to the school secure in the knowledge that there is no real action the authorities can take against their unacceptable behaviour.</P>
        <P>The draft proposals we are debating this morning include a number of provisions which go some way towards addressing the deficiencies in the 1998 legislation.  Under these new proposals, an appeals committee shall now consider: the nature, scale and persistence of the behaviour of the student; the reasonableness of the efforts made by the school to accommodate the student; the educational interests of the student; the educational interests of all other students at the school; the safety, health and welfare of all students, teachers and other staff at the school; and the policies of the school regarding such behaviour and related issues.</P>
        <P>This is a step forward but I remain concerned that if this legislation is enacted schools may still find themselves in the situation whereby they are forced to re-admit a pupil who, through his or her own unacceptable behaviour, has been suspended or expelled from the school.</P>
        <P>When this legislation reaches Committee Stage, I will submit amendments to improve the position of schools in dealing with unacceptable behaviour.  I have said many times we must not emasculate schools regarding how they deal with this issue.  We must respect the fact that the decision to suspend or expel a student is never taken lightly, and direct our legislation to acknowledge this fact.  For this reason, the legislation should be amended so that it is absolutely clear that where a committee examining an appeal comes to certain conclusions, then that appeal committee could only in the most exceptional of cases recommend overturning the decision of the school to expel or suspend a student.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The conclusion that the appeals committee would have to come to would be as follows: a school had acted properly, in terms of notifying the student and his or her parents at each step of the process towards suspension or expulsion; it had acted reasonably, in terms of taking the final decision to expel or suspend the student; it had acted in accordance with its policies; and that these policies were well-communicated to all students and their families.  Where an appeals committee is of the belief that these three conditions have been met by the school authorities, overturning the decision of the school must only be taken in the most exceptional of cases.  Inserting this type of clear statement into the legislation will recognise that schools do not act lightly in this matter and will empower them further to deal with seriously disruptive and unacceptable behaviour.  This would be good for schools, for teachers, for all students and for our young people.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned that the draft legislation does not place a specific onus on the appeals committee in respect of students suspended or <Col N="1525"/>expelled for reasons due to violence or the threat of violence.  I understand the Department of Education and Skills in Britain has introduced guidelines of this type which state that schools will not normally reinstate a student expelled for this reason.  The absence of a specific reference to this issue in these proposals is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>This is particularly appropriate given the recent attack on a teacher at a school in Dublin.  Following this attack, a teacher has been left with a broken nose and several broken teeth.  This is a matter that will be considered by the school board of management and is under investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so I will not speculate further on this case.  However, it unfortunately is just the most recent example of violence against a teacher.  I will also table an amendment on this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of the difficulties that schools face in dealing with unacceptable behaviour stem without doubt from under-funding in our education system.  For example, half of all primary schools still have no access to the National Educational Psychological Service almost a decade since the service was established.  Many young children who need assistance are being left behind and by the time they reach second-level schooling are growing increasingly frustrated with the system.  This contributes to poor classroom behaviour.  Access to essential services is, undoubtedly, important from an educational point of view.  These services, however, also contribute to children and young people settling into school properly, and go a long way to improving the classroom and school environment.</P>
        <P>Our trainee teachers must be given all the necessary assistance in dealing with disruptive behaviour in the best possible way.  Some inexperienced teachers, when presented with a case of serious indiscipline, may simply not know the best way in which this can be handled.  In these circumstances, a discipline problem might be exacerbated by inappropriate action from an inexperienced teacher.  All possible assistance should be given to new teachers to ensure that this does not happen.</P>
        <P>An expansion of the home-school liaison service should be prioritised so that problems in the home environment which may contribute to indiscipline can be properly assessed and assisted, along with greater co-operation between the Department of Education and Science and the HSE.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Guidance services in place in schools are poor at best.  Schools with an enrolment of less than 200 pupils receive only eight hours career guidance counselling per week.  Guidance counsellors could play an important role in improving the school environment through one-to-one and group involvement with students but at present are completely snowed under due to a lack of adequate resources.  Serious breaches of school discipline, <Col N="1526"/>or threatening behaviour against teachers, should be reported immediately to the Department of Education and Science, which should know the schools facing the greatest discipline challenges when allocating resources.  I welcome that the Minister has decided to assign behavioural support to 50 schools.  A further 74 schools have sought such support.  The Minister would accept that schools would not make such an application lightly.  When can the other 74 schools hope to have the support provided?  What exactly will the unit comprise?  Will it be a separate classroom or a group of people operating within the school as a whole?  Will some of the 50 schools experience space constraints to facilitate the unit and if so what steps will be taken to address that problem?</P>
        <P>Building a culture of acceptable behaviour in our schools has many dimensions.  It is important to enable schools to deal with unacceptable behaviour properly and amend section 29 of the Education Act 1998.  Resources are also key.  Other areas also require action from the Government, particularly tackling drug and alcohol abuse among young people and ensuring that bullying is stamped out when and where it happens.  Bullying is a deeply destructive behaviour that can have long-term negative consequences for individuals.  In some extreme cases it can lead to suicide.  Tackling both student discipline problems and bullying behaviour at school in tandem with each other would have a longer-term positive effect throughout society.  Young people must be given clearer guidance and direction when their behaviour is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Recent studies have shown an unacceptably high rate of bullying in our schools.  It is of grave concern that many teachers appear to feel unable to challenge certain types of bullying, for example homophobic bullying, especially when four of every five teachers are aware of verbal bullying using homophobic terms and 16% of them reported incidences of physical bullying in a homophobic context.  To take a longer-term view, workplace bullying costs Irish business up to &euro;3 billion per annum through poor productivity and absenteeism.  The children and young people of today will be the workers of tomorrow.  They must learn that unacceptable behaviour at school, whether it is directed at teachers or their peer students, will be tackled when and where it occurs.  This would also have a positive effect in tackling workplace bullying in later life.  Bullying is a vicious and destructive behaviour that must be addressed.  Children who are bullied cannot be left without support and help, particularly given that it can take generations for bullying to leave a family.  I call on the Minister to introduce a national anti-bullying strategy in all schools immediately.</P>
        <P>The young people of today have unprecedented access to hard drugs and alcohol.  The extent of the problem that faces us is considerable.  The European school survey project on <Col N="1527"/>alcohol and other drugs showed that Irish boys and girls aged 16 years are among the highest alcohol abusers in Europe in terms of binge drinking and drunkenness.  Some 16% of boys and 12% of girls in the 12 to 14 age group are regular drinkers.  In the 15 to 17 age group half of boys and girls are regular drinkers and drunkenness is commonplace.  There is documented use of cocaine, cannabis, ecstasy and opiates by 15 year olds, and these drugs are undoubtedly being used by younger children also.  It is abundantly clear that young people can gain easy access to drugs and alcohol.  I know the Minister will agree that this is having a profoundly negative effect on many young people.  They are being confirmed in bad and dangerous habits at a young age.  Their education and that of their peers is being damaged.  Drug and alcohol abuse at a young age is contributing to poor school performance and early school drop out.  Most seriously, it is causing serious harm to their health.</P>
        <P>We all know that peer pressure can be a major factor in how young people behave.  The need to be part of the group undoubtedly leads to some young people experimenting with alcohol or drugs, often against their better judgment.  We must give schools the tools and the support to tackle this problem as effectively as possible.  We need to consider the problem creatively, and examine new initiatives which could help to rid schools of the scourge of alcohol and drug abuse, and to empower young people to resist peer pressure.</P>
        <P>The existence of a voluntary random drug-testing scheme in schools would counteract this peer pressure.  For the first time, young people would be able to refuse to smoke that joint or pop that pill on the basis that there would be a very real chance they might be caught.  This would give young people, who might feel pressurised into taking drugs or alcohol, a way to just say no.  If a school decides to introduce random drug testing and if consent for this is given by parents or guardians, the Department of Education and Science should support this decision.  Each school management authority should be asked to decide whether it wishes to introduce random tests for drug and alcohol abuse.  If in favour, the school management should contact all parents and guardians and ask for their written consent that their child be included in any future random checks.  Tackling the scourge of alcohol and drug abuse is highly relevant to this debate, as tackling illegal drug use will contribute to building the type of atmosphere that we all want to see in place in our schools.</P>
        <P>I would like to see greater clarity on the issue of enrolments and intend to table amendments in this regard on Committee Stage.  I accept what the Minister said in her speech in this regard.  However, one of the hardest issues to tackle in the legislation is that in some cases children are <Col N="1528"/>not being refused enrolment.  Rather schools are adopting a policy of advising parents to wait and see, and come back later.  I recently came across the case of a child who tried to get into six different of schools, none of which refused him.  They all claimed not to have space but asked him to come back to them in a few weeks.  The child never got a letter advising that he could not enrol because the school was full.  I was advised that as he had not been refused enrolment, he could not avail of the section 29 procedures.  It is unfair to leave any child in that situation.  He is effectively unable to gain a place but has not been actually refused a place.  That issue should be addressed in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>We also support this necessary Bill.  This week we read of a teacher whose nose and teeth were broken by a student.  On the other side, from the children&rsquo;s point of view, a study by the anti-bullying unit in Trinity College suggested that 35% of boys and 19% of girls were physically attacked during a three-month period.  There is no doubt that there are serious problems in our schools that need to be effectively addressed.  There have been difficulties with section 29 and the task force on student behaviour proposed that this should be one of the measures the Minister should take in addressing the behaviour of students in schools.</P>
        <P>While we will be proposing amendments to the Bill, it only represents a small part of what is required and only implements a small number of the recommendations of the task force.  The Minister needs to implement some of the other measures.  While this represents a rebalancing of rights and all of us would feel that the rights of the majority of students who want to learn in schools need to be protected, at the same time the children who are being excluded from school also have rights.  As a society it will be to our peril if we fail to address the rights of those students also.  I would be concerned that the tone of what is being said in this debate focuses on getting them out of the schools, which could then simply operate for the majority of the children.  However, what happens to these young people?  We complain about anti-social behaviour.  John Lonergan has been quoted as saying that the level of education of people in prisons is very low.  We cannot simply cast them out, particularly when they are below school-leaving age, and expect the Prison Service to pick them up at a later stage.  That is no way to deal with young people and their rights to an education.  While we must look after the rights of the majority of students, we must also look after the rights of the minority who in some cases cause serious problems in schools.</P>
        <P>Before coming to the House for this debate, I took the opportunity to reread the recommendations of the task force report.  The task force was very good and I commend the Minister <Col N="1529"/>and its other members.  However, its approach was very much holistic and it was not just about kicking the troublemakers out of school.  It focuses on setting up the kind of environment in schools and communities around them that would prevent children from being expelled from schools through intervening at an early stage to identify problems.  There must be early diagnosis of disorders such as ADD, ADHD, dyslexia or others which cause young people to misbehave in school if we are to assist them, their families and schools.</P>
        <P>Chapter 10 of the report states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The interim report stressed the need for all the key players to come together in an effort to stem the corrosive influence of persistent, serious disruption in our schools.  We reiterate that call.  This teacht le ch&eacute;ile of stakeholders is a fundamental tenet of the set of Recommendations set out below.  Schools alone cannot supply all the remedies.  They need and deserve the support of the Department of Education and Science, management bodies, parents and society in general.  The Task Force calls on all the players to make their contribution and to do so in a spirit of generosity and collegiality, in the knowledge that as an investment it can yield only good.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It further states:</P>
        <P LI="1">As highlighted right through this report, some schools are catering for students who bring with them a multiplicity of needs, many of which act as barriers to successful achievement in school.  These schools require a range of measures accompanied by adequate resources to guarantee their efficacy.  We are confident that the Recommendations that we put forward can make a significant contribution to the creation of a more harmonious teaching and learning environment in our classrooms and schools.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The task force recommended more involvement by parents and the availability of parents&rsquo; rooms in schools, ensuring harmonious transfer from primary to second level and that those who have supports in primary school continue to receive them at post-primary level.  It also dealt with teacher in-service education and ensuring teachers are properly resourced and empowered to deal with the wide variety of problems they encounter with young people in the classroom.  Obviously, we are dealing with a changed society.</P>
        <P>The report also deals with the introduction of a charter of rights and responsibilities.  I note the TUI magazine dealing with section 29 amendments also stressed the need for the introduction of a charter of rights.  The task force also dealt in its report with issues such as the introduction of behaviour support classrooms.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement that she intends to do this.  Other issues such as reducing class size, the pro<Col N="1530"/>vision in schools of adequate psychological services and addressing the difficulty of getting a diagnosis &mdash; I accept this matter does not come within the Minister&rsquo;s remit &mdash; under the mental health for children section of the Department of health and Children need to be addressed.  There are many logjams in this area which often result in families having to wait for years to obtain a diagnosis.  Families are having to go on waiting lists under pressure from many other areas within the health services.  This is, for many of them, an added burden imposed on them by the educational services.  It is often difficult to obtain the required diagnosis in order to obtain necessary supports for young people.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that all pupils are being categorised as troublemakers.  While some pupils may just be playing bad others have disorders which were not addressed earlier in the education system.  Our primary focus must be on addressing those problems.  I accept we must also provide schools with the powers to expel students who cause serious problems.  The task force also recommended &mdash; I am sure the Minister is aware of this &mdash; that implementation and evaluation of its recommendations be monitored.  Perhaps the Minister will say if she is planning to do this.  I suggest it should be done in light of the fact that many measures introduced do not have the desired effect.  A clear recommendation of the task force is that its recommendations be evaluated and measured in terms of implementation and success.</P>
        <P>The statistics I received by way of parliamentary questions on the number of appeals under section 29 are categorised under the headings, primary and post-primary and, refusal to enrol, expulsion and suspension.  However, we are dealing in the main today with expulsions and suspensions.  I hope later to speak on the issue of refusal to enrol.  It is clear that the number of appeals at post-primary level in respect of expulsion have been steadily increasing.  The relevant statistics are: 2003, 34 expulsions; 2004, 52 expulsions; 2005, 68 expulsions; and up to end November 2006, 76 expulsions.  Schools are concerned about the divide between the number of appeals upheld and not upheld.  This legislation is designed to ensure schools have the power to expel students who cause serious disruption to the learning of other children.  I do not have a problem with that.  However, we must find other ways of dealing with students who are expelled from school.</P>
        <P>The report also includes recommendations in regard to young people excluded from school.  Paragraph 9.1 which deals with out of school provisions suggests approximately 1% to 2% of young people do not fit in a mainstream school because their needs cannot be catered for in a classroom-type situation.  In this regard the TUI states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Pupils are not taught on an individual basis [they are talking about in schools] they are <Col N="1531"/>taught in classes of many. Their conduct, if continually disruptive, robs the right to learn of other pupils who do not misbehave in any significant way.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We should heed the task force which states that a small minority of young people are not suited to the classroom situation and recommends the introduction of out of school provision such as the expansion of youth encounter projects which exist in three of our main cities.  While we have only a small number of these projects, from my experience they work well.  They offer alternatives for young people from the age of 12 years who are unable to get into a school or who have been expelled from school at an early age.  The task force recommends that these projects be expanded.  It also recommends that Youthreach which caters for students over 15 years be expanded and the introduction of a junior Youthreach for those aged 12 years to 15 years who are out of the school system.  I recently visited a Youthreach programme in my constituency.  It is doing fabulous work.  Many of the young people involved in that programme had been expelled from school and were in a limbo-type situation until they reached the required age for Youthreach.  They were studying for their junior certificate and were doing very well.  I hope the Minister will address this issue when responding to the debate.</P>
        <P>We must, when legislating to exclude young people from regular schooling, provide them with alternatives.  We cannot simply leave them out there with no support.  The Minister will probably reply that such matters come within the remit of the Educational Welfare Board.  I accept that.  However, it does not run programmes.  It can only try to secure places in programmes for these children or provide them with home tuition.  We need the Department of Education and Science to value these programmes and to provide them where needed.  We must address the needs of the small percentage of young people who do not conform to what is expected of them in school if we are to address problems such as anti-social and criminal behaviour, bullying, youth suicide and joyriding.  I am sympathetic to schools.  I know what is required if they are to run orderly, disciplined establishments which allow appropriate learning.  However, I feel very passionately that we cannot simply ignore the others.  If we do so, we are storing up serious problems for the future.</P>
        <P>In respect of the National Behaviour Support Service, I welcome the fact that this support will go directly into the schools this year.  I was critical of the expenditure of &euro;2 million last year which went almost entirely on setting up a new bureaucracy, with a full-time administrator based in an education centre, a national co-ordinator, four assistant national co-ordinators, nine regional development officers and 20 part-time associates. <Col N="1532"/> Psychologists are included, but they have been taken from NEPS which already does not have enough psychologists.  We need hands-on support in schools rather than a bureaucracy.</P>
        <P>In reading the report of the task force, I cannot see any place where it recommended setting up this kind of a national bureaucracy.  My understanding was that it just wanted support teams which would go into schools which have problems and work with them.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for that clarification because what schools say they really need is the hands-on approach.  They do not need someone sitting in the Navan education centre; they need someone in their schools.  I accept the clarification but there is still too much bureaucracy around it.  </P>

	<P>This may be an aside, but I met school secretaries yesterday who must be paid out of the capitation grant received by the schools.  The actual support structures in the schools are inadequate.  They do not have sufficient access to educational psychologists and do not have the reduced class sizes and all the other measures recommended by the task force.  </P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to refrain from sitting back and simply saying that since she has set up the support measures in the schools and is amending the legislation today, she does not need to do more.  There are many other recommendations.  The task force also has a timeframe.  At the end of each series of recommendations, it states what should be done in 2006, 2007 and so on.  Its timeframe is across all the recommendations so it is not a matter of recommending that the legislation be introduced and the support teams set up and one can wait two more years to take the other measures.  Its approach is about starting everything more or less at the same time so that we can address the various aspects of it.  This is my concern.</P><Col N="1533"/>
        <P>Having said all that, I welcome the legislation.  It is welcomed by those who work in schools and the parents of the majority of young people, who want their children to have the opportunity to study in a peaceful and proactive environment.  There are some concerns with regard to the legislation and we will also table amendments in the future.  I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to something outlined by the TUI in its article that there is no provision in the amendments that pupils should not be reinstated solely on technicalities or procedural grounds.  I ask the Minister to examine this aspect.  It is probably true that young people expelled or suspended under section 29 can sometimes use a technicality.  I believe this point was alluded to by Deputy Enright and we must be aware of it.  The TUI may make recommendations to the Minister in this regard.</P>
        <P>Another aspect of section 29 relates to enrolments.  I welcome the section which basically states that schools cannot deny rights under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  In other words, the right of people with special educational needs to a place in school will be maintained and this legislation will not undermine their rights, which is very important.  However, their right to get into a school in the first place needs to be protected.  While provisions relating to the refusal to enrol are included in section 29, schools are managing to cherry pick students and make it difficult for parents to enrol their children with special needs, which was acknowledged by the Minister.  Deputy Enright also referred to this fact.  Sometimes, they will not give parents a letter stating they have refused to enrol the child so that parents cannot take an appeal under section 29.</P>
        <P>We need to strengthen the rights of people with learning difficulties in this area and the rights of schools who have an open policy.  Up to 10% and more of the student body of some schools is composed of students with special learning needs and the schools cater magnificently for them.  It is ironic, but these schools often end up having section 29 appeals taken against them because more parents seek to enrol their children in these open and welcoming schools, whereas other schools do not have section 29 appeals taken against them because they let it be known that they do not want to cater for young people with special learning difficulties.</P>
        <P>The Minister needs to take action in respect of enrolment policies.  I have previously stated that, under section 33 of the Act, she can introduce regulations.  I do not know whether she has thought about whether this might be necessary in view of the fact that there seems to be a growing divide, particularly in Dublin where certain schools want young people who do not have learning or social difficulties and leave other schools to be more inclusive and holistic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.  Hear, hear.  </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1534"/>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>This upsets the balance of these other schools because for them to be effective, they need a balance and mix.  The Minister should consider making regulations under section 33, which she is empowered to do under the Act.  </P>
        <P>Ultimately, we all want all young people, irrespective of their learning needs, to be able to get into schools that can cater for their needs and for all young people to have a fair chance.  In order to do this, we need to ensure they can get into schools and that all schools will cater for a wide variety of needs, that the curriculum is sufficiently wide to address a wide variety of needs and that there are alternative programmes for the small number of young people who cannot or do not wish to cope in a school setting.  The Labour Party suggests that there should be a social guarantee so that all young people, irrespective of whether they are in or outside school, have the opportunity to avail of education, training, employment or something appropriate to their needs.  As I stated previously, if we do not do this, we will store up all kinds of problems for ourselves into the future in terms of those alienated young people who are probably the main subjects of our debate today.</P>
        <P>We are not opposing the Bill.  We welcome what the Minister is doing, but there is a lot more to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Healy, Crowe and Finian McGrath.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the Green Party, I welcome the publication of this Bill.  As other speakers have stated, it provides a welcome opportunity to debate a number of issues, the primary one being school discipline and trying to achieve a balance between the rights of individual students, the right of all students to learn and the right of all teachers to teach.</P>
        <P>There are a number of other areas, such as extending section 29(1)(<i>c</i>) which relates to situations where a child has been refused enrolment to an all-Irish division or class of a school.  Other issues relate to the National Educational Welfare Board, NEPS, provisions and the maintenance of the rights of students with special educational needs.  Due to time constraints, I will put down amendments relating to these matters on Committee Stage rather than dwell on them here.</P>
        <P>The main issue is school discipline.  This is a very challenging issue to deal with &mdash; otherwise this Bill would not exist in the first place and there would be no ongoing complaints from teachers&rsquo; unions.  One of these unions, the ASTI, carried out a survey recently which revealed that more than one in ten teachers had been physically attacked by a pupil.  It also found that more than half of teachers had also been subjected to verbal abuse and taunts from students.  Some 7%, a significant number, admitted they were sexually harassed in the classroom environment.  How can one <Col N="1535"/>teach properly in such an environment and how can other students learn?</P>
        <P>These are the challenges the Minister has attempted to deal with through this Bill.  As the Minister has stated, it is primarily aimed at ensuring that the rights of the pupil appealing an expulsion are treated equally alongside the rights of the majority of students to learn in the classroom and trying to balance the rights of teachers to do their job in a normal working environment.  I commend the Minister and her Department on their efforts in trying to address this problem which nearly every second-level school faces on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>The changes proposed do not go far enough to ensure the rights of children to learn in a safe, non-disruptive and idyllic environment.  In short, a disruptive pupil is still allowed to rule the roost.  Notwithstanding his or her right to appeal decisions, there is still too much leeway to allow him or her remain in the school.  A pupil may be allowed remain for the most spurious or technical reason.</P>
        <P>The Bill seeks to amend section 29(4), allowing the appeals committee to consider a range of factors in appeals relating to expulsion and suspension.  They have been mentioned before and take in: the educational interest of the student making the appeal; the educational interest of other students in the school; the nature, scale and extent of the student&rsquo;s behaviour; the reasonableness of efforts made by the school; the safety, health and welfare of teachers and students; the school&rsquo;s policies, code of behaviour and extent to which this complies with any issued guidelines; statutory duties of schools; and other relevant matters.</P>
        <P>In attempting to cover all these issues the balance still has not been struck and schools can still be forced on a technicality to let a student return.  A student could continue disrupting and acting as a real and present physical danger to others in some cases.  It is high time schools were provided with the powers to act effectively against students who disrupt the class time and again after a warning.  This Bill is an opportunity to do so and I look forward to amendments being put forward by various parties and individuals.</P>
        <P>The TUI, another teaching union, has indicated that decisions to suspend or expel pupils are usually taken in complete exasperation with refusal by the pupils and parents to heed repeated requests for changed behaviour.  Every opportunity is normally offered to pupils to make amends; it is not like a dictatorial regime where a hand is chopped off after one offence.  The students go through a lengthy process.</P>
        <P>If a student&rsquo;s conduct is continually disruptive and robs other pupils of the right to learn, or if pupils continue to misbehave, action must be taken.  There are cases where students appeal and are rightfully let back in.  I hope this will occur <Col N="1536"/>not on a technicality but for a good reason.  Some cases of disruptive behaviour can occur, as Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan mentioned in mitigating circumstances.</P>
        <P>There are no clear guidelines in this legislation for dealing with cases of violence or where violence has been threatened.  An example is where recently at a school in my constituency a 17 year old student allegedly assaulted a teacher, breaking his nose and teeth and damaging his eyes in a vicious assault.  It is claimed the row broke out after the student had been playing with a mobile phone in class and took a photograph of the teacher.  Having been told to put the phone down, the student attacked the teacher.</P>
        <P>I will not comment on the individual case because it will go before the courts.  In such cases, the student should not be allowed back into the school under any circumstance.  The authority of the teacher will have been severely damaged and the student, in order to save face with other students, will have to walk with a bit of a swagger and keep his or her head high even if he or she has been humbled or realises his or her error.  That student would have issues of self worth and will try to keep it up by swaggering around and boasting that he or she may attack the teacher again.  This is why there cannot be an environment worthy of learning where a pupil is readmitted who has been expelled for violent behaviour.  Such a student would have to go somewhere else, which I will deal with presently.</P>
        <P>Deputy Enright mentioned the Fine Gael policy of possibly searching students for drugs or alcohol, which I disagree with totally.  We do not live in the Bronx or a violent era in which kids should be routinely searched for weapons.  We are still a relatively sane society, thanks be to God.  To bring such searches into schools would be wholly negative and would criminalise young people at too early an age.</P>
        <P>Kids will take drugs and drink outside the school system.  It is more of a problem for young people to come into school after drink or drug binges, when they cannot concentrate or stay attentive.  It is not so much the problem of drink and drugs being taken within the school but a case of such actions affecting school work.  That is a wider societal issue which I will not try to skirt over.  It needs to be dealt with and we should tackle the root causes.  We need more intervention at an early age.</P>
        <P>In previous responses to questions I have put down the Minister has correctly stated the Department cannot take total responsibility for children.  However, we need more intervention and the task force on student behaviour recommended an holistic approach to the problems.  We need resources put in at primary level to cover the Department&rsquo;s role.  For example, the Green Party has proposed a new responsibility to ease the transition for students entering second-level education.  The TUI has called for an induction <Col N="1537"/>for students on discipline issues when they enter first year.  These deal with people going into second-level education.</P>
        <P>I previously mentioned in committees that teachers would predict that a particular youth would cause trouble or end up in prison, although the student could be as young as six or seven.  Resources must be put in place to deal with problems that are not always within the education system itself.  We should consider expanding social services or assessment.  For example, if we had the full complement of 200 National Educational Psychological Service personnel, it could go some way in providing an overall solution.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan mentioned that children excluded from school also have rights and I agree.  We cannot forget that while on one hand we should ensure those who cause trouble should be kept out of the system, particularly if they will affect the rights of other students and teachers to do their job, we cannot on the other hand label them as scumbags and leave them with it for the rest of their lives.</P>
        <P>Disruptive students were not born that way.  Very few people are born bad.  Many are moulded by the system into disruptive students.  Social background, such as a dysfunctional home life or having a special educational need that is not dealt with, could be a factor.  In recognising the turmoil that leads a student to become violent we should also help such students.  This may not lead to a student going back into the same school after he or she has committed a violent act as that would affect the way students and teachers relate.</P>
        <P>Another approach outside the existing school system is required.  Perhaps we need a new type of education centre.  On a visit to Sydney in New South Wales some years ago, I visited Edgware school in a rough suburb of the city.  That school has been specially set up with other centres to deal with discipline issues.  The Minister is aware of this school.</P>
        <P>In this facility youths can go in and out at their own time and learn when they want or learn in very small classes.  This is because some may have problems interacting with others.  These youths can sometimes go back into the mainstream system after a spell in Edgware, whereas others get some form of qualification through the school itself.  That is the way forward.</P>
        <P>The task force report refers to out-of-school provision.  Youthreach could be expanded to be a model in this respect and a junior Youthreach, as mentioned by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, would be a good idea.  Youthreach must be resourced as it does not currently have the special educational needs services that primary schools do.  Some 70% of the people in Youthreach have special educational needs.  If such issues are dealt with, Youthreach could be a model with a section dealing with particularly disruptive students.  These youths could be given the opportunity to develop their lives in the way they see fit while protecting <Col N="1538"/>teachers and other students so that they can teach and learn in a safe environment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which I welcome although I am not sure it goes far enough.  The detail will be teased out on Committee Stage.  The Bill is based on research carried out by the teaching organisations and the report of the task force.  Lack of discipline is a significant problem and it needs to be tackled seriously.  School is a microcosm of life.  Pre-schools, schools and the wider community are all part of the social fabric.  Disruptive pupils affect the majority of pupils who are committed to learning.  As Deputy Gogarty stated, disruption also affects teachers.  I accept this is a difficult area.</P>
        <P>Various inputs are evident in the Bill.  Contrary to the general perception of it, in this case flexibility is evident on the part of the Department.  This is necessary, especially in disadvantaged areas.  I refer in particular to schools in CL&Aacute;R areas and in the DEIS scheme.  In my constituency, St. Joseph&rsquo;s national school in Ballingarry will lose a teacher on 1 September 2007 unless the Department allows the teacher to continue to work there.  The school numbers have fallen to two under the quota.  This school is in a disadvantaged area and has a number of special needs and disadvantaged pupils.  A special effort should be made for this school and similar ones throughout the country.  Ultimately, how pupils get on at school will indicate how they will get on in life.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to understand the withdrawal of psychological assessment from some schools.  There appears to be a disparity between schools that were classified as disadvantaged and those in the DEIS scheme.  The Presentation Secondary School in Clonmel had disadvantaged status but has now lost its on-site psychological assessment service.  This appears to suggest to the whole school community that if one works hard and gets results, one will lose one&rsquo;s disadvantaged status and be removed from the DEIS scheme, as happened in this case.</P>
        <P>Class size is another factor that impacts on school discipline.  Various surveys have been done on this issue.  A survey that was carried out in December 2006 in my constituency makes disturbing reading.  It indicated that in the 2006-07 school year over half of the county&rsquo;s primary school pupils would be in overcrowded classrooms.  A total of 21% of south Tipperary primary pupils are in classes of between 30 and 34 pupils and another 37%, or 2,383 pupils, are in classes of up to 29 pupils.  A further 143 pupils are in classes of 35 and over.  Some of those classes have special needs pupils which adds to an already difficult situation.  I hope that even at this late stage the Minister will implement the promise made in the programme for Government that no child of eight years or younger would be in a class of more than 20.</P><Col N="1539"/>
        <P>Sub-standard accommodation is an additional factor that impacts on school discipline.  I appeal to the Minister to meet a deputation from Gaelscoil Chluain Meala.  As she is aware, the school&rsquo;s accommodation for the past 13 years has been in sub-standard conditions.  It is in a never-ending cycle of waiting for other agencies to make decisions on a site and a new school.  The school opened in 1994 with two teachers.  It now has 12 teachers and 250 pupils.  The waiting list extends to 2011.  Overcrowded and substandard conditions are not conducive to learning or discipline.  I appeal to the Minister to decouple the siting of Gaelscoil Chluain Meala from the Tipperary Institute transfer to the Ballingarrane estate in Clonmel.  This has had the effect of delaying the process of identifying a site and building a new school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this important legislation which deals with violent and disruptive pupils.  We have to face up to this serious matter as it is a fact of life that a minority of pupils can be disruptive and damage our education system.  Nobody likes excluding a pupil but there are times when schools have to make this tough decision in the interests of the pupil, his or her classmates and the school.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to build and develop schools with a warm, friendly and welcoming ethos.  I am pleased to say we have achieved that in many cases but we must constantly develop good practice in our schools, both from a management and teaching point of view.  One way to achieve this is to have a reasonable class size.  This issue must be brought into today&rsquo;s debate.  Failure to do so would be to keep our heads in the sand.  Class size should be an election issue and I commend all those who will raise this issue in the coming months.</P>
        <P>After ten years of unprecedented economic growth, which has seen the national debt almost wiped out and regular budget surpluses that could not have been imagined a decade ago, it is difficult to believe class size is still an issue.  I accept some progress has been made.  It is indisputable that class size at primary level is the second highest in the European Union.  For years, groups like the INTO and delegates at its annual conference have listened to Minister after Minister promising to reduce class size whenever resources permitted.</P>
        <P>Having just witnessed a giveaway budget and the &euro;2 billion surplus of the Department of Finance, I agree with the comment of my colleague, Mr. John Carr, general secretary of the INTO, that if resources do not permit now, they will never permit.  Class size in primary schools has become a political imperative.  The Minister for Education and Science stated the basic resource in education is the interaction between the <Col N="1540"/>teacher and the child and, therefore, the degree to which we resource that interaction is the key to our success in education.  These are not my words, they are the words of the Minister.</P>
        <P>In 2002, as part of the programme for Government, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats stated clearly that over the next five years they would progressively introduce maximum class guidelines which would ensure the average size of classes for children under nine would be below the international best practice guideline of 20:1.  Five years after that promise was made, children under nine remain in the second highest class size in the European Union.  Whenever there are fewer than 20 pupils in a classroom each pupil receives more attention from the teacher, fewer pupils distract each other, the level of noise is reduced and each pupil receives a greater proportion of educational resources and learns more.  This can reduce violence and disruption.</P>
        <P>A recent survey found that 35% of boys and 19% of girls were physically attacked in our schools over a three month period, a worrying development.  We must address this from other angles.  There is a minority of violent, dysfunctional pupils in schools but this cohort is higher in socially and economically disadvantaged areas.  One cannot expect a five year old to be normal and happy if he or she comes from a family steeped in drug and alcohol abuse and domestic violence.  One cannot expect the child to act in a normal way at school.  We must ensure the protection of these children, many of whom are identified at the ages of four and five.</P>
        <P>I welcome developments in pre-school education.  Some disadvantaged schools have fantastic programmes involving home-school liaison teachers, creative principals, high quality teachers and parents developing strategies to assist these pupils.  Such policies should be implemented.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend section 29 of the Education Act 1998, following the recommendations of the task force on student behaviour in second level schools.  Section 29 provides that an appeal may be made to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science.  This refers to permanently excluding a pupil, suspending a pupil and refusing to enrol a child.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am concerned by the refusal of some schools to enrol children with special needs, disabilities or those from poor backgrounds.  I challenge the management authorities to be more open.  We are losing the balance in some schools.  We used to have the doctor&rsquo;s child educated with the plumber&rsquo;s child and the unemployed person&rsquo;s child.  If wealthy children go to one school and the poor to another, society will be divided.  We must be vigilant that this does not happen.  A mix of children lifts all of them, in respect of economics and education.  Those who have experience of mixed systems believe it is the way forward.</P><Col N="1541"/>
        <P Just="Left">Parents should support the local school.  Shipping pupils to what is considered an elite school can be damaging.  If parents, as taxpayers, have difficulties in the local school they should work with staff and the parents' council.  The Minister is aware that policies have been tested in disadvantaged areas and the more progressive ideas have come from the poorer schools.  We must support teachers and parents.</P>
        <P>The Minister states she is pleased &ldquo;that the National Educational Welfare Board is currently finalising comprehensive guidelines for schools on developing and implementing effective codes of behaviour&rdquo;.  Sensible ideas are being proposed.  I welcome this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate is timely in light of increasing indiscipline in our schools, most recently displayed with the stabbing of a 17 year old pupil by a fellow pupil in a school in Templeogue and the assault of a teacher in Clondalkin who was attacked by several students resulting in the teacher losing several teeth.  I am also aware of an incident a few years ago where a former pupil threw rocks at a pregnant teacher&rsquo;s car, breaking the windscreen.  A mini-riot ensued and teachers had to be escorted from the school.  Four Garda cars and the Garda helicopter were involved.  The teacher had to pay for the repairs to her car because the incident happened on school property.  I was not too popular at the school for highlighting what happened because the school was not happy with the publicity.</P>
        <P>Hard cases may not make good law but I cautiously welcome this legislation.  The Minister is attempting to ensure greater balance between the rights of the school, the community, the rights of teachers to work in non-disruptive classroom, the right of suspended or expelled pupils to appeal a decision and the collective right of other students to learn in an environment free from disruption and menace.</P>
        <P>Section 29 proved a lengthy and bureaucratic procedure unpopular with teachers, unions and schools.  It placed a considerable administrative burden on schools, particularly principals, making it extremely difficult to deal with serious, disruptive behaviour.</P>
        <P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s response to the belief of the TUI that the issue of appeals being upheld on a technicality has not been addressed?  The TUI has warned that the Minister has not gone far enough to ensure a level playing field for every member of the school community.  It also seems the Minister has ignored the TUI demand that an appeals panel should normally not recommend the reinstatement of pupils in violent cases.  Surely an appeals panel should include serving teachers, as is the case in Northern Ireland and Britain, or representatives of a teachers&rsquo; union.</P>
        <P>Most agree that section 29 needs reform but that reform must ensure that unruly students are not returned on a technicality to the detriment of <Col N="1542"/>the broader school population.  We must balance the rights of all.  By favouring disruptive students, section 29 resulted in schools becoming increasingly powerless to remove continually disruptive students due to the unfair appeals process.  Reforming this legislation is a first step but is not enough to improve discipline, respect and a general positive learning environment in our schools.  Indiscipline takes up a considerable amount of time for teachers, resulting in stress and threats of physical abuse.  Pupils also lose teacher time.  We should never underestimate the negative impact that a minority of disruptive students can have on others.  Physical, verbal and emotional abuse should have no place in our classrooms.</P>
        <P>While the Minister for Education and Science has pledged &euro;8 million this year for the national behaviour support service, this will only cover 50 schools.  The Minister must respond adequately to the gravity of this problem.  The disruptive minority in any classroom should not be allowed to dictate to the rest and hinder a teacher&rsquo;s ability to teach or a pupil&rsquo;s ability to learn.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>School discipline is unquestionably a core issue in post-primary education.  The amount allocated to tackle student indiscipline should be considered in the context of spending in Britain.  Following a 2001 report highlighting the extent of negative school behavioural problems in Scotland, some &pound;32 million was spent each year in the first three years, which was supplemented by a &pound;53 million package.  This funded additional support staff in schools, such as behaviour co-ordinators and classroom assistants.  Last year alone in Wales and England over &pound;460 million was assigned to its behaviour improvement programme.  The behaviour support service needs a significant increase in staff numbers.  There is a need for behaviour support in classrooms to help students who are struggling.  Learning support units would reduce suspensions and expulsions by improving student learning, motivation, attendance and behaviour.  Many second level schools face a crisis of discipline and must be supported in tackling this problem.  All students have the right to a school experience that is free from disruption and bullying.</P>
        <P>Recent TUI research revealed the severity of this problem.  One in five post-primary teachers is subjected to intimidation and threatening behaviour every week.  There is a need to improve and guarantee discipline in the schools with a well-resourced behaviour support system.  Suspension and expulsion of students should be the last resort.  For those students who cannot cope with, or are not suited to, mainstream education an alternative education must be provided.  It is not acceptable to dump young people with behavioural problems on the community to create more mayhem on the streets.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I started life in the inner city and attended school with the nuns in Clarendon Street, then went to Synge Street, at a time Gay Byrne describes as &ldquo;brutal&rdquo;.  Children were beaten at that time but I do not have bad memories of my schooldays.  I then attended Drimnagh Castle and had no bad times there.  In a debate such as this one reflects on those days and how problems were dealt with then.  We live in more enlightened times and the Minister has presided over that improvement.  </P>
        <P>I am a former member of the Deansrath Community College board.  Unfortunately, the school received bad publicity during the week when a teacher was assaulted, which is regrettable.  There was also a serious incident in St. MacDara&rsquo;s school in Templeogue.  I received an anonymous letter yesterday from a woman in my constituency, expressing serious upset at that incident and concern about the atmosphere there and the difficulties it creates for her two children.  We must be sympathetic to her point of view.  I am not picking on St. MacDara&rsquo;s, which is a first class school, with which I was involved as a member of the VEC.  Nevertheless, it had a problem last week.</P>
        <P>Many of these schools have up to 1,000 pupils.  I visited my local primary school recently and noted that the teacher was starting the day at 9 a.m.  People in every profession say their work is demanding but although it is a long time since I <Col N="1544"/>was in school I recognise the demands on teachers.  There are two sides to the coin which the Minister understands.</P>
        <P>Deputy Finian McGrath said that this debate is not only concerned with the central issues, about which we know.  When we debated the Prisons Bill earlier this week I said that it is better to spend money on education, at every level, than to have to visit young people, from my constituency and others, in places of detention.  It is easy to say that these issues could be dealt with at school but we must do all we can, particularly in disadvantaged communities, to ensure that young people get the best start.</P>
        <P>The Minister agrees with this principle and has visited Tallaght on several occasions where she has seen the efforts made by the staff and community in the national schools in Killinarden and Jobstown to look after young people who might be at risk.  She has also visited the ACE project which helps young people complete their education and go to university, as they should.  Resources should be made available for all these programmes.</P>
        <P>There are always demands and various unions knocking on our doors with different points to make.  The former Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, came last autumn to see the Early Start programme in St. Thomas&rsquo;s school in Jobstown which is under significant pressure.  We should do all we can to help it.</P>
        <P>The Minister initiated the Tallaght West Childhood Development Initiative, which she visited when Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach will visit Tallaght on Friday week with the Minister of State with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to launch this initiative formally.  This concerns helping the community in Tallaght and elsewhere; there are similar projects in Ballymun and in the Northside Partnership.</P>
        <P>The prevention and early intervention programme which the Department of Health and Children has initiated examines innovative methods for improving outcomes for children in an integrated way.  In a reply to a recent parliamentary question the Minister of State with special responsibility for children said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The intention is to ensure that local services connect effectively with one another, making them more focused on the multiple needs of children and families.  The strategy will also provide for some new services and the re-orientation of existing services in the identified area to meet the specific needs of the community.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Apart from the impact on my community in Tallaght this project will be useful elsewhere in the region and, in time, around the country.  It is important to support these programmes which create the right attitude to education in children.</P><Col N="1545"/>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I recently met a lady at a coffee morning who informed me that I was a lovely little boy when I lived in Crumlin.  However, my sisters say this is not true.</P>
        <P>I enjoyed school and I still enjoy it.  I have a five year old granddaughter who is taking a great deal of interest in school and who wants to draw, learn about the environment, etc.  I am a strong believer in the process in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is important that the issues the Minister is addressing in the legislation be highlighted.  Everyone is aware of situations where particular students are a disruptive influence in school.  We all remember our own school days and we have heard stories about what has happened to others since becoming involved in political life.  When I moved to Tallaght, I never had any intention of becoming a politician.  My first involvement in local politics &mdash; if one could call it that &mdash; was on various school boards.  I am sure the then parish priest, Fr. Richard Sherry, who subsequently moved on to Donnybrook, will not mind me outing him for appointing me to a number of local primary school boards.  It was not perceived that he and I were of the same political persuasion.  I became a member of South County Dublin VEC in 1985 and ended up serving on all the school boards in the Tallaght area.</P>
        <P>School boards of management continually raise issues relating to discipline with us and there is an expectation that, on each occasion, we should back them.  That is fair enough and, in most instances, we support them.  It is important that we should support the notion that young people be safe in their classes and that special attention be given to those students who want to attend classes, do everything right and behave and not be disruptive.  This is vital, particularly in the context of health and safety issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a result of serving on second level school boards in south-west Dublin over the years, I developed concerns with regard to those young people who were expelled from school.  I except <Col N="1546"/>that this might not be one of the central themes of the Bill &mdash; which I welcome and which I am glad is being supported across the floor &mdash; but there will always be one young person who, for one reason or another, falls out of the system and it is not always the case that this fact is identified.  Everyone can cite instances of this happening.  The teacher unions and those they represent will inform one that schools cannot be all things to all people and that they are obliged to concentrate on those pupils who want to work and achieve.  Young people who fall out of the system should not be forgotten.  The Minister will be aware that I am particularly interested in a number of projects in my constituency that specialise in work of this nature.  Those who work on these projects will always be obliged to challenge the view in the Department regarding what should be done and who should be doing it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is aware that on a number of occasions I have expressed strong support for the Citywise education project, which is based at Jobstown village in Tallaght and which was opened by the Taoiseach.  This project caters for the young people in the area.  Since it commenced operations, it has run a full-time education programme for those who do not attend school and also a range of after-school supports and club and sporting activities for upwards of 250 local young people from the area of west Tallaght, particularly Jobstown, to which I refer.  I spoke to those involved with the project earlier in the week and I understand they are looking after 15 young people from the area who, for one reason or another, have left school.  Some of the children to whom I refer were actually expelled.  It is important, particularly in the context of this legislation, that challenges exist in that regard and that someone takes action in respect of them.</P>
        <P>I have been involved with school boards and local politics for almost 30 years.  In that context, I am not sure that schools always make the best possible effort to discover what happens to the young people who fall out of the system and end up being at risk as a result.  There is a great deal of pressure on the school system and those involved are obliged to provide services to those children who want to be educated, who want to act properly and who do not want to be disruptive.  However, there will always be somebody who will drop out of the system and require special attention.  In my view, it is important that we should cater for the needs of such individuals.</P>
        <P>Many Deputies have received representations from the teacher unions, particularly the INTO, in respect of issues that are of concern to them.  Over the next 100 days, as the end of the lifetime of this D&aacute;il approaches, many people will knock on our doors to lobby us and take advantage of the political climate as they see it.  In that context, it is important that we remain focused on what we are doing.  I am glad the Government is doing so.  Not long ago, a Taoiseach used to call an elec<Col N="1547"/>tion, the various parties would hold their conventions and we would then canvass for two and a half weeks before voting took place.  I met a man in Tallaght village this morning who informed me that the tree outside his house needs to be pruned.  He poked me in the shoulder and stated that I should not forget that he has four votes at his disposal and that there is an election in the offing.  I am not being flippant by recounting this story and I have always been accessible and available to people.  It is the political season but people must remain focused.  I hope the Minister will continue to retain her focus, that she will go about her business and that, where possible, she will visit schools.  There are many schools in Tallaght and in my constituency in general at which she would be welcome.</P>
        <P>Let us try to get the job done.  I informed someone recently that I am more concerned about finishing my first D&aacute;il term successfully than I am about being re-elected.  It is important that one does one&rsquo;s job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy would like to return here all the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to do the job one was elected to do and that is my aim.  That is why I take every opportunity to speak on behalf of my community in this House.</P>
        <P>I referred earlier to what are perceived as disadvantaged communities.  I am not sure that it is always appropriate to consider specific areas in certain constituencies, identify them as being disadvantaged and state that disadvantage does not exist anywhere else.  The latter is obviously not the case.  However, there are areas in which more challenges than normal arise in respect of school attendance and the recruitment of good teachers.  In fairness, teachers, particularly those with good experience, are sometimes obliged to make career choices.  It is difficult for schools in disadvantaged schools to fight to attract or retain staff on the basis that they might have an easier life elsewhere.  I hope I will not be contacted by teachers for saying that.</P>
        <P>It is important that the disadvantaged communities and schools to which I refer will always require even more help than others.  As the Taoiseach famously stated, even though all boats tend to rise in good times, we should not forget the smaller vessels.  As far as education is concerned, it is extremely important that we heed this advice.  I will always fight on behalf of the various schools in my constituency but it is important to fight even harder for those who require special attention.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well in dealing with the Bill.  It is important legislation.  I am always pleased to hear Opposition spokespersons, even this close to a general election, welcoming legislation.</P>

	<P>We should give this Minister the credit she deserves for what she is trying to achieve.  She has been progressive in dealing with the issues of concern to all of us and it is important that she hears from all of us.  Her efforts regarding educational disadvantage are getting support.  Many people will have a different perspective on these issues but I believe she is on the right track.  There will always be a need for resources but where there is disadvantage it must be addressed. </P>
        <P>Disadvantage affects schools like the one in my community in Springfield Estate, St. Mark&rsquo;s, which has a large population of international students.  That is a positive aspect but, as the Minister is aware, it raises particular challenges which it is important to address.  I wish the Minister well with the legislation, which I support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to contribute to the debate on the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I welcome the Bill.  Like Deputy O&rsquo;Connor, I do not have an educational background although a few members of my family are teachers.  Something had to be done about disruptive students.  I hope this legislation will address the problem but as the Minister is aware there is &ldquo;many a slip &rsquo;tween cup and lip&rdquo; and legislation brought before the House often takes on a different hue by the time it is passed.  However, the Oireachtas is sending a signal to teachers throughout the country that they can expect some help from the establishment in dealing with this problem.</P>
        <P>I listened carefully to Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan and others who spoke about the other side of this coin and the balance required.  I spend a good deal of time speaking to teachers and principals in east Galway and I was told by a principal in a post-primary school there that the disruption can be so bad on occasions that he feels he should wear shin guards to school.  Thankfully, those cases are in the minority but one bad apple in the barrel can disrupt the entire class if they are allowed continue with the behaviour.  If the class brat is allowed to upset the whole class a copycat syndrome can develop and others in the class will think they can get away with the same behaviour.  That is a major problem, particularly in larger schools.  Some students can be controlled at a certain level but if they see another student getting <Col N="1549"/>away with disruptive behaviour, they will do the same.</P>
        <P>Being a principal of a school is a difficult job for a variety of reasons I do not have the time to go into now.  Disruptive students take up much teachers&rsquo; and principals&rsquo; time.  We all appreciate that there must be checks and balances but in regard to corporal punishment the pendulum has swung too far the other way.  My generation experienced corporal punishment, and there is no doubt that was a difficult time to be in school; there was not much talk about the rights of children.  I have no time for corporal punishment, nor has any other Member, but the pendulum began to swing the other way as happens in modern democracies.  In the past eight or ten years in particular, the news got out that a pupil cannot be touched, regardless of what he or she does.  Whether that is right or wrong, that is the perception.  This legislation will redress that somewhat and I hope the teachers, principals and vice-principals who will examine it when it is passed will believe they are in a slightly better position in that they will now know where the battle lines are drawn, which was not clear previously.</P>
        <P>I do not have enough involvement in education to know how the appeal system will work.  It appears satisfactory but I assume some clever person will drive a coach and four through it before too long; it is our job to close off any such loopholes if that happens.</P>
        <P>I could spend the next half hour rattling off examples of cases involving disruptive students.  Some of the students involved are so ferocious in their intent that not only can the teachers not control them but the garda&iacute; are unable to do anything with them.  Some students of 13, 14, 17 or 18 years of age are at a stage in their lives that, regardless of the arm of the State involved, even if it is the Garda, they will upset it.</P>
        <P>I am aware of some remarkable cases where the disruption was so bad the students were eventually expelled.  In one case it took almost two years to do this during which time there were case conferences and outside agencies became involved.  While all that was going on the school was being thrashed.  That is the problem with this kind of behaviour.</P>
        <P>I hope the message goes out from this Chamber that there will be no room in schools for students who are overly disruptive, whose behaviour places other students at a major disadvantage and where the dignity of teachers is impugned.  I will address the question of where such students should be placed, because that will have to be done.</P>
        <P>I did not hear it mentioned in the debate earlier, and perhaps it is not politically correct to talk about it, but I do not understand the reason all the responsibility for a child&rsquo;s education is placed on the school authorities.  Schools play a major role and formal education is one of the most important aspects of a child&rsquo;s upbringing but <Col N="1550"/>more emphasis must be put on the family and the parents in the case of disruptive students.  Many will argue that if one has responsible parents, one will not have disruptive students.  A school principal informed me that he had one of his teachers trailing a family in a large town in County Galway for several months to see why the children were not attending school.  The teacher finally met the father who assured him his three children would be at the school the following morning but only if the teacher paid him.  No one will doubt there is more trouble in that home than was mentioned at the door to the teacher.</P>
        <P>It is against this background that we must consider the other side of the coin.  This Bill draws the battle lines and disruptive students will be expelled from the school system.  Agencies, therefore, must be put in place to follow their progress outside of the school system.  The real disaster is if no one cares what happens to such children.  Those children left to their own devices outside of the system will inevitably have a prison term on their CV.</P>
        <P>Some parents take no blame for disruptive behaviour.  Many teachers have described situations where, after some misdemeanour by a pupil, the parents were asked to attend the school.  When informed of the incident, the parents would claim it is not their child who was wrong, it was the teacher.  These kinds of parents claim the teachers are failing their children and do not have the skills required to teach.  I accept there are bad teachers, just as there are bad Deputies and the odd bad Minister.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever link there is between the school and the home, it must include the parents and guardians of the children concerned.</P>
        <P>I admire youth work and extra-curricular activities.  Even in the best communities, there are always three or four parents who must do the work of 30 or 40.  Whatever activity, be it youth work, football or hurling, it will always come down to three or four good community-minded people.  The rest of the parents will not become involved and are not concerned so long as their children are collected and left home safely.  Many parents do not take their share of the responsibility for such activities.  I am a great advocate of the Outreach programme.  I was once a youth work officer and I believe it is important that young people are given the opportunity to express themselves out of school hours.  All youth organisations, such as For&oacute;ige, play an outstanding role.  Whatever funding is given to these organisations, it must be remembered how important their work is.</P>
        <P>Some of the Minister&rsquo;s actions tend to counter her legislative aims.  For example, some services <Col N="1551"/>in the home school community liaison scheme have been reduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been no reduction.  Up to 82 new teachers will be recruited for the scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>From a reply to a parliamentary question, I understand that the scheme in Athenry Vocational School will, as of 1 September 2007, be withdrawn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not be withdrawn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the service will be spread around a wider catchment area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should listen because I know exactly what I am talking about.</P>
        <P>The staff members who have responsibility for Athenry Vocational School and Loughrea Vocational School will not have the same remit next September.  They will have to cover a larger catchment area with more students.  Under the Bill&rsquo;s provisions, disruptive students will be removed from school.  I could not imagine a better service than the home liaison community scheme to deal with disruptive students rather than expelling them.  It has made a positive contribution in both Loughrea and Athenry.  The teachers involved know both the students and parents.  With the Exchequer brimming with tax returns, I cannot understand why this service is being reduced.  The work of the scheme has a direct and positive bearing on disruptive students because it connects the problems with the family.  While the process can be slow and tedious, it often works in assisting disruptive students.  The Minister&rsquo;s legislative intention runs counter to this.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is another important service.  In a reply to a parliamentary question, I learned 74 national schools in County Galway do not have direct access to the service.  The Minister claimed there was another route they can take to gain access.  I was not aware, until it was pointed out to me, that this can be an expensive route.  Even for the schools with access to service, there is an upper quota on the children that can be seen by the psychologist in any one school each year.  Principals have informed me that in national schools with up to four teachers, there is a limit to the number of children who can access the service.  The service should be student-orientated.  It is a good service that has ensured that children, who could have fallen through the system, were identified and assisted.  I have known disruptive students who were identified at an early stage to have learning problems.  Remedial action was taken and many have gone on to take university <Col N="1552"/>degrees.  If that had not happened, God only knows where they would be now.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s recent comment that the interaction between pupils and teachers is of great importance.  This makes it even more difficult to understand the overcrowding that exists in so many schools.  I understand the people of my area will have the pleasure of a visit from the Minister next Saturday, during which I hope to have a chat with her.  Pupils are walking over one another in Aughrim national school and in Cahergal national school outside Tuam, where there was a fire in recent weeks.  I visited Aughrim last week and was astonished at the situation; one could not swing a cat in the old part of the school.</P>
        <P>We cannot expect teachers and children to give of their best in such circumstances.  As many Members have observed, class size has a major effect on pupils&rsquo; performance, as do their surroundings.  Children and teachers packed into a banana box will not do as well as those who enjoy the modern set-up desired by all.  The Minister has a great personal interest in this area but much work remains to be done.</P>
        <P>I cannot imagine why any Member would oppose our proposals regarding voluntary alcohol and drug testing in schools.  If everybody signs up to such a scheme, including parents, teachers and boards of management, there is no reason that it should be contentious.  Many parents and teachers would be only too pleased to see such schemes initiated on a voluntary basis.  I sincerely hope they will be.</P>

	<P>I simply wonder how it might be implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is innovative in the area of education and so is the Fine Gael Party.  There are ways of implementing such policies if the will is there.  It is a challenge to tackle the alcohol and drugs crisis in our schools.  There is no point in burying our heads in the sand and pretending it is not happening.  The Taoiseach tried to suggest yesterday that there is no problem in this regard.  Like his brother, he does not <Col N="1553"/>realise the urgency of the situation.  There is a serious problem in our society in terms of alcohol and drug abuse.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has put forward an idea to alleviate this situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I merely ask who would carry out the testing in schools.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I will explain that presently.  The Minister&rsquo;s attitude seems to be to reject the proposal immediately rather than listen to the details.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am only asking who would do the testing of blood and urine samples.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposal does not involve blood and urine testing.  Two Irish companies produce the tests that we propose to use in schools; they are swab tests that do not involve blood or urine.  There are five or six different tests and it is for each school to decide which to use.  We propose that each school should be assigned a drugs adviser who is also a community worker.  He or she will liaise with boards of management, parents and teachers to implement any initiatives considered worthwhile to alleviate the problem of alcohol and drug abuse in schools.  This person will work with teachers to implement those initiatives.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael in government will implement this scheme.  In the meantime, we ask the Government to consider supporting schools in this way.  I agree with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comment that anything that might help is worth trying.  To question how it might be done and who will perform the testing is an irresponsible attitude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a reasonable question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but I object to the way the Minister asked it.  I appeal to her to keep an open mind on this.</P>
        <P>Some Members expressed concerns that such a scheme might infringe pupils&rsquo; rights.  It is clearly a voluntary initiative.  We want boards of management, teachers, parents and even pupils to sign up to it.  It will not be forced on anybody.  The Taoiseach cannot understand how such testing can be both voluntary and random.  It is simple.  When a school decides to implement this programme or another voluntary initiative, parents will be asked to sign up their children.  Only those children whose parents have given permission will be subject to random tests.  These children will have volunteered to be randomly tested.  It seems too complicated for the Taoiseach to figure out but it is a simple process that could deliver good results.</P>
        <P>The problem of alcohol and drugs availability in schools creates disciplinary problems and affects the health and welfare of young people.  This problem is not confined to young people but <Col N="1554"/>is evident in all sections of society.  A different initiative is required for each section.  This is one solution that we hope will work in schools.  Out intention is not to catch pupils out, name them as drug abusers or give them a criminal record.  The objective of the scheme is two-fold.  First, it offers young people a means of resisting pressure.  We are all aware that students are under immense pressure to partake of alcohol and drugs.  Alcohol is the greater problem but the incidence of drug use is increasing.</P>
        <P>Students need a way to overcome serious peer pressure.  We are all affected by peer pressure at different times in our lives.  For young people, that pressure can manifest itself through the use of drugs and alcohol.  Research shows that the possibility of being randomly tested on any given school day offers students a way out.  When encouraged to use alcohol or drugs by their peers or others, they can opt out because of the possibility they will be tested in school the next day.  It is a simple but effective solution.</P>
        <P>The second advantage of a programme of voluntary random testing is that it will identify those students who are engaging in alcohol and drug abuse so that they can be admitted to treatment programmes, receive counselling and so on.  This will give them a better chance in life.  We on this side of the House will consider other initiatives because we owe it to young people to protect them and give them a way out from peer pressure and bullies.  We have discussed this with boards of management, parents and students.  Most of those who examine it carefully see it is a worthwhile initiative.</P>
        <P>As the Minister observed, an important aspect of this is having somebody to carry out the testing.  We propose that a drugs adviser, with expertise in this area, should be available to every school to give advice on this and other initiatives.  Boards of management and teachers are not experts on all the issues that affect young people.  They require guidance and support and it is the responsibility of the Government to provide that.</P>
        <P>Most students say that alcohol use is rampant among their age group, particularly among younger secondary school children of 12, 13 and 14 years of age.  As they get older, students can either handle alcohol better or become mature enough to refuse it.  Children of 12, 13, and 14 years are vulnerable, however, and must be protected.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal is one way of offering that protection and it has a good chance of being successful.  The drugs advisers will be able to work with schools on other initiatives that will not involve random testing but will be concerned, for instance, with encouraging students to engage in other activities that keep them away from alcohol and drugs.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister not to mock this proposal without thinking it through fully.  Some Members have argued that implementing it would set us on the wrong road, reminiscent of schools in the <Col N="1555"/>Bronx.  We wish to prevent our schools becoming like those schools.  It is all about helping young people and trying to prevent them from engaging in abusive behaviour.</P>
        <P>Drug and alcohol abuse among students contributes to the serious deterioration in discipline in schools.  Difficulties in this regard are ongoing for several years.  We debated a motion on this issue a year ago, at which time the Minister said we were overreacting and being alarmist and that there was no need for changes in this area.  We are not being alarmist; the facts show that this is a serious problem.  That is why we support this Bill as a step in the right direction in tackling the problem of lack of discipline in schools.</P>
        <P>The Bill brings clarity to the situation.  It is hoped it will make the appeals system more straightforward and ensure that more appeals are upheld.  It also clearly sets out the rights of students in terms of the arguments they can make, and provides that there will be a thorough investigation before deciding whether schools have implemented their codes of behaviour correctly.  Teachers can also engage in bullying behaviour and we must ensure systems are in place to identify such teachers.  The provisions requiring that everything be investigated thoroughly on behalf of both students and teachers are welcome.  This clear guidance for the appeals procedure is welcome and will help ensure that all parties have a fair say.</P>
        <P>I have not fully read through the task force report, School Matters, but I will go through it with a fine-tooth comb.  The national behaviour support service assessed the 124 schools which applied to it.  I accept we cannot include every school but what was the criteria under which the schools were assessed?  Some 50 schools were picked from the 124 which applied.  Did the other schools miss out because of funding or because they did not need the service?  Will the Minister give us some information on that?  I accept every school cannot be included immediately but I would like to know if there were other reasons, apart from funding, schools were not included.  I appreciate it is a start-up project and that every school cannot be included immediately.</P>
        <P>The task force has valuable insights into strategies and approaches to deal with disruptive students.  The National Educational Welfare Board is currently finalising its guidelines on developing and implementing effective codes of behaviour.  I mentioned before in the House and at committee that we need stronger guidelines, codes of behaviour and disciplinary procedures for schools.  There must be standards across the board.  There should not be huge differences between schools in terms of codes of behaviour, breaches of discipline and so on.  We need better guidance.  Boards of management and schools are looking for clear guidelines to be set down. <Col N="1556"/> Indeed, a set of rules would go a long way in many schools.</P>
        <P>Recently qualified teachers have told me they did not get enough training in class control, disciplinary procedures and so on and feel unequipped to deal with this issue in the classroom.  We need to address that issue.  The Minister will probably outline all she is doing but teachers have told me they do not believe they have the skills to handle disciplinary matters.  Much of that has to do with the person but it also has to do with the procedures.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the handbook student teachers receive when they leave college has a chapter on discipline.  They should be given help and guidance in the area of discipline because it is a major problem for teachers.  Teachers of all ages have said to us that they can no longer cope in the classroom.  Some teachers are retiring early because they cannot handle the pressure of teaching.  Other teachers spend all day trying to control the class and do not even get to teach.  I have seen teachers in action and some have very bad methods to deal with discipline, which add to the problem.  Other teachers are very effective.  Surely we can learn from teachers who get it right and can control a class.  Some teachers do not have the ability to do so and we must help them, give them guidelines and provide them with better training.  One way or another, we must solve this problem.</P>
        <P>Regardless of how good the teacher, there are problems with students who need help inside and outside the school environment.  Help should be given from a very young age.  My colleague spoke about the role of parents.  Parents have an important role in ensuring their children are disciplined, mannerly and so on.  However, that is lacking among many and we must do what we can to fix it.  Parenting courses would go a long way towards helping that.  Not every parent is perfect.  Most parents have ups and downs and admit they do not always get it right.  They would be quite happy to accept help and guidance along the way.  However, some parents have to be forced to accept help and guidance.</P>
        <P>We must seriously consider parenting courses for all parents because it is a difficult time to bring up young people and to have children given the pressures we face.  It is hard to instill discipline in children, get them ready to become full members of society and to treat people with respect.  We need to help parents and parenting courses are one way to do so.  If one wants to adopt a child, one must do nearly 18 months of courses yet any couple can decide to have a child without doing a course.  On many occasions we talk about education as a way to solve problems but we must accept we can take action to prepare children for school.  We cannot expect teachers to solve every problem.</P>
        <P>While this Bill mainly deals with long-term suspensions and expulsions from school, I refer to <Col N="1557"/>short-term suspensions.  Perhaps I am wrong but I believe short-term suspensions are dished out too quickly and, therefore, lose their effect.  If they are given out all the time, they have no effect, especially if given out for minor breaches of discipline.  One loses a tool one could use at a later stage for a worse breach of discipline.  It is unfair on some students who get suspended for a couple of days for the wrong reasons.  For some families, having a child suspended is still a big embarrassment and can cause serious problems.  It is not simply a couple of days off school and no big deal.  It is a big deal and it goes on the student&rsquo;s record.  The boards will bring forward codes of discipline and I look forward to debating them.  We have a serious problem with discipline which we must tackle in any way we can.</P>
        <P>Youthreach was mentioned earlier.  It does a very good job but it has not been mainstreamed.  It is located in parts of buildings or wherever it can get some space.  If we accept Youthreach has done a good job, surely we can give it proper places to hold classes and treat it with the respect to which it is entitled.  It is doing a very good job and some students are getting a great chance, which they are taking.  We need to help and encourage these students and provide them with a proper environment in which to attend school.  One&rsquo;s environment has a big impact.  If classes are too big, classrooms become crowded, especially if there are computers in the room.  It is very hard to work in such an environment and for the teacher to try to control a class.  Progress is being made to reduce class sizes but we must realise we are not moving fast enough in some areas.</P>
        <P>Prefabs and poor buildings result in young people having a negative attitude towards their environment.  If one is being taught in a prefab, which is 20 years old and which would fall apart if one kicked it, one would not have much respect for it and for those who work in it.  We would not work in poor conditions, so we should not expect students to do so.  We should demand and expect better for young people so they will feel better in their classrooms.  That alone would help discipline.  A range of initiatives should be taken.</P>
        <P>Disruptive students cannot be corrected in school alone.  There must be more for them outside the school, namely, in their homes and communities.  Our society has become busier and richer but we have forgotten to look after young people in their communities.  We have not provided them with the facilities they need.  Despite the millions of euro spent in recent years, we need to do more and provide new initiatives, programmes and structures for young people of all ages in villages, towns and cities to give them a chance, places to go for support and to meet so they do not hang around streets and bad places where they will get into trouble.  If young people have excess energy, there is a good chance they will do something wrong in school or outside it.  If we keep young people busy, give them plenty <Col N="1558"/>to do and provide them with help and support, there is a good chance they will not cause major problems in school or elsewhere.  However, we are failing to do that.  I do not blame anybody or any Government for that.  We have failed to act over a number of years as this country has developed.  Young people are always the last group on which money is spent in terms of council budgets, etc.  It is necessary to provide young people with facilities.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Students are under much pressure and we spoke earlier about peer pressure in the context of drink and drugs.  Addressing that issue will involve drugs advisers, medical personnel and others who will help with random testing, etc.  Students are under other pressures, whether in terms of fashion, religion or otherwise.  They are also under pressure as a result of the workload placed on them.  Are we expecting too much from some students as they go through their school years?  They do a full day at school and when they go home, they do another four or five hours study or homework.  Few people in the workforce would work the same number of hours as students.  Some students doss as do some adults, Deputies and Ministers.  However, many students are under pressure to work many hours to try to get the results they need to climb the ladder in life.  We must look at that situation.  We ask too much of our young people today.  The education system has served us well over the years but there has to be a way to relieve the pressure on young people.  While many of their problems are examples of indiscipline and bad behaviour, others are tragic.  The pressures of society, examinations and workloads in school contribute to that situation.</P>
      
        <P>The Bill is relatively small but the lives of students are of great significance and we do not devote enough time to them.  They are not properly looked after.  There is a responsibility on all of us to push their agenda and help as much as we can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their interest in the Bill and for their comments, not just concerning discipline but wider issues in education.  This Bill is only one element in tackling problems of discipline, which is a serious issue for a small number of schools.  In those schools, however, it needs to be addressed.  The recommendations of the task force, which are being implemented as we speak, were very broad in range and this legislation is just one of those recommendations.</P>
        <P>In answer to Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, the task force comprises psychologists, teachers and principals and they will go into schools as teams.  They invited every school to briefing sessions to explain what their work was about.  They invited applications from schools, of which there were 124 in total, 50 of which they prioritised for <Col N="1559"/>immediate roll-out based entirely on the information given by the schools.</P>
        <P>There is no set model for how this will work.  Some schools need support in staff training and in internal management.  Others need support to work with individual groups of children and others need behavioural support in the classroom.  Even for the last of those there is no particular model because the support offered depends on the circumstances of the school and the issues it wishes to address.  We do not have a preconceived notion of a particular model that will work but are open to what is happening on the ground and are keen to start work immediately.</P>
        <P>The budget for 2007 is quite generous, at &euro;8 million, and schools will immediately be notified.  Next week is the mid-term break and the behavioural support team will start working the following week, meaning we will see real progress in its work this term.  Schools will appreciate the high calibre of the leader and other members.  Their experience on the ground and the ideas they bring to the team are varied and will help make a real difference.</P>
        <P>They will have to consider other options for schools, such as the involvement of parents&rsquo; councils and student councils, to give a voice to students, which are a crucial part of maintaining discipline and a code of behaviour.</P>
        <P>To answer Deputy English&rsquo;s question, every school is required to have an anti-bullying policy.  A template for a number of different policies has been given to all schools and is available on the website, giving schools a formula to use and adapt to their own situation.  I referred earlier to the code on which the National Educational Welfare Board is working for primary schools and it is something for which schools have asked.</P>
        <P>Staff, students and parents must sign up to a code of behaviour, or for that matter an anti-bullying policy, otherwise it will not work.  Significant help has been given recently by the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, on new forms of bullying such as web bullying, mobile telephone bullying etc.  If I were to write out all the things that were happening in combatting bullying, such as the school support service, social, personal and health education, legislation, policy templates and campaigns and supports given by the NCTE, they would amount to a national strategy and that strategy is making a real difference in schools.  It is unfortunate that people still suffer in schools, as they suffer in society, which is all the more reason why targeted initiatives need to be in place.</P>
        <P>Deputy Enright raised a typical point.  She mentioned a student who had applied to a number of schools and did not receive even one answer.  If a parent applies formally to a school the school must answer within 21 days.  If the school does not answer, the Department can ask <Col N="1560"/>for clarification and, if it continues not to answer, it is taken as a <i>de facto</i> refusal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Does &ldquo;formally&rdquo; mean in writing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The school cannot kick it into touch.  The Bill provides that the appeals committee can draw inferences from the school failing to comply with the requirement to give information, limiting the capacity of the school to defer decisions on enrolments.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan asked about expelling a student.  The educational welfare officer must be notified before a student is expelled and a student cannot be expelled before 20 days have passed.  Some Deputies asked whether such expelled students were thrown out on to the street.  Anybody below a certain age must be accommodated in another school.  I accept that one size does not fit all and some have particular difficulties.  We are currently carrying out an audit of other out-of-school provisions that include Youthreach and the youth encounter project and provide very valuable work, with a view to seeing how they can be strengthened.  A recommendation was made for a junior Youthreach, which I would support, but I am adamant it should not be for children aged 12.  A child cannot be rejected from a mainstream second level school before he or she sets foot in it, which is what would happen because certain children at primary school would be told to go into Youthreach.  That makes them a failure before they start.</P>
        <P>Given that one in five primary school teachers now deals with children with learning difficulties of one type or another, I hope that problems of basic literacy and numeracy could be addressed and supported in primary schools.  The school completion programme deals with transition from primary to secondary school as a key element of its work.  The expansion of home school community liaison is another feature which can help children to make the transition.  The evidence shows that problems largely arise in second year, rather than first, so I do not want 12 year old children to be rejected from the mainstream.  I see junior Youthreach as an added support for problems relating to discipline.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan raised a subject which is supported by the task force, namely the idea of holistic supports in schools.  These may take the form of parents&rsquo; rooms, for which all the disadvantaged schools have been invited to apply under the dormant accounts scheme.  Such initiatives support the work of the home school community liaison officers, of which there are currently 370, with interviews taking place for the recruitment of a further 80, making a total of 450.  Their work will be concentrated on disadvantaged schools but we made it quite clear that schools that currently have a service will continue to hold it, in line with their level of disadvantage and the size of the school population.  The <Col N="1561"/>number is over and above the mainstream classroom teachers and can make a huge difference.</P>
        <P>I accept the point that class size can be an issue.  At second level, which is what we are discussing, there is a teacher for every 13 students.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are still thousands of students in classes of more than 30 students.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a statistic, not the reality on the ground.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the reality.  If one offers subject choices at second level, some classes will be small.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some are big.</P>

	<P>A student I met told me that there are 28 people in her English class.  When I asked her about another of her subjects, she told me that there were two people in her Spanish class.  When one tries to get the best use out of one&rsquo;s teachers and offers different subjects, some classes will be larger than others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>We know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a teacher for every 13 students, including important posts such as guidance teachers, the number of which we have increased in the past two years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>That does not help English teachers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and resource teachers.  As there is such variety in second level schools, it is important for a school&rsquo;s management to ensure that the mix of subjects and the distribution of teachers suits the school&rsquo;s situation.  If schools have questions on this matter or on how it is being implemented locally, they can raise them with the behaviour support service to determine whether the matter is having an effect or what type of curriculum is on offer.  For example, should they have junior certificate support teams and should they offer more practical subjects?  Next September, the new subjects of technology and computer-aided design will be introduced.  As these subjects can suit those who are good with their hands, we should ensure that schools offer such a curriculum to support children.</P>
        <P>If we are to have top class schools, buildings are an issue.  As the House is aware, of the country&rsquo;s 4,000 schools, 1,500 will have building programmes and their&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  Children should be allowed to run around, but they do not need to go on break together.  A little local management should be used to send classes out one at a time.  They do <Col N="1563"/>not all need to run around in playgrounds that are too small for them.</P>

	<P>We want to raise people, not machines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.  That children spend 20% of their waking hours in school per year is wonderful.  Deputy English is right in that we cannot expect schools to do everything.  One must look to communities and parents because we cannot expect teachers to do everything or schools to answer every problem.</P>
        <P>We want to provide quality education for all students.  When the task force was launched, I accepted the recommendation to introduce this legislation to rebalance rights, but it is important not to focus on the right to expel.  The Bill is concerned with ensuring that proper considerations are taken into account during an appeals process.  The first consideration listed is &ldquo;the nature, scale and persistence of any behaviour alleged to have given rise to, or contributed to, the decision made by or on behalf of the board&rdquo; and the reasonableness of any effort made by the school to enable the student to participate in and benefit from education.</P>
        <P>The Bill focuses on individual students.  This is as it should be because constant chattering at the back of a class could be viewed as disruptive behaviour in some schools or be ignored in others.  It is important not to ignore an individual&rsquo;s rights, but we should recognise the rights of other students to get an education and the rights of teachers to teach.  I do not accept that the Bill does not go far enough.  It is a rebalancing of rights and provides guidance to an appeals board on what should be considered.</P>
        <P>Regarding expulsions, a great deal of section 29 relates to second level schools rather than primary schools.  As I told Deputies who raised the matter of second level class sizes yesterday, the schedule for primary level will be sent during the coming weeks and class sizes will be reduced in September, as was the case last year.</P>
        <P>As I told the INTO this morning, if any Minister for Education and Science had stood before it five years ago and stated that there would be 4,000 extra primary school teachers by now, he or she would have been laughed at.  If a Minister had stated ten years ago when the Government entered into office that there would be 7,000 or 8,000 extra teachers by now, the INTO would have laughed at him or her.  However, both increases have come to pass.</P>

        <Quest> the measures outlined in the national development plan that will address the east-west divide in tourism numbers and income, the need to upgrade Ireland&rsquo;s tourist attractions, particularly outside of Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[5955/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Development Plan 2007-2013, Transforming Ireland, includes the largest-ever Government investment programme for the development of tourism.  This tourism development programme, which provides for an &euro;800 million Exchequer investment over the next seven years, has as one of its fundamental objectives the stimulation of regional development.  The programme includes an international marketing sub-programme, which provides &euro;335 million to promote the island of Ireland in key international markets.  The key objective over the <Col N="1565"/>seven years will be to increase tourism revenue and visitor yield and to help achieve a wider regional and seasonal distribution of business.  It also includes a product development and infrastructure sub-programme, which provides &euro;317 million to upgrade and supplement our tourism attractions and activities and to deliver a national conference centre in Dublin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Earlier today, I launched F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s tourism product development strategy for the period 2007 to 2013.  That strategy clearly sets out what must be done to ensure the Irish tourism product is relevant and fit for purpose in today&rsquo;s changing marketplace.  It also identifies the bodies and agencies that are in the best position to deliver the necessary results.  In rolling out programmes and initiatives under the strategy, special regard will be paid to the need for integrated regional development.</P>
        <P>A training and human resource development sub-programme is also part of the plan, which will invest &euro;148 million in the education and training of the tourism workforce, both domestic and non-national, as well as sustaining structured educational opportunities in the third level colleges and institutes of technology around the country.  It will also provide for the continuation of initiatives aimed at improving management capability and networking in SMEs and micro-enterprises at regional level.</P>
        <P>In addition to direct investment through the tourism development programme, the new NDP includes a range of complementary programmes that will greatly benefit the future development of tourism.  These relate not only to the major planned capital investment in transport, energy and environmental services but also to the proposed investment of over &euro;900 million in culture infrastructure and &euro;990 million in sport infrastructure under my Department&rsquo;s Vote.</P>
        <P>Many more opportunities for investment in tourism will arise under the new NDP, many of which will have a strong regional and rural dimension.  It will be important, therefore, for developers of tourism attractions to tap into these other sources of funding.  These areas include, to mention but a few, the proposed new gateway innovation fund, the programme of investment in North/South co-operation, the rural social and economic development programme, the Gaeltacht and islands development programme, the built and natural heritage sub-programmes, the waterways sub-programme and the urban and village renewal fund.</P>
        <P>As Deputies will be aware, last year I announced the appointment of the chairs of the five new regional tourism development boards.  These boards are now in place and their key objective is to ensure a greater focus on the individual needs of each region at a national level, and direct involvement for the regions in the development of national policy and tourism strategy.  These new regional tourism structures <Col N="1566"/>will be an important resource available to the various spending agencies in optimising the tourism benefits of their investment under the national development plan, thereby adding to the social and economic impact locally of such spending.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister outline the measures in the national development plan and the tourism product development strategy launched today that will distribute tourists more evenly throughout the country and provide the attractions that will encourage them to leave Dublin?  Most of the growth in numbers and in development has taken place in Dublin.  Will the Minister outline the percentage distribution of international tourism revenue between the eastern seaboard and the rest of the country for 2005 and 2006 and the comparable figures for 2000?</P>
        <P>In light of the increasing numbers of foreign nationals, who are very welcome, working in the hotel and catering industry, what steps are being taken to ensure these staff are well informed about Ireland and its tourism attractions so they can give good advice and information to our visitors?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister recognise that many of our tourism attractions are now tired and lack creativity?  What measures are there in the national development plan to address this problem and how long with that take?  The Cliffs of Moher centre that was opened last week was in the pipeline for 17 years.</P>
        <P>What measures are being taken to combat litter and to improve the appearance of our cities, towns and villages?  Will the Minister give a commitment today on the opening date of the national conference centre?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The measures announced today are intended to benefit the regions.  Consideration must be given in the course of the implementation of the F&aacute;ilte Ireland strategy to various proposals which will come forward.  Some of our attractions require reinvigoration and it is our intention to ensure this happens.  The intention under the product development scheme is to reinvigorate some of the older attractions and, in that context, it should be remembered that there are 7,500 of these.  It is then intended to establish some new attractions.</P>
        <P>The specifics are not spelt out in the plan but we recognise the need to have particular regard to our own culture and heritage.  Attractions that might be considered include those which would be a showcase for our traditional music, song and dance.  Also, to accentuate difference is to gain a greater dividend in terms of numbers from foreign shores so it might be appropriate to look back and consider emigration that has taken place from this country by having a centre similar in concept if not design to the Ellis Island project in New York.  There is a number of projects that <Col N="1567"/>may be considered and we will seek a regional spread for them.</P>
        <P>The formulation of new super-regions and the formation of the new regional tourism development boards have given a new impetus to regional tourism, as witnessed by substantial increases last year in visitor numbers to the regions.  There was a substantial increase in the number of visitors to the south west in 2005.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The largest ever Government investment programme for the development of arts and culture was unveiled at the end of January in the National Development Plan 2007-2013: Transforming Ireland.  Some &euro;1.13 billion in capital funding has been allocated to the NDP cultural sub-programme, which will see &euro;904 million allocated in respect of areas under the remit of my Department over the period 2007 to 2013.  The remaining &euro;226 million is for Irish language strategy that is to be administered by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. </P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s record in the arts and culture area is one of which we can be justifiably proud and I am delighted to outline our goals for the coming seven years in this regard.  In our fast-paced and vibrant economy, it is important to remember that economic indicators alone cannot measure a strong and healthy society.  The well-being of our society is dependent also on the vitality of our communities.  The arts have a critical role to play in enlivening, invigorating and distinguishing our society, locally, nationally and internationally.  Unquestionably, this national development plan places the arts and cultural sector at the very core of Government policy and at the leading edge of its developmental objectives.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan 2007-2013 will also provide major capital infrastructure resources in Dublin for cultural purposes.  Under <Col N="1568"/>the plan, the headline projects are &euro;288 million for the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall and the Abbey Theatre, &euro;45 million for the extension of the National Library, &euro;45 million for the refurbishment of historic buildings and enhanced collection space at the National Gallery of Ireland, &euro;7 million for the Gaiety Theatre, &euro;45 million for new exhibition space for the Irish Museum of Modern Art, &euro;10 million for the Chester Beatty Library expansion and &euro;20 million for the National Archives of Ireland.</P>
        <P>This funding is in addition to the current funding provided on a yearly basis to the National Archives, National Library of Ireland, National Gallery, National Museum of Ireland, National Concert Hall, Irish Museum of Modern Art and Chester Beatty Library.  It is also in addition to capital moneys to be provided for routine capital works, acquisitions, exhibitions and digitisation projects at those institutions.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach unveiled the model and architectural design for the Exploration Station, sometimes known as the national children&rsquo;s museum on the 5 February 2007.  This facility will be Ireland&rsquo;s first purpose-built interactive science centre.</P>
  
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P>It will strive to inspire a lifelong passion for discovery and innovation in children and young adults.  It will do this by engaging young minds with a range of interactive exhibits and programmes demonstrating the relevant role of science in our lives.  Children are the main focus for this initiative but it will be of interest to people of all ages with a particular focus on young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.  This initiative is in receipt of capital funding from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I have undertaken to provide up to 39% of its current funding requirements.  This commitment is dependent upon me being satisfied that the venture is properly grounded in the commercial reality, that provision is made to ensure the socially disadvantaged have access to the facility, and that a robust business model is prepared.  I authorised my Department to provide &euro;150,000 to the establishment of the station in 2006 and have increased this funding to &euro;250,000 in 2007.</P>
        <P>My Department has provided financial support to Dublin City Gallery, the Hugh Lane, which is situated in Parnell Square, in response to specific requests for financial support from this gallery.  My Department will give due consideration to any future requests for funding that may be received from the gallery.  The National Centre for Partnership and Performance, situated in Parnell Square, which was established by the Government in 2001 and placed on a statutory footing in January this year, does not fall within my responsibilities.  However, I am sure its <Col N="1569"/>location in the square is of benefit to the general area.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>Dublin City Council is examining the possibility of establishing a cultural zone in Parnell Square and my Department is in discussions with the council in the context of determining the character, content and positioning of such a zone and its complementarity to the existing and anticipated cultural landscape of the city.  The national Access programme, for which &euro;81 million is provided in the NDP, also covers Dublin and I will be announcing the second round allocations under the scheme in March.  Meantime, the redevelopment and extension projects at Smock Alley and the Gate Theatre have been initiated and construction should commence later this year.</P>

	<P>The children&rsquo;s museum is of major significance to many schools not only in the Dublin area, but throughout the country, whose pupils come to the city for school tours.  When will the project be completed?  We have all the other museums, art centres, etc, but I am not aware of any other museums that contribute to developing a child&rsquo;s mind in such a way.  What funding does the national development plan commit to the museum?  Is it to be a public private partnership?  Is the site mentioned the best one for it or would it be better placed in the Parnell Square development that Dublin City Council is to make into a civic and arts centre?  After the development of O&rsquo;Connell Street, this area needs an injection of funding and it has some wonderful buildings.  Is the site proposed for it now written in stone?</P>

	<P>The Exploration Station, which is sometimes known as the national children&rsquo;s museum and was unveiled by the Taoiseach, does not come under the ambit of my Department but the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

This commitment is dependent upon me being satisfied that the venture is properly grounded in the commercial reality, that provision is made to ensure the socially disadvantaged have access to the facility, and that a robust business model is prepared.  I authorised my Department to provide &euro;150,000 to the establishment of the station in 2006 and increased this funding to &euro;250,000 in 2007.</P>
        <P>I envisage that the Exploration Station will be completed within the next year or two.  However, I do not have a precise timeframe and I will request the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to communicate the precise timeframe &mdash; if he has it &mdash; to the Deputy.

        <Quest> his plans for investment in sport under the national development plan, including the rationale for each sectional allocation; if a pool at Lucan will be included under the local authority swimming pool programme, subject to an application being made; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[5921/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the sport sub-programme of the National Development Plan 2007-2013, the Government will invest &euro;991 million in sporting infrastructure over the next seven years.  This investment will comprise the following: the development of flagship projects, such as the National Sports Campus at Abbotstown and the new Lansdowne Road stadium; the delivery of a range of sporting facilities, including swimming pools, at community and regional level; and supporting the development of facilities to enhance the quality of the experience to be enjoyed at horse and greyhound racing venues.</P>
        <P>The national development plan includes the provision of &euro;149 million towards the development of a campus of sports facilities at Abbotstown of which &euro;119 million will fund phase 1 of the project.  This will meet the indoor and outdoor training needs of Irish elite sportspersons, who compete at national and international levels, and will also provide high-quality facilities for the local community.  The first steps in the realisation of the sports campus is commencing with the refurbishment of the former State Laboratory as the new headquarters of the FAI, which I expect will be ready for occupation later this year.</P>
        <P>In addition to overseeing the development of phase 1 of the campus, one of the tasks of the newly established National Sports Campus Development Authority will be to identify and prioritise the next phase of the development, in respect of which &euro;30 million is being set aside in the NDP.</P>
        <P>The Government has agreed to provide &euro;191 million towards the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road stadium as a 50,000-seat state-of-the-art stadium.  The new stadium will be a first-rate <Col N="1571"/>facility appropriate to a contemporary international arena.  The planning process must run its course and the outcome of an adjudication by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeals against the granting of planning approval for the project by Dublin City Council is awaited.  I am optimistic that, by 2010, we will have a second splendid major stadium for field sports in the city of Dublin at Lansdowne Road.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;184 million is being provided over the next seven years for the local authority swimming pool programme to fund the completion of the current round of the programme, which has been in operation since 2000, and the launch of a new round which I hope to announce in the coming months.  On the basis of current grant levels, available funding should enable us to embark on the construction of almost 50 new public pools, which will be a very significant addition to our sporting and recreational infrastructure.</P>
  
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P>The current round of the programme, under which grant aid of up to &euro;3.8 million is provided, has been closed to new applicants since July 2000 in order to give priority to the 57 projects in the round.  However, my Department is completing an expenditure review of the local authority swimming pool programme at present.  The review is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date and what changes, if any, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  The review is currently being finalised and it is my intention to publish it as soon as possible.  Following consideration of the recommendations in the review, it is my intention to launch a new round of the local authority swimming pool programme as soon as possible.  When the programme is re-opened, it will be open to all local authorities to submit applications under the terms that will apply &mdash; this includes South Dublin County Council in respect of proposals for a pool at Lucan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The cornerstone for the much-improved sporting infrastructure of the country during the term of the Government has been the national lottery-funded sports capital programme.  The programme has helped provide hundreds of new pitches, changing rooms, sports halls and much needed equipment to sports clubs throughout Ireland.</P>
        <P>The national development plan will ensure the continuation of the sports capital programme and the provision of sport and recreational facilities on a nationwide basis.  Almost &euro;420 million will be allocated over the period of the plan, once again highlighting the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that people throughout the country will have access to top-of-the-range sporting facilities.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to funding of the Irish horse and greyhound racing industries through the horse and greyhound racing fund has <Col N="1572"/>enabled a programme of capital investment in horse and greyhound racing tracks in recent years which has underpinned a growth in both sectors.  This will continue under the national development plan and should enable Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon to undertake long-term planning which will result in the further development of a network of modern, well-managed facilities for both industries which will continue to be attractive to the public.</P>
        <P>The benefits of participating in sport, whether at the level of competitive sport, recreational sport or active leisure activity, must be fully appreciated by all.  The Government&rsquo;s investment in sport to date has yielded benefits to people in terms of physical, cultural, educational, emotional well-being and personal development.  This effect, though difficult to evaluate, is tangible and very real.  The value of sports tourism, for example, has been placed in the order of &euro;350 million per year.</P>
        <P>The Government is determined that people should have access to sporting and recreational facilities, whether they are competing in sport professionally or simply participating for health, recreation, relaxation and enjoyment.  The investment of &euro;991 million under the national development plan is clear evidence of the importance the Government attaches to putting in place modern well-equipped and well-managed sporting facilities which will have real and lasting benefit to our communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>The first part of my question relates to how the funding will be allocated.  I will not get into an argument about the horse and greyhound racing fund, which I have raised before.  Given that the nationwide audit of sports facilities promised in the programme for Government may not be ready by the time the Government ends its term, what plan does the Minister have to ascertain the best locations to which to allocate the money under the sports capital programme, for example, or the local authority swimming pool programme?  Has any detailed analysis been done or is it planned to do such analysis on the number of new schools in an area and its demographics and their relationship to sporting need so that we can target where sporting investment needs to be made?</P>
        <P>I welcome the investment outlined in the NDP.  However, we need to ensure that whatever Government comes after this one tries to allocate the funding fairly and on the basis of need.  That has not necessarily happened in the past.  The sports clubs and groups with the best organisations have made submissions resulting in a geographical anomaly.  Is there a mechanism in place to identify need and to ensure funding is appropriately targeted?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The first phase of the audit is under way in my Department.  There is no doubt but that it will not be completed before the forthcoming election.  However, I anticipate that <Col N="1573"/>in due course the results of the audit will be made available.  Facilities which are grant aided must comply with certain criteria.  Each proposal is benchmarked against this criteria.  A project that does not qualify having been benchmarked does not receive grant aid.  Where grant aid is approved it does not automatically follow that the funding will accrue to the organisation concerned.  All of the conditions imposed in respect of the allocation of a grant must be fulfilled by the organisation concerned.  This includes compliance with all relevant planning guidelines and by-laws and the availability of local funding for the project.  Projects are not simply plucked from here and there, each project is benchmarked against a set of strict criteria.  Many of the issues raised by Deputy Gogarty are covered by the criteria used in the benchmarking process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a top town analysis in terms of need which would allow particular groups to apply?  On the swimming pool programme, will the Department liaise with the Department of Education and Science on the provision for multi-use school campuses of a swimming pool partially funded by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism?  Lastly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>There is not time for a third question.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the new swimming pool programme be announced and what is the timeframe for application?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I hope to announce the new swimming pool programme in the next couple of months.  Applications in that regard will then be invited from various towns and cities.  The applications will be individually examined because each applicant will be required to submit a preliminary report.  The OPW and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism must be satisfied as to the need, feasibility and viability of each application as is the case in regard to sports capital funding.  The population of a particular town or city will be important in considering whether additional facilities are required.  These factors are considered in the context of the criteria laid down.  I reiterate that projects are not simply plucked out of the air willy nilly.  Each project is assessed on its merits and benchmarked against the relevant criteria.</P>

	<P>Last autumn, the Government decided to proceed with the redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre at George&rsquo;s Dock on a build, finance, and maintain, BFM, basis.   At the same time, I announced the holding of an international design competition for the new Abbey Theatre, details of which have yet to be published.  The OPW is currently working on the detailed technical specifications for the competition and these will be available to interested parties when finalised and the competition has been formally published.  A competition of this nature is a complex one and takes time to perfect.  An added complexity to be addressed is the handover of the winning design to the winning public-private partnership, PPP.  This must also be addressed in the competition documentation.</P>
        <P>A jury is being set up to select the winning design.  The jury will comprise representatives from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the OPW, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the Arts Council and the Abbey Theatre.  When a winning design has been selected the building will be procured by means of a build, finance and maintain public private partnership.  A construction phase of approximately 18 months is envisaged once the PPP contract has been signed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The impression was given on 6 September last that this competition would commence immediately.  When will the competition commence?  How long will it take and when will the successful designer be announced?  This saga has been ongoing for the past ten years.  The national theatre is operating in antiquated conditions which is not fair to the performers, artistic directors or patrons.  It is time this saga was brought to a close.  Also, when does he expect work will commence on the new theatre and does he have a completion date in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I have given Deputy Deenihan an outline of what I consider to be the timeframe involved.  It is impossible for me to state how long the public private partnership will take.  The PPP contract is complex, as we learned during the development of proposals for the National Conference Centre.  It is a lengthy and complex method of procurement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister give any indication&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The OPW is working on a detailed technical specification for the competition in regard to the Abbey Theatre.  Obviously, all of this documentation will be made available to interested parties when finalised and the competition has been formally published.  It is not possible for me to say at this point when exactly the new designer will be selected.  I had hoped that we would be in a position to present the new design this summer.  I remain hopeful that will be the case.  We will then be required to move on to <Col N="1575"/>the PPP stage following which all relevant financial proposals will have to be examined.  Only then can the contract for construction of the theatre be placed.  As I stated earlier, it is envisaged that once that process is finalised, construction should be completed within approximately 18 months.  That is as accurate as I can be on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is being very ambitious in terms of presenting the new design this summer given the competition has not yet been announced.  When exactly will it be announced?  Can he give a timeframe for commencement and completion of the project?  Will this saga continue for another ten years?  I remind the Minister that the Cliffs of Moher project was in the pipeline for some 17 years.  We must ensure this project which has been ongoing for ten years does not continue for that long.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The idea for the Cliffs of Moher project may have been thought of 17 years ago but it was presented to me only in the context of the tourism product development scheme in the past couple of years.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am seeking information in regard to the Abbey Theatre.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Funding of &euro;10.5 million was sanctioned for that project.  Despite only a couple of years passing since the project was first discussed with Clare County Council, the project is now in place.  That is pretty good going by any standards.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</askee>
        <Quest> if he will clarify his recent call for figures within the racing industry to support the redevelopment of the Curragh Racecourse; the amount of money the Government has hitherto pledged to the redevelopment; if he anticipates further Government support for this project; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[5547/07]</QRef><Col N="1576"/>
      </Qst>
      
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The redevelopment of the Curragh racecourse is part of an overall programme through which &euro;280 million will be invested in racecourse development throughout the country by the end of 2007 under Horse Racing Ireland&rsquo;s, HRI, capital development fund for Irish racecourses.  Under this fund, HRI, which is the statutory body responsible for the horseracing industry, will provide up to &euro;140 million in grant aid with racecourses financing the balance from their own resources.  HRI has approved grant aid of &euro;35.6 million towards the redevelopment of the Curragh racecourse.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>HRI receives a guaranteed level of funding each year from the horse and greyhound racing fund, which is based on accrued excise duty on off-course betting, subject to a minimum level based on the year 2000 level adjusted for inflation.  Any shortfall in the amount generated by the excise duty is made up by direct Exchequer subvention.  Since 2001, HRI has received over &euro;317 million from the horse and greyhound racing fund and will receive a further &euro;58 million from the fund in 2007.  The new national development plan, covering the period 2007-13, includes &euro;70 million in capital provision for the horse and greyhound racing industries which will enable HRI and Bord na gCon to undertake the further development of a network of facilities for both industries.  In addition, both industries also receive a significant level of current funding under the provisions of the fund which enables the industries to meet borrowing commitments.</P>
        <P>The redevelopment of the Curragh racecourse, which is the flagship project for Kildare, will involve the movement of the existing road, construction of a new grandstand and facilities and the relocation of the Stand House Hotel to overlook the racecourse.  This will result in a world-class facility and further enhance Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a world leader in the field of horse racing.  Work has now commenced on the road and this is scheduled to be completed by the end of May 2007.  The full redevelopment is scheduled for completion in 2009.</P>
        <P>The redevelopment of the racecourse has received the support of His Highness, the Aga Khan, who in 2003 purchased the Stand House Hotel adjacent to the racecourse and donated it to the Turf Club on behalf of Irish racing.  I acknowledge his generosity and the role played by the then senior steward of the Turf Club, Ray Rooney.  The redevelopment has also received the support of three leading owners who are sponsoring the construction cost of the road and it was in this context that I recently urged those who benefit most from the industry to also support the redevelopment of the Curragh racecourse, which is the home of flat racing in Ireland.  I acknowledge the role played by all involved with the Curragh racecourse, including the current senior steward, Pierce Molony, and thank them for their continuing effort and commitment.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1577"/>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and associate myself with his remarks about the Aga Khan and the three owners.  I attended the Moyglare dinner at the K Club at which the Minister stated he was looking for others to do as those owners did and get behind the project.  This gives rise to concern that some aspects of the industry are not fully supportive of the development at the Curragh.  I asked the question to find out whether the Minister&rsquo;s remarks were a general overview of the position aimed at getting everyone who could support the Curragh in their own way to do so, although they may not have offered financial support like the three owners.  It is the flagship of the flat racing world and certainly generates huge revenue for Kildare and the counties in its catchment area during the flat season.  I asked the question to see whether it was a general overview to get people involved who could take on other aspects of the development and sponsor or fund it as the three owners have done in respect of the new road.  This road, which is nearing completion, will certainly be very significant for safety and the transport of horses on the Curragh and will allow the development to take place.  Did the Minister believe there was someone who could add further to the development at the Curragh?</P>
        <P>Are there other sporting events or aspects of sport which could be catered for at the Curragh?  I know that, at one stage, the late Michael Osborne, God rest him, proposed that a project concerning national hunt racing could be undertaken.  I do not think this developed into anything.  Does the Minister have a view on this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>My remarks at the dinner, to which the Deputy referred, were of a general nature in acknowledging the contribution of His Highness, the Aga Khan, and the generosity of John Magnier, Michael Tabor and Derrick Smith.  I was encouraging other people involved in the industry who benefit from it to see whether they could also invest for the benefit of the racing industry and, in particular, the benefit of racing in Kildare and its flagship project, the Curragh, which is the headquarters of Irish flat racing.</P>
        <P>To answer Deputy Wall&rsquo;s second question, I do not envisage national hunt racing taking place at the Curragh under this particular development.  The Curragh will remain a flat racing course which is, unquestionably, one of the finest of its kind in the world.  I am delighted that this major development for Kildare, Irish flat racing and the Irish racing industry is taking place.  It is very important.  In 2009, when the racing and general public see the newly designed Curragh, they will agree this is a state-of-the-art, world-class race track with every modern facility available.  I envisage it making an enormous contribution to the Irish racing industry, sporting public and, in particular, the economy of County Kildare.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>My legislative priorities are the two Bills from this Department listed on the Government legislation programme for the spring session of 2007 &mdash; the Irish Sports Council (Amendment) Bill and the Bord na gCon (Amendment) Bill.  The purpose of the Irish Sports Council (Amendment) Bill is to provide for the granting of powers to the Irish Sports Council to establish subsidiary companies.</P>
        <P>The Bord na gCon (Amendment) Bill is intended to give effect to the recommendations of the recent Dalton report into certain matters affecting Bord na gCon.  The Bill deals with the reconfiguration of the board, with particular reference to the number and tenure of ordinary board members and the tenure of the chairman, and the need to separate regulatory functions from promotional functions, both of which are now the responsibility of Bord na gCon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, these are two important Bills.  It is of the utmost importance that the measures in the Bord na gCon (Amendment) Bill are implemented as a matter of urgency.  Obviously, determining the business of the House depends on the Whips.  Can the Minister indicate when the Bord na gCon (Amendment) Bill will be introduced?  Which of the Bills will be introduced first?  Does he envisage that both of them will be completed this session?  The Bord na gCon (Amendment) Bill has huge significance and everyone in the greyhound racing industry is seeking to have it completed as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I imagine the Irish Sports Council (Amendment) Bill, which is at an advanced stage of preparation with just a small number of technical issues to be resolved, will be the first to come before the House.  It is difficult to know whether the legislation will be passed during the course of this D&aacute;il.  I think the time might be tight.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to new figures from Tourism Ireland showing that while tourism revenue increased in 2006, it did not equate to the rise in visitor numbers, due to primary growth coming from short stay visitors from eastern Europe; his views on this discrepancy; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 13 and 20 together. </P>
<P>The CSO has not yet produced last December&rsquo;s tourism figures, but all of the indications are that 2006 was a landmark year for tourism.  We expect to have received a total of 7.4 million visitors in 2006, an increase of close to 10% on 2005.  Figures from the CSO for the first nine months of the year show an increase of 11% in foreign revenue earnings.  In respect of mainland Europe, the 11-month figures show numbers are up by almost 19% on the corresponding period in 2005.</P>
        <P>Part of this impressive performance has been due to an increased number of visitors from central and eastern Europe and there is no doubt this region will be an increasingly important tourism market for Ireland.  However, the bulk of our growth from mainland Europe in 2006 still came from our traditional markets.</P>
        <P>Outside of mainland Europe, all of our major tourism markets have shown healthy increases in the first 11 months of 2006, with visitors from Great Britain up by 6.2%, visitors from north America up by 10.5% and visitors from other long-haul routes up by 7.8%.</P>
        <P>Looking ahead to 2007, a growth target of 5.6% in overseas visitor numbers has been set.  This represents a higher rate of growth than that predicted for international tourism this year.  The target is particularly ambitious when viewed against the background of changing consumer preferences, tougher international competition and pressures on Ireland&rsquo;s relative competitive positioning.  In particular, the continuation of the later booking pattern, changing consumer demands and the increased demand for authentic holiday experiences will pose challenges for the industry here.</P>
        <P>This year, I was pleased to again secure record levels of Exchequer investment for tourism services, a total of &euro;154 million.  This will enable both Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland to implement a comprehensive set of programmes to help ensure targets are met.  In particular, the increased marketing fund of &euro;45 million, an increase of 12.5% on last year&rsquo;s provision, will <Col N="1580"/>enable both agencies to significantly step up their marketing activities.</P>
        <P>The indicators for 2007 are positive but it would be a mistake to be complacent.  If we have learned anything from the past five years, it is to expect the unexpected.  We do not know what we could face in terms of international developments and the Irish tourism industry and tourism agencies have weathered many storms over the past five years.  We have learned to be flexible, to adapt and to take nothing for granted in the process.</P>
        <P>It is a tough world in the international tourism marketplace and nowadays we have to run pretty hard just to stand still.  In that context, it is gratifying we are doing so well.  Our marketing investment has certainly been paying off but Tourism Ireland is indicating that we cannot live by marketing alone.  Put simply, the product experience must deliver on the promise.</P>
        <P>Competitiveness is still an issue and will continue to be, as it will for most high-cost destinations.  The higher the cost of the product, the more emphasis we must place on quality and value for money.  Visitors should be satisfied they are getting value for their money.  Research shows that, in general, it is the basic cost-of-living items that impact most on visitors&rsquo; awareness in terms of value for money, and not the basic tourism and travel components, such as the cost of transport and accommodation.</P>
        <P>The friendliness of the Irish people and the welcome for the visitor is legendary and has been a pillar of Irish tourism for a long time.  However, the pace of life and composition of our workforce is changing.  Visitors to many of our hotels and restaurants, especially in the cities, meet fewer Irish staff.  If visitors look forward to meeting Irish people and they do not have that experience, they may feel somewhat disappointed.</P>
        <P>Our immigrant workforce in the hospitality industry provides a great level of service and has injected a new cosmopolitan dynamic into Irish tourism but there is that intangible Irish &ldquo;thing&rdquo; &mdash; wit, craic or the potential to be surprised by humorous insights or exchanges &mdash; that legend almost demands be part of the Irish experience and which is hard to manufacture.  We are currently in a transition period and we have to manage that.  Nevertheless it is important to point out that our traditional tourism pillars of people and place are still holding up as major sources of satisfaction in our visitor surveys.</P>
        <P>Given the challenges, it is all the more important that we focus strongly on improving the quality of our service and product, as well as other issues that impact on the tourism experience.  My Department and the tourism industry will continue to focus on implementation of the New Horizons tourism strategy and its associated action plan to ensure the current good level of progress is maintained.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1581"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Although our tourism figures have continued to rise, the length of stay has tended to decrease.  This shows that notwithstanding people&rsquo;s pressurised lives, they find Ireland too costly and are staying here for a shorter period.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note that since 1999 we had a surplus of &euro;650 million in terms of earnings from all visitors to Ireland versus expenditure by Irish visitors abroad.  Now we have a deficit of almost the same amount.  While the tourism sector is doing well, in relative terms it is not doing that well as the Exchequer is suffering with regard to overall spending on tourism, taking into account Irish spending abroad versus the spending of visitors here.</P>
        <P>Are there any further plans to market to our native population, given the amount of time a traveller will be stuck in airports with security checks?  What quality products can be offered?  If one goes to Northern Ireland local people can be seen working in the industry.  Will the Minister procure marketing or financial incentives to ensure local people here can be part of the product?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>It is estimated that over the next six years, approximately 6,000 additional people will be required for the tourism industry here.  The industry already accounts for more than 3% of GNP and has attracted approximately 246,000 to its workforce.</P>
        <P>It is clearly important we ensure people are incentivised.  In that respect I was pleased to announce this morning that we will make &euro;148 million available to ensure the human resource element of the tourism industry is looked after, people are trained for the industry and businesses are in a position to adapt to changing circumstances.</P>
        <P>With regard to domestic tourism and Irish people holidaying abroad, it is true that in any buoyant economy people will tend to go abroad on holidays.  It is also true of a buoyant economy that people tend to take breaks at home, which is the reason we have seen a major increase in the number of Irish people holidaying at home.  The industry earned approximately &euro;4.3 billion from foreign sources last year, but it is sometimes forgotten that the income from domestic sources was &euro;1.6 billion, giving a total of &euro;5.9 billion.</P>
        <P>In addition, statistics show that visitor numbers to this country to the end of November last year increased by 10.3%, but revenue for the first three quarters increased by 11%.  There is now a definite correlation between the increase in the number of visitors and increase in revenue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might answer the questions asked during the priority question that he refused to answer.  He is very much into statistics and I am sure he will have those I am after.  Will he outline specifically the percentage distri<Col N="1582"/>bution of international tourism revenue between the eastern seaboard and the rest of the country for 2005 and 2006, as well as comparable figures for 2000?</P>
        <P>As the Minister has mentioned, a number of foreign nationals now work in our hotel and catering industries, which we all welcome.  What specific steps is the Government taking to ensure they are equipped with information, that they can give directions and that they understand the ethos of Irish tourism?</P>
        <P>When will the building of the National Conference Centre commence?  The turning of the sod will no doubt be a big event.</P>

	<P>These are mainly statistical questions.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It referred to quarterly tourism figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Deenihan wished us to give the specifics, if available, on the breakdown of the amount spent on the east coast and west coast by visitors to the country, he should have put down a question to that effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked that question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>What I can say to Deputy Deenihan is there is evidence of a substantial increase last year in the number of visitors coming to the regions.<b></b> Of that, there is no question.  There is a correlation between the increase in the number of visitors and the revenue.  I have explained all of that already.</P>
        <P>With regard to the national conference centre, about which Deputy Deenihan asked, I anticipate we should be in a position to close the deal on it in the very near future.  Some loose ends require to be tied up and then I sincerely hope we will be in a position to proceed with it.  A national conference centre is of immense importance because of the fact that we anticipate it will be worth in the order of &euro;50 million in additional tourism revenue to Dublin and will attract anything up to 30,000 additional visitors to the city.</P>
        <P>On the statistical questions which Deputy Deenihan asked, I will try to get the figures he requested.  I cannot guarantee they are available but we will try to come as close as we can to getting them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1583"/>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>What prompted this question was a statement by the chief executive of Tourism Ireland, Mr. Paul O&rsquo;Toole, to the effect that a number of factors could impinge on the ambitious growth rates for the future.  He went on to talk about currency fluctuations, global socio-economic uncertainty and a number of other factors.  He also referred to the decline in the value for money rating and the perception of tourists that the warmth of the Irish welcome was beginning to disappear.  I accept I have not had an opportunity to see the statement released this morning about what is being done in that regard.  What is being done to change that perception given the context of such an important person in the industry stating his concern about the value for money rating?</P>
        <P>Given all the recent price increases for gas, electricity etc., the tourism industry will have to pass on some of them.  What can we do to overcome the two factors referred to by the CEO?  The Minister may reply that some discussion on this matter took place this morning but I am unaware of what was said because I was in Kildare at a function attended by the Taoiseach.  I have not seen any press release on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>It is understandable the chief executive of Tourism Ireland would make his concerns known on two very important issues.  As Deputy Wall stated, one of these relates to competitiveness and value for money.  The other matter relates to the warmth of the Irish welcome.  Both factors are of pivotal importance in terms of advancing the cause of the tourism industry.</P>
        <P>Ours is a free market economy.  We have advised the industry on numerous occasions about the need to remain competitive and to offer value for money.  To be fair, there has been a response.  For example, the Restaurants Association Of Ireland introduced a value menu and, in general, several outlets offer reasonable bargains to potential visitors to their establishments.  We have seen an improvement in the perception of foreign visitors where value for money issues and competitiveness are concerned.  There is no question but satisfaction with all-round value for money has improved since 2004.  However, I accept it remains below the levels recorded in the early years of the decade and it continues to be the most critically greeted aspect of the Irish holiday experience.</P>
        <P>Overall, 14% of holidaymakers in 2006 were dissatisfied with the statement that Ireland offered good all-round value for money, but a much higher percentage, just over two in five people, or 41%, were satisfied with this aspect of their holiday.  It appears the message is getting through.  The comparatively negative view of good all-round value for money is reflected in how holidaymakers perceive the cost of living in Ireland.  Almost half described it as higher than <Col N="1584"/>they had expected.  The costs that caused most surprise related to eating out and alcohol, although there is also evidence of resistance to other costs such as food in shops and supermarkets, accommodation and car hire.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Irish welcome, we announced a substantial fund this morning for human resources training under the new national development plan under the F&aacute;ilte Ireland tourism strategy.  I anticipate this should result in far greater professionalism among new people in the industry.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 31 together.</P>
        <P>The inaugural meeting of the inter-agency steering committee established for the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall was held on 4 December 2006, under the chairmanship of the Secretary General of my Department.  The committee members are the Secretary General of my Department, the chairman of the Office of Public Works, the chairman of the National Concert Hall, the manager of Dublin City Council, a representative of the National Development Finance Agency, and the assistant Secretary General of my Department with responsibility for the arts and culture brief.  The director of the National Concert Hall was in attendance at this meeting also.  My Department provided the secretary to the committee.</P>
        <P>The task of the inter-agency steering committee, in general terms, is to oversee the procurement, negotiation and construction phases of the design, build, finance and maintain PPP for the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall, in compliance with relevant Department of Finance guidelines and in adherence to the terms of the Government decisions germane to the project, and to realise the vision set for the project.</P>
        <P>As the inter-agency steering committee is overseeing a deliberative, commercially sensitive PPP process, it would be inappropriate to report on its meetings.  The committee&rsquo;s terms of reference require it &ldquo;to maintain confidential all materials that shall come to be considered by it, having regard to the commercially sensitive aspects of the process, and relevant governing legislation&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1585"/>
        <P>As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 10 of 26 October 2006, contracts for the purchase of the interest of University College Dublin in the Earlsfort Terrace site were executed on 20 September 2006.  University College Dublin has already transferred some of its personnel and functions to Belfield and will decant from the remainder in 2007.  A lease-back arrangement has been put in place by the OPW with the college until late 2007, by which time the college will have fully vacated the premises.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Mr. Philip Furlong, who I understand retires today, for all his help and assistance to me as party spokesperson.  Will he continue to be chair of this committee and if not, has the Minister selected someone to replace him?  Given his experience in the Department and the nature of the development I would welcome him remaining in this position.</P>
        <P>This question appears to be tabled <i>ad nauseam</i>.  Can the Minister outline a timeframe for the completion of the project?  Will it take two, three or four years?  Is it possible for the Minister to indicate a completion date of 2008, 2009 or whatever?  That is what people in the tourism sector and lovers of music wish to hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Whether Mr. Furlong remains as chairman of the steering group will hinge on circumstances which have yet to unfold.  It is not possible to say at this point what will be the case.  I hope he will be in a position to continue as chairperson because, as Deputy Wall stated, he is a man of considerable experience.  He was also successfully involved in the national conference centre.</P>
        <P>Mr. Furlong retires today after a distinguished life in public service that began in 1961, when he joined the Civil Service as an executive officer, rising to Assistant Secretary General of the Department of Finance and Secretary General at the Department of Arts, Gaeltacht, Heritage and the Islands and Secretary General of the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism.  On this auspicious occasion, I wish to record the outstanding achievement of Mr. Furlong.  He was an outstanding civil servant and a man whose commitment, experience and knowledge is acknowledged throughout the public service.</P>

	<P>I mean Deputy Wall.  Maybe Mr. Furlong will be a Deputy later.  He would be a great Minister because he helped me.  Work is advanced on the accommodation brief of the redeveloped National Concert Hall project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the contribution made by Mr. Philip Furlong, especially to the <Col N="1586"/>Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism.  He was accessible at all times to the Opposition and helpful.  I wish Mr. Con Haugh the best in his new position.  He will fill the shoes of Mr. Philip Furlong.</P>
        <P>There will be surplus space when UCD medical and engineering faculties relocate to Belfield.  The Royal Irish Academy of Music has requested accommodation on the site of the existing concert hall.  Synergy would occur between the concert hall, the three performing spaces and the Royal Irish Academy of Music.  This institution produces the talent of the future and it would be convenient for major international performers to interact with the students of the academy.  The academy could put on major performances in the new concert hall.  Has this possibility been explored and will the Minister consider my proposal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I advised Deputy Deenihan that I would bring this proposal to the attention of the steering group and the board of the National Concert Hall.  I have no update on the situation but will make inquiries about the current position and write to Deputy Deenihan.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to my previous replies of 26 October 2006 and 30 November 2006 regarding the incentives available for film production in the State.  I explained at that time that the task of attracting international production to Ireland is dependent on a number of elements, not all of which fall within the sphere of influence of my Department or of the Irish Film Board.  Decisions to site a film project in a particular territory involve complex funding, cultural, logistical and project-specific elements, all of which must gel for a successful result.  As described in these previous replies, primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions is a matter for the Irish Film Board.  This agency is funded through my Department and is independent of the Department in its operations.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s primary role in supporting the film sector relates to the administration of elements of the section 481 tax relief scheme.  I have previously outlined the Government&rsquo;s initiatives and enhancements of the scheme contained in the Finance Act 2006 in recognition of the changing dynamics of this industry, aimed at increasing Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a film-mak<Col N="1587"/>ing location.  These incentives are kept under review in conjunction with the Irish Film Board and any necessary amendments to retain or regain competitiveness will be addressed and brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The Irish Film Board has been the driving force in such endeavours and, with its overall funding for 2007 increased to &euro;19.7 million, it will be enabled to continue with its key role of developing and supporting film production in Ireland.  The increased current allocation will facilitate the board in marketing Ireland as a film location and, in particular, will assist the work of the newly appointed film commissioner in Los Angeles in raising the profile of the Irish audiovisual industry abroad.</P>
        <P>The welcome additional funding provided by me to the Irish Film Board in 2005 and 2006, totalling &euro;3.5 million, was directed to supporting international productions that could demonstrate clear economic, industrial and cultural benefits to Ireland.  The Irish Film Board&rsquo;s judicious selection of projects to support in 2005 resulted in significant additional Irish production activity worth &euro;30 million in 2005 and &euro;34 million in 2006.  Therefore, &euro;3.5 million generated &euro;64 million.  The evidence in employment, training and turnover is clear, going some way to restoring the health of the sector which had to rely on low scale indigenous production in 2004 and 2005.</P>
        <P>The continuing increases in capital funding to the Irish Film Board since 2004 have ensured support to meet the demands of the industry in the areas of project and talent development, training and indigenous film and television production.  The increased support enables the Irish Film Board to fulfil its aim of sustained growth of the industry, increasing the number and quality of films produced in Ireland each year.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>In leading that delegation to attract international films to Ireland, was there a positive outcome?  Given that we are approaching St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, with Ministers attending pageantry around the world, are any Ministers attending Hollywood?  I have always supported this practice because it provides a great opportunity to develop tourism.  Visiting Hollywood could create an image that may assist employment and the <Col N="1588"/>development of the arts and actors by attracting more international films.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Irrespective of when I went to Hollywood, it feels as if I never left it.</P>
        <P>During the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festivities and over the course of that week many Ministers travel to different parts of the world.  It affords us an opportunity to advertise Ireland on the world stage.  As a small nation on the periphery of Europe, we must take advantage of it.  No other country of comparable size is afforded the publicity Ireland receives on that day.  The ministerial visits have been a catalyst for economic growth and development on this island.  It is possible that one of my colleagues will be in Los Angeles, one of the designated cities, during the week.  I will ask my colleague to promote the Irish film industry.  Since I became the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism it has been traditional to brief each of my colleagues visiting a foreign location on the advantages that may accrue from tourism.  They act as ambassadors, bringing visitors back to the country.</P>
        <P>We have a permanent film ambassador in Los Angeles whose job it is to liaise with the major studios to attract film production to the country.  I will ask whichever colleague goes to Los Angeles to see if it is possible for him or her to meet the representative and liaise with Hollywood production companies with a view to attracting film productions to Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister expand on the job description for the film ambassador?  Does that person have other responsibilities?  Does that person have an office in Los Angeles and has he or she been successful?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister commit to the continuation of section 481 beyond 2008?  The capping on the level of investment in a film is too low to attract the type of blockbuster film that would travel internationally.  Typically, that would require &euro;100 million.</P>
        <P>What is the future viability of Ardmore Studios?  I understand that little is happening there.  In the event that anything does happen to Ardmore, does the Government have any plans to provide services that will keep the industry going and developing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year was extremely successful for the Irish film industry.  The number of certified productions at the end of the year was the highest in several years.  The total certified spend last year was &euro;202.5 million, which was a significant increase on previous years, except 2003.  The section 481 amount last year was the highest in several years, at &euro;110.8 million. </P>
        <P>The British have changed their rules on film and offered good incentives to the industry.  We are in competition with them.  The Minister for Finance increased the cap to &euro;35 million from &euro;15 million and increased the relevant percentages, <Col N="1589"/>which did a great a deal for the industry.  The British Chancellor, Mr. Brown, however, took a personal interest in the reliefs available there which makes it more difficult for us to compete.  The question is whether to get involved in a Dutch auction, which is not the preferred option, or to see if we can enhance the co-production arrangements which we have with Britain and examine whether it is possible to reach a mutually compatible and acceptable position.</P>
        <P>We are far ahead of other jurisdictions in terms of television production.  We are the only one which offers section 481 type of relief to television production, which has resulted in some major television series being made here.  I have no reason to believe that this will not continue during 2007 although I accept that, in the absence of changing section 481 to bring it into line with British laws, inward film production could be more difficult.</P>
        <P>I understand that the ambassador, or representative, of the Irish film industry in Los Angeles is located in the Enterprise Ireland building and that he liaises with Hollywood production companies with a view to bringing productions to Ireland.  I hope that this will be successful.</P>
        <P>The future of Ardmore is contingent on the success or otherwise of the Irish film industry which I hope will continue to grow as it did in 2006.  I have no doubt that there will be such growth in television production.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this matter.  The issue affecting my constituents and many others in the commuter belt in the greater Dublin area is the serious and ongoing problem of overcrowding on commuter trains to and from Sallins, Hazelhatch, Kilcock, Maynooth and Leixlip and the city.  Passengers more often than not must remain standing for the entire journey, with consequent health and safety implications, and there is a need for the Minister for Transport to <Col N="1590"/>issue instructions to increase the frequency of the service.  I am glad to acknowledge the presence of the Minister in the House. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s status required that I attend. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That status is fast disappearing because this Minister is one of the few who has come into the House.  I compliment him on doing that because, sadly, it is a dying practice.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to enhance the feeder bus service too because if we are serious about dealing with global warming and road traffic congestion, we must be serious about the alternatives.  Trains are the most effective and efficient form of passenger service.  Transport 21 will encompass this entire area and meet its needs well into the future.  However, several modifications could be made now to enhance and improve the health and safety factors in the service, making it possible for more people to avail of the rail service and thereby take traffic off the roads.</P>
        <P>A parking area of six or seven acres at Maynooth local rail station was sold some years ago for a housing development.  It happened before this Minister was in charge of transport.  It was a daft idea.  Enhanced parking is needed there now.  Some effort has been made to create extra parking in Leixlip-Louisa Bridge but this is insufficient to meet the requirements of the number of passengers likely to use it.  Kilcock has limited parking and is likely to need much more because of the development taking place there.  People from the hinterland will need a place to park there too.</P>
        <P>Every town along that route is introducing parking restrictions because people in a hurry abandon their cars when they have nowhere else to put them.  They might have already travelled 20 miles.  The train does not pass every house.  The same applies to Sallins and Hazelhatch.  There is plenty of parking space at Hazelhatch but it is a mile or so from the village.  It is an area that could provide a better service and this also applies to Sallins.</P>
        <P>The Minister has several options.  For example, he could increase the size of the trains by adding more carriages, although that raises health and safety factors.  It is not necessary, however, to open the trains all the way from end to end.  It is possible to meet the safety requirements.  The Minister should consider increasing the frequency of the service and provide an upgraded feeder bus service to ensure the maximum number of people can get to the train, and come away from it, as quickly as possible.  That has the potential to become a very attractive service but it needs to be enhanced with all the improvements required to make it easy for the commuter to use it.</P>
        <P>Standing throughout the journey is not a great idea.  People say that if one travels on the Tube in London, one might have to stand all the way. <Col N="1591"/> It is not necessarily a great idea there either as the British have found to their cost more than once.</P>
        <P>It would be greatly appreciated if, in anticipation of and prior to the inauguration of Transport 21, a number of modifications could be undertaken along the rail lines in question.  Such modifications would have major benefits in terms of alleviating the congestion with which we must deal on our roads.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this important issue.  I hope I can meet some of his specific concerns with a number of positive outcomes.</P>
        <P>The day-to-day operation of railway services is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  I am aware, however, of the significant increase in suburban rail passenger numbers in recent years, including on the two lines serving Kildare, namely, Connolly-Maynooth and Heuston-Kildare.  This can lead to crowding at certain peak times but I am informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that while this can cause some discomfort and inconvenience to passengers, it does not give rise to safety concerns.</P>
        <P>In response to this increase in passenger numbers there has been a significant increase in rail investment in recent years.  The frequency and capacity of services on the Connolly-Maynooth and Heuston-Kildare lines have been increased substantially in line with demand growth over the past five to ten years.  For example, provision for an extra 2,000 daily commuters was added to Maynooth line services at the start of 2006.  This increased the overall peak commuting capacity to cater for over 7,000 people, more than double the level that obtained in 2003.  On the Kildare line, overall peak commuter capacity has more than doubled since 2000, from 2,200 to over 5,000.</P>
        <P>A number of rail development projects currently under way or in planning will further increase capacity on both lines.  The first of these involves introducing new services on the Maynooth line to the new Docklands station on its opening in March 2007.  The new station will have great significance in respect of the matters raised by the Deputy.  While long-term issues will be dealt with under Transport 21, short and medium term solutions will be offered in tandem.  The new station at Docklands will facilitate the operation of extra peak services from Clonsilla, <Col N="1592"/>on the Maynooth line, to the city centre, freeing up more capacity for users from areas such as Leixlip, Maynooth and Kilcock.  This and other planned service enhancements will increase the capacity of Maynooth line services by a further 3,000 this year, from 7,000 to 10,000.</P>
        <P>It is also planned to increase the capacity of some peak services by introducing eight-car trains to replace the four-car trains currently in use.  I am informed that the greatest level of crowding normally occurs on two peak-time four-car trains.  Doubling the capacity of these trains will, I hope, substantially ease the problem.  These immediate solutions will come on stream within the next month or so.</P>
        <P>Capacity on the Kildare corridor is currently constrained by track capacity due to the mix of fast inter-city services and stopping commuter services.  On 5 December 2006, I signed the Kildare route project railway order.  This will enable Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to proceed with works to double the number of tracks from two to four on a key section on the line between Cherry Orchard and Hazelhatch.  I understand that work will commence later this year on that project for completion by late 2009 or early 2010.  I understand the main stations where crowding can occur on the Kildare line are at Sallins and Hazelhatch.  In an effort to alleviate the situation at these stations, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann recently added an extra service at Sallins.  There are now nine services each weekday morning from Sallins to Dublin-Heuston, arriving before 9.30 a.m., compared to just four services in 2001.</P>
        <P>The major short-term and long-term projects being delivered or planned under Transport 21 will deliver additional capacity to meet the growing demands of commuters on both routes.  The longer term plan is to electrify both lines and have them form part of an integrated rail network for Dublin connected by the interconnector tunnel.  This will have an important effect in the context of reducing carbon emissions.</P>
        <P>Deputy Durkan will acknowledge that I cannot wave a magic wand and put everything in place overnight.  We recognise the problems faced by people in the area in question and we are trying to deal with some of these immediately.  The new station at Docklands &mdash; the first built in 100 years &mdash; will be operational in March and will help us to deal with many of the capacity constraints that exist.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 22 together.</P>
        <P>The planning process for the Lansdowne Road Stadium redevelopment is still in train. To reiterate the position, in July last year, Dublin City Council granted planning permission for the project, subject to a number of conditions. This led to a number of appeals against the granting of planning permission by local residents.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la held an Oral hearing in December last and its decision is expected shortly.</P>
        <P>Subject to a favourable outcome to the planning process, it is envisaged that construction will get underway immediately. There is an estimated construction period of 29 months and  I am optimistic that by 2010,  we will have a second major <Col N="1594"/>stadium for field sports in the city of Dublin at Lansdowne Road.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</askee>
        <Quest> his views on whether the GAA will be requested to extend the opening of Croke Park beyond 2007 in view of the delay to the development of Lansdowne Road. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of the GAA continuing with its policy of accommodating rugby and soccer in Croke Park is one for the GAA alone to decide and it has always been my policy not to interfere in this matter. I have at no stage sought to tell the Association what approach it should take on the question of access to Croke Park.</P>
<P>However, like most other sports loving people in the country, I was delighted and proud to see the first staging of an international rugby match at the fine stadium at Croke Park last Sunday. Furthermore, I look forward to further great entertainment when the remaining rugby international and the soccer fixtures take place there this year.</P>
<P Just="Left">In January 2004, the Government agreed to provide funding to the joint IRFU/FAI project for the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road Stadium as a 50,000-capacity all-seater stadium. The planning and design stage of the project got underway and in July 2006, Dublin City Council granted planning permission for the project. As you know, the matter was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and an Oral hearing took place in December. The planning process must run its course and the Lansdowne Road Stadium Redevelopment Company is awaiting the outcome of an adjudication by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeals against the granting of planning approval for the project by Dublin City Council. However, I am optimistic that by 2010, we will have a <Col N="1595"/>second splendid major stadium for field sports in the city of Dublin, at Lansdowne Road.</P>
<P>Given that Lansdowne Road will be out of commission for a period of time, the three sporting organisations involved, that is the IRFU, the FAI and the GAA, entered into discussions to provide an alternative venue for rugby and soccer during this time. Agreement was reached about the use of Croke Park in 2007 and I understand that the three parties have now commenced discussions for the use of Croke Park in 2008 and the GAA will make its decision regarding 2008 at a meeting this weekend. I look forward, with confidence to these negotiations being concluded in the same spirit that made possible the sporting occasion of great cultural and historical significance that was exhibited in Croke Park on Sunday last.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that under the new National Development Plan, covering the period 2007 to 2013,  almost  &euro;2.7 billion has been allocated for a range of programmes and projects in the Arts, Culture, Sport  and Tourism areas within the remit of my Department, made up of  &euro;904 million under the Cultural Sub-Programme, &euro;991 million under the Sport Sub-Programme and  &euro;800 million which has been allocated to the Tourism Development Programme.</P>
        <P>My Department will have responsibility for the expenditure of this funding either directly or through bodies under the aegis of my Department such as the Arts Council, the Irish Sports Council and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Accordingly all the funding will be allocated through the Vote of my Department in the context of the annual Estimates process, with the exception of some funding for capital projects in the National Cultural Institutions which will be allocated through the Vote of the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Full details on the funding available from my Department and the bodies operating under its aegis, and the investment priorities together with indicative financial allocations for the next seven years, are set out in a number of press releases issued on the announcement of the new NDP. <Col N="1596"/>These can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie.</P>
        <P>As may be seen from the press releases there are a number of major infrastructural projects which will be funded under the new NDP in the areas of Arts, Culture, Sport and Tourism.  These include a new National Concert Hall on the Earlsfort Terrace site, the new Abbey Theatre, redevelopment of the Wexford Theatre Royal, major projects at the National Museum and National Library, the development of a state-of-the-art Sports Campus at Abbotstown, the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road Stadium and the National Conference Centre.</P>
        <P>The development of some of these projects is already under way and work will commence as soon as possible on others. The objective is to have them completed within the lifetime of the NPD but specific completion dates are not yet available.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 25 together.</P>
        <P>As I have previously informed the House, the nationwide audit of sports facilities has commenced and is being carried out in stages to help speed up the availability of information. The first phase is being carried out within my Department and will establish a record of national and regional sports facilities.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, the work currently being undertaken is a data gathering exercise in conjunction with the main sporting bodies and local authorities to identify the facilities for inclusion in this phase. My Department has compiled a list of in excess of one hundred sports facilities of national or regional significance.  Many of these have been funded under the Sports Capital Programme since 1999 and a considerable bank of information already exists, although some of this information is not up to date and therefore an updating of data is being undertaken.  Furthermore, details of facilities at third level educational institutions and swimming pools have also been included on this inventory. Further engagement with the main sporting bodies, local authorities, facility owners and managers is being undertaken so that a comprehensive database on the range and nature of sporting facilities at national and regional level can be completed.</P><Col N="1597"/>
        <P>The Programme for Government sets out a commitment to put in place a national sports facility strategy that will identify gaps in facility provision and set out an approach to fill these gaps.  It is anticipated that the Strategy will be completed within a six-month period.</P>
        <P>By ascertaining and mapping what is already in place at a national and regional level, an important part of developing a strategic approach to future facility provision will be put in place, as well as establishing the level of need that exists in the sports sector and helping to determine future priorities.  As stated previously, the enormity of completing the complete audit of sports facilities should not be underestimated and, given the experience of other countries, is likely to take a number of years to complete.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that animal welfare and the area of illegally imported animal remedies for greyhounds and racehorses is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon  are the statutory bodies responsible for the horse and greyhound racing industries respectively including integrity management and anti-doping controls.  However, <Col N="1598"/>officials of my Department have been in contact with the Department of Agriculture and Food, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon in relation to the particular issue raised by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The position is that Bord na gCon met yesterday with officials from the Department of Agriculture and Food in relation to this issue and the Board plans to issue a statement and educational brief to the greyhound public to ensure they understand all aspects of the legal status and use of unlicensed products.  I recently announced the establishment of an independent Control and Appeals Committee, in line with the recommendations of the Dalton Report, to adjudicate on all integrity-related cases arising in the greyhound industry.  In Horse Racing, the Turf Club is responsible for the testing of racehorses both in and out of competition.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Tourism Policy Review Group, New Horizons for Irish Tourism: An Agenda for Action, was published in September 2003. I appointed the Tourism Action Plan Implementation Group for a two-year period to oversee implementation of the Action Plan set out in the Report. That Plan contained 76 recommended actions to help Irish tourism meet the ambitious targets set for the sector in the Report, namely, 10 million visitors per annum and &euro;6 billion in foreign revenue by 2012.</P>
        <P>The Implementation Group reported to me, in March 2006, that 63 of the 76 recommended actions made in the New Horizons Report, had either been implemented or good progress had been made in relation to them. The Group highlighted the areas where good progress had been made including:</P>

	<P>On 1 February 2006, I appointed Mr. Tim Dalton, former Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality, and Law Reform, to carry out an independent assessment concerning corporate governance and related matters affecting Bord na gCon.  Mr. Dalton delivered his Report on 5 April 2006. </P>
        <P>On 4 July 2006, the Government approved specific actions to be taken in line with the recommendations of the Dalton Report. These included:</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the drafting of legislation, as a matter of urgency, to implement key recommendations made in the Dalton Report relating to the tenure of the Chairman and the Board of Bord na gCon, to increase the size of the Board from seven to nine members, and to arrange for the reconstitution of the Board along these lines as soon as circumstances permit;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />an examination of the options for the establishment of a Doping Control Committee as an agency independent of Bord na gCon;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the immediate publication of the Report;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />a root and branch review of the Greyhound Industry Acts 1958-1993 with a view to bringing legislation dealing with the greyhound industry into line with best current practice.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Report has already been published.  The former Chair has resigned and I have appointed a new Chair, Mr. Dick O&rsquo;Sullivan, and another new member in succession to an outgoing <Col N="1600"/>member.  In January of this year, the Board of Bord na gCon appointed a new Chief Executive.  The Bord na gCon (Amendment) Bill, needed to give effect to the changes necessary regarding the tenure of the Chair, and the size and composition of the Board of Bord na gCon, is currently listed on the Government Legislation Programme for Spring Session 2007.</P>
        <P>In relation to the establishment of an independent Doping Control Committee, while Mr Dalton concluded that greyhound racing is by and large a clean sport and that infringements are quite low and falling, it was decided that new arrangements would not be delayed until the relevant legislative changes were made, but would be implemented now by the Board, using its existing powers.  The legislative amendments will, when enacted, confirm this new system and make it mandatory.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, on 10 January 2007, Bord na gCon announced the establishment of an Independent Control Committee and an Independent Appeals Committee, in accordance with the provisions of existing legislation.  The Control Committee will consist of five independent persons including a qualified solicitor/barrister and a veterinarian.  The overall level of testing and scale of sanctions for offences will be set by the Board of Bord na gCon while the action or sanction to be take in any particular case will be a matter entirely for the Control Committee.</P>
        <P>The Board has also established and appointed a separate independent Control Appeals Committee consisting of three independent persons, including a qualified solicitor/barrister and two veterinarians.  The Control Appeals Committee will be responsible for hearing any appeals rising from decisions of the Control Committee.  A more wide-ranging and fundamental review of the Greyhound Industry Acts is also being undertaken and I will revert to Government with the results of that exercise in due course.</P>

	<P>The Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which is administered by my Department, is essentially driven by the requirements of local authorities for public swimming facilities.  No restrictions were placed on the submission of applications by local authorities prior to the closing date of 31st July, 2000 under the current round. An application for a replacement pool was accepted from Monaghan County Council after the closing date as the only swimming pool in the county closed for health and safety reasons thus leaving the county without a public pool.</P>
        <P>Since 2000, the priority has been to support the 57 swimming pool projects within the existing programme. 23 pool projects have been completed and opened. 16 pool projects are under construction or about to start construction and 18 other pool projects are at various stages of the process &mdash; 5 at tender stage; 7 are at contract document stage and 6 are at preliminary report stage.  Expenditure under the programme has increased significantly since 2000, although annual drawdown varies according to the level of grant claims submitted by the local authorities in any one year &mdash; &euro;7.36m in 2000, &euro;8.12m in 2001, &euro;3.88m in 2002, &euro;9.00m in 2003, &euro;17.59m in 2004, &euro;14.10m in 2005, and &euro;22.77m in 2006 &mdash; giving a total of  &euro;82.82m over the past 7 years.  An amount of &euro;25m is provided for 2007 in my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual capital programme.</P>
        <P>In terms of assessment, projects are considered on a case-by-case basis and consideration is given to such issues as to whether the area is classified as disadvantaged, the number and geographical spread of projects within and between counties, the viability of the project, particularly in relation to operational and maintenance issues, overall funding package for the project, technical details and the Department&rsquo;s annual estimates provision for the Programme.</P>
        <P>My Department is now completing an Expenditure Review of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  The Review is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date and what changes, if any, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  The Review is currently being finalised and it is my intention to publish it as soon as possible.  Following consideration of the recommendations in the review it is my intention to launch a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  When the Programme is re-opened, it will be open to all local authorities to submit applications under the terms that will apply.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 30 together.</P>
        <P>With London 2012 fast approaching, athletes and teams from other countries may consider using Ireland as a base to prepare and train in the years prior to the Olympic Games.  Ireland possesses the advantages of having the same climatic conditions and being in the same time zone as London, as well as being within an hour by air travel.  Furthermore, this country will avoid most of the media hype that one often finds in the host country.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure that Ireland benefits from the proximity of the Games, I established a Task Force in August 2006 comprising high level representatives from the sporting, business, tourism and cultural sectors.  This group will work to ensure that Ireland is an attractive training base for Olympic athletes leading up to 2012 and that Ireland also benefits from the tourism, business and cultural opportunities arising from the hosting of the Olympic and Paralympics Games in London.</P>
        <P>If Ireland is to be attractive to potential participating athletes, access to high quality sporting and ancillary facilities must be available.  In this regard, my Department has undertaken a London 2012 sports infrastructural audit of facilities that might be suitable to develop to meet the training needs of overseas teams preparing for 2012.  Department officials have been in touch with National Governing Bodies of Sport and third level institutions in order to establish the type, range and suitability of the sports facilities available for this purpose.</P><Col N="1604"/>
        <P>What is currently being undertaken therefore is a data gathering exercise to gauge the level of facilities Ireland has to offer to potential visiting athletes.  This audit process will be completed shortly in line with the standards set out by the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG).  We will then have a clearer picture of the facilities likely to be attractive to participating athletes in the build-up to London 2012 and my Department will then examine whether investment may be required to bring these facilities up to the required standard.  Any expenditure on facilities will be aimed not only at attracting teams but primarily at ensuring a lasting legacy for Irish athletes and communities.</P>
        <P>In December last, I announced sports capital funding allocations totalling &euro;14.33 million to 27 organisations throughout the country towards the development of a number of key strategic national and regional sports facilities as well as funding to enhance the quality and range of equipment available to a number of national governing bodies to assist in increasing participation in those sports.  These allocations were in addition to the &euro;75 million allocated to 797 projects under the 2007 sports capital programme.</P>
        <P>The funding announced in December last included allocations of &euro;1 million to both Limerick City Council&rsquo;s Grove Island Sports and Leisure Centre and to the development of University of Limerick&rsquo;s Sports Campus.</P>
        <P>The allocation of &euro;1 million to the Grove Island centre was one of three such grants (the others being to Letterkenny and to Tallaght) to assist with the costs of providing major municipal, multisport centres attached to Local Authority swimming pools.  The provision of this funding was aimed at enhancing and expanding the range of and quality of local and regional clubs, groups and individuals to participate in a variety of sports and physical recreation activities.</P>
        <P>As part of the Local Authority swimming pool programme, &euro;3.8m has been awarded to Limerick City Council towards the development of a swimming pool at Grove Island.</P>
        <P>The University of Limerick has an admirable track record in attracting international calibre sports people to train on the existing campus facilities and I am confident that the additional facilities planned for the campus in respect of which I allocated a grant of &euro;1m in 2006 will play an important part in helping athletes prepare for future international competitions including the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 29 and 111 together.</P>
        <P>The Arts Council is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  Under the Arts Act, 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to stimulate public interest in the arts;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts;</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to assist in improving standards in the arts.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My Department has no function in deciding on the extent of Arts Council funding for particular projects or locations.  Indeed, the Arts Act, 2003, underpins the Council&rsquo;s independence in this context.  I am delighted to have secured &euro;80m in funding in 2007 for the Arts Council.</P>
        <P>My Department provide capital grants directly for arts and culture infrastructure around the country.  The main vehicle for such capital funding is the Arts &amp; Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme (ACCESS), under which almost &euro;43 million was provided to 40 arts and cultural facilities around the country.  This scheme commenced in 2001.  Many projects have been completed and the remainder are in the course of completion.</P>
        <P>Applications under the second round of the ACCESS scheme are currently being assessed by an independent Selection Committee.  The Committee expects to provide me with recommendations by March 2007 and I hope to make an announcement regarding the second round of the scheme shortly thereafter.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;81m in total is available under the ACCESS programme over the life of the National Development Plan, 2007 to 2013.  The funding offered to applicants under the second round of ACCESS will ultimately be determined by the quality and scope of the projects currently being assessed.</P>
        <P>In addition to ACCESS, almost &euro;53m in capital has been awarded to other arts and cultural projects in 2004, 2005 and 2006.  These projects, while <Col N="1606"/>not formally part of the ACCESS scheme, are managed in the same way as the ACCESS projects and the same policy objectives apply.</P>

	<P>Under the National Sports Campus Development Act 2006 and the subsequent establishment of the National Sports Campus Development Authority, effective from 1st January last, operational matters relating to the Sports Campus at Abbotstown are matters for the Authority by virtue of section 7(1) of that Act.  The functions of the Authority as set out in the Act include the management, operation and maintenance of the sports campus and, in particular, the furnishing and equipping of the sports campus with such plant, machinery, equipment and apparatus as it considers appropriate.</P>
        <P>As I have already indicated to the House, as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court on 14 November 2006, the National Aquatic Centre was returned to the possession of CSID on 1 December 2006.  CSID has since been replaced by the National Sports Campus Development Authority.  As part of the contingency planning for the repossession of the Centre, CSID had established a subsidiary company, CSID (Operations) Ltd to operate the Centre.</P>
        <P>Immediately on repossession, a full health check of the National Aquatic Centre was instituted.  This audit will cover all aspects of the facility including maintenance, mechanical and electrical, and water quality issues, and is also dealing with financial systems, human resources, marketing and sales.</P>
        <P>In parallel with these elements, a comprehensive maintenance programme has been taking place, dealing with the building management system, cleaning, water treatment, lighting, windows, CCTV, telecoms, flumes and security.  All of this work is ongoing at present.  When it is completed, the NSCDA will be reporting to me on the outcome.</P>
        <P>As I have said in this House on several occasions, there is a major challenge to restore the reputation of what is a fantastic facility and to ensuring that it is used to its fullest extent by both elite swimmers and those who just want to have a fun time at the National Aquatic Centre.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 33 together.</P>
        <P>As I have informed the House, most recently on 30 November, 2006, Spencer Dock International Conference Centre Consortium has been appointed Preferred Tenderer for the provision of a National Conference Centre in Dublin.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, the Centre is being procured under a Public Private Partnership process under the auspices of the Office of Public Works &mdash; the Contracting Authority.  During the Preferred Tenderer phase the Consortium is required to develop and provide the full range of project documents for review and approval by the Contracting Authority.  The current expectation is that the contract will, subject to Government Decision, be awarded within the coming weeks.  It is envisaged that site enabling and related works in preparation for construction would commence shortly thereafter and that the Centre would be operational some 40 months thereafter.</P>
        <P>I am delighted that delivery of another major commitment in the Programme for Government may now be about to become a reality.</P>
        <P>On the basis of consultations undertaken earlier by my Department and research reviewed, I am totally convinced of the need for a modern, dedicated National Conference Centre if Ireland is to realise its full potential in the hugely valuable international conference market.  According to a number of independent estimates, the National Conference Centre, when fully operational, is expected to generate additional foreign revenue earnings of between &euro;25m and &euro;50m per year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 113 together.</P>
        <P>Government policy for the Arts is set out in the Programme for Government and elaborated further in my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy.  Having regard for the statutory functions of the Arts Council as set out in Section 9 of the Arts Act 2003, and in accordance with section 21 of that Act, a Special Committee was established to advise the Arts Council on how best to align the Council&rsquo;s strategies for the promotion and encouragement of the arts with the priorities of the formal education system.  The Committee should deliver its advice to the Council by 1st May 2007.</P>
        <P>The five person Committee is chaired by Ms Mary Nunan, Arts Council member.  The other members are Mr. Jerome Morrissey, National Centre for Training in Technology, Mr. Pat MacSitric, Assistant Chief Inspector, Department of Education and Science, Mr. Derek West, former Principal, Newpark Comprehensive School and Chair of NAPD Arts &amp; Culture Committee and Ms Orlaith McBride, Arts Council member.</P>

	<P>I have had a number of meetings with both the Gaelic Players Association (GPA) and the GAA at which player welfare issues for inter-county players were discussed.</P>
        <P>At these meetings and in subsequent letters to both the GPA and the GAA, I have set out the position of the Government on this issue.  Firstly, it is entirely a matter for the GAA, as the Governing Body for Gaelic Games, to determine whether or not it wishes to embrace professionalism in any form.  The Government has no wish to influence this decision in any way.  However, the Government for reasons of sporting policy and priorities is not prepared to make public funds available to finance &ldquo;pay for play&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the GAA in the first instance to determine how it will meet the cost of addressing player welfare needs.  I remain disposed to allocate funding to support player welfare issues provided that a realistic, well-developed and costed proposal which would have the support of both the GAA and the GPA is put to me.  An important consideration, however, would be that funding should not displace resources already being committed by the Association at national or County Board level to player welfare.</P>
        <P>It would be premature to lock into particular financing mechanisms until agreement has been reached between the GAA and the GPA on arrangements to enhance player welfare and the additional costs arising for the GAA have been established.</P>
        <P>I hope that the negotiations currently underway between the GAA and the GPA will reach a successful conclusion.</P>

	<P>As I have advised the House on a number of occasions last year, most recently on 30 November last, individual actions and measures relating to tourism promotion or development at regional or county level are day-to-day functions of the State Tourism Agencies.</P>
        <P>There has been a major reform of Irish tourism structures in recent years with the setting up of Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Reform of the function, role and operational aspects of sub-national structures, as recommended by the Tourism Policy Review Group in its report &ldquo;New Horizons for Irish Tourism &mdash; An Agenda for Action&rdquo;, was the final phase of that process.</P>
        <P>In response to the recommendation in the New Horizons report, F&aacute;ilte Ireland commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to review regional tourism structures.  That report recommended the establishment of Regional Tourism Development Boards to ensure a greater focus on the individual needs of each region at a national level and the subsuming of former Regional Tourism Authority management and staff into F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</P>
        <P>The bodies known as County Tourism Committees were a substructure of the Regional Tourism Authorities.  Last year, to facilitate the new regional structures and the establishment of the five new Regional Tourism Development Boards, the former Regional Tourism Authorities passed the necessary resolutions and the Boards of Directors resigned.  Now that the Regional Tourism Authorities as companies no longer exist the former County Tourism Committees have lapsed.</P>
        <P>Following the dissolution of the RTAs, I gave my consent to the establishment by F&aacute;ilte Ireland of five Regional Tourism Development Boards &mdash; in the South-East, the South-West, the West, the Midlands-East and the Northwest regions &mdash; and the delegation of certain functions to each of the Boards. The functions so delegated are:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />directing the formulation and regular review of a comprehensive tourism development strategy for its region, to cover all key aspects of tourism develop<Col N="1611"/>ment including the product, enterprise support, training, marketing, infrastructure and environmental management needs of tourism in that region;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />drafting multi-annual work plans for its region to support the implementation of the region&rsquo;s development strategy for tourism;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />submitting multi-annual plans to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for funding and other resources and securing funding, as appropriate, from within the region;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />overseeing the implementation of the region&rsquo;s approved work plans and approving corrective action as appropriate;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reporting on outcomes achieved from implementing the region&rsquo;s tourism development strategy and issues arising from its implementation;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />performing the role of advocate for tourism development in its region in accordance with national and regional policies and procedures; and</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />working closely with other bodies in the region to support the development of tourism in the region.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I appreciate that a significant amount of energy and activity exists at county level with many tourism enterprises, and the local authorities, often identifying, in the first instance, with the county structure.  I understand, however, that the experience with regard to the former County Tourism Committees was mixed and inconsistent.  I also understand that they performed with varying degrees of effectiveness.  In this regard, I expect that the regional strategies, which are being drawn up by the Regional Tourism Development Boards, will seek to harness and build on the county dynamic within the overall regional framework.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 106 and 110 together.</P>
        <P>The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations who cater for people of all ages at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  The programme is advertised on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>Applications for funding under the 2007 programme were invited through advertisements in the Press on October 15th and 16th last.  The closing date for receipt of applications was November 24th 2006 and a total of 1,531 applications were received.  All applications received before the deadline are currently being evaluated against the programme&rsquo;s assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the course of these assessments, additional points are given to applications from areas of disadvantage, as designated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (DCRGA), namely RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and Local Drugs Task Forces.  Applicants from these designated areas also only have to provide evidence of 20% local funding as against 30% for applicants from non-disadvantaged areas.  Successful sports capital programme applicants from CL&Aacute;R and RAPID areas may be eligible for top-up grants from DCRGA.  Indeed, over &euro;5 million in additional grants was provisionally allocated by DCRGA to applicants from these designated disadvantaged areas in 2006.</P>
        <P>I intend to announce the provisional grant allocations for the 2007 sports capital programme as soon as possible after the ongoing assessment process has been completed.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s ACCESS scheme provides capital grants for arts and culture infrastructure around the country, much of which is community based initiatives.</P>
        <P>155 applications for funding were received under ACCESS II 2007 to 2009 and an independent selection committee is currently assessing the applications received.  The Committee expects to provide me with recommendations in respect of these applications by March 2007 and I hope to make an announcement regarding the scheme shortly thereafter.</P>
        <P>The Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which is also administered by my Department, provides grant aid for the construction of public swimming pools.  My Department is completing an Expenditure Review of the Programme at present.  The Review is currently being finalised and it is my intention to publish it as soon as possible.  Following consideration of the <Col N="1613"/>recommendations in the review it is my intention to launch a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme as soon as possible.  When the Programme is re-opened, it will be open to all local authorities to submit applications under the terms that will apply.</P>

	<P>The person concerned was granted a C visit visa to enter the State for a period of three months.  It now appears that she is seeking an extension of her permission to remain in the State.</P>
        <P>A wrap-around information sheet accompanies every visa application form.  That sheet makes it clear to the applicant that, in general, persons granted visas for particular purposes are not permitted to remain in the State for any purpose other than that for which the visa was granted.</P>
        <P>Every visa applicant is required to state on the application form the dates on which he or she proposes to enter and leave Ireland.  He or she is also required to declare that the information supplied is correct and complete.</P>
        <P>A C Visa is granted for visits of less than 90 days.  As a consequence it is not the general policy to extend permission to remain to persons who are admitted initially for a period of 90 days or less on a C Visa, save in very exceptional and unforeseen circumstances.</P>
        <P>The person concerned must leave and reapply from outside the State should she wish to return.  She should include in her new visa application the purpose and duration of her intended stay.</P>

	<P>Following the submission to me in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, I decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, I am pleased to note that the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics for the third and fourth quarters of 2006.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.</P>

	<P>The case referred to by the Deputy falls under the scope of the Dublin II Regulation, (Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003).</P>
        <P>This Regulation is intended to prevent the phenomenon of &lsquo;asylum shopping&rsquo; across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one Member State or whereby an asylum seeker has been granted a visa to enter another regulation state.  At the same time, it guarantees applicants that one State will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of &lsquo;refugees in orbit&rsquo;, a situation which had previously pertained in Europe.  Under the Dublin II Regulation, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, (ORAC), can, on the basis of relevant criteria, request another State to accept responsibility for an asylum application and have it processed in that other state.</P>
        <P>Following investigation by ORAC, it was determined that the person concerned had previously made an asylum application in France.  As a direct result of the ORAC determination, a Transfer Order was signed in respect of him on 01 August, 2006, obliging him to present to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, (GNIB), on <Col N="1617"/>22 August, 2006, for arrangements to be made for his return to France.  He presented as requested and a flight was arranged for his transfer on 30 August, 2006.  However he evaded his transfer and became illegally present in this State.  The person concerned continues to evade his transfer and remains illegally present in the State.  I would therefore urge the person concerned to come forward and present himself to the GNIB without further delay.</P>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to D&aacute;il Question number 152 of 14 December, 2006, in respect of the mother in this instance.</P>
        <P>As you are aware, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, (ORAC), determined in accordance with the terms of the Dublin II Regulation, Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003, that France is responsible for examining the mother&rsquo;s asylum application in this instance.  Under Article 4(3) of the Regulation any child or children born to an asylum seeker after they arrive in another Member State shall have their asylum application, if they make one, heard in the State where the mother&rsquo;s application for asylum was first lodged.  Accordingly a request under Article 4(3) was made to the appropriate authorities in France on 07 December, 2006, asking them to also accept the child, which they did.</P>
        <P>Arrangements were made for their transfer on 15 December, 2006.  However they evaded their transfer and became illegally present in this State.  The persons concerned continue to evade their transfer and remain illegally present in the State.  I would therefore urge the persons concerned to present to the GNIB  without further delay in order to arrange their transfer to France.</P>

        <Quest> if he will alter the rules relating to work visas for US citizens in view of the fact that the same is being sought from the US for Irish seeking to stay legally in the US; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, US citizens are exempt from Irish entry visa requirements.  They are however, as are all non-EEA nationals, required to report to an Immigration Officer on arrival at an Irish port of entry to seek permission to enter the State.  In addition, all non-EEA nationals, including US citizens, who wish to remain in Ireland for longer than three months are required to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau and seek the appropriate permission to remain.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Access to the Irish labour market by US and other non-EEA nationals, other than those whose residence status (e.g. refugee, legally resident spouse of Irish national etc.), specifically grants them free access, is dealt with by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Employment Permits Act 2006 has now entered into force and sets out new arrangements governing this area.  These include a new &lsquo;&lsquo;Green Card&rdquo; permit for people earning above &euro;60,000 per year in any sector and for those in the &euro;30,000 &mdash; &euro;60,000 range in strategically important sectors.  Information regarding <Col N="1619"/>the qualifying criteria for &ldquo;Green Cards&rdquo;, work permits and other labour market access schemes are available from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment website at www.entemp.ie.  The Work Visa and Work Authorisation schemes previously operated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been replaced by these new arrangements.</P>
        <P>Non-EEA nationals, including US citizens, who have permission to remain in the State as students are currently entitled to take up casual employment (defined as 20 hours per week during school term time and up to 40 hours per week during school holidays) for the duration of their permission to remain.  This entitlement ceases upon the expiry of the person&rsquo;s permission to remain as a student.  However, while this represents the current position, &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; provides that employment of non-EEA students will become subject to an application for an employment permit.</P>
        <P>Although US citizens are not visa required, they can subject to certain criteria, avail of the Holiday Working Visa Scheme which can be issued for up to a 12 month period and which allows the holder to work in Ireland in a casual capacity during the validity of the Working Holiday Visa.</P>
        <P>My Department has no proposals to initiate a regularisation scheme in respect of non-EEA nationals, including US citizens who are currently working and residing illegally in Ireland.  However, if the Deputy has a particular case in mind I would advise that the individual concerned should write to the Immigration Division of my Department, which is located at 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 giving details of their circumstances and the grounds on which they wish to remain.  Each case will be examined and determined on the individual merits of the case.</P>

	<P>Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief on certain health expenses incurred by a taxpayer in respect of the provision of health care for him or herself and/or his or her qualifying dependants.  However, the relief is only available to the extent that tax has been paid in a tax year.</P>
        <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in this particular year the taxpayer has been granted the maximum relief available for the health expenses as claimed.  The total amount of tax paid for the year ending 31 December 2006 amounted to &euro;3,135.43, and this amount was repaid on 17 January 2007.  Unfortunately, there is no further tax available to repay to the taxpayer for the year 2006.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that almost all their consultancy expenditure is in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) area.  While Revenue endeavour as far as possible to carry out their ICT work in-house, and use the various civil service ICT recruitment options to maintain a cadre of skilled and experienced  internal staff, they do use &lsquo;external support&rsquo; to develop tangible assets in the form of software which is recognised by the C&amp;AG in the annual appropriation accounts.</P>
        <P>Recent examples of this are the engagement of computer experts to develop and provide support for critical ICT projects such as the redesign of the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Customs Automated Entry Processing (AEP) systems as well as the maintenance and enhancement of Revenue&rsquo;s underlying application frameworks &mdash; their back-office Integrated Taxation Services and the public-facing Revenue On-Line Services.</P>
        <P>Revenue also employ consultants who &lsquo;advise and recommend&rsquo; in the traditional manner.  These consultancies represent typically low-cost, once-off business area assignments.  For clarity, the numbers involved in these consultancies are shown separately in the table.</P>
        <P>The amount of expenditure and the numbers engaged are shown in the table.  The number of people varies from time to time during each year depending, for example, on the number of projects being worked on at the same time and the stage that projects are at.</P>

        <P FLI="0">As regards reducing reliance on consultants, it would not be realistic to expect to eliminate consultants altogether from an organisation like the Revenue Commissioners, because of the organisation&rsquo;s size and the complexity of its operations.  However, as already mentioned, Revenue do try as far as possible to carry out their ICT work in-house, and uses the various civil service ICT recruitment options to maintain a cadre of skilled and experienced internal staff.  Latterly they have used provisions of Sustaining Progress and its successor for &lsquo;open&rsquo; recruitment.</P>
        <P>Revenue also test the market, via open EU competitions, for all key projects such as PAYE (2003) and AEP (2005).  They have issued a Prior Information Notice in the EU Journal stating an intent to approach the market again in 2007 for external ICT support for the full portfolio of projects and frameworks.</P>
        <P>Finally, the figures in the table above must be seen in context: Revenue&rsquo;s total expenditure in 2005, for example, was &euro;387m and it employed some 6,445 staff.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, detailed design of the Fermoy North Drainage Scheme commenced in June 2006 and has been ongoing since.  As some changes had to be made to the Scheme exhibited in November 2005, mainly on the western boundary, a slight delay has been experienced in commencing the tender process to appoint a civil engineering contractor.  However, this work is now almost completed and the Office of Public Works expects to commence the tender process within a matter of weeks.  When the tender process is complete OPW will submit the scheme to the Minister for Finance for Confirmation.  Subject to the Minister Confirming the Scheme, OPW would expect to commence construction works within a matter of weeks thereafter, some time in the third quarter of 2007.</P>
        <P>Detailed design of the Fermoy South West Scheme will commence when construction on the North Scheme is underway.  The South East <Col N="1622"/>Scheme will follow similarly when construction commences on the South West Scheme.</P>

	<P>Individuals aged 65 years or over (and individuals who are permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining themselves,) can claim a refund from DIRT where the income of the individual (inclusive of the deposit interest) is below the appropriate income exemption limit for tax purposes.  In the 2007 tax year the exemption limit for a single person aged 65 or over is &euro;19,000 per annum, and in the case of a married couple, the exemption limit is &euro;38,000 (the equivalent limits for the 2006 tax year were &euro;17,000 single/ &euro;34,000 married).  A partial refund may be due to such individuals whose income (inclusive of the deposit interest) does not greatly exceed the appropriate income exemption limit.</P>
        <P>In the recent Budget I announced that the rules relating to such individuals are now being changed so that in future they may notify their financial institution of their status and receive the interest without deduction of DIRT.

From 31 March 2008 the basic minimum standard required will be the new FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate in Agriculture.  Details of the new scheme, as well as a commencement date of 31 March 2008, were agreed with the farming representative bodies at the Partnership talks concluded late last year.</P>
        <P>The extended lead in time provides an opportunity for an individual to achieve the existing standard before the new requirements take effect.

<P FLI="0">With regard to occupational pensions, that is approved superannuation schemes set up by the employer, it should be noted that the cost figures in respect of employee and employer contributions are very tentative estimates and that efforts are being made to improve information on the cost of tax relief for pensions, generally. Subject to these limitations, and using data on the numbers of employee contributors obtained from the Pensions Board, the approximate average value to each employee contributor of tax concessions in respect of the total combined estimates of contributions by employees and employers is estimated at &euro;1,637. There is no basis on which to provide an estimate of the highest individual value of tax relief.</P>
        <P>The average value of income tax concessions for contributions to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) which are available to the self-employed and to employees not in occupational pension schemes and to Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) is estimated at &euro;2,411 and &euro;2,500, respectively.</P><Col N="1624"/>
        <P>The highest individual tax relievable contribution allowable in 2003 in respect of the contributions to RACs and PRSAs, assuming a contributor aged 50 years or over and taking into account a contributions earnings cap of &euro;254,000, is 30 per cent of  &euro;254,000 or &euro;76,200. This amounts to a tax relief of &euro;32,004 at the top tax rate of 42 per cent.  The relief can be doubled in the case of a married couple where each spouse qualifies for the maximum individual relief of &euro;32,004. On the basis of the information available from tax records the highest individual values of tax relief allowed in 2003 were &euro;56,262 for RACs and  &euro;39,900 for PRSAs.</P>

For tax exemption purposes, Childminders must also provide evidence that they have notified their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC), through the local Childminding Advisory Officer that they are providing a childminding service.</P>
        <P>The number of voluntary notifications made by Childminders to the CCCs since the introduction of the Childcare Services Relief in December <Col N="1626"/>2005 has been monitored by my Office on a regular basis.  The latest figures available as of the end of November 2006 are summarised in the table below.</P>
        <P>The first tax year for which this tax exemption applies is 2006 and tax returns for 2006 must be made by the end of October 2007.  Until that time, the final take-up of this initiative cannot be fully established.</P>

	<P>&ldquo;Adding Years to Life, Life to Years: A Health Promotion Strategy for Older People&rdquo; was developed by the Department of Health and Children in collaboration with the National Council on Ageing and Older People (NCAOP), as the first strand of the Healthy Ageing Programme.  This strategy provides a framework for action and informs health promotion activity for older people at national and regional levels.   The Department continues to support the NCAOP in the development of further strands of the programme.</P>
        <P>The second and third strands involve supporting the implementation of the strategy through various means including the development of an information and support network for promoting the health, welfare and autonomy of older people and identifying and promoting models of good practice for healthy ageing.   The programme also aims to support a range of sectors with a role to  play  in  healthy  ageing  through development  and  capacity-building practice  in  the  areas of networking, training, materials, models of good practice, national partnership initiatives, public awareness and evaluation of initiatives.</P>
        <P>To date the programme has: developed the Healthy Ageing Database, through widespread consultation with relevant stakeholders.  This database is a valuable information resource for sharing information and experience on healthy ageing initiatives; published &ldquo;Healthy Ageing in Ireland: Policy, Practice and Evaluation&rdquo; Report, analysing current healthy ageing initiatives around the country and presenting models of best practice; published the &ldquo;Directory of Healthy Ageing Information Resources for Older People&rdquo;, to provide older people with information on leaflets, videos and posters relevant to healthy ageing (produced by both statutory and voluntary organisations); developed a Healthy Ageing Residential Care Initiative for long-stay institutions and residential facilities for older people in Ireland; and published &ldquo;Older People in Ireland: A Profile of Health Status, Lifestyle and Socio-Economic Factors from the National Health and Lifestyle Surveys (SLAN)&rdquo;.  The programme is assisting the development of a national falls and fractures prevention, treatment and rehabilitation strategy.  Annual healthy ageing conferences are organised on Safety and Older People, Social Inclusion of Older People at <Col N="1630"/>Local Level, and Nutrition and Older People in Residential and Community Care Settings.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government launched the National Disability Strategy, in 2004 as a framework of positive action measures to support the participation of people with disabilities in Irish society. Two new pieces of legislation &mdash; the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 and the Disability Act, 2005 form an integral part of this Strategy, along with the suite of six sectoral plans, launched in 2006.</P>
        <P>One of the most important aspects of my Department&rsquo;s sectoral plan is the arrangements for commencing Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, which provides a statutory entitlement to an independent assessment of health and education needs, a statement of the services (Service Statement) which it is proposed to provide, and the right to pursue a complaint through an inde<Col N="1632"/>pendent redress mechanism if there is a failure to provide these entitlements.</P>
        <P>Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 will be commenced on a national basis (including Galway) in respect of persons of different ages as follows: for children aged less than 5 years &mdash; with effect from 1, June 2007; for children aged 5 years to 18 years  &mdash; in tandem with the implementation of the EPSEN Act 2004; and for persons aged over 18 years &mdash; as soon as possible but no later than 31, December 2011.</P>
        <P>Services for adults and children will continue to be enhanced progressively over the next number of years. The commitment by the Government to provide a Multi-Annual Investment programme of some &euro;900m over the period 2006-2009 for disability support services recognises the need to build capacity in the health services to deliver on these obligations.The bulk of this funding, around &euro;720m, is being spent in the health services.</P>
        <P>I have allocated &euro;100m in 2006 and a further &euro;100m in 2007 for the continuing development of services for people with a disability.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>

        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these <Col N="1633"/>apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <P>Staffing grant assistance was previously approved for the Group in question of &euro;84,786 under the EOCP, which included &euro;76,786 over three years in November 2000  and a further  &euro;8,000 in February 2004.  Capital grant assistance of &euro;25,554 was also approved for the Group in March 2002.  An application by the Group for further staffing grant assistance over three years, was appraised by the Programme Appraisal Committee (PAC) recently.</P>
        <P>The PAC did not recommend to the Secretary General that he approve further staffing grant assistance to the Group under the EOCP, as the Group had not met the reporting requirements regarding the previous grant assistance allocated.  The Secretary General concurred with the recommendation of the PAC not to approve additional funding in this instance and the Childcare Directorate of my Office informed the Group of this decision.</P>
        <P>The Group  recently appealed this decision and the appeal has been forwarded to Pobal, who carry out detailed assessments of all grant applications on behalf of the Office of the Minister <Col N="1634"/>for Children.  Following Pobal&rsquo;s assessment of the application, a recommendation will be made to the PAC, prior to a decision being made by the Secretary-General.  The Group will be informed of the outcome in due course.</P>

        <P>An independent mid-term review of progress on implementing the Strategy was carried out by the National Children&rsquo;s Advisory Council in 2006.

The OMC is a cross-cutting Government office located in the <Col N="1635"/>Department of Health and Children which focuses on harmonising policy issues that affect children. It brings together key staff and functions regarding children&rsquo;s health and well being and policy functions concerning Youth Justice and Early Years Education.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). The enabling of exchanges to provide DSL broadband is a matter for the service providers.</P>
        <P>The facilitation of broadband coverage across the entire country continues to be a key priority. I am aware that, despite Government and private investment in broadband, there are areas of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. Accordingly, I have announced a new scheme which will aim to provide a broadband service to these areas. This scheme will, when it is fully rolled out, ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met.</P>
        <P>A Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently considering all elements of the proposed scheme and work on the design of an appropriate tender will commence in the coming weeks. This scheme will be confined to areas of the country that are not yet served by any broadband service provider, currently thought to be 10-15% of the population.</P>
        <P>Under the joint industry/Government initiative, which established the Broadband for Schools programme, high speed broadband connectivity is being provided to all primary and post primary schools in the country at no cost to the schools <Col N="1640"/>themselves. 96.8% of schools have broadband installed to date.</P>

	<P>Since 2002, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is a statutory independent body, has been charged with all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.</P>
        <P>In 2006, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) directed BG&Eacute; to implement a new Gas Connections Policy, which determines the economic viability of connecting towns to the gas network. The new policy allows for the appraisal of a new town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns. Having regard to this new policy, BG&Eacute; carried out a comprehensive review of towns being considered for connection to the national gas network. The review is being conducted in two phases, and phase 1, which covers the towns in the proximity of the Mayo-Galway Pipeline, has already been completed.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of this phase of the review, the CER made the decision to allow Bord G&aacute;is to extend the natural gas network to eleven towns along the route of its Mayo-Galway gas transmission pipeline, including Athenry, Craughwell, Headford and Tuam, and it is envisaged that the connection of the eleven towns will take two to three years to complete.</P>
        <P>Bord G&aacute;is is continuing its evaluation of the viability of extending the gas network elsewhere to towns in other parts of the country with a view to completing its review by July, 2007.

Following completion of this study, the CER will consider whether other towns with an economically viable case may be connected.</P>
        <P>As regards the methodology employed by BG&Eacute; in its review, including its rationale as to why towns such as Tynagh, Ardrahan, Kinvara and Kilcolgan were not selected for examination, I can advise the Deputy that BG&Eacute; has a dedicated e-mail address, newtowns@bge.ie, for the purpose of dealing with any such queries.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 to 101, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, I addressed this matter comprehensively in my reply to Priority Question Number 3 of 8 February 2007 and to subsequent supplementary questions. The case to which he refers in Questions 96, 97 and 101 relates to five Cuban citizens who were convicted in the US in 2001 on charges ranging from espionage to first degree murder. A panel of three judges from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta overturned the 2001 convictions on 9th August 2005 and ordered a retrial based on new evidence. The Miami District Attorney duly filed an appeal against the decision of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Following an appellate hearing on 14 February 2006, a 10-2 decision to uphold the 2001 convictions was issued on 9 August 2006.</P>
        <P>It is my understanding that a number of appeals lodged on behalf of the defendants remain under active judicial review within the framework of the US domestic legal system. As I have previously informed the Deputy on several <Col N="1642"/>occasions, the Government has no standing in this matter, which is a bilateral consular question between the US and the Cuban authorities and, consequently, I do not intend to raise this matter with the US Government.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of family visits, I am aware from the 2005 Report of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention that, as of October 2005, sixty visas had been issued for visits by family members but that visas had not been granted to the wives of two of the convicted men on the stated grounds of US national security. Again, I do not believe that this is a matter on which I have any standing and I do not intend, therefore, to raise it with the US authorities.</P>
        <P>As I have made very clear in my replies to the Deputy&rsquo;s previous Parliamentary Questions on the issue of terrorist threats, Ireland, along with our EU partners, condemns all acts of terrorism, regardless of their target or motivation. Terrorism can never be justified by any cause, reason or ideology. It places the lives of innocent people at risk and undermines tolerance, openness and respect for fundamental freedoms in society. However, as I have also previously stated, I am not in a position to comment in any substantive way on the issues raised by the Deputy due to the imprecise nature of the allegations.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the overriding objective of Ireland and our EU partners in our relations with Cuba is to encourage &mdash; and not to enforce by external coercion &mdash; a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as is clearly set out in the European Union&rsquo;s 1996 Common Position on Cuba. The European Union believes that critical engagement with the Cuban Government, alongside dialogue with wider Cuban civil society, is the most effective way to promote peaceful change in Cuba.</P>
        <P>In June 2003, the European Union took a number of diplomatic steps following large-scale arrests, summary and arbitrary judicial processes, and the severe prison sentences imposed upon 75 dissidents for the exercise of the right to freedom of speech and participation in public affairs, as well as the summary trial and rapid execution of three ferry-boat hijackers in breach of minimum standards for the administration of the death penalty.</P>
        <P>In July 2003, the General Affairs and External Relations Council noted a serious deterioration in the human rights situation in Cuba. The Council, nonetheless, reaffirmed the validity of the policy of constructive engagement with Cuba, as provided for in the 1996 Common Position, as the basis of EU policy towards that country.</P>
        <P>The validity of the 1996 Common Position was most recently reaffirmed by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 12 June 2006. The European Union has emphasised its willingness to cooperate with Cuba on the basis of a dialogue with the Cuban Government and Cuban <Col N="1643"/>civil society, as soon as the Cuban Government shows the political will to engage in a dialogue aiming at tangible results, especially in the field of human rights and political freedom, the restriction of which remains a matter of deep concern. In this regard, I would again urge the Cuban Government to release all prisoners of conscience and to respect internationally acknowledged principles and practices, including in respect of judicial process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2004, Galway County Council submitted a tender to my Department seeking grant aid under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme for a project promoted by a private sector interest to construct a leisure centre, including a swimming pool, on a council site different to that initially recommended in a Feasibility Report prepared by the Council in 1999.  The formal procedures under the programme, which would have been known to the Council, are that Ministerial approval is required at each of the Preliminary and Contract Document stages, before tenders are invited for a project.  Notwithstanding the fact that Galway County Council pursued an alternative approach to the procurement of the facility, my Department indicated to the County Council that it would be prepared to examine a detailed proposal on its merits.  My Department&rsquo;s main concern in such cases is to ensure that the normal characteristics of a public swimming pool, such as public access and social inclusion considerations are adequately catered for.</P>
        <P>Since then, Galway County Council has been in contact with my Department which resulted in a proposal being made by the Council in June 2006.  Given the need to protect the State&rsquo;s interest arising from any grant aid awarded under the programme, my Department had certain legal aspects involved examined by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office.  Arising from that examination and in order to progress the matter further, Department Officials met with Galway County Council in November 2006 and proposals which emerged from that meeting are the subject of ongoing negotiations between the Council and the promoter and the Council and the Department. The Department is awaiting a reply for the Council to a recent letter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 to 126, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions. The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency. While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has informed me that it owns a total of 33.14 hectares of land in seven of the towns in question.  The tabular statement below shows the location and size of each of these holdings. IDA Ireland has no land holdings in Craughwell, Headford, Kinvara, or Portumna.</P>
        <P>During 2006 IDA hosted a total of three site visits by potential investors to two of the towns referred to in the above questions &mdash; two visits were to Tuam and one visit was to Loughrea.</P>
        <P>A central goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development. The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) and the new <Col N="1650"/>National Development Plan provide a framework for the achievement of this goal through the prioritization of development and investment in the Gateway and Hub locations. On this basis, IDA Ireland seeks to attract FDI into the Gateway and Hubs, as well as a small number of additional locations, throughout the West, i.e. Galway, Tuam, the linked Hubs of Ballina and Castlebar, as well as Ballinasloe and Westport.</P>
        <P>In line with the NSS, the Agency is investing significantly in the provision of planned and focussed property solutions tailored to specific sectoral targets.  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s sectoral emphasis is on attracting new knowledge intensive projects in Medical Technologies, Life Sciences, Information Communications and Technology and International Services. Two new Business and Technology parks have been developed in Tuam and in Ballinasloe.</P>
        <P>Despite increasing competition, Galway County and City continues to be very successful in winning new FDI. IDA supported companies are showing very strong employment numbers in the County, now accounting for 9,923 permanent jobs.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland continues to work actively with the existing base of overseas companies across the County to encourage them to grow and expand.  In addition the Agency is working with local groups, utility providers and other organisations to ensure that the County secures the appropriate infrastructure to enable the existing companies to grow and develop and to make the relevant locations sufficiently attractive for new projects.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to producing a Green Paper on pensions as part of the social partnership agreement Towards 2016.  The Green Paper will outline the major policy choices and the challenges we face in the pensions area. The two reports completed by the Pensions Board in 2006 &mdash; the National Pensions Review and their report on mandatory pensions, Special Savings for Retirement are major inputs to the Green Paper.</P>
        <P>I expect that the Green Paper will be finalised by the end of March 2007 and published thereafter.  A consultation process will then take place and the Government will publish a framework for future pensions policy on foot of this.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 130 together.</P>
        <P>The total cost of family income supplement payments is approximately &euro;2.75 million per week at present.  The average weekly payment is &euro;125.  Total expenditure in 2006 was &euro;107 million.</P>
        <P>The Family Income Supplement is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 132 together.</P>
        <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme (BSCFA) operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year and is administered on behalf of my Department by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Applications for the allowance may be made between the beginning of June and the end of September each year.  Some 84,800 families with approximately 172,000 children benefited from the scheme in 2006 at a cost of &euro;25.4m.  This is an increase on the 2005 figures when some 76,166 families with 157,254 children benefited at a cost of &euro;16.7m.  Some 90% of all applications received in 2006 were successful.  Some 19,323 applications were refused in 2006.</P>
        <P>Statistics are not available on the numbers of people who could qualify for, but do not apply for, back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  There were some 20,000 people in receipt of FIS last year when the back to school clothing and footwear scheme was in operation.  The Department&rsquo;s records show that almost 4,000 of these applied for and were awarded back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  As FIS is payable in conjunction with one-parent family payment (OFP) and other payments, FIS recipients will also have received back to school clothing and footwear allowance as OPF recipients.</P>

	<P>The Irish Aviation Authority was established under the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993 with responsibility for the safety regulation of the Irish aviation industry and the provision of Air Traffic Management services in Irish airspace.  The Authority exercises its safety regulation functions and service provision functions in accordance with the norms of international standards and procedures, both European, i.e. EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency), JAA (Joint Aviation Authorities), Eurocontrol, and global, ICAO  (the International Civil Aviation Authority).

        <P>My responsibility in relation to the safety functions of the Authority arises under Section 32 of the 1993 Act, which requires me periodically, to commission an examination of the performance by the company of its functions insofar as they relate to the application and enforcement of technical and safety standards in relation to aircraft and air navigation.  The most recent examination took place in 2004 and concluded that there is a general, positive and proactive attitude and competence vis-&agrave;-vis safety and the maintenance of a high safety level.  It is my intention to commission a further examination this year in accordance with the provisions of Section 32.</P>

	<P>The Special Investigation Unit (SIU) was established in the late 1980s to deal with serious problems relating to use of illegal substances (hormones, angel dust etc.) in animal pro<Col N="1658"/>duction.  Over the intervening years, the remit of the Unit has been expanded to assist in the implementation of various schemes and in particular to investigate breaches of legislation governing animal disease control, identification and smuggling, animal medication, etc.</P>
        <P>Staffing in the Unit has expanded over the years to reflect its extended role and its dedicated staffing currently stands at 14.  In addition, there are 13 staff in the Unit who deal with identification and traceability aspects and, where necessary, the Unit can be expanded by resources from other areas of the Department, including District Veterinary Offices.  I am satisfied that the staffing levels available are adequate and I do not propose to assign extra resources to the Unit at this time.</P>
        <P>The work of the Unit involves regular inspections, monitoring, investigations and follow up work including preparation of cases for prosecutions and attendance at court. Following are details of the number of formal investigations initiated by the Unit over the past 3 years:</P>

        <P FLI="0">With regard to illegal substances, extensive monitoring carried out by my Department on farms and at slaughtering plants indicates strongly that use of such substances is a not a current feature of Irish farming as evidenced by the absence of any confirmed positives out of over 21,000 samples tested for such substances over the last 3 years.  This positive situation is due in no small way to the consistent work of the SIU since its inception, whose investigations led to 250 persons being convicted of various offences under animal remedies legislation since 1996, resulting in 72 persons receiving custodial sentences and fines of c. &euro;950,000 being imposed.</P>
        <P>While the reducing trend of prosecutions in more recent years also reflects a greater culture of compliance resulting from enforcement activity in earlier years, my Department continues to be extremely vigilant in this area.   I might also state that my Department works closely with other national agencies, such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Customs, as well as with equivalent agencies elsewhere in the EU, as part of its monitoring of this area.  In addition, the laboratory services at the disposal of my Department work within a coordinated structure at EU level to ensure that analytical capability is kept up to date with ongoing developments.</P>

	<P>The Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965 are the principal statutes governing the welfare of animals, including race animals, in this country. The responsibility for pursuing complaints of cruelty under that legislation rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On receipt of such a complaint, the Garda&iacute; have a statutory basis on which to investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an act of cruelty against an animal.  In view of this, my Department does not have details of prosecutions taken under this legislation.</P>
        <P>The Animal Remedies Regulations 2005 regulate the act of prescribing by veterinary practitioners of veterinary medicines.  As a general principle, under this legislation, a veterinary practitioner may only prescribe for any animal a medicine which, following evaluation to ensure its quality safety and effectiveness, has been licensed for the species and condition in question.  However, as an exception to this general principle and in order solely to avoid unacceptable suffering in an animal, a veterinary practitioner, based on his or her professional judgement, is enabled to prescribe, within certain defined limits, products authorised for other species and other conditions.</P>
        <P>However, of its nature, this latter provision could not legitimately be used as a basis for prescribing a product which would be harmful to the animal or to the consumer and any person breaching this provision would be liable to the penalties provided for in the legislation (up to &euro;5,000 and/or 1 years imprisonment on summary conviction or &euro;350,000 and/or 10 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment).</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance is 1% of those farmers to whom certain Statutory Management Requirements (including the Nitrates Directive) or GAEC apply. In 2006 this resulted in some 1350 Cross Compliance inspections under the Nitrates SMR.</P>
        <P>The EU Regulations governing cross-compliance penalties provide that where the non-compliance results from negligence of the farmer the reduction shall normally be 3% but this may be reduced to 1% or increased to 5% depending on the extent, severity and permanence of the non-compliance found.  Similarly, where the non-compliance is deemed intentional the reduction shall normally be 20% but this may be reduced to 15% or increased to 100% depending on the extent, severity and permanence of the non-compliance found.</P>
        <P>In each case the applicant has the right to have any decision reviewed by my Department.  The review is carried out by an officer other than the person who carried out the original inspection.  Where the applicant is not satisfied with the result of the review he/she has the right to have the case referred to the Independent Agricultural Appeals Office.</P>
        <P>Breaches of the Nitrates Directive were found during 300 of these inspections. In 78 cases the breach was deemed inadvertent, minor in nature, did not result from negligence of the farmer and was capable of occurring in practical farming situations. In these cases the tolerance regime operated by my Department was applied and the farmers in question did not suffer any financial penalty.  Of the remaining 222, 90 farmers received a 1% penalty, 54 farmers received a 3% penalty, 74 farmers received a 5% penalty, and 4 farmers received a 15% penalty.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 150 together.</P>
        <P>Under the relevant EU regulations, the restructuring aid for the sugar industry has to be drawn down on the basis of an aid application submitted by the sugar processor. The applications must contain a restructuring plan, including a social plan detailing the actions planned in particular with respect to re-training, redeployment and early retirement of the workforce concerned. In July 2006, Greencore duly submitted such an application, which indicated that the proposed redundancy payments were in accordance with the ruling of the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>I am aware that there is an ongoing dispute between the company and the workers over the interpretation of the Labour Court recommendation. I regret that the parties have not yet resolved their differences but, as I have explained on a number of occasions, I have no function in <Col N="1662"/>that regard.  The position regarding that dispute was outlined by my colleague the Minister for Labour Affairs, Mr. Tony Killeen TD, in reply to a Parliamentary Question on Wednesday 31 January 2007.</P>
        <P>The aid application submitted by Greencore was approved in September subject to the outcome of the Judicial Review proceedings instituted by Greencore in respect of the Government decisions regarding the allocation of the aid. In view of these legal proceedings, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</P>

	<P>I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department takes seriously the issue of noxious weeds growing on the lands of State and semi-State organizations and Local Authorities.  In 2006 my Department launched two publicity campaigns in February and May to raise public awareness of the need to control noxious weeds. These publicity campaigns consisted of: posters forwarded to public bodies including Garda Stations, Local Authorities, Department of Agriculture and Food regional offices, Teagasc offices and agricultural merchants for display in public places, Department press notices in the National press, and Department press releases.  In addition all Local Authorities were written to again in August to remind them of their responsibilities under the Noxious Weeds Act.</P>
        <P>My Department will be running this type of publicity campaign again in 2007 so that Public Bodies and Local Authorities continue the elimination of these weeds from public areas.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 to 159, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="1665"/>
        <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available.  The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</P>
        <P>The provision of rented accommodation provides an immediate solution to a deficit of school accommodation, and is often the only available option where extra accommodation is needed at short notice.</P>
        <P>However, the current focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible by way of permanent accommodation. In order to reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level a new devolved initiative was launched in 2003. The purpose of this initiative is to allow schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money. Since the introduction of the devolved initiative over 200 schools have been allocated funding under this scheme.</P>

	<P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students. These are the Higher Education Grants (HEG) Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees&rsquo; (VEC) Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses.</P>
        <P>The HEG Scheme is administered by the Local Authorities on behalf of my Department. The other three schemes are administered by the Vocational Education Committees. Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. An approved third level course for the purpose of the HEG and the VEC Scholarship Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years dur<Col N="1666"/>ation and a full time postgraduate course of not less than one year&rsquo;s duration pursued in an approved institution. The Schemes outline the respective courses which are approved for grant purposes.</P>
        <P>The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. If an individual applicant considers that s/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, s/he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
        <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes (clause 3.3 of the Higher Education Grants Scheme), a second chance student is defined as a student, who having attended but not successfully completed an approved course, is returning following a break of at least five years in order to pursue an approved course at the same level (i.e. Second Chance Student).</P>
        <P>My Department understands from the information supplied that the student referred to by the Deputy already holds an undergraduate degree. Accordingly, he is ineligible for a higher education grant or to benefit under the Free Fees Initiative in respect of a subsequent course at that level.  Tax relief, however, is available in respect of undergraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU Member States, as well as in private colleges in the State. This relief applies at the standard rate of tax and is available to full time and part time courses. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local Tax Offices.</P>
        <P>Apart from the funding provided through the Student Support Maintenance Grant Schemes, financial assistance is also available from my Department through the Student Assistance Fund. The objective of the Fund, which is ESF-aided, is to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Further information on this fund is available from the Student Access Officer at the college being attended by the candidate.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post-primary education in the late 1960&rsquo;s and maps were drawn up at the time. No general review of catchment boundaries has taken place since the inception of the school transport scheme. A small number of local reviews were carried out over the years in certain circumstances where, for example, a new post-primary school was established in an area where previously there was none or, conversely, where a &ldquo;sole provider&rdquo; school closed due to declining enrolment.</P>
        <P>No recent changes have been made to the catchment boundary maps for County Wexford. However, my Department is aware that an incorrect map was used to categorise a small number of students for school transport in the 2005/06 school year only. The error was promptly discovered and acted upon.</P>
        <P>My Department will liaise with the Transport Liaison Officer for County Wexford regarding the map on the Wexford VEC website.  If necessary, that map will be brought into line with the map retained in my Department.</P>

	<P>When the establishment of an Ionad N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Oideachais Gaeilge in Baile Bhuirne was announced in 1999 the intention was that it would function as a national centre of excellence to support the teaching of Irish and through Irish, <Col N="1668"/>and would engage with education institutions from pre-school to third level.</P>
        <P>When the project went to tender, the construction costs were deemed excessive and it did not go ahead.  There have been a number of developments since the original announcement.  Principal among these was the establishment of An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta and the evolution of a new in-service model for teachers.</P>
        <P>There is an overlap between the functions of An Chomhairle and the functions envisaged for the Centre in Baile Bhuirne and this has to be addressed.  In addition, the new in-service model for teachers will prioritise regionalised access to a full spread of curriculum expertise through the regional education centre network.</P>
        <P>In order to clarify the specific rationale and function of the proposed Ionad N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Oideachais Gaeilge, officials from my Department together with officials from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs met with the interested parties.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 and 169 together.</P>
        <P>The Substance Misuse Prevention Programme (which is also known as the Walk Tall Programme support service) is available to all schools in local drug task force areas and to date teachers have availed of the training provided to over 325 schools.  In addition to the 325 primary schools in the LDTF areas in Dublin, Bray and Cork which receive an ongoing service of support from the SMPP (Walk Tall Programme), since September, <Col N="1671"/>2006, the service has notified all DEIS (Urban 1 and 2) schools about its support service and, as a result, 150 extra schools in those categories now receive a support service in drug prevention strategies from the Walk Tall Programme.</P>
        <P>The Substance Misuse Prevention Programme is offered to teachers in summer courses in various education centres around the country (15 planned for  2007) as part of their professional development in this important aspect of their work in teaching pupils about the dangers of substance misuse.</P>
        <P>Proposals for extending the Substance Misuse Prevention Programme  to other areas of disadvantage outside the Local Drugs Task Force Areas (LDTFAs) have been made by the Steering Committee of the &lsquo;Walk Tall&rsquo; Programme.</P>
        <P>The proposals have been received in my Department where they are currently being considered by my officials. This consideration involves consultation with the &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo; Support Programme personnel to explore, amongst other issues, the feasibility of extending the Programme to areas of disadvantage which are outside the local drugs taskforces. This includes the deployment of resources to areas of most need in accordance with the National Drug Strategy 2001-2008, including Urban Band 1 and 2 schools which are identified in the DEIS (Delivering Equality in Schools) programme.</P>

	<P>In recognition of the difficulties that students can experience in obtaining suitable accommodation and following consultation with third level institutions, a special tax incentive was introduced to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in Section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999. The Act provides for relevant Guidelines to be issued by the Minister for Education and Science in consultation with the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government and with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>The Guidelines detail a range of conditions that are required to be in place in order that a development may qualify for tax relief. The Guidelines are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and I am arranging for a copy to be provided to the Deputy.</P><Col N="1672"/>

	<P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students which are administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees. The Higher Education Grant Scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.</P>
        <P>Under the nationality requirement, students must hold E.U. Nationality, have Official Refugee Status or &mdash; have been granted Humanitarian Leave to Remain in the State; or</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish national residing in the State, or be the child of such person, not having EU nationality; or</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of another EU Member State who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed, or self-employed, in the State or be the child of such a person, not having EU nationality; or</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be nationals of a member county of the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Students must meet the nationality requirement at the time of entry or re-entry to an approved course. However the Grants Schemes contain a &lsquo;change in circumstances&rsquo; clause which provides that a candidate&rsquo;s eligibility may be assessed or re-assessed in the event of a change in circumstances in relation to, inter alia, reckonable income, the number of dependent children, normal residence and nationality, where the candi<Col N="1673"/>date becomes an Irish national or the national of another EU member State.</P>
        <P>The &lsquo;change in circumstances&rsquo; provision allows candidates who acquire nationality through the naturalisation process, during the course of their studies, to apply to be assessed or re-assessed for grant assistance with effect from the academic term when the change occurs.</P>
        <P>The decision on eligibility for third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.</P>
        <P>If, however, the Deputy has a particular case in mind and provides detailed information, to the Student Support Unit of my Department, the case can be examined to ensure it was assessed correctly under the terms of the grant Schemes.</P>

	<P>Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. The Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with Section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission of a pupil to the school.</P>
        <P>Currently, under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of this Department. Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and where an appeal is upheld the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.</P>
        <P>Otherwise, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.</P>

	<P>A statutory Record of Monuments and Places, RMP, is maintained in accordance with section 12 of the National Monuments Act 1994.  The RMP is published on a county by county basis and is available for public inspection in the offices of each planning authority and in one library of each library authority.</P>
        <P>A number of the monuments listed in the RMP fall within a category defined under National Monuments Act 1930, as amended, as national monuments.  These are monuments or remains of monuments the preservation of which is a matter of national importance by reason of the historical, architectural, traditional, artistic or archaeological interest attaching thereto.</P>
        <P>Statutory protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for planning authorities in the exercise of their functions under Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Each planning authority is required to include in its development plan a Record of Protected Structures within its functional area.</P>
        <P>Under the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1999, my Department is preparing the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH).  The purpose of this is to identify, record and evaluate the country&rsquo;s architectural heritage uniformly and consistently.  Each NIAH survey, undertaken by my Department within any particular local authority&rsquo;s functional area, provides the basis for recommendations under the Planning and Development Act 2000 to planning authorities <Col N="1676"/>for the inclusion of particular structures in the Record of Protected Structures.</P>
        <P>In March 2003, arising from the NIAH survey undertaken within the functional area of Fingal County Council, I recommended 665 structures for inclusion on the Fingal County Council Record of Protected Structures.  The NIAH survey for Fingal is published on the website <i>www.buildingsofireland.ie</i>.  An NIAH survey for the Dublin City Council area has not yet been undertaken.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, a number of historic properties are maintained in State care by the Office of Public Works.  A list of the national monuments and historic properties in the northern part of Dublin City and in the functional area of Fingal County Council is being compiled by my Department and will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The total funding available to my Department for heritage purposes in 2007 amounts to almost &euro;70 million.  Funding of some &euro;31 million for built heritage includes sponsorship of the Heritage Council for its day to day operations and its capital grant scheme, the provision of capital financing to the Office of Public Works for works to properties in State care, support of local authorities to enable them to provide grant assistance for conservation works to protected structures, and provision for the newly established Irish Heritage Trust.</P>
        <P>My Department has designated, and provides funding for a scheme of grants for the conservation of protected buildings.  This scheme is administered by local authorities who assess and prioritise applications and approve individual grants.  The scheme is aimed at assisting owners and occupiers to carry out conservation works on structures of architectural significance in the Record of Protected Structures which the local authority has listed under the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Inquiries about this scheme may be made to the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P>Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, my Department will also administer a scheme of grants for the restoration and conservation of buildings of significant architectural heritage merit and which are in public ownership or open to the public generally.  Criteria in relation to the Heritage Council&rsquo;s grant scheme, <Col N="1677"/>Buildings at Risk, are available directly from the Council.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;38.553 million will also be available in 2007 to the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department in respect of our natural heritage.  This funding provides for running costs of six National Parks and 66 State-owned Nature Reserves, development of tourism related projects, visitor facilities and related capital projects, and salaries for industrial staff.  It also provides for research and scientific study related to all areas of conservation management, and compensatory measures for landowners&rsquo; costs and losses resulting from restrictions in managing their land in areas designated under the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, and for compensation for landowners who cease turf cutting activities.  In 2007, this subhead will also provide funding of &euro;750,000 of for Biodiversity Awareness.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 and 188 together.</P>
        <P>In order to be able to vote at elections and referenda in this jurisdiction, a person&rsquo;s name must be entered in the register of electors for a constituency in the State in which the person ordinarily resides.</P>
        <P>Postal voting is provided for in respect of certain categories of person as specified in electoral law. The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting by wholetime members of the Defence Forces, members of the Garda&iacute;, and Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses. Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories: electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996); electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day &mdash; in these cases, the law provides for completion of the necessary voting documentation at a Garda station (the Electoral Act 1997); full-time students registered at their home <Col N="1682"/>who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State (the Electoral Act 1997); electors who  because of the circumstances of their detention in prison pursuant to an order of a court are likely to be unable to go in person on polling day to vote (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006); and certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001).</P>
        <P>While electoral law is subject to ongoing review, there are no proposals to alter the existing arrangements along the lines referred to in the Questions.</P>

	<P>In July 2004, my Department introduced a special programme for the installation of central heating in local authority rented dwellings.  Local authorities were advised that the choice of heating system and associated improvements in thermal insulation was a matter for determination by the authority with reference to, the expected capital and running costs, including servicing and management and maintenance costs as well as the preference of the occupants.  In addition, the environmental benefits of the chosen system e.g. reduction in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions were also to be borne in mind.</P>
        <P>Prior to this initiative, my Department has required since 1994 that central heating be provided in all new local authority dwellings and <Col N="1683"/>included in the overall cost of schemes.  Local authorities are also required to comply with the Building Regulations, the Department&rsquo;s guidelines and other statutory requirements when installing central heating in dwellings.</P><Col N="1684"/>
        <P>A number of pilot projects, supported by the Department, in relation to the provision of alternative energy for social housing are currently underway.  When these are completed and the results assessed, a decision will be made on the future direction of policy in this area.</P>
