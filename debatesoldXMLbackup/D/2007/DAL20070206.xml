      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>My Department has one item of legislation, the Statute Law Revision Bill, which was published on 1 February 2007 and is at Order for Second Stage in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>This Bill will continue the process of modernising the Statute Book by repealing 3,188 ancient statutes, dating from between 1200 and 6 December 1922, that are now redundant or obsolete.  The Bill will also positively retain 1,348 statutes from the same period, as they are not proposed for repeal at present.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, it is the intention that all legislation that pre-dates the foundation of the State will be repealed.  Where we need to keep the provisions <Col N="1502"/>of any pre-1922 legislation, it is intended that these will be re-enacted in a more modern form.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Where does the Government&rsquo;s proposals on a constitutional referendum on the rights of children stand?  Have the proposals and the proposed wording been finalised?  When does the Government propose to bring the necessary legislation for this referendum before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann?  Is the Taoiseach concerned that the commencement of a general election campaign in less than three months could hinder a comprehensive debate on what everyone agrees is a very important issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter was discussed this morning and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has given the outline of his full proposal and its wording.  To give the parties more time for consultation we will not proceed yet.  There is plenty of time if we wish to do this.  There are important issues to be dealt with if we can come to an agreement.  The question is whether political agreement can be reached.  The work at official level in the Department will be completed this week.  These are not politically contentious issues. There seems to be comprehensive agreement on them, though they generate much interest in certain groups and individuals.  We will wait for the Minister of State to complete his discussions with the parties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach have a target date for a referendum?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Realistically a referendum would have to be held by some time in April.  We will have the work finalised and it is a question of whether the work with the parties will also be finalised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there any question of holding such a referendum on the same day as a general election?  Does holding a referendum in April followed by a general election a few weeks later provide a feasible timescale for these important issues?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will be in a position to bring forward a referendum Bill within a week and there is no reason a vote cannot be held in early or late March.  It is a question of whether agreement can be reached among the parties.  I would not propose holding a referendum on the same day as a general election.   That would not be a good idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no political disagreement on the requirement for a referendum dealing with the zone of absolute defence.  This is very important and the point has been made previously.  </P><Col N="1503"/>
        <P>On the four other propositions, it seems the advice of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution is not being followed.  The advice was that one can call a referendum, in an emergency, within a thirty day period but that there should be real, public consultation about changes to the Constitution.  I met the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance last week and it broadly supports this.</P>
        <P>Last year the Taoiseach made a comment on the requirement for a referendum, as he is entitled to do as Taoiseach.  We were led to believe the Minister of State with special responsibility for children would have detailed consultations with the Opposition parties.  Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, Fine Gael spokesperson on justice, was contacted by the Minister of State last week while he was on his way to Dublin and they had a discussion the following day.  The Minister of State also spoke to the Labour Party spokesman.  However, as we have no wording to consider, all Fine Gael could discuss this morning at its Front Bench meeting was the intent and objective of the Government.</P>
        <P>When one changes the Constitution, unforeseen circumstances may arise.  We had rushed legislation in the past, including the nursing homes Bill, and we have had difficulties with other aspects of legislation that arose, never mind the Constitution.  Although the Taoiseach says he wants all-party agreement on the matter, his approach flies in the face of the recommendation of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which was chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan and which contended there should be serious public consultation.  The world of academia or other sectors may raise very valid questions that are not foreseen by anybody in the political spectrum, as was the case with the BUPA-VHI issue, in respect of which a lacuna in the law has been identified.</P>
        <P>If the Taoiseach is to hold the referendum in early March, as he said to Deputy Joe Higgins, he will note that this is only 35 days, or five weeks, from now.  In the context of the recommendation of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, is the matter deemed by the Government to be an emergency?  What are the Taoiseach&rsquo;s views on this?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach intend to legislate in respect of the private health insurance market, which includes VHI, BUPA and VIVAS?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a question for the line Minister.  These questions refer specifically to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry but it is important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened to the views of Deputy Kenny, Leader of the Opposition, on this issue.  Last year the House was coming down over issues with which we had to deal, and it was sug<Col N="1504"/>gested that we should not go into recess in the summer until they were dealt with.  That is the view I heard from all sides.  I was strongly criticised because I went to an international forum &mdash; I was the only member in Europe to be invited &mdash; and it was argued I should not have gone before dealing with the substantive issue in a legislative and constitutional way.  Since then, I have met all the relevant groups, that is, in June, July and September, and I designated the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to deal with the comprehensive issue.  A large number of groups was involved in the process, including legal groups, religious groups of all denominations and medical and sociological groups dealing with children and other issues.  We came to a view in October, which I aired, and there has since been considerable engagement by a range of groups, including NGOs, educationalists, sociologists and others, all of which have had meetings with the Minister of State over the past three months and longer.</P>
        <P>I take the point that Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe and others need time and that is why I said what I said.  I do not expect them to make up their minds on the basis of one meeting &mdash; I am not asking any spokesperson to do that.</P>
        <P>If we do not deal with this issue, it will not be the end of the world, but we should try to deal with it.  Deputy Kenny is totally right that unforeseen issues can always arise dealing with such issues.  One can take it that as soon as one decides to hold a constitutional referendum &mdash; I have had this debate for ten years with Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe &mdash; the all-party committee issues a report, which then enters the system for consideration.  We sometimes change the views in the all-party committee&rsquo;s report and deal with the matter on a legislative basis.  It then proceeds to be dealt with on some other basis.  It is not at all irregular that we do not agree with the view of the all-party committee, although it does a good job in bringing issues to the fore in the way it does.</P>
        <P>Groups on all sides say we should deal with this issue.  Although there seems to be no controversial issue involved in this, I have never seen a referendum issue unopposed.  If there is nothing to oppose in the referendum, something will be invented, and we can be certain of that.  I can almost see where that is coming from already.</P>
        <P>I am not trying to enforce action on this initiative, but it is an outstanding issue that we need to deal with.  It has been pointed out to me by all the bodies in their submissions to the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that we should deal with this matter.  I have a view as to whether it should be dealt with by one or more questions, but I will not press my view on it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in his consultations with the various parties can work out a consensus in this regard.  If it is not dealt with in April we will <Col N="1505"/>have to deal with it later.  The House is aware of the ramifications, which mean we cannot put it on the long finger because it will resurface in a range of other forms.  I think we will have no problem in dealing with it before the D&aacute;il ends, but if that cannot be done, so be it.  The House should come to a view on the issue.  I will not proceed in the absence of political agreement.  That would not be wise, but the Government side is ready to proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In my time in the D&aacute;il we have not had a more accessible or conciliatory Taoiseach.  Notwithstanding that, in the ten years, almost, in which Deputy Bertie Ahern has been Taoiseach, any time the Opposition has been invited to come on board, matters have never proved to be what they appeared.  The Taoiseach is wrong to say that last summer the House was coming down.  Last summer the Government was coming down.  Presumably, the House would come down after it.  There is no difficulty on this side of the House about the absolute zone of protection.  To widen that, there is no problem on this side of the House about protecting or asserting the rights of our children. </P>
        <P>Is it not the case that the omnibus referendum now being proposed is quite complex?  Notwithstanding the support I suspect will be forthcoming from all sides of the House for the principle that is being sought to achieve, careful scrutiny and wide public debate and consultation is necessary before we embark on an enterprise as serious as amending our Constitution.  It is very difficult to envisage how that can be allowed for between now and the end of March, given that we have not yet seen legislation.  Presumably the Taoiseach and his Ministers will engage on the habitual flight of the earls around St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and a week will be lost for that.</P>
        <P>As regards consulting the Opposition, notwithstanding the conciliatory streak that runs in that wing of Fianna F&aacute;il; the consultations have been minimalist.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach in particular about the organisations he talked about which he met last June and July.  Is it not the case that this was but a mote in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s eye last June and July?  He needs to discuss with the organisations involved in children&rsquo;s rights and protection the specific amendment the Government now proposes to put forward.  Will he say whether those organisations have been involved in the consultations regarding the wording?</P>
        <P>I read in <i>The Irish Times </i>today that the Irish Council for Civil Liberties believes the proposals now being considered are seriously defective.  Some of the children&rsquo;s organisations believe they fall far short of what it is they thought they were getting.</P>
        <P>Why does the Taoiseach think it is necessary for us to rush this through by the end of March?  Given the broad support from all sides of the <Col N="1506"/>House for the principle involved, we should take the time to ensure that we do it properly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have answered most of those questions, but I do not know what Deputy Rabbitte meant when he said that when I engaged in constitutional issues during the period of my leadership, it was not what it seemed.  When a Government of which he was a part tried to pass its only major proposal, namely the divorce referendum, I brought my whole party behind it to make sure it was passed.  The Deputy knows that it would not have been passed otherwise.  For the Good Friday Agreement, I dealt even-handedly with the Opposition during the negotiations.  The only referendum with which we had problems was one in which the Deputy&rsquo;s own party had a difficulty with a judicial issue, so I dropped that aspect from it.  At every stage in my time as leader, I played it absolutely even-handedly, so Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s comment is unfair.</P>
        <P>I was under considerable pressure last year from a range of organisations to deal with the issue that arose from what happened in early June.  We have attempted to do that, but it is not the end of the world whether we get it finished by March.  If I did not bring it to a stage whereby the whole thing was ready, Deputy Rabbitte and others would say that I did nothing.  Given that the lifetime of this D&aacute;il ends in the summer, I want to complete the work and I will get to a stage where there is broad agreement on this issue inside and outside the House, including among the children&rsquo;s bodies.  There is one children&rsquo;s body that is trying to create difficulties around this, but all of the others have taken a different view.  If it is not possible to get broad political agreement, then we will leave it until later, but if there is agreement, then we can have the referendum.  There is no great difficulty about this.  Religious, medical and social organisations all have an interest in this issue and would like to see it dealt with.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct to state that there will always be difficulties.  I have often been asked why we do not have a referendum for different issues when there is all-party agreement, but I have always answered that there is no such thing as a simple change to the Constitution.  It is certain that somebody will take an opposing view.  People will see problems where none exist, but I suppose it is unfair to suggest that they invent problems.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, has his views but he is open to debate this issue.  That is a fair way to proceed.  If we cannot deal with the issue in March or early April, then the House will have to deal with it in the life of a new D&aacute;il.  I will not say that the parties do not have the time or do not wish to consult for whatever reason.  I will not use the majority in the House to get this through.  I have not done that in the past.  I pulled <Col N="1507"/>a referendum late in the day on another occasion just to accommodate the Labour Party.  We can come to a view with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is available.  The Government and the administrative system will be ready this week to move on.  If it is not possible to do that, we can hold it in abeyance and take it forward on the other side of the general election.  The House will not be able to avoid having to deal with this issue in 2007.  It is needed for many reasons &mdash; I am sure the Deputy has been meeting the various groups, just as I have.  There are many reasons we should not delay it unduly.  I think that is a reasonable approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it true that Fianna F&aacute;il has already placed a printing contract for the referendum?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I answer the question?  That is just nonsense.  Fianna F&aacute;il has placed no printing contract for any referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>No printing contract of any kind has been placed for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>None whatsoever.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Taoiseach tells the House he is serious about having a referendum passed for the good of all children, in particular, is he considering that there could be a need to make some budgetary provision for it?  Additional moneys are needed to address classroom sizes, for example.  A significant number of people are waiting to get into schools in many constituencies.  Is the Taoiseach conscious of the import of the referendum, in so far as it will put an onus on the Government to deliver certain things?  It cannot simply be seen as wishful thinking, in terms of the rights which the referendum will clarify.  Has that been part of the discussions to date?</P>
        <P>I would like to conclude by asking about something that was raised the last time the House considered this question.  I refer to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which the Taoiseach mentioned.  Is it now clear that the implementation of the recommendations of the Kenny report will not require a referendum?  The Taoiseach mentioned in his reply to me the last time we spoke about this matter that the Bill to give effect to those recommendations was being drafted.  Can the Taoiseach give the House a report on the progress that is being made?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1508"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation on that matter is being drafted in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>No further progress has been made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not require a referendum.  The Department is proceeding on the basis of what we set out.  Considerable work was done in the Office of the Attorney General, the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in June, July, August and September.  Following an enormous amount of thought and action, meetings took place about how to take this forward.  A great deal of information was disseminated.  That process was concluded at Government level in October and I announced it at the beginning of November.  In the three months since then, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has been engaged in extensive discussions with an enormous range of organisations.  The Minister of State will be glad to outline the details of that consultation to the House if a Deputy asks him a question about it.  We are trying to make progress on an issue that is seen as extremely important.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Like every issue, this issue has implications.  It may be that what was said in the first place needs to be extended.  When we consider in the cold light of day what needs to be done and how it can best be done, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will be ready and willing to do that on behalf of the Government.  He is already engaging with the political parties in that regard.  If the Government can agree on that and move forward, it is ready to do so.  If we cannot get agreement on the matter, we will not get involved in a row about it.  It will have to be dealt with in due course.  We have acted in very good faith throughout this process with all of the groups &mdash; a substantial number of organisations have been involved.  I refer not only to the children&rsquo;s non-governmental organisations, which have been very active, but also to the other bodies which were calling on us to take action in this area.  They have been supporting our moves and engaging with the Minister of State, as have many other people.  There are right-wing and left-wing views on this issue, as there are on all issues.  We have to understand that.  We will proceed if we can get political agreement.  If we cannot get such agreement, we will be unable to make progress.  I think that is a reasonable position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards a referendum, is the Cabinet considering the possibility of putting more than one question to the electorate to deal with the five propositions before us for consideration?  What is the current thinking on that following today&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting?  Has the Taoiseach considered the point made earlier about having the referendum or referenda on the same day as the general election to enhance the participation of the electorate in the referendum decision process?  An examination of turnout for stand-alone referenda will show that there is greater participation in the poll when the referendum is connected with another electoral process.  Would the general election not be the optimum opportunity to ensure maximum participation in the decision on these very important matters?</P>
        <P>On the Taoiseach&rsquo;s legislative priorities, last week he mentioned his enthusiasm for the establishment of the all-Ireland civic forum.  Is it a requirement that legislation will be introduced by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department or some other Department to establish the civic forum?  If legislation is required, would it not be useful to commence the preparation and publication of that legislation so that it could act as a spur for the establishment of the civic forum?  Does the Taoiseach expect that any further legislation will be required in tandem with or following the re-establishment of the Executive, the Assembly and the all-Ireland Ministerial Council, all of which, I hope, will come into play in the not too distant future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked a number of questions.  With regard to the referendum, there are merits in having more than one question to deal with the five issues; there will probably be two questions.  Subject to consultation, the Government would see merit in doing that again.  We will see what happens in the consultations but we have not ruled it out.  As I said to Deputy Higgins, it is not a good idea to hold the referendum on the same day as the election.  It would <Col N="1510"/>lead to the question Deputy Rabbitte considered it necessary to ask, that is, whether Fianna F&aacute;il sees a political advantage in having a referendum on this issue.  I do not want that to happen; that is not the purpose of the referendum and it is not a good idea.</P>
        <P>I strongly support the civic forum.  It does not require legislative changes.  We have spent the past eight or nine years working on the civic forum concept and engaging with people in many different ways.  It would be a huge advantage to Northern Ireland in the future and for engaging with civic society and various interest groups in the South if we can get it up and running.</P>
        <P>With regard to the final question, I do not believe other legislation is required.  The amending legislation on the Foyle is now resolved.  If other legislation is necessary, we will deal with it but I do not envisage it being required at this stage.  If there is a suggestion otherwise, we will move quickly on it.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach rather conveniently ignored another referendum relating to the rights of the unborn, which was passed but had unforeseen consequences which led to two further referendum proposals.  Surely the Taoiseach recognises the need to ensure proper scrutiny, consultation and consensus when it comes to the rights of the born children?  He has not explained to the House the reason we cannot have that space and time to ensure we have that result and hold the referendum on the same day as the general election.  It does not make sense to say that somehow it would be politically used on the day of a general election but not on any other day.  There is a much better chance of party politics being taken out of the referendum campaign if consensus could be reached, if time was given to it and it was held on the same day as the general election.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s argument against holding it on the same day as the general election does not make much sense to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not conveniently forget any referendum.  I was referring to referendums which have already been held and I tried to get consensus on that issue as well.  The people will make the final decision.  If the Government and the Oireachtas agree on something and put it to the people, we have to accept their decision as the final arbiters.  We should not be upset one way or the other as to their decision.  We should put our case to the people and fight it and see whether they are against it.  If the Deputy is of the strong opinion that we should spend more time and achieve agreement by June at the time of the general election, I am open to that and I will not stand in the way.  If holding the referendum in June is a compromise instead of March or the autumn, I will ask my colleagues to accept <Col N="1511"/>the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion to hold it on the same day as the general election.</P>

        <P>Was this item on the agenda of the Cabinet meeting today and was the format of what will be put to the people agreed by the Cabinet today?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated half an hour ago, it was discussed at the Cabinet meeting today.  The format was put to the Cabinet and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is ready to finalise his discussions with the parties.  There is not much point in me asking the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan to have discussions with the parties and then put forward proposals before that happens.  If there is no progress in those discussions then the Government will issue its proposals.  The Cabinet discussed and agreed the manner in which the Government would wish to proceed if agreement between the parties was achieved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the position that the Cabinet considered this today and agreed the format of the referendum and having agreed it there will be further consultations with the Opposition?  Does this mean that what the Cabinet agreed today may have to be reviewed in light of any view the Opposition or organisations centrally concerned might have?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated early on, the Government has a preference but we would like to get political agreement.  The Government format is based on our current thinking, subject to the deliberations with the other parties.  I emphasise it is open to amendment, based on those considerations.  If it is clear that other parties are unwilling to agree or want a longer period and will not agree to a referendum this side of the election or on the same day as the election &mdash; which seems to be the preference of the Labour Party &mdash; then the Government will put forward its own proposals.  I will not be proceeding to create a division on this issue in the next few months.  Having spent a long time on significant consultation in the past nine months I intend to bring it to finality for the sake of those who have acted in good faith with the Government.  It is really a question of what the parties wish to do.  If agreement can be reached then so be it.</P>
        <P>I do not really care if we have the referendum in April, May or at the same time as the election but I have to say to Deputy McManus that I do not think it would be good to have it on the same day as the general election.  We would do so if everybody said we should but we would get into another sideshow with those opposed to the amendment and either it would not be properly <Col N="1512"/>debated or it would get confused with the general election.  Neither outcome would be particularly good.  If the Deputy were to ask what would be my choice, I would rather not have the referendum on the same day as the general election but if everybody else said it was a good idea, I would not stand in the way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Following on what Deputy Rabbitte said, in the short reflection that we had on the matter this morning we had to consider what was the intent of the Minister of State and the Government.  Did the Cabinet decide and agree on a form of wording this morning?  If so, will the Taoiseach inform the House of it?</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach rightly pointed out, questions are always asked about these matters.  In the event that the Opposition parties are able to reflect on whatever form of wording is decided by the Cabinet and general agreement is reached on the matter, does the Cabinet intend that the legislation dealing with the age of consent would return to the House at a subsequent stage?  Is that the intention from a legislative perspective in the event that the referendum proceeds, taking into account the other constraints outlined?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no ulterior agenda other than to try to be helpful on the matter.  If the Opposition parties prefer that the Government brings forward its full proposals in public, we could do so.  I would prefer if the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, had private consultations with the parties and we awaited their outcome.  Otherwise we might as well make the entire proposals public and say this is the Government&rsquo;s view and that we will listen to comments.  I do not think we would gain time or secure proper agreement and consultation if we did that.  It would not work.  People should engage with the Minister of State and see if we can come to an agreement.  If we cannot, I will publish our proposals. </P>

        <Quest> the practical steps she is taking to address the burden of cross-compliance on farmers; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[4056/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Cross-compliance is an integral part <Col N="1514"/>of the direct payment regime following the introduction of the CAP mid-term review changes in 2005.  With the extension of cross-compliance to a number of other scheme areas from this year, including the disadvantaged areas scheme and REPS, the delivery of annual payments to farmers of the order of &euro;1.9 billion is now covered by the requirements of cross-compliance.  This involves two key elements. First, a requirement for farmers to comply with 18 statutory management requirements, SMRs, set down in EU legislation on the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health.  Second, a requirement to maintain the farm in good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC.</P>
        <P>The rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance is 1% of those farmers to whom the statutory management requirements or GAEC apply.  However, at least 5% of producers must be inspected under the bovine animal identification and registration requirements, as this level is prescribed under the new regulations.</P>
        <P>My Department has published two information booklets on cross-compliance, which were issued to all farmers in early 2005 and also in August 2006.  These guides have detailed the cross-compliance requirements under various EU regulations, as well as giving information on inspection controls on farms.  Information on cross-compliance was also provided by my Department at various single payment scheme meetings with farmers.</P>
        <P>In consultation with farming organisations in the context of the charter of rights for farmers, my Department has adopted a weighting system within the cross-compliance inspection regime whereby due account is taken of infringements of the cross-compliance requirements which are, on their own, inadvertent and minor in nature, do not result from negligence of the farmer and are capable of occurring in practical farming situations.  In such circumstances, a certain level of tolerance is applied while, at the same time, the farmer is notified of the infringement.  The system that has been developed also ensures that any penalties are applied in a standardised fashion throughout the country.  It should be noted that while 1,389 farmers were subject to cross-compliance penalties under the 2006 single payment scheme, a further 977 farmers, while technically in breach of the requirements, did not suffer any penalty because of the tolerance regime applied by my Department.  Breaches of cross-compliance in 2006 resulted in some &euro;706,000 being withheld from farmers by way of penalties representing 0.05% of Ireland&rsquo;s national ceiling of &euro;1.3 billion.</P>
        <P>The vast bulk of penalties applied were for breaches of rules on the identification and registration of bovine animals &mdash; for example, tagging and registration of births, movements and deaths.</P><Col N="1515"/>
        <P>Further consultations will now take place with the farming organisations on arrangements for inspections under the new SMRs that have come on stream for 2007.  I am committed to ensuring the maximum level of integration of inspections across all areas, including inspections under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  On this basis, the overall number of annual inspections under the single payment scheme and the disadvantaged areas scheme is unlikely to exceed 8,000.  This is a significant reduction from the 18,000 inspections annually under the old coupled regime.</P>
        <P>The policy of my Department towards on-farm inspections has been to give advance notification of up to 48 hours.  However, this was unacceptable to the European Commission and my Department was obliged to perform a number of inspections without prior notification in 2006.  The vast bulk of inspections &mdash; some 92% of the total farms selected for single payment scheme/ disadvantaged areas scheme inspection in 2006 &mdash; were all pre-notified to the farmer.</P>
     
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>EU regulations governing the single payment scheme would allow my Department to give pre-notification of inspection in all cases where certain elements of cross-compliance are involved, for example, the nitrates regulations.  However, my Department is committed, in the Charter of Rights for Farmers 2005-07, to carrying out all single payment scheme and disadvantaged area scheme checks during one single farm visit in most cases.  This obliges my Department to respect the advance notice requirements applicable to the most stringent element of the inspection regime, namely, a maximum of 48 hours notice but with no advance notice in a proportion of cases.</P>
        <P>My Department is in regular contact with the European Commission with a view to simplification of single payment scheme requirements with particular reference to  advance notice of inspections and tolerances.  The Commission&rsquo;s initiative on simplification of the CAP and the review of cross-compliance which is under way provides the opportunity for a fresh look at cross-compliance and other single payment scheme issues.  I am pressing for this, both in direct contact with Commissioner Fischer Boel and the President of the Council, Minister Seehofer.  I raised the matter at the Council on Monday of last week where several member states had similar problems to ours.  It is not surprising then that simplification of the CAP and the cross-compliance regime in particular are core issues for the current German EU Presidency.</P>
 </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Many farmers are currently living in fear of cross-compliance inspections.  As a <Col N="1516"/>result, some farmers are literally packing it in and reducing numbers.  I will give the Minister an example.  This morning, I met with farmers on the Offaly-Westmeath border.  They told me that when 70 farmers recently held a meeting about the development of an airport in County Offaly, there was only one objector.  Five years ago, some 90% of farmers would have objected to such a development but the situation has changed because farmers want to get out of farming.  The Minister will be going to Brussels to try to overturn what she and her predecessor agreed at EU level.  Commissioner Fischer Boel has been quoted extensively as saying there is no justification for no-notice inspections.  Is it not the case that her German counterpart automatically gives notice to all farmers and that where standards of milk production meet basic quality requirements, no dairy inspections take place?  The reality is that we have a different set of rules here than that proposed by the Commission or that being implemented in other countries.  On that basis, will the Minister review the lack of notification with regard to inspections?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>To have people like the Deputy raising harum-scarum ideas can instill fear in farmers.  Since I was first appointed, I have implored the former Commissioner, Commissioner Fischler, and Commissioner Fischer Boel that we should have pre-notification.  The impression given by the media did not reflect what the Commissioner said in Germany.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, discussed the issue with her at Green Week, and I followed on from that meeting last Monday week at European Council level.</P>
        <P>The view among all of our colleagues is that the issue of cross-compliance needs to be simplified, which is what the President would like to achieve before the end of his term &mdash; I met him last year to discuss this.  I will be vociferous in putting forward a number of issues within the cross-compliance sector that I would like to see addressed.  The Commissioner has indicated she will bring forward proposals in March to take on board a number of the concerns expressed by all member states.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that Ireland was the first country, on the basis of decoupling, to feel the factors arising from cross-compliance, but these are now being experienced in other member states.  It is on that basis that we can gather greater momentum.  However, it is incorrect to suggest we are trying to change what we agreed.  Rather, we are trying to refine the system and I assure farmers my goal is to ensure there is pre-<Col N="1517"/>notification of inspections.  There are a number of other issues within the cross-compliance criteria that I would like raised and addressed in the context of what the Commissioner will put forward in March and the health check of 2008.</P>

	<P>The Minister promised to issue all farmers with a copy of the checklist the Department of Agriculture and Food will use.  It was not issued for the 2006 inspections.  When will it be issued to farmers?  If a person brings a car for an NCT, it is known what conditions and checks are required before the vehicle is brought in.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister ensure that when an inspector carries out an on-farm inspection, the farmer gets a copy of the report on the day and does not have to wait for it?  When will farmers get clear and unambiguous information with regard to the requirements under cross-compliance?  A number of public meetings have taken place where representatives of the Department and of Teagasc have contradicted each other.  There is serious confusion among the Department&rsquo;s inspectors with regard to the interpretation of the rules and regulations under cross-compliance.  How are farmers supposed to understand the rules and regulations when the officials cannot decipher them?</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2002 the Department&rsquo;s consumer liaison panel highlighted consumer concerns about food labelling.  Subsequently, the food labelling group was established in July 2002 to examine the matter and to come forward with recommendations by the end of the year.  The group, which was widely representative of the major stakeholders in the food chain, such as consumer interests, industry, Departments and agencies, presented its report to the Department in December 2002.  An interdepartmental and agency committee to progress the recommendations contained in the report was established in April 2003 and met on five occasions.  At its final meeting on 3 February 2004, the committee agreed that there was no need for further meetings of that committee as substantial progress had been made on the implementation of the food labelling group&rsquo;s recommendations and the remaining matters were being pursued by the appropriate agencies. </P>
        <P>As regards the recommendations of the group, the position is that all recommendations except two have been fully addressed.  The outstanding issues related to labelling of origin at certain outlets and the definition of substantial transformation.  As regards the former, all beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector is now <Col N="1519"/>required by law to carry an indication of country of origin.</P>
        <P>The primary legislation enacted by the Oireachtas last year, under which our beef labelling requirements on country of origin were extended to the catering sector, also allows for the extension of country of origin labelling to other meats.  However, because different origin labelling requirements apply to other meats in the retail sector under current EU legislation, and different systems of traceability are in operation, coupled with some import-export complexities, the situation is not as straightforward as it is for beef.  The European Commission has opposed member states introducing legislation in this area that is in excess of common EU requirements.  Nonetheless, my Department has been involved in consultations with the Department of Health and Children on draft new regulations to require operators in the retail and catering sectors to provide country of origin information on poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat.  It is intended to submit these regulations, when they are finalised, to the European Commission for approval, as required by EU legislation.</P>
        <P>Of course, the preferred way forward is that the Commission would progress the question of country of origin labelling of all meat at EU level.  The Minister has been in regular contact with the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection on this subject and also raised the issue in the Agriculture Council, and she will continue to take every opportunity to press for progress on this matter.  The Minister has also used the opportunity provided by bilateral meetings with EU ministerial colleagues to seek their support for EU action on country of origin labelling and so far has been encouraged by their response.</P>
        <P>Last year the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate of the European Commission undertook a consultative process on a wide range of issues in this area, under a document entitled &ldquo;Labelling: Competitiveness, Consumer Information and Better Regulation for the EU&rdquo;.  I arranged for the Department to make a submission on food labelling and country of origin labelling of meat through the Department of Health and Children, which co-ordinated the Irish contribution to this process.  This confirmed our strong preference for origin labelling of meat and meat products, and the desirability of there being common EU-wide legislation to support a labelling regime.  I also ensured that the second outstanding issue, namely, the definition of substantial transformation, was raised in the submission to the Commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for that detailed response, which has answered many of the questions in my original queries and some <Col N="1520"/>I had asked previously.  I am somewhat concerned that when we raise issues such as traffic light food labelling, this kind of question is kicked back to the Department of Health and Children although the Minister for Agriculture and Food has commented on it.  I am concerned about the interaction between the Departments.  Will the Minister&rsquo;s consumer liaison panel examine the traffic light issue as a specific aspect of food labelling, one that is relevant to the Department of Agriculture and Food as well as the Department of Health and Children?  It has been passed back and forth.  I know the Minister does not fully agree with my views or those of Deputy Naughten in this regard but I would like to hear the views of the consumer liaison panel.  As the panel comes under the banner of the Department of Agriculture and Food, it might be appropriate for it to examine this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The dairy industry in my part of the country would not be enamoured of the idea of traffic light labelling &mdash; I heard this directly from industry members, particularly with regard to cheese and other dairy products.  As issues arise they are considered by the different agencies working in this area.  Very quick action was taken following the consumer liaison panel&rsquo;s highlighting of consumer concerns on the issue and subsequently the food labelling group and an interdepartmental agency implementation group were established.  All except two of the 21 recommendations made by the food labelling group have been implemented.  We want to see additional progress on food labelling and this is an issue we highlight consistently at European Union level.  I have outlined our preferred method of dealing with the matter.  With regard to traffic light labelling, the recommended daily allowance is another suggestion put forward as a method suitable for labelling.</P>
        <P>We are determined to make progress within the European Union on this issue.  The directorate dealing with health and consumer protection has held a consultation process on the issue to which we submitted a strong submission through the Department of Health and Children.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, can verify that we have received more positive responses from Ministers of the other member states than we would have got some time ago with regard to the need for the European Union to have better systems of food labelling.</P>
        <P>We are determined to make progress on the issue.  While some progress has been made, we are determined to make further progress on issues such as substantial transformation and country of origin.  There are serious obstacles, but the preferred route is to get European Union-wide recognition of the need for country of origin labelling.</P>

        <Quest> if she will make a statement on the recent statement by the European Commission that Greencore is only entitled to full compensation on the basis it has fulfilled all its obligations to its former workers. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the relevant EU regulations, the restructuring aid for the sugar industry has to be drawn down on the basis of an aid application submitted by the sugar processor.  The applications must contain a restructuring plan, including a social plan detailing the actions planned in particular with respect to re-training, redeployment and early retirement of the workforce concerned.  In July 2006, Greencore duly submitted such an application, which indicated that the proposed redundancy payments for the Mallow workers were in accordance with the ruling of the Labour Court.  I am aware there is an ongoing dispute between the company and the workers over the interpretation of the Labour Court recommendation and while I regret the parties have not yet resolved their differences, I have no function in that regard.  The position regarding that dispute was fully explained by my colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Killeen, in reply to a parliamentary question last Wednesday.</P>
        <P>The aid application submitted by Greencore was approved in September subject to the outcome of the judicial review proceedings instituted by Greencore in respect of the Government decisions regarding the allocation of the aid.  In view of these legal proceedings, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  Is the Minister aware that a reply to a question by Mary Lou McDonald, MEP, to the European Commission two weeks ago stated that compensation for the closure of the sugar plants at Mallow and Carlow would only be paid once all the members and actions defined in the restructuring plan had been implemented by the undertaking and verified by the member state?  The reply further stated that this system enables the member state to ensure that all obligations linked to the restructuring plan, such as redundancy arrangements for the workers, are met.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept, given that Greencore has refused to honour its original agreement with the Mallow workers, it is not entitled to draw down the full amount awarded to it, particularly in light of the fact that the &euro;4.4 million owed to the workers pales in comparison to the &euro;146 million awarded to Greencore in compensation?  Does the Minister also agree that in refusing to comply with an order of the Labour Court, Greencore has, in effect, admitted it is in the wrong?  Has the Government not an obligation, <Col N="1522"/>as holder of the public share in the company, to ensure Greencore does not receive one cent of compensation until such time as it has honoured its original commitment to the workers and has lived up to all the outstanding commitments to the workers in both factories?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I must take into consideration that judicial proceedings are in progress on this issue.  I am aware of the situation.  I have met the workers twice and know the unions have met Klaus-Dieter Borchardt the Deputy Chef de Cabinet of Ms Fischer Boel who has outlined a response similar to that provided to Mary Lou McDonald, MEP.  The Commission&rsquo;s position explains the relevant provisions of the EU regulations which accords with the Department&rsquo;s understanding of the regulations.</P>
        <P>Deputy Ferris mentioned the Labour Court.  While not a statutory matter, we would all like to ensure that all companies with the financial wherewithal to abide by Labour Court proceedings and decisions would do so.  However, as has been said, the company has decided it is not prepared to alter its existing redundancy provisions.  Similarly, the trade union has not changed its position and is not prepared to accept the company&rsquo;s offer.  We would like to bring this matter to a finality.  To reiterate, the services of the Labour Court remain at the disposal of the parties if they wish to return to get clarity on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  The Minister is aware there was a disagreement between the union and Greencore with regard to the interpretation of the Labour Court decision.  This was subsequently clarified by the Labour Court.  However, because the clarification did not suit it, Greencore has effectively ignored it.  Not alone that, the Minister is part of a Government that retains a public share in the company and has allowed this to happen.  The Labour Court is there for a purpose, but its adjudication has been totally ignored which is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The golden share has nothing to do with the issue.  It only refers to permission to be given by the State in the disposal of the sugar assets and has nothing to do with the day to day workings of Greencore or anything arising from the EU restructuring scheme.  Therefore, I cannot interfere, particularly when a judicial review is in the offing.  We would love to bring clarity to the matter and bring it to finality, particularly for the workers.  The Labour Court is at the disposal of both parties and willing to facilitate an outcome.  I regret there is a dispute between the parties.  All I can do is reiterate my call for the matter to be brought to finality and for clarity from both sides as to the best outcome.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest> the number of farmers who have not been paid their single farm payment in each of the years 2005 and 2006 due to difficulties over inheritance issues or partnerships; her views on whether young farmers should be given all the support necessary and payments made a priority; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[4082/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The position in so far as payment under the 2005 single payment scheme is concerned is that some &euro;1.199 billion has been paid to over 128,200 applicants, 99.9% of total eligible applicants, including &euro;14.3 million in refunding the modulation reduction on the first &euro;5,000 paid to each applicant.</P>
        <P>There are a small number of cases which have not yet been paid.  In some instances, the Department is awaiting legal documentation in the cases involving inheritance applications.  There are other cases where farmers submitted 2005 single payment application forms but never submitted an application for the transfer of the single payment entitlements to them.  The Department is arranging to make direct contact with the persons involved requesting them to submit the transfer application form immediately.  The number of cases involved at this stage is extremely small but it is the Department&rsquo;s intention to pursue all of these cases in order that the farmers involved have an opportunity to apply for the transfer of entitlements.</P>
        <P>The Department will process these applications as soon as they are received.  If they are in order, the entitlements will be transferred to the 2005 single payment scheme applicant and payment for both 2005 and 2006 will be issued.  Under the 2006 single payment scheme, &euro;1.197 billion has been paid to 123,300 applicants.  Full payment has been issued to 122,200 farmers, while a further 1,100 farmers have received the 50% advance <Col N="1524"/>payment.  Farmers paid by the Department to date under the 2006 scheme account for almost 97% of all applicants.  Any cases remaining to be paid are generally under query for one reason or another.  The timely issue of payments to all farmers, including young farmers, is a priority for the Department.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the single payment scheme in 2005 brought the new concept of payment entitlements into the direct payments system.  Payment entitlements are not attached to land but are the property of the farmer active during the reference period and in receipt of direct payments under one or more of the livestock premium and arable aid schemes.</P>
        <P>Payment entitlements may now be sold with or without land, but can only be sold without land once 80% has been used in one calendar year.  On the other hand, entitlements may be leased to another farmer only if accompanied by an equivalent number of hectares of eligible land.  Entitlements may also, of course, be transferred, with or without land, by gift or through inheritance.  The registration details of entitlements may also be changed, for example, from one name to joint names or to partnerships.</P>
        <P>It is incumbent on the Department to maintain a database of entitlements containing the name and herd number under which entitlements are registered with a view to ensuring that payment be issued to the correct holders of the entitlements for any year.  When entitlements are transferred from one farmer to another or when the registration details of the herd number are changed, the parties must complete an application to have the registration details of the entitlements changed.</P>
      
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>The application forms to be completed by farmers engaged in transferring or changing the registration details of entitlements are available through the Department&rsquo;s website and local offices, as well as at Teagasc offices.</P>
        <P>The closing date for receipt of applications to transfer entitlements for 2006 was 16 May 2006.  However, where an entire holding and entitlements are being transferred within the ten-month period, such applications may be accepted at any time during the ten months.  Some 6,000 applications have been received in the Department to transfer entitlements for the 2006 single payment scheme.  Approximately 2,300 of those applications were received after the closing date and many have been received only in the past couple of months.  Those late applications are, nevertheless, being processed.</P>
        <P>The Department is making every effort to have all those applications processed as quickly as possible.  Applications for the sale of entitlements with land, the lease of entitlements, the transfer <Col N="1525"/>of entitlements by gift or inheritance, or the transfer of entitlements to partnerships must be accompanied by appropriate documentation such as a copy of the deed of transfer or lease agreement.  In over 50% of cases, the required documentation was not furnished with the original applications, thus necessitating further contact with the parties involved.</P>

	<P>Some things are useful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  I have a certain anxiety for what may be a small number of farmers, although I have still not found out how many are owed moneys under the 2005 or 2006 schemes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure for 2005 is approximately 100.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I simply ask how many have not been paid.  I have serious anxieties regarding those young people encouraged by their parents, uncles or aunts to stay in farming through being granted use of the land by deed, transfer or partnership.  There seems to have been a dreadful breakdown in the operation of the scheme.  In one recent case, a Teagasc adviser had never heard of the forms that had to be filled in and had to have them sent to him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>Teagasc&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a Teagasc adviser rather than an ordinary farmer.  Farmers are not getting a sympathetic hearing regarding such issues; they are not being heard at all.  They have been told to send in material, but no matter how they try to communicate with the relevant personnel, they do not receive the required answers.  The important fact is that they are certainly not getting the money.  For young farmers, money is the No. 1 issue and in many cases it is their total profit.  I appreciate the Minister of State giving me all that information, but I want to know how and when those young farmers caught in transfer mode will be paid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>For 2005, approximately 100 cases remain outstanding, 99.9% of applicants already having received their entitlements.  In those 100 cases, we await documentation.  It is important to state that every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, but when it comes to transfer, they must be accompanied by the appropriate documentation, <Col N="1526"/>such as the copy of the deed of transfer or the lease agreement.  In over 50% of cases, the required documentation was not furnished with the original application, thus necessitating further contact with the parties involved.  In fairness, departmental officials are following people up to assist them in collating the documentation.</P>
        <P>The closing date for 2006 was 16 May, but we received applications right up to Christmas.  We were very flexible with the date and certain of those of whom the Deputy has spoken may have applied to us quite late as a result.  Some 6,000 people applied for transfers in 2006, but 2,300 of them did so after the closing date, many of them in the weeks before Christmas.  The application forms are not only available on the website but in our local offices and the Teagasc offices.  If there is a Teagasc adviser who does not know that the forms are in its offices, perhaps we should be told about that.</P>
        <P>If the Deputy wishes to raise particular cases, we will be delighted to help as we wish to assist such people.  From the Department&rsquo;s perspective, it has been a great success story, with 99.9% of people paid for 2005.  Despite all I have said to the Deputy regarding 2006, 97% of applicants have received their payments.  It has been a great success and if there is an isolated case with which the Deputy would like us to assist, we would appreciate his informing us.</P>

        <P>There are people in grave difficulty and I wrote to the Minister directly before Christmas regarding at least two individuals in dire straits.  It is not funny.  While it may be gratifying to emphasise that 99.9% of people have been paid, if the Minister of State were among a small number of Deputies not to have received last year&rsquo;s salary, she would not be happy either.  I would like to have elicited the figures for 2006.  Will the Minister consider making personnel available in such difficult circumstances to deal with matters?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>There are only 100 cases outstanding.</P>

	<P>There are only 100 for 2005, although we do not know how many there are for 2006.  If we are sincere about young farmers, we should try to give them all the help we can rather than hindering them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1527"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2006, 1,100 farmers received the 50% advance payment, although their cases are currently being queried, which is why they have not yet received the balance.  In some cases, consolidation or stacking may have been involved and we just need the documentation.</P>
        <P>If those about whom the Deputy is concerned have their documentation in order, they should furnish it.  Some people have been genuinely delayed owing to inheritance issues and questions being dealt with by their solicitors such as family settlements.  We must have the documentation, but we are absolutely sincere in saying to the Deputy that our doing so well regarding the payments has been a great success in European terms.</P>
        <P>We strongly desire to reach the stage where we have dealt with 100% of payments and will be thrilled to assist farmers.  We want to give them the money rather than hold on to it, but at the same time we must have documents such as the copy of the deed of transfer and the lease agreement.  I hope the Deputy understands that with 50% of the necessary documentation absent and officials chasing it, we are doing our best and working very hard to ensure that we pay out.  If we get the documentation from the farmers, particularly the small group outstanding for 2005, we will deal with their applications immediately.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest> when compensation will be issued to sugar beet producers; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[3556/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The compensation package negotiated in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime is worth in excess of &euro;310 million to Ireland.  It is comprised of three elements.</P>
        <P>The first is the sugar beet compensation which has been incorporated into the single payment scheme with effect from 2006.  It will be worth approximately &euro;123 million to Irish beet growers over seven years.  The second element is the EU restructuring aid for the sugar industry, which in Ireland&rsquo;s case is worth approximately &euro;145 million.  In accordance with EU regulations, the Government made certain decisions last July regarding the implementation of the restructuring aid, in particular the percentage to be reserved for beet growers and contractors.  These decisions <Col N="1528"/>are now the subject of judicial review proceedings instituted by Greencore in the High Court.  Under the EU regulations, the first instalment of aid would fall to be paid in June 2007.  In view of the legal proceedings, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</P>
        <P>The third element of the compensation package is the diversification aid, also provided for in Council Regulation (EC) 320/2006, worth almost &euro;44 million in Ireland&rsquo;s case.  A national restructuring programme has been prepared and submitted to the EU Commission, in accordance with the EU regulations, with a view to drawing down the diversification aid.  The regulations provide that payment of this aid would commence in September 2007.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>In reality, farmers are getting only approximately a quarter of the available compensation, a far cry from the 60% to 40% split from the sugar beet crop return.  Every farmer in Europe, whether he or she produces beet, gets the single farm payment, so that does not form part of the compensation package.</P>
        <P>The restructuring fund falls due in June, but does the legal action currently being taken threaten that due date?  Could it be the case, depending on how long the legal proceedings are ongoing, that the due date may occur later?  Perhaps the Minister could clarify the matter.</P>
        <P>Is the diversification fund separate from the legal action taking place, and will it definitely be paid in September, subject to the European Commission being satisfied with the proposals put forward?  With regard to tax implications, the Minister for Finance has stated that more than 80% of the compensation package is liable to tax.  Has the Minister discussed the matter with the Minister for Finance, as it would have major implications for farmers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the judicial review and restructuring aid, the case is due to be heard on 1 May, and we all hope it can be finalised soon so we can proceed with the June date.  We will have to await the outcome.  The diversification aid of &euro;44 million is separate from the disputed amount.  The matter of tax implications is currently being assessed by the Department of Finance and I have held initial discussions with its Minister.  We await the examination of the proposals forwarded by my Department for further discussion.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the single farm payment and compensation, although people receive the single farm payment, they receive a differential in the single payment on the basis of compensation for the reduction in the price of sugar.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that, but everybody involved in the beet industry in the past receives that single farm payment.  Discussions have been <Col N="1529"/>ongoing with Greencore and the Government has its golden share with regard to the disposal of assets.  Will the Government put forward the case that at the time the property was disposed of to Greencore, it was undervalued because of the impact of the golden share?  It is now an extremely valuable asset, which should be part of the case being put by the Government.</P>
        <P>As a result of this issue, the growers and contractors were hard done by in only getting a quarter of the available compensation, when such a very valuable land bank was being made available to Greencore at a knock-down price.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to reiterate that the Government made a decision on the basis of an independent report by Indecon, which took into consideration all aspects of the EU regime.  On the basis of that independent expert appointed by the Government, it was decided to reserve 32.38%, which was &euro;47.1 million, for growers and contractors.  This sum was made up of &euro;40 million for growers and &euro;7.1 million for machine contractors, relating to loss of specialised machinery.</P>
        <P>It is on the basis of this decision we are now being challenged, and it is completely inappropriate for me to make any statement on the matter.  Although the Deputies on the Opposition side may smile, I am very aware of the implications of making any statement that could compromise the impartiality or independence of the decision made by the Government, even in the confines of the House.  Although anyone would regret the dispute, that is the democracy in which we live.  People are entitled to express their view and I hope the matters arising from the judicial review proceedings will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001 designates certain bovine tissues as specified risk material, SRM, and lays down rules for its removal as a public health protection measure in the context of BSE controls.</P>
        <P>In its opinion of 28 April 2005, the European Food Safety Authority concluded that a scientific basis existed to review the age limit for the removal of certain SRM in bovine animals, in <Col N="1530"/>particular as regards the vertebral column.  In July 2005 the EU Commission adopted a reflection paper, the TSE, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, roadmap, looking at the next steps that could be taken with regard to BSE in the short, medium and long term.</P>
        <P>After consultation with member states and stakeholders, Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1974/2005 was adopted in December 2005.  This regulation provided that the age limit for removing vertebral column, including dorsal root ganglia of bovine animals as SRM, could be increased from 12 to 24 months.  Provision is also made for further review of the age limit, which would have to be on the basis of scientific advice.</P>
        <P>The requirement for authorisation of retail establishments such as butchers for the specific activity of handling and removing SRM is prescribed in European and national regulations.  The environmental health officers service of the Health Service Executive, under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, implements these regulations in retail butchers shops.  Butchers are required either to declare non-handling of SRM or to comply with the standards for authorisation for handling of SRM.  Authorisation ensures that this material is removed and disposed of in a manner that protects consumers.  Butchers seeking authorisation need to demonstrate the presence of systems to ensure adequate identification, separation, removal, storage and disposal of SRM.</P>
        <P>Retail butchers who choose not to handle SRM can handle all beef from animals under 24 months.  In addition, unauthorised retail butchers can handle beef from animals over 24 months if it has been boned out or has its vertebral column removed prior to intake.  The handling of SRM at retail level has been identified as a priority area for protection of consumers.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has consulted the trade on the approach to implementing these regulations and it has published an extensive set of frequently asked questions to assist the trade in understanding these requirements.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission has indicated that an opinion is awaited from the European Food Safety Authority that will determine whether an increase in the age limit for the removal of vertebral column as SRM, from 24 months to 30 months, can be considered.  However, it may still take some time for the European Food Safety Authority to reach a definitive conclusion on this matter.</P>
        <P>Any provision for a change in the age limit for the removal of vertebral column would have to be on the basis of a proposal from the European Commission and approved within the framework of the standing committee on animal health and the food chain.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  The Minister of State will be aware that many family butchers are under significant financial pressures currently, and many are going out of business.  The loss of that sector of the market would be bad from a farmer&rsquo;s point of view as it provides some kind of competition to the big meat plants.  It also gives variety to the consumer, which is critically important.</P>
        <P>Scientific advice is currently that animals under 30 months do not need to be tested and there is no risk associated with BSE for animals under that age.  Why is there a 24-month rule when a 30-month rule is already in place that considers the matter from a scientific basis?</P>
        <P>When will the European Food Safety Authority make a decision on the issue?  The difficulty is that with beef up to 24 months, the bone to meat ratio is quite high.  As a result, there are significant additional costs on butchers boning out animals themselves or having to pay a meat plant or abattoir up to &euro;500 for every four animals boned out.  As this is putting considerable financial pressure on the butchers, will the Minister of State indicate a timetable on the matter?</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Naughten raised a number of important points.  All of us were delighted to see some new butcher establishments open and we know the great service those traditional butchers continue to give.  We want them to be in as competitive a position as possible in the supply of meat and other products.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>At political level, through the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and at senior chief veterinary officer level at the Standing Committee on Animal Health and the Food Chain, Ireland has argued strongly for an increase in the time limits.  We have argued this consistently and strongly for some time.  The matter has been raised by the Minister and by me with the Commissioner.  It has been raised at Council of Ministers&rsquo; meeting level and it has also been argued vigorously by the chief veterinary officer.  The position is that we will continue to pursue that issue.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>We have not been given an indicative timeframe for when the European Food Safety Authority is likely to issue a further recommendation, but it is an issue that we have consistently kept on the agenda of the Standing Committee on Animal Health and the Food Chain and of the Council of Ministers.  We realise the issues involved on which we need to make progress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Has any progress been made on the other section, that 30 months is still being held as the time by which animals must be tested?  It is clear that at least 36 months would be realistic and would make a considerable difference to the cattle trade.  This change would have implications right down the line.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1532"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Crawford probably will be aware that a negative conclusion was reached in the European Parliament.  The proposal now is that the Commission would give each member state the competence to make the decision itself.  Unfortunately, that will not happen tomorrow either.  It is also an important issue on which there has been some progress.  We want to see further progress, as the Deputy rightly pointed out.</P>
        <P>One important aspect of the specified risk material regarding BSE which would be welcomed by all sides of the House is that while the number of cases in 2002 stood at 333, that figure had reduced to 41 by 2006.  We hope to see even further progress on such incidences this year.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food,</askee>
        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 377 of 27 June 2006 regarding equine infectious anemia, if she will furnish a response to the issues raised; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[3585/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s question of 27 June 2006 continues to be the subject of a thorough and comprehensive investigation by our Department, as part of which officials have travelled overseas to consult with international colleagues.</P>
        <P>An extensive amount of information has been gathered as part of the investigation which is currently being assessed.  It is not possible at this stage to state when the investigation will be concluded other than to say that it remains our position that if sufficient evidence is gathered to support a prosecution, we will seek to have the case prosecuted through the courts.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, in view of the circumstances, that it would be entirely inappropriate for us to comment any further on the progress of the investigation.</P>
        <P>As regards the disease, the position is that since the initial case was confirmed in June 2006, the Department has taken very significant steps to contain the outbreak and progress its eradication and to protect the valuable Irish bloodstock industry.</P>
        <P>To date, 28 cases have been confirmed, the most recent on 10 December 2006 &mdash; over eight weeks ago.  This is, by some considerable distance, the longest interval between any two previous cases and, with over 14,000 blood samples having been tested last month, gives increasing confidence that the outbreak has been contained and we are well on the way to its eradication.  Monitoring is continuing and the Department is currently following up a suspect case where there is an inconclusive test result.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her response.  I am concerned that seven months <Col N="1533"/>after the initial outbreak was reported, the Department is still investigating it.  We all know what is circulating on the rumour machine.  It is critically important if prosecutions are to be taken that action is swift and the necessary evidence is garnered as quickly as possible.  This particular incident had the potential to decimate the industry in this country.  I acknowledge that the Department is doing everything in its power to fully investigate it, but it is critically important that its action is seen to be swift.</P>
        <P>Second, will the Minister of State outline the steps being taken to support owners of animals which have been inadvertently infected by swamp fever?  There are a number of cases of which she will be aware.  What measures, such as financial supports and scientific and veterinary expertise, are being provided to the owners?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department is continuing to progress the investigation into the circumstances in which the disease was first introduced to the country.  The investigation is a comprehensive one and the Department will, in the event of sufficient evidence being established, endeavour to pursue a prosecution.  Due to the nature of the investigation, the Department is not in a position to comment further on its progress at this stage.</P>
        <P>On Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s second question, the Department is paying for the testing.  There has been a comprehensive surveillance programme, the cost of which was largely borne by the Department.  Separately, the Department provides a financial contribution for each visit by a vet to take blood samples from horses, subject to movement restrictions, and also covers the cost to the Irish Equine Centre of analysing the samples.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>As this is clearly of such significance to the horse industry, are there any changes in the protocol, quality control and quality assurance procedures arising that should be applied to the importing of other batches of that product and similar biological products?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The Veterinary Council is dealing with that and has introduced new protocols.  The Department has given advice to horse owners and in view of the veterinary association involvement in this matter, the Department is reiterating the advice consistently given over the past five months that veterinary practitioners should at all times observe the highest standards of hygiene and should ensure that in all circumstances contaminated veterinary instruments are either appropriately disposed of or thoroughly sterilised before reuse.</P>
        <P>The most recent of the 28 cases was confirmed on 10 December 2006.  That is over eight weeks ago, or 57 days.  Prior to this, the longest period between cases had been 27 days, 25 days and 20 days, respectively.  This period of 57 days since 10 <Col N="1534"/>December last is important and we hope that the outlook is improving.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Department specifically investigating the issue of the 57-day period?  Based on that period and on the history of the disease to date, it would seem that there may be some other reservoir at play.  What is the Department&rsquo;s view in that regard?</P>
        <P>Some of the owners of these animals are small operators who rely solely on the income from them.  They have been left without an income through no fault of their own.  It is not acceptable that the Department, while paying part of the costs of veterinary expenses, should leave these people without an income when this was completely outside their control.  This matter needs to be addressed by the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I stress that the Department has made clear that it does not intend to make any contribution to horse owners in respect of losses claimed to have occurred as a consequence of being restricted.</P>
        <P>On vigilance, testing and the 57-day period of which I spoke, no doubt a great deal of testing has taken place in this area.  There have been 14,000 negative tests in January alone, we have completed the targeted surveillance programme and a further 10,000 samples should be tested by the end of March.  We are increasing confidence in this area and are working with the industry.  We continue to keep the industry updated and we acknowledge the work of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association and the stud masters.  Everyone is working together because of the importance of the industry.</P>
        <P>The lengthening intervals between cases is giving comfort and reassurance that the situation is stable and the outbreak contained, but there is no room for complacency.  Despite the progress made to date there is a need to maintain vigilance and continue testing.  The Department and the industry must continue to work together for the benefit of the Irish bloodstock industry and to ensure the disease is finally eradicated from Ireland with all reasonable steps taken to prevent its introduction.</P>

        <Quest> when the REPS 4 will be open to applicants; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The rural environment protection scheme, REPS, 4 will form part of the new rural development programme for the period 2007 to 2013.  The programme was sent to the European Commission in late December and has to go through its approval process.  We cannot be definite as to how long this process will take but <Col N="1535"/>we continue to pursue early approval.  Our officials are in ongoing contact about it with our counterparts in the Commission services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister give an educated guess as to when this scheme will be in place?  A number of farmers were on the REPS 2 scheme, which lapsed on 31 December, and they cannot apply for a new scheme until REPS 4 becomes available.  Will the Minister extend the REPS 2 scheme as an interim measure, either for six or 12 months, to get over the anomaly that exists?  Farmers who were in REPS 1 and continued into REPS 2 have found themselves in limbo until the new scheme becomes available.  Is it possible to facilitate a continuation of REPS 2 in the interests of good environmental management and to maintain the income those farmers have had up to now?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year we took advantage of the Commission&rsquo;s transitional rules to make special provision for REPS 2 contracts that expired up to 30 November 2006 to be extended for a further year.  This option is no longer available to us because the EU regulations governing REPS 2 and REPS 3 expired on 31 December 2006.  It is now legally impossible to approve or extend contracts under either of those schemes.  Farmers whose REPS 2 contracts are expiring have had two opportunities to transform their undertakings into new five-year contracts in REPS 3.  We are doing our best to make sure REPS 4 will be available for them as early as possible.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the funding they received by the colleague of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food through the national development plan and in the budget, surely a national scheme could be introduced to get over this issue until REPS 4 becomes available.  We are talking about a small number of people but they should not be left high and dry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>It would take far longer to do what the Deputy suggests than engage in the process we are going through at the moment.  There will be a meeting next week.  The Minister has raised the specific issues and we do not anticipate problems regarding REPS 4 &mdash; we are doing all we can to progress it.  Meetings have been undertaken with the Commission on this matter and further meetings are planned. </P>

	<P>In keeping with commitments given in the Agri-Vision 2015 action plan, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, announced in November a beef and sheepmeat processing sector investment package totalling some &euro;50 million.  This grant assistance, which should trigger investment of some &euro;120 million, is yet another clear indication of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the continued development of a modern, competitive, innovative and market-focused food industry.</P>

	<P>The objective of the scheme is to make financial assistance available towards the cost of the construction and acquisition of buildings, new machinery and equipment and, consequently, assist the industry in improving efficiency and competitiveness and, in so doing, not only strengthen primary processing but also underpin agricultural incomes. </P>
        <P>As regards the operation of weighing scales, I would point out that officials of the Department carry out regular inspections of meat plants to ensure that weighing equipment is operating efficiently and that weighing procedures are being correctly carried out in a consistent manner.  In some meat plants, farmers have a clear view of the scales read-out where the plant has installed a special viewing area specifically for this purpose.  In some instances it might not be practical for the meat plant to install a viewing area because of building design.  In such cases it would be a matter for the plant to decide, taking account of hygiene and health and safety concerns, whether a farmer would be permitted access to the scales area during processing of his or her animals.</P>

	<P>Is the Minister of State saying that there is to be a U-turn in February on the <Col N="1537"/>commitment given by the Minister for Agriculture and Food before Christmas or is the Department seriously considering providing viewing facilities for farmers as part of the &euro;50 million meat processing development budget as indicated by the Minister?  The difficulty with weights is the Department of Agriculture and Food cannot legally take a prosecution if there is an anomaly with them.  Is it the case that officials in the Department of Agriculture and Food cannot take a prosecution because, owing to industrial action, officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are not calibrating the scales on a regular basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Since I raised the issue last week of operations being cancelled in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital my office has been inundated with the reflections of people all over the country on other operations being cancelled.  It must be very dispiriting for professionals to work in the health services given the present position.  </P>
        <P>Ten years have passed, &euro;60 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money has been spent on the health service, there have been three Ministers for Health and Children and the Government still does not seem to realise that there is a serious shortage of acute beds in the country.  Last week the Taoiseach said there will always be waiting lists and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, said this is a manufactured crisis, with people in white coats showing concern, and that the Government will not be directed by such a situation.  Last week it was St. James&rsquo;s Hospital that was involved and this week it is the Mater Hospital.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck was first rolled out in 2000 and there was a specific guarantee that six beds in the Mater Hospital would be left aside specifically for <Col N="1539"/>women who required urgent medical attention for cancer and that they would receive intensive treatment from specialists within three weeks.  I understand those six beds are no longer available to women who need urgent medical attention for cancer, which is appalling.  The guarantee of six beds no longer applies because the figures for accident and emergency units are being massaged.  It is all about the trolley count.  It is either a question of saving face or saving lives and in this case it appears the Government is more interested in saving face.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House that the six beds guaranteed to be ring-fenced for women who require urgent medical attention for cancer will be restored forthwith?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy raised two questions but I believe I answered the one on beds last week.  In addition to the HSE&rsquo;s own beds, the number of beds contracted by it this year amounts to approximately 1,300.  Some 360 beds are being made available through the private sector, including 220 in the greater Dublin area, 100 in the south and 40 in the western region.  Another 1,050 have been taken from the other sectors.  The plan of the Minister for Health and Children is to take approximately 1,000 beds out of &ldquo;cohabiting&rdquo; hospitals &mdash; private hospitals.</P>
        <P>Progress is being made on all these issues, as I explained at some length last week.  Deputy Kenny does not want to acknowledge the enormous increase in numbers successfully achieved through the winter initiative in the accident and emergency system.  There has been a huge reduction in respect of the accident and emergency waiting list.  In October, there was a reduction of over 30%, as was the case in November.  In December and January, there were reductions of 50% and 57%, respectively.  The time people have been waiting has reduced dramatically.</P>
        <P>I know about the St. James&rsquo;s Hospital issue and what arose therefrom, as Deputy Kenny probably does also.  I acknowledge the pressures on staff in hospitals at this time of the year and also the work they do.</P>
        <P>We have invested enormously in cancer services.  Many thousands more people have received cancer care.  There have been over 40,000 more inpatient treatments and 55,000 more day care cases.  The waiting lists for cancer treatment of all kinds have dramatically improved in the past decade.  We have over 300 cancer specialist posts and we are building cancer services under the new cancer control strategy of last year, which was welcomed by everybody.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck cancer screening does not represent the emergency cancer process, as Deputy Kenny should know.  BreastCheck is being rolled out nationally.  We are preparing a cervical screening programme, which is due to start later this <Col N="1540"/>year.  There was no screening programme at all until a few years ago.  We are investing in new cancer treatments and we have guaranteed capital funding, including PPP funding, of over &euro;400 million for the radiotherapy network.  The HSE will implement the programme over the coming years; it cannot be done all at once.</P>
        <P>The new linear accelerators are being installed in St. Luke&rsquo;s hospital and new facilities are being built at Beaumont and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals.  Patients are being treated in Limerick, services will be offered in Waterford Hospital, which is linked to the private hospital in Waterford, and there is capacity in Cork and Galway.  Patients in Donegal are being offered treatment in Belfast and there are also arrangements with Galway.  All those services are in operation.  I have no intention of saying during Leaders&rsquo; Questions that if any hospital has a certain number of beds linked to anything, or to consultants, those beds should have a certain configuration.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Facts are one thing, statistics are another and human lives are yet another.  The Taoiseach read out a list of facts and figures.  I said we have spent &euro;60 billion in the past ten years under three Ministers for Health and Children.  The Taoiseach has not addressed the human side of any aspect of this matter, bearing in mind that 40,000 operations have been cancelled and 29,000 people are still on waiting lists.  There seems to be no understanding any more of what is happening by members of the Government.</P>
        <P>In 1997, Fianna F&aacute;il promised the full implementation of the national cancer strategy, including the creation of centres of excellence in Dublin, Cork and Galway and eight regional centres.  Ten years on, the programme is not even half way towards completion.</P>
        <P>In 2001, the Government promised in the national health strategy that programmes for breast and cervical cancer screening would be extended nationally.  Six years later, women, principally, are discriminated against in the provision of the service.  More recently, a report on radiation oncology, produced by the HSE and remarked upon by one of its officials, clearly stated the objectives in this area are unachievable in the timeframe set out.</P>
        <P>The joint report, published in 2001, concludes that critically ill adults and children are routinely denied intensive care services in Ireland.  It states that the cancellation of major surgery and premature discharge are routine and that these practices are known to increase patient mortality.  Nevertheless, in the wake of three Ministers for Health and Children, the Taoiseach tells us things are well.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;NBSP Women&rsquo;s Charter&rdquo;, which deals with emergency cases of women suffering from breast cancer,  lists the following aim: &ldquo;To arrange <Col N="1541"/>for you to be admitted for treatment by specialised trained staff within three weeks of diagnosis&rdquo;.  It is an emergency when a woman finds a lump in her breast only to discover that a guarantee made nationally that six beds would be available in the Mater Hospital is no longer being honoured.  It is all about the trolley count and saving face.  Very little of what the Taoiseach read refers to saving lives.  It is about time that the Government, in its remaining 100 days before it is voted out of office, decided to focus on the real issues that exist rather than having the Minister for Health and Children tell us that the crises are manufactured by professional personnel in white coats who look concerned about the people who are dying.</P>

	<P>As regards the services I accept Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s point that their roll-out in the private sector, as in the Whitfield Clinic and in <Col N="1543"/>Limerick, can be done at enormous speed.  To say at the start of 2007 that they cannot achieve a strategy by 2011 is just not acceptable.  Given the huge resources and the staff they have been given, they should be able to do it by 2009.  I do not accept that and I have said so to the Minister for Health and Children, who in turn has repeated it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Deputy Kenny, we are preparing a cervical screening programme which will start later this year.  It was not the case that we have not got a programme.  There was no programme a few years ago.  As regards the staff involved now, there are 110 new specialist posts in cancer treatment, giving 300 new cancer specialist posts.  There is a cancer control strategy.  It is neither reasonable nor fair to say that in this area we have not put in an enormous amount of resources.  There are cases, such as the one we saw a few weeks ago that was highlighted by RTE, where I accept somebody had not been seen for months.  I have not seen the full facts as regards the case, but that should not happen.  It will be interesting to follow it through, but I have not seen the full details.  However, we put in the screening processes and we are rolling them out.  We have improved services and massively reduced waiting lists.  I am not going to do a bed count as regards the Mater or any other hospital, but we are genuinely and honestly putting the resources in and we shall continue to do that.  It is not all finished.  The final date was 2011, and I accept that.  However, we have improved the services dramatically for diagnostic work, radiotherapy &mdash; which is not fully completed, I admit, but the programme is in place &mdash; and elective work.  Matters have improved dramatically.  I come across people on waiting lists too.  However, services, which were never in place hitherto have been resourced and enhanced around the country. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Let the record show that I meant Helen of Troy.  I was always beguiled by Liz Taylor.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach respond to recent newspaper statements to the effect that estate agents and auctioneers propose to increase their fees by 33% as a result of the apparent slowdown of price acceleration in the housing market?  Specifically <Col N="1544"/>on behalf of the auctioneers, a gentleman called Mr. Fintan McNamara told the <i>Irish Independent</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">During the course of the boom it was very very easy to sell properties.  Agents very often were just facilitators in the sale process.  Now, however, as the market cools, agents are going to have to use their marketing skills and there will be a lot more work involved.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Will the Taoiseach permit a situation where, for example, the cost of the buying and selling process of an average house will rise from &euro;5,250 to &euro;7,000, on top of all the other charges young people have to pay?  I do not recall auctioneers reducing their commissions when prices were going up.  It seems the same amount of selling is involved whether the property is &euro;1 million or is an averaged price house.  Houses went up by 12% and commercial property values rose in double digits.  I do not need to tell the Taoiseach how fraught and harrowing the business of buying a home is.  How is it that his Government, however, will defend and protect the interests of developers and anybody with money but not those of young people who are trying to buy a home?  Why is the Taoiseach not calling in the Competition Authority to deal with this issue?  Why is he not bringing forward the Bill that has been promised for five years, to regulate estate agents and auctioneers who can do and charge what they like?  We have seen the malpractices some of them are engaged in highlighted in recent times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not defend, condone or stand over developers, auctioneers or agents of any type who engage in this.  Regulation of the property services sector, which is vested in the new property regulator services authority, as already outlined in the House in the last session by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will license and regulate management agents, who are often the source of problems as regards service charges and accountability.  We had this debate in the House in the autumn.  Subject to checking, the heads of the Bill were passed before Christmas and the legislation has gone for drafting.  Issues that relate to local authority planning conditions, estates being taken in charge etc. are covered in that legislation.  Changes are to be made in company law to help avoid problems such as failure in any of these areas, including what the legislation was particularly meant to deal with, namely, management companies.  It was also intended to include all the other areas.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has issued guidelines in the last few days as regards the governance of these types of companies which will help control the management of the companies.  The report points to certain measures that should be taken as regards matters such as charges, dealing, agents, contracts and management company structures.</P><Col N="1545"/>
        <P>Perhaps the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement cannot do much about the legal end.  However, to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the heads of the property regulator services authority legislation have been drafted and are designed to deal with the point the Deputy has raised.  There is also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Let us move on to the next hope. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have already got the heads of the Bill in place.  In terms of the matter raised by Deputy Rabbitte, it is the seller who pays the auctioneer, not the buyer.  For once I agree with him that there is no argument whatsoever to be made or any justifiable case for auctioneers to have any increase, having worked on the basis of 30,000 to 35,000 a year, while they are now selling in the range of 94,000 and that figure might drop to 88,000.  There is a process involving the Competition Authority where one can get an auctioneer&rsquo;s licence.  It may be a bit cumbersome, but it must be regulated.  The only way to deal with it is by having more competition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Rabbitte asked me why I would condone this sort of thing.  We are not condoning it.  The heads of the property services regulatory authority Bill went before the Government before Christmas.  This Bill will license and regulate management agents, who are the source of these problems.  That will hopefully help the costs.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill to deal with management companies, which we have raised on these benches so many times, has got absolutely nothing to do with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s friends in the auctioneering business.  A Bill has been promised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for five years to deal with the regulation and licensing of auctioneers.  There is no sign of it and no prospect of it coming before this House.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach saw the excellent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme which exposed the practices that are going on in the industry, such as the practice of inventing bids and ghost bidders which put up the prices.  The Taoiseach will have to point out to me the person who sells a home but who does not have to buy a home.  Where I live, anybody who sells a home must buy a home, so I do not know what point the Taoiseach is making.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>A very eminent Member of the other House wrote an article recently about how to become a member of the auctioneers&rsquo; association.  He is now trading, although I do not know if he is doing any business.  He says that as long as one pays a bond of &euro;12,700 and one does not have a police record, one can start out as an auctioneer.  In his article, he states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Today I can advertise as an auctioneer; I can buy and sell houses for commission; I can advise on guide prices; I can conduct auctions galore; I can gazump until the cows come home.  Best of all, I can take in buckets of money from a gullible public.  I am not subject to the prying inspections of the financial regulator, the Central Bank, any fig-leaf of an auctioneers&rsquo; body &mdash; or anyone else.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the actual situation.  There is no regulation and there is no licensing.  Judging from what the Taoiseach has said, he has no intention of sending the Competition Authority after these guys.  This is a disgrace.  After all the money that has been creamed off in the last 15 years, they are threatening to put up fees by 33% because the price of houses will not rise at the same rate as they have in the last ten years.  It is an outrage and the Government needs to act on it, rather than talking about planning and development conditions, management companies and any other sand the Taoiseach thinks he can throw in the eyes of the public.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I said to Deputy Rabbitte that the heads of the property services regulatory authority Bill were published before Christmas.  The Bill will be responsible for auctioneers, estate agencies and management agencies.  That is precisely the issue that the Deputy raised today.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform set up a working group on the regulation of auctioneers.  I understand that was a public group and the Labour Party made no submission to it.  Under current competition rules, auctioneers are <Col N="1547"/>not allowed to fix fees, so it is not the case that they can do anything, as the eminent Member of the Upper House suggested.  I thought Senator Ross was in another profession, but maybe he is an auctioneer as well.  Auctioneers usually arrange fees in agreement with the public, but under competition rules they are not allowed to fix fees.  If Deputy Rabbitte thinks they are involved in that, they are breaking competition rules.</P>
        <P>It is inevitable that things move up and down as market forces come into play.  If the houses are not being sold, auctioneers will not have the staff.  We have proposed legislation and we have published the heads of a Bill that is responsible for auctioneers and agents.  The working group of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will examine and regulate auctioneers and it is still in operation.  Under competition rules, they are not allowed to fix fees.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Government taking any emergency measures to rescue half of the population of this State from the shocking debacle that the Taoiseach has allowed to develop in the area of private health insurance?  Is there the slightest hint of embarrassment in his Government that the policy of privatisation he has pursued for ten years has, in this particular instance, become a monster that is stalking the health needs of our people, thirsting for the maximisation of profit, threatening further sharp increases in the double tax known as private health insurance and threatening to end the concept of community rating?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children was warned last July that speculators could drive a coach and six through the legislation in this area, that big snouts were lining themselves up at the trough to organise another smash and grab raid for a further three years, and then walk away with the proceeds.  Why was there not an immediate response from the Minister for Health and Children and from the Government?  The Quinn Direct-BUPA Ireland wolf is not just at the door, but in the bed masquerading as a newborn babe.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, is standing by like a bemused Little Red Riding Hood, saying &ldquo;Oh Mr. Quinn, what big teeth you have, what a big appetite for profits, tut tut&rdquo;.  Meanwhile, BUPA has walked away with up to &euro;100 million in profit, <Col N="1548"/>soaked from ordinary people who have been double taxed as they feel they must have private insurance due to the Government&rsquo;s failure to provide a just and equal health service.</P>
        <P>The owners of Quinn Direct may know a lot about mixing concrete but nothing about health care, yet they think they can walk away over the next three years with another &euro;100 million.  A measure of the contempt which they have for the old, the sick and the handicapped can be seen in one of today&rsquo;s newspapers, in which they suggest that some of the VHI clients could be transferred to them.  A few old people can be thrown to them to cover their backs and everything will be all right, as if our elderly patients were sacks of cement to be offloaded from one pick-up truck to another.</P>
        <P>What is the Government&rsquo;s position on this debacle?  Did the Cabinet discuss this issue this morning?  Will we have emergency legislation to curb the greed of these private profiteers who are determined to trash any concept of equality in the health service?  They are parasites because they are thriving on human necessity.  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s position?</P>

We are taking legal advice on how we should handle the position.  We have to consider the employment position and take into account BUPA&rsquo;s 400,000 policyholders.  We have to see the structure that Quinn Direct will have for its new corporate entity.  The Barrington group has been examining the proposals and the case made by a number of insurance companies, including VHI Healthcare.  The Government hopes to complete this process as quickly as it can.  The first issue we will have to examine is that of the arrangement of the new corporate entity.  We will have to consider how it fits in with the 1994 and 2003 Acts.  It may be outside the scope of the Acts &mdash; it may not have been foreseen by them.  While that is what it looks like, we cannot be sure until we know the full position.  For example, we will have to see the application that Quinn Direct will make to the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and the Health Insurance Authority.  We cannot be certain until then.  We will have to deal with a number of important issues.  We discussed the matter earlier today.  We have had a number of meetings.  The Health Insurance Authority is also examining the issue.  We will have to try to make some early decisions on it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Why has this matter been left until the eleventh hour, when the damage may well already have been done?  Why did the Government not react immediately when the issue was flagged last July?  It is clear that there is no urgency on this issue.  Such negligence of the highest kind reflects the Government&rsquo;s bias in favour of those who see the human and health needs of people simply as a cold marketplace in which business can be conducted and profit made.  The big business interests which are moving into the health care sector for private profit &mdash; I refer to speculators and beef barons, etc. &mdash; do not take the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, seriously in any sense as a defender of public health.  Why should they, given that she is robbing land from public hospitals and giving it to private hospitals and then lecturing the consultants because they want to moonlight in those private hospitals?  How can they take her seriously in such circumstances?  Community rating is based on a concept of equality among human beings, but the Minister represents a party which promotes inequality.  I refer to the Progressive Democrats, which advocates a system &ldquo;red in tooth and claw&rdquo;.  The Minister is on the same wavelength as those who are poised to make a killing on foot of people&rsquo;s private health insurance needs.</P><Col N="1550"/>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that ordinary working people who pay massive amounts of taxation should not feel pressurised to take out private health insurance?  They are under such pressure because the Government is incapable of providing a health service in which they can be seen immediately and efficiently.  I ask the Taoiseach again to tell the House, on foot of the advice given to the Cabinet this morning, what the most likely outcome to this problem is.  Will Quinn Direct be given a three-year period of grace, after which some other so-called entrepreneur will be able to move into the health insurance field in its place and walk away with another fortune?  What will the Taoiseach do to stop this scandal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of important issues arise in this regard.  The 400,000 who use BUPA Ireland&rsquo;s service want to continue to avail of private health insurance and have their policies protected.  We should consider the staff of BUPA Ireland and the position of VHI Healthcare which expects to receive resources from the private health insurance operators under existing legislation which did not envisage the circumstances which have arisen.  We will have to wait to see what form the new corporate entity will take.  It appears, on the face of it, that the underwriting company has been dealt with in a different way.  It seems that it is outside the scope of the legislation.  We will have to take legal advice on how to handle this.  We will need to see whether Quinn Direct gets a licence from the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and the Health Insurance Authority.  We will need to take account of the positions of the other private health insurance companies such as VHI Healthcare.  The Barrington group which is already looking at that issue has been taking account of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Actually, it has not been doing it since last July.  The first I heard about Quinn Direct taking over was in the House last Wednesday.  It only came into the equation a few days before that, as I understand it.  I did not know of its interest until last Wednesday.  I have no brief for Quinn Direct which employs 6,500 people.  I do not know if it is right for Deputy Higgins to feel it necessary to describe a company which employs 6,500 people in the economy as the beast at the trough, or the wolf at the trough.  It is disrespectful to describe the company, for which I have no brief, in such a manner.</P>

I do not think we can resolve the matter before the ongoing work of the Barrington group has been completed.  We need to examine precisely how Quinn Direct intends to compose its corporate entity.  We have to deal with such issues and will do so.  I do not think the matter can be dealt with in the next day or two.  I do not want somebody to think it can be resolved tomorrow.  It is likely that Quinn Direct will not apply for an IFSRA licence for some time.  The Health Insurance Authority will have to deal with such an application.  The report of the Barrington commission is not due until next month.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of major national and local importance, namely, the fact that while drift net fishermen in north-east England were given &pound;70,000 a number of years ago as part of a buy-out agreed in the interests of salmon conservation, and &pound;110,000 is being offered to the remaining drift net fishermen there as part of a further buy-out, just &euro;2,000 is being offered to Ireland&rsquo;s 850 drift net fishermen as part of a similar buy-out.  They are being offered &euro;23 for each salmon caught in the last five years.  A quota reduction of 75% is already operating.  No provision has been made for the drift net crew and no other option is being considered for them.  We need to consider whether this is equitable, considering the devastating effect it will have on the fishermen and their families in rural areas for the rest of their lives.</P>

	<P>I raised this matter with the T&aacute;naiste last Thursday, when two Bills were to be withdrawn, the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service Bill, <Col N="1553"/>which would assist very poor people in getting access to credit and money advice.  There is now only one Bill to be withdrawn, although there were two on Thursday.  Why is that?  Overworked journalists have not had an opportunity to follow up on the weekend commitments of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to cap interest rates over a period.  No doubt one of these days somebody will find out why we are not capping interest rates and I suspect the Minister for Finance will tell them.</P>
        <P>Presumably, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service Bill is being kept on the list for window dressing purposes.  Although the Minister could not express acute enough concern about the plight of poor people before Christmas, he is not at all upset now.  This Bill is left on the list for blatant window dressing purposes.  Is it not the case that nothing will be brought forward in the lifetime of this Government to help unfortunate poor people who are in the grip of moneylenders and who cannot access credit in the normal way?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to No. 16.  It is not the difficulty with regard to the specific amendments and the transfer of additional powers to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission but the importance, when such matters come before the House, of highlighting the fact that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is not representative of all opinion in this Chamber.  There are no places for Members of the component parts of the Technical Group.  This continues to create a degree of vexation and must be addressed.  If additional powers are to be transferred to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, the first thing to be done is to try to make it representative of all strands of opinion in the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No. 16 has been agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The Comhairle (Amendment) Bill is being withdrawn because the Citizens Information Bill has been passed and is now before the Seanad.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service Bill has been on the list for the last five years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>On the previous list of Bills, the Pharmacy (No. 1) Bill and the Pharmacy (No. 2) Bill were listed together.  I note it is intended to publish the Pharmacy (No. 1) Bill but the second Bill is not yet approved.  There is concern about patient safety, compliance with European law and compliance with the health and medical laws of the State.  Will the Pharmacy (No. 1) Bill deal with those?  Why has the No. 2 Bill been dropped from the list?</P>
        <P>We are due to discuss the Moriarty tribunal report next Wednesday.  Will there be an opportunity for questions and answers at the end of the series of statements?  Some Members might wish to raise questions and the Taoiseach or somebody else might wish to give answers.  I have asked questions a number of times about the Harris report but there is still no indication that it will be debated in the House.  The report, which was translated at a cost of &euro;16,000, deals with the decline of the Irish language in primary schools.</P>
        <P>No. 38 on the list is the Education Ireland Bill, which deals with the teaching of English to foreign students here.  I visited a school in Dublin West last week.  The school has 150 children who require support teaching in English but, due to the inflexibility of the Department of Education and Science, there are only two language support teachers.  There is an all round drop in reading skills as a consequence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The last Bill mentioned by the Deputy is due to be introduced during the year.  The Pharmacy (No. 1) Bill, to provide for fitness to practise regulations and so forth, covers the removal of restrictions on pharmacists educated in other EEA countries from managing or supervising a pharmacy in this country that is less than three years old.  The Bill covers issues relating to the European Union, EEA countries, the pharmacy review group and the fitness to practise rules and should be before the House in this session.  The heads are completed and the Bill is almost drafted.  The second Bill was to provide for regulatory services and other issues in the pharmacy review group report.  I do not know if the two are being combined, and I do not have a date for the second Bill.  Most of the big issues, however, are dealt with in the first Bill, although probably not all of them.</P>

        <P>My third question is about the referendum.  The Taoiseach informed me during Question Time that the Cabinet today considered this matter and agreed the format, subject to consultation with the Opposition parties.  My colleague, Deputy Howlin, has since been in touch with the Minister of State with responsibility for children who said that no wording has been agreed.  I would be obliged if the Taoiseach clarified the position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The property services regulatory authority Bill is to provide for the establishment of the property services regulatory authority to give full effect to the report of the auctioneering and estate agency review group.  It is on the list of promised legislation and it is due this year.</P>
        <P>The voluntary health legislation is on the list.  In reply to Deputy Joe Higgins, I stated that the Government is awaiting its legal advice on the various issues.  I have no further word until the process I outlined is completed.</P><Col N="1556"/>
        <P>I stated the Government&rsquo;s position on the referendum today.  The Government has finalised its position, subject to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s discussions.  It would be ridiculous for the Government to sign off on it and then have a consultation process.  This would be the wrong procedure.  We will wait for the discussions to take place before we come to a final position, which is the only fair way to ask for meaningful consultation.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not understand why Deputy Rabbitte is being so mischievous on this issue.  I spent 45 minutes today explaining the situation in what I regard as a fair and even-handed manner.  The Government has completed its work.  We would like this to be agreed on an all-party basis.

	<P>Following the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s ruling regarding Deputy Cuffe&rsquo;s request under Standing Order 31, where the Deputy tried to raise the subject of climate change, will the Carbon Fund Bill be brought before the House for amendment any time soon, given that &euro;270 million allocated for this purpose in the budget will not be adequate for carbon credits?  It has been estimated that &euro;750 million will be needed.</P>
        <P>I have asked on previous occasions about this matter.  I am still not sure if the promised legislation giving effect to the recommendations of the Kenny report on the affordability of building land and proper planning is promised legislation as the <Col N="1557"/>Taoiseach informed me during Question Time.  In the case of various pieces of legislation, the House has been informed that publication is expected but that it is not possible to indicate when at this stage.  This includes important legislation such as that concerning the register of persons who are considered unsafe to work with children and the crimes Bill and so forth.  Legislation which the Taoiseach has informed me on a number of occasions is promised by the Government does not appear on the list of promised legislation.  Is there another list that we should be consulting?</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Finance Bill 2007:" RHead="Second Stage"> 
    <Title>Finance Bill 2007: Second Stage. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am glad to introduce this, my third, Finance Bill to the House.  In my first Bill I concentrated on reducing the tax burden on low and middle earners.  In my second Bill I reformed and refocused the structure of investment tax reliefs and set a minimum tax which the well-off must pay.  In this Bill I seek to ensure the benefit of strong economic growth is shared by all taxpayers and, in particular, low and middle income earners.  I also seek to ensure that the ordinary taxpayer can better access the full range of normal tax allowances by improving the way the tax system works.</P>
        <P>The principal aims of the Bill are, therefore, to reduce the income tax burden on the lower paid by removing almost 40% of income earners from the tax net; deliver on our promise to middle income earners to ensure that 80% of all taxpayers in effect pay tax at no more than the standard rate; promote jobs, enterprise and investment, particularly in small firms through measures specifically aimed at that sector; promote greater investment in research and development and to retain our attractiveness as a prime location for foreign domestic investment; continue to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax system and close off the loopholes that are an unfortunate feature of all tax codes; and use the tax system to promote environmental and other socially desirable policy goals.</P>
        <P>It is worthwhile at this point to set out a few basic facts about our tax code which will help dispel a number of myths that might otherwise go unchecked.  First, the tax system has become incomparably fairer than the one we inherited in 1997.  There will now be more than 845,000 low income earners exempt from income tax compared with 380,000 in 1997.  The average tax burden on those on average incomes is less than half that in 1997.  We have one of the lowest tax takes in the world from persons on low and middle incomes.</P>
        <P>Second, rather than extending tax reliefs to all sorts of projects, as happened in the past, we now have a rational measured approach with appropriate caps on how far those reliefs can be exploited.  There is a case for targeted, productive, job giving reliefs where they can be shown to deliver for the taxpayer.  The business expansion scheme and regional relief schemes in the Bill pass this test and involve a degree of risk taking by investors perhaps lacking in other tax relief schemes.</P>
        <P>Third, the system of indirect taxes under this Government seeks to safeguard the lower paid.  It is not regressive as some studies maintain, for example, VAT does not apply to a range of basic foodstuffs &mdash; bread, butter, milk, meat, fruit and vegetables &mdash; children&rsquo;s shoes or clothing and oral medicines.</P><Col N="1566"/>
        <P>Fourth, we have gone a long way to achieve an efficient and effective tax system.  More tax is being paid by self-assessed taxpayers.  More taxes are being paid on time.  Modern IT systems mean more on-line payments.  Greater revenue powers achieve a better collection performance and complete change in the culture of paying one&rsquo;s taxes. Better IT facilitates the customer and a range of measures in this Bill will help make claiming tax reliefs easier.  It is important to appreciate these facts and acknowledge this perspective when examining the contents of this Bill, as I will now do.</P>
        <P>The Bill is being presented against a backdrop of continued strong economic performance and sound public finances.  The economy is estimated to have grown by 5.4% last year and is forecast to grow by 5.3% this year.  Our public finances are healthy and we have recorded a general Government surplus in nine of the past ten years and reduced our debt to GDP ratio to the second lowest in the euro area.</P>
        <P>Good economic and fiscal performance does not happen on its own but is nurtured and supported by sensible economic policies which reward hard work and enterprise through low taxes on labour and business.  Hand in hand with this, a strategically balanced, prudent and stability-orientated approach to the public finances facilitates historically high levels of investment in the productive capacity of the economy, while at the same time enhancing public services and protecting the most vulnerable in our society.  In this regard our record speaks for itself.</P>
        <P>Since 1997 the economy has been transformed, growing at an annual average rate of more than 7% in GDP terms.  More than 600,000 more people working than in 1997.  For the first time in our history more than 2 million people are employed in the State.  With so many more jobs and people employed, more goods and services are being produced and the consequent increase in tax receipts has allowed for a significant increase in the level of public services.</P>
        <P>Our approach of making work pay has proved hugely successful.  We are not complacent about our success and must continue to work to create the conditions necessary to sustain economic progress in the future.  We recognise that Ireland is a small and open economy especially exposed to changes in the global economic environment.  As such, we must address those domestic factors that we can influence or control in order that we can ensure the economy is suitably prepared in the event that external difficulties arise.  In these circumstances, a key policy challenge will be to enhance our competitive position to ensure continued improvements in our living standards.</P>
        <P>The Government is addressing the competitiveness challenge in a number of ways.  We are investing in infrastructure and people and improving the skills of the population, which will <Col N="1567"/>help us to compete by repositioning the economy for the production of more knowledge based goods and services.  We are also committed to enhancing the capacity of our economy and have illustrated this commitment in the recently announced national development plan.  We are improving our infrastructure and moving towards a more knowledge based economy by investment in research and development, science and innovation.  This will sustain our economic progress, improve our competitive position and create new and better jobs.</P>
        <P>The planned total spend of &euro;184 billion in the national development plan is an investment for us all in the future, which serves to increase competitiveness, enhance productivity, reduce congestion and improve services.  The plan builds on the significant achievements of its three predecessors.  In the 2000-06 period the previous national development plan delivered: more than 525 km of new national roads and 51,000 km of non-national road refurbishments; more than &euro;10 billion in housing projects and almost 50,000 new homes built; more than 460 schemes under the water services investment programme have been completed to improve water quality and help the environment; more than &euro;500 million has been invested under the rural water measure, with more than 450,000 people benefiting from the upgraded group water and small sewerage schemes; 57 new primary schools and refurbishment of almost 5,000 more; 19 new secondary schools with a further 13 already in construction; and 31,000 additional child care places.</P>
        <P>These facts show that the previous NDP delivered for the people.  We are fortunate to live in good times.  The current plan seizes the potential presented by current prosperity, strong financial standing and favourable demographics to position the country for continuing progress if the environment becomes less benign in future.  While continuing the good work of the previous development plans, the new NDP necessarily has a different focus in that it is designed to secure the gains made, sustain our prosperity into the future, balance growth across our country and do all this in a way which protects and enhances our environment.</P>
        <P>A vibrant economy underpinned by the reward of enterprise and work, strong and stability orientated public finances and the ambition of the national development plan are strategic cornerstones of the Government&rsquo;s economic and social policy.  The Finance Bill I present to the House today, focusing as it does on ensuring the benefit of strong economic growth, is shared by all taxpayers, and in particular low and middle income earners will further enhance the solid underpinning for future economic growth and the broader well-being of our society.</P><Col N="1568"/>
        <P>In each of the three Finance Bills I have introduced to the House I have been able to introduce measures which make the tax system fairer.  The tax burden on the low and middle income earner has been significantly lightened.  When this Bill has been enacted two out of every five income earners will have been removed from the tax net.  The Bill delivers on our promise to middle income earners to ensure that 80% of all taxpayers in effect pay income tax at no more than the standard rate.</P>
        <P>The Bill runs to 118 sections and three Schedules.  I will outline some of the main provisions in the time available to me, listen carefully to the contributions of Deputies and try to respond to the points they make when I reply to the debate.</P>
        <P>The various income tax measures and reliefs announced in the budget are dealt with in sections 2 to 4, inclusive.  These widen the tax bands and increase various credits, including the basic personal credit and employee tax credit, and reduce the top rate by 1%.  When this Bill has been enacted, almost two out of every five income earners will have been removed from the tax net.  The Bill delivers on our promise to middle income earners to ensure that, in effect, 80% of all taxpayers pay tax at no more than the standard rate.</P>
        <P>Section 5 provides for a 9% increase in rent relief.  Section 6 confirms the budget increases in the ceilings on mortgage interest relief.  For first-time buyers the ceiling is doubled from &euro;4,000 to &euro;8,000 in the case of a single person and from &euro;8,000 to &euro;16,000 in the case of a married couple or a widowed person.</P>
        <P>Section 8 provides that the foreign service allowances of employees of certain agencies, working in the overseas offices of those agencies, are treated in an equivalent manner in terms of the allowances paid to staff in the Civil Service who are serving in foreign postings.</P>
        <P>Section 9 provides the necessary legislative changes to allow the Revenue Commissioners, where possible, to credit and repay automatically reliefs such as age-related tax credits, health expenses, tuition fees and trade union subscriptions.</P>
        <P>Section 10 extends indefinitely the special tax exemption for unemployment benefit paid to systematic short-time workers.  This had previously been renewed from year to year.</P>
        <P>Section 11 amends the provisions exempting from income tax income arising on the investment of certain compensation payments.  This will exempt returns from offshore funds from tax in the same way as returns on domestic investments.</P>
        <P>Section 13 closes off an abuse of the rent-a-room exemption scheme in order that the exemption will not apply where an adult child pays the rent to a parent for staying in the parental home.  Section 14 increases the child-minding tax exemption limit of &euro;10,000 per year set in last year&rsquo;s <Col N="1569"/>budget to &euro;15,000 per year to encourage a greater uptake.  Section 15 introduces an additional threshold of relief of &euro;20,000 per year for qualifying long-term leases of farmland exceeding ten years&rsquo; duration.</P>
        <P>Section 16 amends the tax treatment of various pension products and approved retirement funds in a number of respects.  The main changes are that: first, Revenue will in future be able to approve, subject to conditions, generic pension products such as those under which single-member retirement benefits are marketed without the need for individual Revenue approval for each case and, second, an amendment to the legislation is being made to clarify that the operation of the pension fund limits is not affected as a consequence of pension adjustment orders made by the courts in circumstances of judicial separation or divorce.</P>
        <P>Section 18 confirms changes to the business expansion and seed capital schemes.  Both schemes are being extended for a further seven years until 31 December 2013.  The company limit is being increased from &euro;1 million to &euro;2 million, subject to a maximum of &euro;1.5 million to be raised in a 12-month period.  The investor limit is being increased from &euro;31,750 to &euro;150,000 in the case of the business expansion scheme and to &euro;100,000 in the case of the seed capital scheme.  Recycling companies are being added to the list of qualifying trades.  These changes to the schemes, with some additional alterations to the operation of the schemes provided for in this section, are subject to a commencement order being made on foot of approval by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>The Government is firmly of the view that this relief is important to the creation of jobs in Ireland and for the development of the small business sector and that the European Union will recognise this also.  In this general context, the film investment relief is due for renewal next year and before we renew it we will have it fully reviewed, as before, to ensure that it is delivering the desired effect.</P>
        <P>Section 19 proposes a number of changes to income tax appeal provisions to provide that where a determination of the appeal commissioners is to be reheard by a Circuit Court judge or a case is to be stated for the opinion of the High Court, the inspector will not be obliged to amend the assessment under appeal until the appeal process has been fully completed.  In such a case, a refund of tax paid or the collection of tax levied will not proceed until final judgment.</P>
        <P>Sections 21 to 23 amend the tax code concerning farmers as follows.  Certain farmers who were in receipt of Feoga and single farm payments in the calendar year 2005 can qualify under the income averaging scheme.  The 25% stock relief for farmers and the special incentive stock relief of 100% for certain young trained farmers is extended for a further two years, subject to clear<Col N="1570"/>ance with the European Commission under State aid rules.  The educational qualifications for the special 100% relief are being aligned with rules governing stamp duty relief for young trained farmers.  The scheme of capital allowances for milk quota is being amended to ensure this relief is available for quota purchased under the new milk quota trading system.  I will bring forward further tax relief measures for farmers on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Section 24 sets out proposed new tax arrangements for stallion stud fees, which will come into effect on 1 August 2008 with the present regime ending from 31 July 2008.  These will replace the present tax arrangements which had been objected to by the European Commission.  The bloodstock industry and the wider racing industry are important economic drivers in rural Ireland.  Despite its small size, Ireland is now the third largest producer of thoroughbreds in the world and accounts for 42% of total EU output.  The existing exemption was key to the development of the sector and in recent years up to 70% of the world&rsquo;s top stallions have been located in Ireland.</P>
        <P>A recent survey estimated that the total number directly employed in the stallion breeding sector is 2,400.  An additional 2,300 are employed in the brood mare sector with estimates of up to 16,500 employed in directly associated activities in the economy.  In addition, the availability of good stallions, together with the high reputation of Irish breeders, has led to more foreign owners boarding their mares here.  In the past 30 years or so, the number of foals born here has tripled and thoroughbred foal output now stands at more than 12,000 per year.</P>
        <P>The key measure in this new arrangement is the provision of a deduction for the purchase cost of the stallion, which will allow the cost to be written off over a useful economic life of four years.  This four-year writing down allowance, which the Bill provides for, is in step with the existing accounting practices in the industry which have evolved over time to deal with the reality in this business, that in the majority of cases investing in thoroughbred stallions is inherently risky and is often a loss-making venture.</P>
        <P>Overall, the measures contained in this section of the Bill will mean that the same broad principles will apply to the stallion breeding industry as for other businesses.  These tax arrangements are subject to clearance by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Section 25 amends the tax relief for donations to approved bodies to remove a number of references to the requirement that various educational bodies must be established in the State.  A number of named bodies are also removed either because they are defunct or are already established charities to which the donations scheme applies.</P><Col N="1571"/>
        <P>Section 26 introduces a scheme aimed at encouraging the development of tourism infrastructure in the mid-Shannon area.  Such a scheme has been under consideration for some time.  In the lead-up to budget 2006, a submission proposing such a scheme was received from Shannon Development.  This was the subject of an <i>ex ante</i> evaluation by Goodbody Economic Consultants last year.  The review was followed by the completion of F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s tourism product development strategy 2007-13.  In addition, in the lead-up to this year&rsquo;s budget a follow-up proposal was received from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  Accordingly, I have decided to proceed with such a scheme on a pilot basis.  In doing so, I point out that in their report Goodbody recommended that if any such scheme was to be implemented: the scope of the scheme should be strictly limited; the scheme should only allow for accommodation where it is integral to the resort; it should not apply to cabin cruisers; it should only operate for a limited term; and there should be an independent certification body.  All these recommendations have been met in the design of this scheme.</P>
        <P>A certification body will be established to vet proposed developments so as to provide quality assurance for the scheme.  Such certification is aimed at establishing eligibility under the scheme before proceeding with any project.  The qualifying period for expenditure under the scheme will be three years from the date of its commencement, which will be done by way of ministerial order.  It will not cover stand-alone hotel or holiday cottage developments and the accommodation content of any qualifying development cannot be more than 50%.</P>
        <P>The designated areas involved are in a corridor of about 12 kilometres on either side of the river, stretching roughly from the bottom of Lough Derg to Lough Ree.  The tax relief will consist of accelerated capital allowances over seven years for qualifying construction and refurbishment expenditure incurred in the qualifying three-year period.  This is aimed at assisting the development of a critical mass of the type of tourism projects needed in the area, such as marinas, leisure centres, equestrian centres, adventure sport facilities, sailing schools, interpretative centres, health farms and spas, heritage houses and gardens.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that following the passing of the Finance Bill 2007 at the end March, the scheme will be immediately notified to the European Commission at which stage work will commence on the drawing up of guidelines and establishment of the certification board with a view to signing the commencement order in June, assuming there are no problems with the European Commission.  The scheme will be operational for three years after this date &mdash; that is, to approximately June 2010.</P><Col N="1572"/>
        <P>Section 27 closes a loophole concerning unallocated partnership profits by clarifying the position that the tax-adjusted profits of a partnership must, for tax purposes, be fully apportioned between the individual partners each year.  This will close off a potentially large tax loss in some major partnership firms.</P>
        <P>Section 28 makes various amendments to relevant contract tax which applies to payments made by principal contractors to subcontractors under relevant contracts in the construction, meat processing and forestry industries, including a number of amendments to meet commitments, contained in the partnership programme Towards 2016, to strengthen the RCT system.</P>
        <P>Sections 29 and 30 amend the current tax laws on SSIAs and the pensions incentive tax credits scheme so as to empower Revenue to seek various information returns from SSIA managers and to require SSIA moneys invested in pension funds under the pensions incentive tax credits scheme to be held for at least one year to avoid a claw-back of credits given under the scheme.</P>
        <P>Section 31 provides for DIRT-free interest to be paid automatically by financial institutions to taxpayers of 65 years of age or over, whose total income does not exceed the relevant income tax exemption limit.  This will also apply to permanently incapacitated people in receipt of such interest in defined circumstances.  It will ensure that relief is given without the need to apply to Revenue for a refund each year.</P>
        <P>In section 32 I seek to afford relief to persons who may suffer double taxation arising from capital gains in countries with which we have a double taxation treaty but where the treaty itself predates the introduction of capital gains tax in Ireland.  The section also removes an element of double taxation on the profits of a foreign branch or agency of an Irish company, where such a branch or agency is located in a country with which we do not have a double taxation treaty.</P>
        <P>Section 34 provides for a number of amendments to the scheme of dividend withholding tax to deal with the introduction of electronic dividend vouchers, the application of the general four-year time limit that applies to other tax repayments to refunds of dividend withholding tax, and an extension of the existing exemption from dividend withholding tax available to non-resident subsidiaries.  Section 36 is an anti-avoidance provision which makes a number of changes to provide special rules for the taxation of personal portfolio investment undertakings in regard to payments made to unit holders.  This will prevent the exploitation by some wealthy individuals of the lower exit tax rate on certain investment funds.</P>
        <P>Sections 38 and 39 amend taxation procedures in regard to life insurance policies in order that the investment proceeds of all life insurance policies will become chargeable to income tax after <Col N="1573"/>an eight-year period.  Section 40 strengthens certain anti-avoidance provisions in regard to the transfer of assets abroad.</P>
        <P>Section 41 extends the application for a further three years to 2009 of the base year 2003 expenditure on research and development against which incremental expenditure will be measured for the purpose of the research and development tax credit.  In addition, expenditure by companies on subcontracting research and development work to unconnected parties will qualify under the tax credit scheme up to a limit of 10% of qualifying research and development expenditure in any one year.</P>
        <P>Section 42 confirms the budget day announcement that the preliminary corporation tax liability threshold for treatment as a small company is being increased from &euro;50,000 to &euro;150,000.  New or start-up companies with a corporation tax liability of &euro;150,000 or less for their first accounting period will not be required to pay preliminary tax in respect of that first accounting period.  In addition, provisions are being introduced under which large companies in a group will be allowed offset their preliminary tax payments between group members for the purpose of working out the adequacy of such payments for interest purposes.  This will assist in minimising interest charges on the group.</P>
        <P>Section 43 deals with group relief for companies, the provisions for which are being amended mainly to comply with a ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Marks &amp; Spencer case on the use of foreign tax losses.  Section 45 introduces a measure that provides an option to companies not to have interest payments made to associated companies in countries with which we do not have a double taxation agreement deemed as a distribution of their profits.  This removes an element of double taxation in the tax code and will help the IFSC.</P>
        <P>Section 46 extends the qualifying period for the scheme of tax relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects from 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2011, subject to clearance by the European Commission from a state aid perspective.  Sections 47 to 51 amend the tax code in regard to capital gains tax in a number of ways.  They increase the retirement exemption threshold from &euro;500,000 to &euro;750,000, amend the site to child relief to limit the size of the site to 1 acre, exclusive of the house, and make a technical change to the exemption for sports bodies to ensure the full value of the existing asset must be applied for approved purposes.  There is a technical amendment in the offshore income gains provisions to update a reference to resident individuals and, where a capital gains tax clearance is not produced on the closing of a sale, an amendment will ensure that any consideration withheld must be paid to the Revenue Commissioners within 30 days.</P><Col N="1574"/>
        <P>Parts 2 and 3 deal with indirect taxes, namely, excise and VAT.  These include sections 52 to 67, inclusive, which set out a range of changes in regard to excise duties, including confirming the budget day reduction to zero of excise duty on kerosene and LPG used for heating, the increase in excise on tobacco and the introduction of a VRT relief of 50% for electric cars.  Existing provisions relating to substitute fuels are being amended so that such fuels, including biofuels, will in future be taxed at the rate applicable to the fuel for which they can be substituted.  The definition of &ldquo;mechanically propelled vehicle&rdquo; is amended to exclude vehicles that do not meet EU-type approval standards for entry into service on the State&rsquo;s roads.  Arising from the Criminal Justice Act 2006, excise duties are being adjusted or imposed in regard to firearms.</P>
        <P>In response to rulings by the European Court of Justice relating to other member states, the Bill provides that company cars driven by Irish residents on behalf of firms based outside Ireland will be exempt from VRT subject to certain conditions.  Provision is also being made for the late opening of betting shops on days on which an evening race meeting is taking place in Ireland, regardless of the time of year.  Currently, late opening is allowable when daylight hours facilitate evening race meetings &mdash; from April through to August.  This change is in response to the advent of floodlit night-time horse racing in Ireland from the latter half of the year.</P>
        <P>Sections 68 to 89, inclusive, contain a number of important revisions to the VAT code, as follows.  They confirm the budget increases to the VAT registration thresholds for small businesses from &euro;27,500 to &euro;35,000 in the case of services and from &euro;55,000 to &euro;70,000 in the case of goods with effect from 1 March, the increase in the farmers&rsquo; flat-rate VAT addition from 4.8% to 5.2% with effect from 1 January, and the reduction of the VAT rate on child car seats from 21% to 13.5% with effect from 1 May.</P>
        <P>Section 71 provides for the removal of the option for landlords to waive their right to exemption from VAT on short-term letting of residential property to remove an anomaly whereby the landlord can claim VAT on the assets of the property in year one but the equivalent VAT on rents from the property will only be received by the Exchequer over a prolonged period.  This currently acts as an unintended Exchequer subsidy to private letting.  The change will apply to properties acquired or developed after the passing of the Finance Bill 2007 and will not affect lettings in existence prior to that date.</P>
        <P>Sections 76 and 81 provide for the deductibility of VAT on conference-related accommodation expenses from 1 July to help Irish hotels compete more favourably on the global stage for conference business.  This change is in line with the recommendations of the tourism action plan <Col N="1575"/>implementation group and was announced in the budget.  Other VAT changes relate to hire purchase transactions in cases where the customer defaults on repayments and where finance houses are involved in the transactions, the taxation of certain services received by public bodies, for example, consultancy services from abroad, and the application of the open market value to certain transactions between connected parties in determining the amount on which VAT is chargeable.</P>
        <P>Sections 91 to 102 introduce changes to the stamp duty code to achieve the following: abolish the head of charge for mortgages; simplify the code; amend the relief available for young trained farmers; extend the relief for farm consolidation for a further two years to 30 June 2009 and allow relief where only one farmer is consolidating; introduce a new exemption from stamp duty for sports bodies which are already entitled to relief from income tax and capital gains tax &mdash; this exemption will relate to purchases of land for the purposes of promoting games or sports; limit the transfer of a site from a parent to a child to build a house to 1 acre, exclusive of the house; provide for an exemption from stamp duty on certain intra-family transfers of farmland; and extend the existing first-time buyer stamp duty exemption to persons who have undergone a judicial separation or divorce where certain conditions are fulfilled.  I am currently considering further changes to the stamp duty code which may be introduced on Committee Stage.  These relate to the application of the code to the development of land.</P>
        <P>Sections 103 and 104 are technical amendments which arise as a result of a High Court case decided last year in regard to when a discretionary trust created will come into existence.  Section 104 changes the date on which the tax becomes payable where a trust is created following death.  This follows a High Court decision earlier this year.  The tax will now apply from the date of appointment to the trust instead of the date of death, as before.</P>
        <P>Section 105 alters the date from which interest becomes payable in the context of a clawback of agricultural or business relief where the assets are sold within the specified period.  The interest will now apply from the date the clawback arises.  Section 107 deals with capital acquisitions tax agricultural relief and amends existing provisions in order that an individual may offset borrowings on an off-farm principal private residence against the property&rsquo;s value, for the purpose of the 80% farmer test.</P>
        <P>On tax administration, section 110 amends the tax code so the need for a person who holds a fixed charge on the book debts of a company to send to Revenue a copy of all the papers lodged with the Companies Registration Office is replaced with a simplified return.  Section 111 <Col N="1576"/>provides for a reduction from six months or 183 days to 93 days in the period which must elapse after the receipt of a valid claim before Revenue is required to pay interest on overpayments.  The shorter period applies for repayments made after the passing of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 112 provides for a once-off increase this year in the ceiling for donations to the Irish Heritage Trust from &euro;6 million to &euro;10 million.  This would allow for the donation of a collection of fine Irish paintings and furniture for display in Fota House.</P>
        <P>Section 113 amends the existing requirements that Departments, the HSE and local authorities and similar statutory bodies that make any payment in the nature of rent or for the purposes of rent subsidy in regard to any premises to make a return containing details of the premises, its owner and payments made.  The amendment will extend this provision so that these bodies will also be required to obtain the PPS number of the landlord concerned.</P>
        <P>Section 114 amends the tax law to clarify and confirm the search powers of Revenue to assist in investigations with a view to prosecutions.  Section 115 creates a new offence of impersonating a Revenue officer.  There have been a number of instances in recent years of persons impersonating a Revenue officer.</P>
        <P>I hope the House has benefited from this explanation of the measures in the Bill.  There are still some matters under consideration that I may bring forward on Committee Stage, should they receive Cabinet approval.  I will also give consideration to any constructive suggestions made during our debate today and tomorrow.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate on it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the last chapter in what the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor described as something of a great epic, which, like the works of Charles Dickens, he decided would be issued in serial form.  Like the work of Dickens, this epic started with great expectations, but much of it for many ended in fairly hard times, which is part of the mark of the Government in its approach to public finances.  It has been very much the tale of two Irelands, with many doing well, but, unfortunately, many more left in the margins.  Many of those in the margins are people waiting for public services that should have been delivered considering the wealth available to the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Bruton is the Nicholas Nickleby of Ireland.</P>

	<P>Perhaps Uriah Heep.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the background to the Finance Bill.  People look on this country as one with <Col N="1577"/>a tremendously successful economy which has yielded extraordinary wealth to the Government.  However, we have not achieved what should have been achieved and this will be the core issue on which we will go to the country in the election.  Much money has been spent, but too much has been left undone.  People will look at the alternatives and decide whether we should have another five or ten years of what we have had or whether it is time to look afresh at the appetite for change.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the Bill comes from the same stable as so many before it.  It is disappointing on many fronts.  It reinforces the strong bias against families, which is contrary to the sort of social policy we should see; it fails to square up to the environmental challenge, the urgency of which we become more aware daily; and it continues to glide along with public spending which is growing 50% faster than the growth of national income.  It does so on the basis of an increasing dependence on a property boom which we all know is unsustainable.  The main problem is the Bill does not address fundamental issues at this time of great opportunity.</P>
        <P>I would like to develop some of these themes, beginning with the issue of families and the way in which we inadvertently, not just through the finance and tax system, pursue policies that make life difficult for them.  If families at work want to put a child into child care, even if they put all of their child benefit and the new under-six payment into child care, they will still have to meet another &euro;145 per week.  The cost of that in gross income is &euro;13,500.  Therefore, they must find that amount for each child in child care.  If a family has two children, the cost of that child care wipes out the entire industrial wage.</P>
        <P>As a result of this, people have to opt out of the workforce for a few years to care for their children at home, but the result is they are penalised further tax-wise, first by losing the PAYE tax credit, a whammy of &euro;990 or approximately &euro;1,000, and then up to &euro;5,250 as a result of the individualisation bands.  What sort of policy is it that has the effect that if people decide to opt out of work for a few years to engage in home care, they are penalised to that level?  This inadvertently creates an environment where parents find it hard to cope.  It is even deeper than this.  If people separate, the tax system decides they should have four tax credits, whereas if they stay together, they should have two.  If they happen to cohabit, are not married and only one is working, they are reduced to just one tax credit.  Some crazy concepts underpin the way we treat families.</P>
        <P>The situation is similar in other sectors, for example, housing.  Many families now have to go into private rented accommodation.  Why is it we decide these families only deserve &euro;14 a week of total subvention support towards their housing expenses, while someone in a council tenancy gets <Col N="1578"/>40 or 50 times this amount?  Similarly, someone out of work would get 40 or 50 times, while someone purchasing a home gets five or six times that amount.  Why do we apply these significant distinctions to the many families forced to go into private rented accommodation?  We must focus more clearly on what we want to do to support families and this should inspire our tax and welfare system.</P>
        <P>Let us look too at the welfare system.  Many of the means tests, for example for higher education grants, medical cards etc., do not take account of the fact that two people trying to cope on one income have higher expenses.  This fact is airbrushed out of the equation.  However, that is the reality.  We want to promote a family policy where people stay together and share the responsibilities of rearing families, but we promote the very opposite through our welfare and tax codes.  We must get our minds around this and deal with the challenge to create a successful environment for parents.  We see ever increasing problems of young people going astray in various ways and to deal with this we must try and support family policy in a more coherent way.  Tax and welfare policy can contribute to this.</P>
        <P>Environmental strategy is another area needing attention.  If we look honestly at the Government record, we see the Government has failed to push the need to change if we are to comply with the Kyoto Protocol and use scarce resources more effectively.  We have a most dysfunctional planning strategy which has continued.  We continually force development further into green spaces leaving people with long commutes and areas without any traffic infrastructure support.  This pattern has been passed as coherent development in the past, particularly in the past decade when we have built 500,000 extra homes and increased our housing stock by 50%.  This was a significant opportunity to lay out or cement a coherent way of using resources, but it was let pass.  We did not reform the planning system, impose the proper building standards on those homes or try to create compact systems of development.</P>
        <P>The strategic development zone, SDZ, proposal was the right way forward, but as far as I know, Adamstown is the only area where the system has been applied.  This is only one case out of 500,000 houses.  This is not good enough and does not demonstrate coherent, joined-up thinking.  There is scope within the tax code, even in one Finance Bill, to be more ambitious about trying to promote sound decisions about the type and location of houses etc.  Development levies, VRT and other such duties could be used as levers to encourage this.  Stamp duty could provide an opportunity when houses change hands to do something about energy standards in houses.  We could create vehicles that would promote the sort of change we need, but this has not been high on the agenda.</P><Col N="1579"/>
        <P>I am baffled that we do not have an interconnector.  I was spokesman on energy many years ago when the issue of an interconnector to the United Kingdom or beyond was mooted in order to open our electricity system to the use of more alternative sources and to provide a more efficient and competitive electricity system.  Here we are, a decade on and billions spent on infrastructure, but the opportunity to achieve that core element, which should have been part of a strong environmental change in trying to achieve more balanced use of energy where we would be more reliant on renewable sources, has been missed.</P>
        <P>We must have much more strategic thinking in government on these challenges, but we come in here and deal with the issues piecemeal.  The Finance Bill results from all the various financial pressures and from the input of accountants and lobbyists, but it does not create a strategic picture about how we treat families or the environment.  We have unwittingly created in recent years a bonanza in property revenue where approximately &euro;100,000 plus from every new house built goes to the Exchequer.  Stamp duty on an average house in Dublin is &euro;41,000.  For an apartment, the figure is now &euro;30,000.  Massive sums are being borrowed in the private sector.  Everyone is aghast at how people could get themselves so deeply into debt, and the Central Bank has been wringing its hands.  Let us not forget that at least &euro;100,000 goes to the Exchequer for every new house built in Dublin, with another &euro;41,000 if it is second-hand.  The figures are obviously lower in other parts of the country.  Even first-time buyers are putting in a great deal, and in Dublin they pay &euro;33,000, even after the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s reform.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Stamp duty receipts have trebled in the last four years.  The Central Bank is worried that borrowers are fuelling spending, and one cannot escape the fact that the level of Government spending seen in the last five years will not be sustainable in the longer term.  One cannot increase spending 50 times faster than the growth in the economy other than for very short periods such as at present, with a massive property boom allowing such largesse in the absence of tax rises.</P><?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>That is not a sustainable basis on which to build spending programmes, and we must return to a much tougher value-for-money approach to squeeze value from public spending.  When one invests new resources, one gets real targets delivered.  That is at the heart of the programme that the Labour Party and we have put together, The Buck Stops Here, in which we try to set out how we might squeeze extra value from public spending.  In that manner, even in a more constrained environment such as we face in future, we can deliver in those key areas in which people have been so disappointed.</P><Col N="1580"/>
        <P>I will make some more specific points about the Bill.  I know the tourism scheme concerns the midlands, and the Minister for Finance, coming from the area, will understand its benefits.  I agree we need better tourism products; except in certain regions, we do not need much more accommodation.  I cannot see that the lessons of the past have been internalised by those who designed the scheme.  We were told that the first thing to do when introducing such a scheme is to assess its cost and benefits.  There is no mention of what the cost or benefits might be, however, despite it being a prerequisite.  It was at the core of all the consultants&rsquo; reports, which were a foot thick.  They looked back at such schemes, and after many years of their operation, found that we had procured only small benefits and that the cost of tax reliefs had been excessive.  We had not designed or thought them through at the beginning.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed there has been no attempt at a cost-benefit analysis of this tourism scheme, which may be wonderful for all I know since I do not know the area.  However, I do not see any such attempt.  One thing that has been taken on board is the need for certification, but we have not yet been told what the eligibility criteria will be.  Somewhere in the Bill it states that they must have regard to a great many factors.  Having to have regard to something is not a very rigorous test criterion, and we must beef that up.</P>
        <P>Before we vote this through, we should see very firm criteria set out in order that we know exactly what will be included.  We cannot leave that question to some large group established afterwards by a Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism who, with the best will in the world, will wish to use the scheme to maximise investment.  He will not think of the taxpayers or the benefit-to-cost ratio.  For him, it is a tool given him by the Minister for Finance that he intends to pump for everything possible; anyone else in his position would do the same.</P>
        <P>We must see such controls put in place, since this is the last time we will see the Bill, and the relief will continue for seven or eight years.  Many of us present will no longer be in the D&aacute;il at a time when the benefits are still accruing.  We must take a more rigorous approach, since it is taxpayers&rsquo; money rather than funds from some pool separate from what we spend on health, for example.  We are deciding that tourism projects in certain areas are more important than investment in plant and machinery in a factory or in an industrial building.  We are deciding that certain things are more desirable than others and that we will use taxpayers&rsquo; money to make them happen.  We must take that rather more seriously than hitherto.  I am not saying that the pattern has been such, and I have always recognised the benefits of what the Minister has done.  However, he has allowed cost-benefit analyses to slip into <Col N="1581"/>the past, when he must instead carry them into the future with equal rigour.  That is missing, although it should be part of such schemes.</P>
        <P>I am still concerned at the level of tax write-offs that we allow certain individuals who can manage the various schemes.  The Minister for Finance is increasing the threshold for the business expansion scheme which is probably among the better examples in that it is based on risk rather than property.  However, the Minister still allows someone, depending on his or her age, to put up to &euro;100,000 into a pension scheme, with a tax subsidy of &euro;40,000 or so provided on that pension each year.  Then the person receives &euro;250,000 from various reliefs if his or her tax affairs are managed properly.  It is only thereafter that certain caps begin to take effect.</P>
        <P>It all ends up with such people paying tax at a rate of 20%.  If they are over the &euro;500,000 mark, the Minister says they will pay 20%.  Let us not forget that an ordinary person pays 41% on income earned above a threshold of &euro;34,000.  That is the reality, and these schemes would have to be extremely good to justify some paying 41% after &euro;34,000 and others 20% on &euro;500,000.  That is the structure we have allowed, however, and the financial caps should be set at much lower levels than at present.  The Minister did not introduce proper restrictions on such schemes.  It is very hard to justify why someone on &euro;34,000 should pay the same marginal tax rate as a multimillionaire, and certain such millionaires will be asked to pay tax at only 20%.  It ought to be dealt with in a more clearcut fashion than in the vehicle invented last year as a first step.</P>
        <P>I will take some credit for reclaimed tax.  There is growing momentum on the part of the Department of Finance, Revenue and the Minister to take seriously reimbursing those who have overpaid.  In a back-of-the-envelope calculation, I estimated that the total was &euro;350 million a year for each of the four years on which one may reclaim money.  That is a great deal, worth some &euro;1.5 billion in total.</P>
        <P>The Minister should ask Revenue to conduct a study, since it has access to the full figures for money spent on medication, doctors and fees.  From its own returns, it could tell the Minister how much ought to attract tax relief.  While there is now a welcome commitment to opening tax relief at source, there are still signs of niggardliness in how it is approached.  For example, the Minister is leaving intact the &euro;125 figure as a hand-trip on medical expenses claims.  It is designed to do nothing other than cut the number of people making such claims.</P>
        <P>The Minister should forget about the &euro;125 and simply make medical expenses tax-allowable.  That would be much more clearcut, and one would not then have to depend on people applying.  The tax-relief-at-source vehicle is much more effective, but it has not been implemented.  He <Col N="1582"/>has consolidated the limits from &euro;250 and &euro;125 to a single &euro;125 instead of simply abolishing it as he should have done.</P>
        <P>Another matter thrown into sharp relief is the limit on retrospection.  People who have overpaid tax may reclaim it only for the preceding four years.  That minimisation is a running sore, the Minister having decided to reduce it from ten years.  The Statute of Limitations period has been reduced to four years.  He has underlined that sore point by saying that only three months after they make the claim may they accrue any interest on money owed them for many years.  I am not arguing that we should have limitless retrospection, with interest paid.  The Revenue Commissioners regard it as a great concession to move from six months to three but it seems that the clock should start to tick straightaway.</P>
        <P>There has been much debate about the business expansion scheme and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is of the view that it is the wrong way to go.  I would be better disposed to it as it tends to involve genuine risk capital.  Successive Ministers tried to weed out the mortgage-based investment that was low risk and one might instinctively think this ought to involve higher risk capital.  Some &euro;16 million has passed through the BES, with &euro;1.2 million in seed capital.  It is not a huge amount and probably worth it.  To be consistent, we ought to see a cost-benefit analysis.  It was not assessed in the Department&rsquo;s last batch of investments and I have not seen any cost-benefit assessment.  Nevertheless, we are deciding to significantly expand it.  I note from the Department&rsquo;s website that a survey was carried out, but this concerned beneficiaries.  It was not exactly a rigorous cost-benefit analysis in which the views of beneficiaries were sought.</P>
        <P>There is interesting information on those who benefited from the scheme such as many start-up companies.  It is disappointing that many of them were not involved in exporting, with 44% not exporting anything.  I believed the scheme would involve more leading edge exporting activity but this does not appear so.</P>
        <P>An element which could act as a warning to taxpayers is that 90% of companies report that investors are satisfied or very satisfied with the returns.  This suggests the number who are dissatisfied is very small.  Perhaps the risk involved is not great and the scheme is not getting to the areas of capital shortages for start-up and developmental companies.  The returns for investors appear to be very comfortable; a very low number of investors are going wrong.  The effort involved in making a proper assessment of the scheme, in the same way as others, would be repaid.</P>
        <P>We need to hear from the Minister&rsquo;s Department on patent income relief.  This avenue was opened up last year but the Minister was very agnostic in the end, deciding to do nothing. <Col N="1583"/> Nothing appears to be coming from official circles on what will happen.  I also have concerns about the different ceilings for individuals who have earned income compared to those with rental income who appear to be able to roll money over into other schemes one after the other, yet individuals with earned income have sharp caps to deal with of approximately &euro;31,000.  I find it hard to understand why much more generous terms of relief should be offered in these schemes for persons who have rental income as opposed to those who earn.  This issue should be considered.</P>
        <P>The Government is still redefining the goalposts on what was actually promised in the last general election, which intrigues me.  There was an absolutely clear promise that 80% of the population would only be paying at the 20% tax rate, which implied that 20% of the population would pay at the higher rate of 42%, as it was, now 41%.  The Department has come up with the new idea of effective rates of tax and the Minister is pretending that this is what was promised.  There were no references to effective rates of tax in the Fianna F&aacute;il or joint manifesto.  This is purely a <i>post-hoc</i> rationalising of the failure to honour one of the key promises made to taxpayers.  The people will not be taken in, although this is now rolled out of the word processor every time the Minister makes a speech.  It comes very high in the litany of achievements and amounts spent under the NDP, etc.</P>
        <P>The Government has the unique distinction of increasing taxes in proportion to GNP faster than any of its predecessors.  For a Government which talks about keeping taxes down, it may be surprising.  It is not so surprising, however, when one takes into account the spending side of the equation.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage.  Thankfully, the Bill is shorter than some of its predecessors.  This takes into consideration the times pressure on some of the individuals who will have to listen to the debate on Committee Stage, the Minister most of all.  I will not be supporting the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Finance Bill is the product of a budget which promised the biggest bonanza in history.  As the Minister delivers his Bill, it is clear that the anomalies, uncertainties and inequalities which pepper the whole tax system remain unaddressed by him.  He began the year with the &euro;184 billion national development plan.  When figures are that large, they tend to become meaningless for people who work and do not earn more than &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 a year.  The Minister for Finance is a former Minister for Health and Children and I would like to focus his attention on a concrete issue.</P>
        <P>The Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease ward in my local hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital, <Col N="1584"/>named after James Connolly by the late Dr. Noel Browne, does not have an adequate supply of hot water.  Speaking about a sum of &euro;184 billion and tens of millions of euro in tax breaks, somebody such as the Minister in a leadership position should be able to consider why we are like kids in a sweet shop.  Although we have so much money, we do not have an adequate supply of hot water for patients suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  That is possibly one of the reasons the electorate wants a change of Government.  The people yearn to see all the money being put to good use.  The strong economy of which we are understandably all proud does not mean much if patients suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease cannot be washed with hot water.</P>
        <P>In previous discussions on the Finance Bill I proposed a standing tax reform commission to address the anomalies in the tax system on an ongoing basis to ensure we could understand the purpose of an incentive; if it met its goal; and whether it could be continued indefinitely, changed or renewed.  These are complex issues and there are not always easy yes or no answers.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight an issue of which many are strongly aware, the challenges presented by climate change and global warming and the dangers posed or opportunities provided in dealing with the issue from an economic perspective.  The Minister is Minister Bigfoot in terms of the carbon footprint stamped by the Department on behalf of Ireland.  The Government has a pollute now and pay later policy.  Our children and grandchildren will be bequeathed this legacy, for which they will pay dearly.  Just as most Irish people are aware that this is one of the critical issues facing us, we understand that this week the EPA will report on Ireland&rsquo;s position on climate change and that its report will leave us hanging our heads, particularly on the issue of transport emissions.  In our great cities and towns we really only have a skeleton public transport system in place to show for the Government&rsquo;s ten years in power and all the money in the sweet shop.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s attempts to meet the Government&rsquo;s Kyoto Protocol commitments will be exposed as a complete failure of action.  He has set aside in the budget &euro;270 million to pay for carbon credits.  Most do not understand that carbon credits are really fines that the Minister will pay through the Kyoto Protocol mechanism for our failure to reduce our carbon emissions to the level promised.  The taxpayers, when they hear that the Government is lining up to pay &euro;270 million &mdash; many analysts have suggested that figure will possibly double &mdash; in carbon credit fines will see this is a failure of leadership which will cost the country dearly.  The old style public service would never have dreamed of lashing out &euro;270 million in fines.  We all would have been so shocked we would not have allowed it to happen and would have sought ways to reduce our emis<Col N="1585"/>sions rather than pay the fines.  It is one reason the electorate is considering, and I think will vote for, an alternative Government because the Minister has not addressed this issue by giving any meaningful leadership.</P>
        <P>The Finance Bill is an attempt to long-finger getting to grips with climate change until the general election is safely out of the way, even in the case of large car emissions where the Minister sent a postcard to his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to let people offer their insights, or &ldquo;ideas on a postcard, please&rdquo;, as to whether polluting SUVs or other cars which are heavy polluters ought to pay a little more tax.  Talk about abandoning any concept of leadership in this booming economy; there is no hot water for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease sufferers in hospital and he sends a postcard to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about vehicle emissions just when the EPA will announce, apparently later this week, that Ireland has far exceeded the commitments to which the Government signed up.</P>
        <P>Other countries can provide public service vehicles, including buses, which run on biofuel mixes.  In many major cities all over the world young Irish people see signs stating the bus is running on a clean fuel source.  Our young people are used to taking metro systems.  They are accustomed to taking public transport, not the train from Clonsilla, popularly known as the Calcutta express, which has only a small number of carriages and on which people regularly faint as it is so crowded.  This is the Minister&rsquo;s answer to problems of climate change.</P>
        <P>The Minister seems to be unwilling to offer any leadership.  Most countries operate wind energy regimes which provide small, but significant, alternative energy sources to carbon.  Incidentally, countries such as Denmark have grown a vibrant economic sector out of the development of alternative fuel strategies, both in building components for capturing wind energy and in all the design elements involved.  Denmark, like Ireland, is a small country with a critical urban-rural mix.  It tries to balance this mix and is doing so somewhat successfully.</P>
        <P>Much of our carbon usage literally goes up in smoke.  Where is the imagination to insulate the tens of thousands of inadequately insulated homes, many of which were built in the construction boom in recent years?  Could the Government not even look after the inadequately insulated homes of older people?  Pollute now and pay later is the underlying message of this Finance Bill on climate change.</P>
        <P>In recent days Chambers Ireland produced an interesting idea, that there should be a shadow carbon tax to give a sense of what it would cost to rebalance the tax system to take account of climate change and reduce that fine of over &euro;270 <Col N="1586"/>million which the Minister, according to his budget speech, plans to pay.  There is much that can be done, but the Minister is avoiding leadership on this issue and one of the reasons we need a change of Government is that we need fresh leadership to address these important issues.</P>
        <P>There are a number of areas which affect hard-working families which I want to address in some detail in this Bill.  My party has also called for and tabled amendments to create an office of taxpayers&rsquo; advocate or ombudsman to ensure PAYE workers get the tax breaks and refunds due in respect of health expenses, bin charges, etc.   This is my fifth year to put this forward.  I acknowledge that the Revenue Commissioners have taken steps to improve people&rsquo;s access to information about collecting various tax refunds and breaks to which they are entitled.  The Minister is more than willing to give the hand to the stallion owners and those in the construction industry who need their bit of a break, but he is far behind when it comes to PAYE workers getting the tax allowances and breaks to which they are entitled.  Perhaps it will appear in the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto.  Perhaps the Minister is saving the taxpayers&rsquo; advocate and ombudsman and the standing tax commission for this.  Perhaps we will convert him yet.</P>
        <P>I want to mention individualisation.  There is now a gap of more than &euro;5,000, whereby single income families face a significant tax disadvantage compared to families where both parents are working.  In a country where child care is so expensive and where housing is now so dispersed, particularly in the greater Dublin area and Leinster, many parents have no option but for one of them to give up work when their children are young, particularly if they have two or more children, never mind that the family may decide that doing so is in the best interests of the family.  That is not addressed at all in the Finance Bill.   The Minister has allowed the gap to widen.</P>
        <P>The Minister has proposals in the Bill for some stamp duty reforms, including a confirmation that families may gift a site up to &euro;254,000 or up to one acre to a child or children free of stamp duty and capital tax.  While the Minister argues, understandably, that these measures are a tightening of existing schemes which have emerged as being far too generous, as valuable lands of as much as ten acres including quarries, etc., have been gifted to children who have avoided stamp duty and, presumably, other capital taxes, this is startling news to ordinary PAYE workers who do not own lands or sites to gift to their children.  Their children must pay stamp duty on a second-hand house costing over &euro;317,500, even if he or she is a first-time buyer, or if he or she is trading up from a first home to a modest family home when they have children.  In the long run, we want families to be successful in Ireland.  Much of our future economic prospects are built on this.</P><Col N="1587"/>
        <P>New tax breaks for property-based development were included by the Minister in the Bill.  Last year the Minister, the Taoiseach and even the T&aacute;naiste agreed with me that it was scandalous that millionaires paid no tax, and that most of the people who got away with paying little or no tax received tax breaks.  A single person pays tax at the rate of 41% once his or her earnings exceed &euro;34,000.  The Minister must contrast this with a person who will now receive a whole new set of tax breaks for developments related to tourism, particularly hotel and holiday cottage building in the mid-Shannon region.</P>

	<P>It is limited to 50% and also includes a restaurant, but not a pub.  I am used to accountants and tax advisers and it does not take much ingenuity to create attractive tax avoidance schemes.  Previously, in less politically correct times, one could have used the back of a cigarette packet and now all it would take is half a page.  The point is, a person on &euro;34,000 with some overtime will pay tax at 41%.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, promised he was phasing out these schemes last year but now he has a new one, much of which relates to his own political backyard.  The schemes are a vote getting measure for the property industry to ensure the situation continues, whereby some very privileged individuals pay little or no tax.</P>
        <P>The former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, introduced individualisation as a way to get more women to join the workforce.  He acknowledged this himself but the country is more complex today in terms of spatial strategy and where couples can afford to buy a house.</P>
        <P>The gap between taxes on single income families and families with two working spouses continues to widen as a result of the changes the Minister for Finance made this year.  A single income family can now pay up to &euro;5,250 more in tax than its double income counterpart, compared to &euro;5,060 last year.  The gap relating to allowances has been widened by several hundred euro.  The standard PAYE, tax credit for each working spouse is &euro;1,760.  The home carer&rsquo;s allowance has remained fixed at &euro;770.  Therefore, the gap has widened, potentially, to &euro;990.  As mentioned, the single parent&rsquo;s tax credit in the Bill has gone up from &euro;1,630 to &euro;1,760.  The single income family has been left standing in this Finance Bill.</P>
        <P>This is not an easy issue but we must, as a society, give it consideration.  The budget for 2007 has exaggerated the discrimination in taxation between these two types of family by continuing the policies initially introduced by Mr. McCreevy through individualisation.  The cost of these measures to families is now close to &euro;700 million per annum, based on the Revenue Commis<Col N="1588"/>sioners&rsquo; pre-budget analysis.  The purpose of the policy was to incentivise, as far as possible, both parents in a family to go out to work, regardless of circumstances.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that there are as many single income, married households in Ireland as there are dual income.  According to the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; annual statistical survey up to 31 December 2005 there were approximately 307,000 of each type of household.  There are approximately 75,000 single income households earning between 150% and 250% of average national earnings.  Most of these families are committed to caring for their children themselves or to looking after aged relatives.  This is now one of the most expensive countries in the European Union and the policy of individualisation is costing them dearly.</P>
        <P>Most of the earners in these single income families are employees, not owners of businesses, because spouses and children of owners of businesses and family companies can go on the books of that business as employees or directors, as the Minister knows.  More than 80% of these 75,000 middle income households fall into this category.  They are people who cannot afford cr&egrave;che and travel fees and have had the decision made for them in many cases.  They are people with sick or disabled children in need of special care that has been denied them.  They are people who have elderly parents or relatives who require additional care.  They are the people who choose to care for family members at home for long periods rather than use nursing homes either because they are not available or they cannot afford them.</P>
        <P>This discrimination was introduced to make work a more palatable choice. However, this is not possible without the provision of many services at a community level, which the Government never had any intention of providing.</P>
        <P>My colleague from the Kerry South constituency, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, pointed out that the home care package for one elderly man in her area, as set out by the Health Service Executive, HSE, came to &euro;60 per week.  What will &euro;60 buy in terms of a home care package?</P>
        <P>Individualisation continues to widen the gap between single and dual income families and ignores the reality that people&rsquo;s lives change more than once during their lifetimes and that many people will need or want to take time out a various stages, particularly relating to child care or care of the elderly.  How many of us have already taken time out to look after our parents in their old age or will want to do so in the future?  Is it right that we should suffer a double penalty for doing so?  Loss of income is a choice that people who care make, but to pay more tax, at the rate they are paying, is a choice that has been forced upon people by the Government for the past eight years.</P><Col N="1589"/>
        <P Just="Left">If one works in Dublin and moves to Kinnegad, Gorey or Tullamore to get an affordable family home and have two children, cr&egrave;che fees could cost up to &euro;300 per week, with commuting times of four hours and more per day.  Small wonder that in this situation many families decide that it is better for one parent, usually the mum, to opt out of work or reduce working hours while the children are very young.  The alternative of getting children up as early as 6.30 a.m., taking them to minders and then doing the long commute is so hard that many families do it for a year or two but, particularly when the second baby comes along, decide that one parent must take time out.</P>
        <P>Children need time with their parents.  Parents need time with each other and with their children.  The burden on families of our current development policies on housing and commuting are not good for relationships and we all know this.  Anyone who has had a child or cared for a child knows that the early years fly by rapidly and do not come back.  When one adds a &euro;6,000 tax penalty for the decision to opt for home care it makes one wonder how family friendly the Government really is.</P>
        <P>It is almost as though the policy of individualisation continued like an unchecked juggernaut after Charlie McCreevy introduced it.  It grew and grew and nobody has examined it to see if what was appropriate seven or eight years ago is still appropriate now, in its expanded and hugely costly phase.  I find it problematic that the Government considers things gone, done and dusted and considers that we must merely live with the consequences.</P>
        <P>This policy of individualisation has led to dramatic transfers from families with children and dependants to two income households, many without dependants.  This is the reality of Government policy towards the family and care in the community and it provides a startling contradiction to some of the rhetoric we heard this week and last week about the &euro;184 billion in the national development plan.  It is time we debated this matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance made a number of changes relating to stamp duty in the Bill.  They are unlikely to benefit the first-time buyer or the person trading up from a first to a family home.</P>
        <P>The scheme for gifting an acre, or a &euro;254,000 site, is well and good for those who have such sites.  As the Minister stated, the provision in this regard tightens a loophole that was obviously open to abuse.  In the course of discussing the Bill will the Minister outline the instances and costs of the abuses in the structure?  He did not address the issue of large property deals in Dublin such as that concerning the Irish Glass Bottle site which seemed to escape stamp duty or property tax through an arrangement for a transfer of shares rather than property.  I have spoken before about deals that each netted the movers and shakers <Col N="1590"/>involved savings of &euro;30 million plus.  The Minister is silent on this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the provision exempting sports bodies from stamp duty.  While discussing the past two Finance Bills, I referred to GAA clubs being obliged to pay stamp duty on fields they buy rather than availing of the exemption that applies to charities.  I am glad the Minister has listened to my proposal in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has proposed a number of reforms concerning stamp duty.  We have talked about the introduction of a stamp duty allowance, or tax credit, attaching to the family home or the principal private personal residence such that duty would not apply to second homes or investment properties.  The stamp duty regime would be reformed in order that it would only be payable on amounts over the threshold.  That measure could be introduced either singularly or over a period of years, as resources permit.</P>
        <P>Stamp duty thresholds should be indexed on an annual basis.  If indexation were applied annually, it would reduce the risk of spikes in house prices when the threshold is raised on a once-off basis.  This is what happened the last time the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, increased the threshold significantly.  It was clawed back within a couple of months by the property industry.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party also wants to examine a system of relief for older people who are downsizing to a smaller family home or arranging personal retirement care facilities.</P>
        <P>Let me turn to the new scheme the Minister has introduced in respect of the Shannon region.  His constituency is one of approximately six or seven, all within a 12 km radius of the mid-Shannon area, to benefit from his proposals.  He needs to show us what his scheme involves to ensure it is not a vehicle for the high flyers and very well heeled to avoid paying their fair share of tax, as is the case with the other property-based schemes.</P>
        <P>Goodbody Economic Consultants, in a report published during the passage of the Finance Bill last year, stated the cost of area-based tax incentives to the Exchequer was very high and that the area-based schemes already in existence were and would cost the Exchequer many tens of millions of euro.  In its review of the schemes it stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">These tax costs are high relative to the outputs achieved.  For example, the present value of tax costs represent up to 43% of the building costs associated with developments undertaken as part of the schemes.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The fact is that the Minister has decided to blatantly fly in the face of his expensively commissioned consultants&rsquo; report and the statement of the Taoiseach and others that the property-based tax schemes would be wound down, particularly in the context of the construction boom <Col N="1591"/>which we are still experiencing and the inflationary impact of such schemes on property prices in the designated areas.  It is particularly worrying that the scheme has been announced without any evidence, cost-benefit analysis or consideration for the overall environmental impact on the beautiful Shannon region.  We need to learn from earlier schemes which resulted in certain mass developments of apartment blocks and holiday homes in parts of the upper Shannon region that simply do not appear to be sustainable in the long run.  Where is the environmental audit of such schemes?  When the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, announced the upper Shannon relief scheme some years ago, he said it would make a Klondike of the region.  The Klondike made the gold miners and others who could get there rich.  However, one must question the current position of the Klondike and its economic activity.</P>
        <P>We want long-term sustainable investment and development in beautiful areas such as the Shannon region.  We want quality employment rather than quick bucks for property developers who build and then leave the locals to play catch-up forever afterwards, which practice is not sustainable.  One should bear in mind that those who will benefit from the schemes are not the ordinary Joe Soaps.  They are earning incomes of millions of euro and pay little or no tax, even under the arrangements the Minister introduced last year, compared to the single person on an income of &euro;34,000.  If the latter is offered overtime, a bonus, a second job or extra work, he must pay tax at a rate of 41%.  This is not fair.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is characterised by an approach of tweaking and tidying up by the Government prior to the adjudication of its stewardship in a few months.  The Bill&rsquo;s main function will cover the implementation of the tax changes in the budget and make adjustments to tax credits and bands.  It will make a rather tentative effort at tax reform.</P>
        <P>In recent years foreign property has been attracting Irish investors who have ploughed huge sums into holiday homes in locations as far-flung as Shanghai and the Bahamas.  The revamp of the business expansion scheme would appear to be an effort to counter this major outflow of investment funds in that it improves incentives for investors in the scheme.  This is to be achieved by raising the upper limit for investments from &euro;31,000 to a more realistic &euro;150,000 and by doubling the figure for each company from &euro;1 million to &euro;2 million.</P><Col N="1592"/>
        <P>In particular, I was very disappointed that there was a failure to countenance any real reform of the stamp duty system and no joy for first-time buyers of second-hand homes.  There was much hope there would be real reform in this area but it is regretted that it did not occur.  First-time buyers are placed on the horns of a dilemma in that there is no change to the threshold of &euro;317,500, despite the fact that the average price of a home is in the region of &euro;350,000.  This is a weakness.</P>
        <P>Estate agents have indicated that house prices have risen by upwards of 12% in the past year.  County Leitrim has topped the league with an increase of approximately 28%.  Nevertheless, the stamp duty threshold remains static, at &euro;317,500, and any prospect of stamp duty reform appears to be a distant dream, as prices continue to reach astronomical levels.  Families anxious to trade up will be hit with a double or triple whammy, as they will have to factor an extra &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000 into their calculations.</P>
        <P>One of the most punitive aspects of the unfair stamp duty system is that house buyers are forced to pay the higher rates for the full value of their property, not merely on the small excess above &euro;317,500.  If they were to pay the difference between &euro;317,000 and &euro;350,000, the system would be a lot fairer.</P>
        <P>Section 97 of the Bill provides a stamp duty tax break for parents who transfer sites up to one acre, or with a value not exceeding &euro;254,000, to each of their children to construct a private residence.  I do not know how many &ldquo;regular&rdquo; or &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; families would be in a position to do this for their children.  The relief is aimed at wealthier families who will benefit a little more as a result.</P>
        <P>One stamp duty adjustment that is to be welcomed is the exemption for amateur sports bodies, a matter referred to by Deputy Burton.  The Independents have lobbied for such a measure.  These voluntary bodies provide many facilities, which is to be welcomed.  No doubt the initiative will be very popular throughout Ireland because the vast majority of sports activity is amateur and most clubs strive to have their own premises.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides a new set of generous property-linked tax breaks for tourism in a number of midland counties.  Known as the mid-Shannon corridor tourism investment scheme, it is designed to stimulate investment in the area.  I have no doubt it is an ambitious plan, but there are parts of the BMW region that have been starved of investment.  There has been an underspend in large tracts of the region.  I should like to see that type of imaginative initiative being examined for the wider region.  There are many borderline examples between the standard income tax and the 42% rates.  Many would welcome the opportunity to have their pension fund topped by the &euro;2,500 under a transfer of &euro;7,500 from their SSIA account.  An alarming figure was <Col N="1593"/>released recently by the CSO which showed that 50% of the population does not have any pension cover.  There is an opportunity here for us to do something about this.  In fact, more than half of SSIA account holders were not regular savers.  If the Government matched the pension schemes on a euro for euro basis, many new savers would find this very attractive.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am more worried by what is not in this Bill.  I was very pleased that the Minister for Finance looked after a number of constituencies, his own included, on the River Shannon.  I welcome this.  Since I entered the D&aacute;il, I have been anxious to see such an initiative taken as regards my own area.  I am speaking in particular about Ireland West Airport at Knock.  This is a wonderful catalyst for the development of the west which has come on in leaps and bounds under Mr. Liam Scollan, its CEO, and chairman, Mr.  Joe Kennedy and his board.  It is a wonderful success story and it is vitally important for the area that this international airport has a special provision.  They are working on a 65-acre business park at present to facilitate knowledge-based industries and high-tech manufacturing in internationally traded companies.  They will be marketing this programme at the end of the second quarter this year.  I ask the Minister to think about this in the future because it is badly needed.  There is a great need for some positive discrimination.  The Minister has proven himself in this regard.  I have raised this in the D&aacute;il on several occasions, and I have been disappointed because there never has been any positive response.</P>
        <P>This is why I was pleasantly surprised that the Minister had introduced the Shannon-based scheme, and I had hoped he would do the same for Ireland West Airport, Knock.  It dealt with 35,000 passengers in December.  When one considers the enormous numbers coming into Dublin Airport, it is certainly in everyone&rsquo;s interest to have balanced regional development.  This is one way the Minister might have done this, through the Finance Bill.  I am very disappointed that such provision is not made.  There is a &euro;45.9 million investment programme in Knock airport, which has started.  It is looking for dedicated funding of &euro;30 million to extend the apron and for a number of other matters that need to be dealt with.  There must be some positive discrimination, however.  Banks will not invest in the west as they should.  They say there is an insufficient footfall there for industry as regards projects and so on.  It is strongly rumoured that the agencies are telling manufacturers in the west of Ireland to go to China and elsewhere.  Already IDA factories are being used as car showrooms.  It was a scandal that IDA factories on which the Government had to pay rent were lying empty.  Now they are being sold.  Therefore, this cannot be said any more.</P><Col N="1594"/>
        <P>The alarm bells are ringing because of the overdevelopment along the east coast.  If Ireland were afloat, the east coast would be well under water.  It would, therefore, make great sense to get away from the ass and cart pace at which people have to move in Dublin, as compared to the opportunities on offer in the underpopulated and underdeveloped west.  It would have made much sense for the Minister to have allowed this special scheme for manufacturing in the region, along the lines of that in Shannon Airport.  This would be of major use because we are still trying to catch up.  The Minister is well aware of the &euro;3.75 billion underspend in the national development plan in the BMW area.  That shows there is a serious problem.</P>
        <P>Ballina is an area which does not even have an industrial park.  IDA officials paid something like five visits since 2000 in the company of industrialists.  However, there is no industrial park to bring them to.  That fiasco is ongoing, and it must be realised that there is a great need for some type of tax incentivisation scheme for County Mayo and, above all, for Ireland West Airport, Knock.  The Minister has looked after the horses as regards allowances for the equine industry, but how about the <i>homo sapiens?</i>   They deserve some recognition too.  The west is still the most economically deprived area of Ireland.  I am glad to see the Minister preaching balanced regional development but I wish he would practise what he preaches.   Where there is a will there is a way, as I have said to him before.  However, the will at this time was for the Shannon basin.  I only wish it were there for the industrial zone at Ireland West Airport.</P>
        <P>Ballina has an unemployment rate of 11%, equivalent to twice the national average.  There are more people on the live register in Ballina than in the entire county of Roscommon.  We have lost a net total of 1,000 jobs net in the past nine years.  All told, there is a great need for a proper road into Ballina.  The N26 is an absolute disgrace.  I thank the Minister for his attention and ask him to bear in mind what I have just said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on introducing his third Finance Bill.  This is his third set of budgets and Finance Bills to come before the House, a trilogy.  It is something not many of his predecessors achieved and it gives us the opportunity to assess over a three-year period the Minister&rsquo;s medium-term plan and how it has succeeded. </P>
        <P>On the positive side the Minister has achieved to a certain extent a degree of redistribution that was quite beyond the ability or willingness of his immediate predecessor.  That said, such redistribution was quite modest and has been achieved at a time when the opportunity for wide scale reform could have been taken, but was not.  I appreciate the Minister operates under a certain <Col N="1595"/>number of constraints, including the fact that he has a coalition partner who apparently believes that a little inequality is no bad thing.  However, as we approach the general election it is not what the Government is promising in the recently announced national development plan but rather what it has achieved, particularly in its second term in office, that it will be judged on.  On those grounds there are scores of missed opportunities and this Finance Bill in particular highlights the mix and gather approach the Minister has taken to what may be achieved in the course of his brief.</P>
        <P>The Minister has closed a number of tax loopholes and that is to be commended.  However, it must be asked what the procedure was that allowed these loopholes to be created in the first instance.  Why was there not enough consideration at departmental level or why was this House not allowed to debate at committee level and identify these loopholes?  One particular loophole he has identified is the exemption for people who have been gifted property residences in which they lived for more than three years.  That has been a tax loophole since 1999 and he is closing it off now because he and his Department have discovered there is widespread abuse.  There is also an onus on the Minister to say, now that this loophole has been identified, how much it has cost in tax forgone, not just in terms of tax relief, but in its abuse.  The loophole was created by people who have exploited it and another, perhaps on a smaller scale, concerns the children of property owning parents renting accommodation in their own homes.  This seems to have been exploited at another level.  The fact that his Government has introduced tax reliefs, budget after budget, on an unthought and costly basis for the taxpayer is again something on which it will be judged.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The second area is of particular interest to the Green Party and something to which the Minister devoted a great deal of attention in his budget speech.  Some three pages of the 30-page speech were devoted to environmental matters.  He did not say much in those three pages.  The end result is that of the &euro;300 he promised to put aside, &euro;270 million will leave the country because we must pay Kyoto Protocol credits.  However, we now know that the Minister vastly underestimated the figure.  The EPA will soon announce figures showing that our carbon emission levels are actually rising.  The Minister based his figure of &euro;270 million on the premise that the cost of carbon credits and the amount needed would be much lower than is now the case.  Deputy Burton was of the view that the amount would double, but given the Minister&rsquo;s budget speech and his failure to take action in the Finance Bill, he is likely to make an underestimate that will make that in respect of the Residential Institutions Redress Board seem like a hiccup.  We could be talking about sums <Col N="1596"/>that reach &euro;1 billion or &euro;1.5 billion, owing to the measures the Government has chosen not to put in place and its decision to underestimate the scale of the problem.</P><?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>I see little or no reference in the Bill to environmental measures.  The Minister states some measures need the approval of the European Union.  Some of his much vaunted measures have taken 18 months to arrive, having been announced in previous budget speeches and Finance Bills.  At a time when the EPA informs us that the position on carbon will get far worse, the Minister and the Department have chosen to say nothing.  The three pages on environmental policy in a 30 page speech count for nothing in terms of the Government&rsquo;s credibility.</P>
        <P>What is so special about the horse breeding industry?  Why has the Minister decided that this industry, above all others, should be paying little or no tax?  It effectively pays no tax.  The measures introduced in this Finance Bill mean that there can be a carry-over from the current arrangement into the new one which will be put in place in August 2008.  The expenses incurred in running a stud farm can be counted twice, both to assess profit and against the tax liability.  The Minister is creating a capital allowance for the purchase of stallions that can be written off over a four-year period.  This invites comparisons with the old &ldquo;Scrap Saturday&rdquo; sketch of the cow that was transported back and forth over the Border.  I can see a future satire involving Sinbad the super stallion who will be sold every four years to different studs, with the amounts written off.  This is just like the loophole in risk equalisation which the Minister for Health and Children failed to spot.  If the Bill provides loopholes that allow measures to be changed after four years, such loopholes will be exploited.  The Minister has to explain why he has created this one.</P>
        <P>The Minister might be surprised to find that the Green Party supports business expansion schemes.  The net result of increasing indigenous industries is badly needed.  The difficulty we have with the Minister&rsquo;s proposed changes is that we have not properly assessed the effects of the current scheme.  The recent study which only affected 35% of those availing of BES schemes does not give us enough information to make decisions.  The Minister needs to be forthcoming, be it through the Revenue Commissioners or the Department, in releasing more detailed information on the people applying to participate in BES schemes.  We can then make a proper assessment of their real worth, which must be to increase the number of businesses and jobs in Irish indigenous businesses.</P>
        <P>The measures supposed to encourage environmental initiatives are almost insulting.  The Minister mentioned one category &mdash; recycling.  As it is not specified in the Bill, I suspect it will be open to abuse and that waste management companies <Col N="1597"/>will avail of the measure, rather than recycling companies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>A stud recycling scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister does his own recycling, but I would not say it is environmentally sustainable.  We hear too much of it in this House.</P>
        <P>It was leaked beforehand that sustainable energy sources would be recognised in the Bill for BES schemes, yet they have not been specified.  Another opportunity could have been provided for in the area of regional development.  Deputy Cowley mentioned County Mayo, but the situation in the Cork docklands is very much up in the air.  As an opportunity, the Finance Bill fails to tick many of the boxes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are eight sections in the Bill dealing with the financial aspects of the Criminal Justice Act.  They seem to be the only ones included in the Bill at the behest of the T&aacute;naiste.  The Bill refers to licence fees for the purchase of dangerous weapons and the three-year period for their achievement.  It seems there is a high degree of detail in one specific area.  The licence fees are very modest and the Government seems to be encouraging a tourist trade in crossbows and firearms.  Given the resources available to the Minister, why does he choose to seek such detail about such a small area?  He has ignored so many other areas, especially those about which he spoke at length in his budget speech.  He will not be surprised to learn that I will attempt to make amendments to the Bill in so far as Standing Orders allow me to do so.  Ultimately, my party cannot support the focus of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>When he launched the Finance Bill last week, I was astonished that the Minister for Finance had the audacity to claim that the Government was trying to use the tax system to ensure those on low and middle incomes benefited from the economic boom.  The evidence contradicts that claim absolutely.  Under the Government&rsquo;s tenure, successive income tax cuts have benefited high income individuals more in real terms than those on low incomes.  Meanwhile, tax expenditures have redistributed wealth regressively in favour of the already better off.  This trend is reinforced in the Bill.  If the Minister tried to use the tax system to ensure those on low and middle incomes benefited from the economic boom, he would eliminate unfair tax advantages for the better-off, review VAT charges which hit low income families hardest and increase the restrictions on the use of specified tax reliefs for high income individuals.</P>
        <P>The Bill gives effect to the budget announcement of a cut of 1% in the top rate of income tax.  Those on high incomes received the cumulative benefit of the increase in personal tax credits and the widening of the standard tax band.  They are <Col N="1598"/>the beneficiaries of the 1% cut in the top rate.  Contrary to the Minister&rsquo;s claims, those just below the average industrial wage of &euro;30,000 per annum gained least per week from the budget.  I pointed out during the debate on the budget that workers on such a wage gained &euro;8 per week, compared with gains of at least twice as much per week for those earning above &euro;35,000.  High income individuals were granted the highest increases in weekly pay as a result of the budget.  These are the facts.</P>
        <P>The Government has attempted to justify the cut in the top rate of tax by linking it to the current buoyant tax take.  It is true that more revenue than ever is flowing into the Exchequer, but from where is it coming?  As the Central Bank notes in its most recent quarterly bulletin published last month, &ldquo;a substantial factor in this has been the exceptionally large revenues derived from the property sector&rdquo;.  The Government has become ever more dependent on consumption taxes, particularly VAT.  The revenue generated from such taxes is far more open to fluctuation and contraction than that from other sources.  The unpredictability of the amount of revenue generated from these taxes has contributed largely to the Government&rsquo;s poor ability to project tax take.  The Central Bank report states:</P>
        <P LI="1">While these have increased much more rapidly than forecast from one year to the next, it is clear that such strong increases in revenue from this source cannot continue indefinitely.  It is prudent to provide for some perhaps significant easing in revenue from this source.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Central Bank is looking ahead.  The entirely wrong and imprudent thing to do in this context is to cut the top rate of income tax and narrow the tax base, thereby making the Government ever more dependent on taxes related to consumption and the property sector.  It needs to be in a position to ensure it has the revenue to provide public services, to fund social protection and to address infrastructural deficiencies, especially when the current rate of consumption and construction slows down, as it certainly will.</P>
        <P>As I have limited time in which to speak, I will focus on a small number of issues.  I will discuss many others during the Committee Stage debate.</P>
        <P>I would like to welcome a number of measures in the legislation.  While Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the decision to keep those on the minimum wage out of the tax net, it would have preferred it to apply in circumstances in which the minimum wage was increased to 60% of gross average industrial earnings.  This has also been sought by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the fact that those on the average industrial wage are to be kept within the standard tax band.  In addition, I welcome the increase in mortgage interest relief.  Sinn F&eacute;in had argued for such a measure in its pre-budget submission.  As we are <Col N="1599"/>enduring high interest rates following the five European Central Bank tax hikes in 2006, more could and should be done under this heading.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s newspapers have reported that the State&rsquo;s emissions output has again accelerated.  It is now heading for a level 25% higher than that of 1990 and 12% higher than the level set out in the Kyoto Protocol target.  This further acceleration is apparently being driven by increases in emissions from the transport sector, which brings me to one of the most bizarre aspects of the budget.  I refer to the need to introduce a higher rate of motor tax for vehicles which produce large emission levels, which should have been addressed in this legislation.  I tabled a parliamentary question on the matter to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, but it was kicked to one of his colleagues for answer later this month.  In his Budget Statement the Minister announced that the introduction of a high rate of motor tax for high emitting vehicles was to be delayed.  It seems that it will not come into effect until this time next year, and then only in relation to vehicles registered after January 2008.  Why did the Minister and his Government colleagues purposely give people a year&rsquo;s notice of this measure?  It amounts to an incentive to purchase high emitting vehicles throughout this year, which is exactly what is happening.  Sales of sports utility vehicles and similar vehicles soared in January, which is contrary to international trends in this regard.  In many countries a clear slowdown in the sale of high emitting vehicles is evident as a consequence of the actions of governments.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the Government announced that it would consider changing the rate of VRT in order that it would be based on the level of output of emissions.  Such a change is not actually being introduced, however.  For some inexplicable reason the Government has merely signalled that it will engage in a process of consultation in this regard.  While I welcome any form of consultation on the part of the Government, I wonder about the merits of such a process in this instance.  As other governments face the reality of climate change and move to implement measures to reduce emissions, the Government is long-fingering even these minor measures which would receive substantial support from the public.  I have to say its approach is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I question a number of other aspects of the Bill.  One of the more highly publicised aspects of the legislation is the proposed tourism investment scheme of property-based tax reliefs in the mid-Shannon corridor.  As a Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy, I want the Shannon region to be developed to its highest potential in tourism.  It is highly questionable whether the proposed scheme can go any way towards achieving that objective.</P>
        <P>As the finance spokesman of my party, I have made clear on numerous occasions Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s <Col N="1600"/>position that all tax exemption schemes should be ended, except when the economic and social value of such schemes outweighs their cost to the Exchequer.  The Indecon review of property-based tax incentives, already mentioned in the debate, recommended that any &ldquo;decision to introduce any new tax incentives should be informed by a formal assessment of the likely costs and benefits&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to tell the House whether a formal assessment of the likely costs and benefits has taken place in this case.  What is the projected cost of the scheme?  Indecon also recommended that &ldquo;where there is justification for government incentives the option of direct public expenditure as an alternative to tax incentives should be considered&rdquo;.  Was such an alternative considered?  I urge the Minister to answer these extremely important questions.</P>
        <P>We have been presented with no clear case for the introduction of the scheme for the mid-Shannon region.  Does the Government have a vision of what is ultimately lying ahead for the region and other parts of the country?  There must be a serious justification before new tax incentives can be introduced because such measures reduce the overall tax base and thereby impose higher tax burdens on average households which are not in a position to avail of many tax relief schemes.  Such incentives provide many people, especially high income earners, with opportunities to avoid paying their fair share.  While I wish the mid-Shannon region well, I need to get certain answers from the Minister.  Why has the line been drawn 12 km either side of this great national resource?</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>As the D&aacute;il will sit for just eight more weeks before the general election, it is important that the Opposition should continue to highlight its concerns about the health service, while outlining its solutions to such problems.  The Government&rsquo;s failure to reform the health service, after ten years in office, has landed us with an awful legacy.  As I said last week, the Government has no clear policies for the future of the health service.  It is clear that the policies published by the Government in the past have <Col N="1602"/>not been implemented to any significant degree.  The Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion before the House demonstrates that the health service continues to be poorly structured, after ten years of this Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Administration.  The national review of acute hospital bed needs under way will identify the number of acute beds which will be needed up to 2020.  That the review will tell us the number of beds we will require in 13 years&rsquo; time is a demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s crazy attitude to the health service.</P>
        <P>Another part of the amendment that deserves comment states: &ldquo;regrets that some patients have their operations postponed when priority is necessarily given to emergency cases; recognises that postponements cause upset and inconvenience for patients and their families...&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Inconvenience&rdquo; is not a word I would apply to Rosie.  This postponement did not cause inconvenience but a delayed diagnosis of her cancer.  As a result of the delayed diagnosis, she has more or less been handed a death sentence by the Government.</P>
        <P>During the debate on Private Members&rsquo; Business last week the Minister said the HSE had been instructed to provide an urgent colonoscopy within two weeks for those who require it.  I asked the Minister to define what was meant by an &ldquo;urgent colonoscopy&rdquo;.  If a patient presents to me with signs and symptoms of what could possibly be bowel cancer, an urgent colonoscopy is required.  A number of my patients had procedures cancelled and they were subsequently diagnosed with bowel cancer.  They do not have the disease to the extent suffered by Rosie and received treatment within a certain timeframe but it had a significant effect on their quality of life because they required more aggressive treatment because of the significant delay in receiving it.  I am a qualified doctor and do not send a patient for a colonoscopy unless I consider it urgent.  Every person who needs a colonoscopy should be seen as urgently as possible.  In Britain a great deal was made of the fact that in the NHS patients had to wait six weeks.  In this country one would not even get on the waiting list for a colonoscopy in six weeks.</P>
        <P>The amendment &ldquo;notes the significant increase in intensive care and general bed capacity at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital&rdquo;.  This gets around the comments by the T&aacute;naiste about crises being taken down from a shelf.  His insensitive remarks about the way patients are treated in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital shows an unbelievable arrogance.  When commentators from the back benches try to spin their way out of this problem, they say there has been a 50% increase in the number of intensive care beds in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  In actual numbers, one new intensive care bed has been provided in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in every year for the last five.  In a hospital which carries out such <Col N="1603"/>complex surgery one new intensive care bed per year can hardly be considered a record achievement by the Government.  It is time to put real doctors in our hospitals, get rid of the spin doctors from the Government benches and deliver these services.  It is a 50% increase on very little.  St. James&rsquo;s Hospital should have a massive intensive care unit in view of the complex surgery carried out there.</P>
        <P>There is also the Minister&rsquo;s co-location plan to provide new facilities on the campuses of public hospitals.  It was interesting to hear on the news this evening that she intends to sign these contracts in May but that she will also insist that the consultants&rsquo; contract is renegotiated in the next seven weeks.  I am glad there is some reality in the Department.  An investor would be mad to sign a contract for the new private hospitals without seeing what the new consultants&rsquo; contract will offer.  The success of these hospitals depends on a new private consultants&rsquo; contract, and there is none.</P>
        <P>Patient care is another issue, and the Minister has been extremely evasive when I have asked questions about it.  If consultants are taken out of the public hospitals, patients will be exposed to the care of less senior doctors.  The Minister will make the current situation worse.  In the private hospital one will see the consultants going home at 5 p.m. and the patients there will be under the care of doctors who are not in training and are unsupervised.  Both private and public patients, therefore, will get an extremely raw deal from what the Minister is offering.</P>
        <P>The amendment asks us to support the Minister in negotiating the consultants&rsquo; contract.  This time last year I offered her my full support when she said she would introduce public-only contracts if the negotiations did not get under way quickly.  At the time I asked her to put a timeframe on the negotiations and suggested that it be the end of March.  Nothing was done.  Why did the Minister do nothing throughout 2006 to push the consultants&rsquo; contract talks forward?  There are eight weeks of the D&aacute;il session remaining.  If there is any delay, we will be in the middle of an election campaign with no new consultants&rsquo; contract.  The Minister should be more honest about why this process fell apart.</P>
        <P>The best way forward is for the Minister to chair the talks.  At least then we would know whether the talks collapsed because of what the consultants or the Department and the HSE were doing.  The consultants&rsquo; contract talks of the last three years have been the most unbelievable nonsense and I am surprised the Minister allowed it to continue under her stewardship of the Department.  I would not mind if it was the former Minister, Deputy Martin, given his failure to act in a number of other crises.  The Taoiseach should have fired him or one of his Ministers of State for <Col N="1604"/>what happened with the illegal nursing home charges.</P>
        <P>As a result of the Taoiseach blinking on that issue, political accountability in the Government has gone into freefall.  One need only consider the issues that have arisen in the past 12 months.  There was the failure to act in the Leas Cross crisis, for which we still do not know if anybody will bear responsibility.  Tonight we saw on the &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo; that a lady who worked in the blood laboratory will become a scapegoat for the huge hepatitis C crisis.  We have seen what happened in Leas Cross and to a number of patients in the nursing home sector during the Minister&rsquo;s term of office but nobody is taking responsibility for it.  What will happen in that case?  Will a junior clerk in some department in north County Dublin take the rap in five or six years?  It is a shocking disgrace in respect of how the health service is being run.</P>
        <P>What happened with BUPA and with regard to the loophole that will impact on the private patients of VHI?  A total of 1.6 million customers of VHI will see their premiums go through the roof.  Much of this is related to Government policy and the fact that the Minister is trying to build co-location hospitals and increasing charges for private beds.  A former colleague of the Minister, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, is trying to impose sanctions from elsewhere in Europe.  In addition, the usual health inflation issues will impact on premiums.  What happened with regard to the BUPA loophole, of which the Minister was informed a year ago?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has failed to deliver an implementation plan for the cancer strategy.  This means the policy guiding Government cancer services is the one produced by Deputy Noonan in 1996.  I studied the Minister&rsquo;s response to the Private Members&rsquo; motion last week.  Of the eight issues she raised, five related to what she would do in the future.  Only three related to what had been done over ten years in power.  That is a hopeless record.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to find out the truth.  The Minister, for example, says a sum of &euro;44 million has been provided for primary care teams.  There are no such teams in County Wexford.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s visit to the county next week and hope that, like the Scarlet Pimpernel, she might&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy, with Deputy McManus, could listen to the health debate.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1605"/>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have searched high and low across County Wexford and still cannot find them.  There should be at least three in the county by now.</P>
        <P>The Government gave a commitment to provide 800 long-term beds in the public sector this year.  However, in a response to a parliamentary question about the programme for additional publicly-owned extended care beds, the Minister said an additional 446 beds would be provided this year.  The other 400 will be provided in 2008.  This is simply spin that she is doing something for the health service.  The reality is different.  For that reason it is difficult to know whether the &euro;400 million provided for care of the elderly services is actually spent there.</P>
        <P>The former director of primary care services in the HSE once attended a meeting of the health committee.  When he was questioned about the number of home help hours being provided by the HSE, he said he did not know the number, as the HSE had no way of measuring the total number.  We do not know if the services the Minister says are being provided for care of the elderly in the community are being delivered by the HSE.</P>
        <P>It is not the only area of the health service where everything appears to be disjointed and out of kilter.  It is possible the nurses will go on strike, although the Minister and the Taoiseach do not have much to say about it.  The Minister places a great deal of emphasis on what the general practitioner and primary care can do in the community.</P>
        <P>From next year no doctors will be trained in Cork because all those who train young doctors there have pulled out owing to the protracted negotiations with the HSE.  A successful training system for young doctors has collapsed and is imploding.  Significant numbers of qualifying physiotherapists are not being employed by the HSE, even though they are badly needed.  Occupational therapists play a significant and important role in defining services for those with disabilities and the elderly who need facilities to make it possible for them to live in their own home.  The Minister constantly refers to people living in their own home and the care of people with disabilities, yet one of the key factors in the delivery of such services &mdash; occupational therapists &mdash; are not available.  It is unacceptable that the waiting time to see an occupational therapist is six months.</P>
        <P>The sham report on radiotherapy services produced in July 2005 shows that the Minister has contempt for those who require radiotherapy.  It is also a sign of arrogance and a pointer to the way the HSE works.  I stated I have my own concerns about political accountability and political interference in the HSE and stated I would like to see the HSE reined in.  The report demonstrates what I mean by the need to rein it in.  In <Col N="1606"/>the days of the former health boards there was political interference but also political responsibility to some degree.  Now we are left with the political interference and no political responsibility.  The Minister constantly tells us that these are issues for the HSE to deal with but there is evidence of significant political interference in the health service, a matter about which we will question Professor Drumm in time to come.  The response of the board of the HSE to this allegation is a clear indication of how it occurs.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael will improve access to primary care for both young and old.  We will provide a doctor-only medical card for every child under the age of five years.  Both my wife and I are general practitioners but we have often had to weigh up whether to give one of our children an antibiotic.  We have three young children under the age of six years.  The financial element in a parent&rsquo;s decision on whether his or her young child requires a medical opinion needs to be taken away.  This is the reason for the Fine Gael proposal.  It proposes to provide health insurance for every child under the age of 16 as a way of making all children equal, rather than simply paying lip service by means of a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights as proposed by the Government.</P>
        <P>I will allow other colleagues to speak on the other Fine Gael policy proposals.  Reform is about matching resources such as manpower, beds, theatre space and occupational therapy services and dealing with industrial relations issues.  It is about time the Government showed real leadership in delivering services for the people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Fine Gael for ensuring this motion was jointly proposed by the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  The motion sets out a road map for a Government that has lost its way.  Instead of consistency, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have lurched alarmingly in different directions on health policy.  Instead of commitments made honourably, the two Government parties spewed out promises that were dishonoured within months of the last election.  There were to be no cutbacks, an end to waiting lists, 200,000 medical cards, 200,000 GP-only cards and 3,000 acute hospital beds.  The reality is a shameful record.  In 2002 the Government health strategy promised &ldquo;immediate benefits for substantial numbers of people and the construction of a health system which in little more than half a decade will be immeasurably improved&rdquo;.  I remind the Minister that we have reached that half decade and no one believes that the promised improvements have materialised.</P>
        <P>On the contrary there is a low level of morale among staff and a high level of anxiety among patients about many aspects of the health service.  More than anything there is an aching need for reassurance in the public psyche.  Many people <Col N="1607"/>have simply lost faith that the immeasurable improvements will ever be made.  The Government has clearly failed in the task it set itself but those on this side of the House have not.  For the first time well in advance of an election, two major political parties in opposition have engaged in the preparation of a major health plan.  It is a significant initiative which provides the springboard for a new and better Government capable of meeting the needs of patients and those who care for them.</P>
        <P>I remind the House of the record: of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital inquiry report, the report on the death of Mr. Pat Joe Walsh, the report on the death of Mr. Peter McKenna, the report on the death of R&oacute;is&iacute;n Ruddle and the Leas Cross report.  These are only some of the reports that have examined the institutional abuse of elderly, frail people, the surgical mutilation of young women and the death of a middle-aged man who bled to death in a ward of a modern Irish hospital.</P>
        <P>There is also the anecdotal evidence that arrives on our desks on a regular basis.  I refer to the patient who was not informed he had contracted MRSA and whose family only discovered the fact when it appeared on the death certificate, the patient who had been waiting more than five months for open heart surgery because he did not have private health insurance and the case with which we are all familiar, the tragic case of Rosie from Kilkenny whose life has been so tragically foreshortened.  The evening news today was full of stories about health.  One of the issues not referred to by Deputy Twomey is the problem of nursing shortages in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  I refer to paediatric nurses not in place, accident and emergency patients on trolleys and staff members concerned about the risk to patients.</P>
        <P>Last March, the Minister was forced into declaring a national emergency with regard to the accident and emergency departments around the country when it emerged that 500 people were on trolleys.  There has been ongoing disagreement about the accurate and exact number of people on trolleys.  Last night I telephoned the person in charge of the accident and emergency department in a major Dublin hospital.  She painted a picture which is radically different from the bulletins issued by the HSE on a regular basis which state that things are getting much better.  A manager of an accident and emergency department is under fierce pressure because some patients on trolleys never appear in the HSE statements as they have not been seen by a doctor.  I refer to the case of one old lady who was there from morning to night, with no food and sitting in a wheelchair, and at 11 p.m. she still had not been seen by a doctor.  That woman will never appear on a HSE bulletin because only people who have <Col N="1608"/>been seen by a doctor and are waiting for a bed will be counted on the trolley watch.</P>
        <P>Those working in accident and emergency departments face considerable pressures.  Speaking on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last month, Dr. John McInerney, emergency medicine consultant at the Mater hospital, said, &ldquo;Over recent months there has been a regression to the same problem as last year&rdquo;.  A new trend has emerged as a result of the concentration on shortening the time of accident and emergency patients on trolleys.  The cancellation of elective procedures is escalating.  The Taoiseach, when asked, refuses to countenance the word &ldquo;cancellation&rdquo;, but for anybody being told to wait for cancer care or a heart operation there is no other description that matches their experience of finding that all the intensive care beds are full.  At a time when St. James&rsquo;s Hospital did not have enough intensive care beds to meet its needs and major procedures were cancelled, intensive care beds in another Dublin hospital were lying idle.  They had not been commissioned owing to a lack of staff and resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>To which hospital is the Deputy referring?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I will tell the Minister afterwards.  I am more cautious than the Minister when I make statements but I am quite happy to give that information to her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it a public hospital?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is a public hospital.  I would have thought the Minister would have heard about it.  However, I will be happy to give her the information.</P>
        <P>With regard to the situation in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, we hear from the Minister that we have too many nurses but time and again facilities cannot be used because there is a shortage of nurses.  This raises issues regarding the consultants&rsquo; contract.  While I want the contract renegotiated &mdash; it is a scandal that it has persisted for so long &mdash; I also want to ensure it does not become inoperable and the current nonsensical problem, whereby hospital consultants are unable to work due to shortages of staff, beds or operating theatres, is not prolonged.  Regardless of what one thinks of hospital consultants, most of them work hard, like to work and feel frustrated when prevented from performing operations or procedures because the Government, despite the unprecedented level of resources at its disposal, has failed to provide the necessary infrastructure.  Overlaying this scenario with additional consultants without first providing an infrastructure will create problems.  The Minister must be honest about what she proposes.</P>
        <P>While it is popular to take on the consultants, what does it mean in reality?  Resolving problems in the health service requires much more expla<Col N="1609"/>nation, thought, investment and reform.  While it is easy to have a populist catch cry, it is difficult to rectify the problem.  The Minister will have my party&rsquo;s support if she takes the correct approach but we will be quick to point out any flimflam should she engage in it on this issue.</P>
        <P>It is worth reiterating the proposals outlined in the motion because they address a number of the core problems in the health service, not all of which occur at hospital level.  The Labour Party recognises that a rebalancing towards primary care is critical because too many of those who end up in hospital do not need to be there.  We must shift many patients towards accessing care at community and primary care levels.  Serious reform of health service management is also required.  We propose a major drive towards preventative medicine and children&rsquo;s health through the provision of medical cards to 40% of the population and free general practitioner cards for all children under five years of age.  The development of an insurance-based system for those aged under 16 years is a first step towards a truly integrated service, to which both the Labour Party and Fine Gael Party are committed.</P>
        <P>The Government side has produced a daft proposal to build private, for-profit hospitals on public lands.  It tries to sell the notion that these facilities will result in the delivery of 1,000 additional public beds.  The Government&rsquo;s approach will not deliver 1,000 beds because it is not a case of substituting like for like.  In addition, the proposal does not enjoy broad support either on the medical side or at political level.</P>
        <P>Interestingly, Professor Drumm implied criticism of the Minister&rsquo;s proposal when he expressed the fear that, having entered a hospital&rsquo;s grounds through the same gate, private and public patients will go their separate ways, with the former accessing a nice hospital with hanging baskets and the latter accessing an under-resourced and inadequate public hospital.  Anyone examining the Minister&rsquo;s approach of developing for-profit hospitals at the expense of building public capacity would have major concerns.  I sincerely hope the Minister, who has no mandate to go down this route, will fail in her endeavour and will not reach her target of signing a large number of contracts.  Parties on this side are committed to ending this policy, which is bad for the health service, to ensure we secure best value for money and optimum patient care in future.</P>
        <P>It is important to consider the content of the Government amendment.  While amendments tabled by all Governments are self-congratulatory in tone, the amendment before us is dishonest.  It states, for example, that there are more medical cards now than in 1997.  Given that the proportion of the population with a medical card has declined from approximately 34% to roughly 29% since 1997, this statement is not true.  The <Col N="1610"/>rules of the game require that the Official Record reflect the truth.</P>
        <P>The GP-only medical card, of which 38,000 have been issued, is a joke.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure is 60,000. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>On 17 January I received a reply from the Minister indicating that 38,000 GP-only cards had been delivered.  She now claims the figure is 60,000.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to note the figure has increased rapidly.  The publicity campaign is working. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to provide accurate information in her replies to parliamentary questions.  In many cases, Deputies do not receive any information.  I am perfectly justified in citing information included in a reply to a parliamentary question, dated 17 January, which indicated that 38,000 GP-only medical cards had been delivered.  </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us not quibble about a difference of a few thousand.  The figure will undoubtedly continue to increase but I must depend on the latest information provided in reply to parliamentary questions.  Even if the Minister&rsquo;s figure is correct, she gave a commitment that 200,000 GP-only medical cards would be issued.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme for Government does not include any such commitment.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, the Minister&rsquo;s word is not her bond.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>A different party made a commitment in its election manifesto.  The Deputy should get the facts right. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I find it odd that a senior Cabinet Minister should continually interrupt during Private Members&rsquo; business.  She promised 200,000 GP-only medical cards. </P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest the Minister thinks before she speaks and I will try to do likewise.  We are approaching the end of the Government&rsquo;s term in office.  Its failure to meet a commitment it made on GP-only medical cards is but one example from a litany of broken promises with which patients must cope daily. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this vital motion on the health service.  Once again, people living in the Cavan-Monaghan region are the victims of bed shortages in the main Dublin hospitals.  In one case a patient has been waiting in Monaghan General Hospital since before Christmas to have urgent, life-saving heart surgery.  If it were not for the high care unit in the hospital, which the Health Service Executive wants to close, I have no doubt the man in question would not be alive today.  He was ready to travel yesterday morning but it transpired that a bed was not available.  This morning he was given special medication to prepare him for the operation but, again, a bed was not available.  Others are clearly being given priority.</P>
        <P>It is unacceptable to right-thinking people that a state-of-the-art theatre in Monaghan General Hospital is lying idle when more than 40,000 elective operations have been cancelled in the past two and half years.  Only this week, I received a six-page report detailing the trauma a man from County Monaghan experienced in a private hospital on the outskirts of Mullingar.  Although its services are covered by the VHI and the Government&rsquo;s National Treatment Purchase Fund, it has not been inspected or subject to the same type of reports or inquiries as Monaghan General Hospital or other hospitals in the north east.  The private hospital answered in writing the litany of complaints received without any denial, accepting that the complaints were justified.  Surely, the first thing the Health Service Executive should do is fully to utilise the equipment, facilities and personnel it has in place in its own units before throwing away money to services that are unacceptable.  I know the Minister got that six-page letter.</P>
        <P>For the past ten years, it has been clearly accepted that we have a shortage of consultants, specialists and general practitioners.  It is nothing short of a joke, however, to see the present Government and especially the Minister for Health and Children, becoming so active in an effort to solve, or be seen to solve, all these problems weeks before an election.</P>
        <P>Patients who desperately need physiotherapy cannot obtain such services in the south Monaghan region because none is available in Drogheda.  However, none of the physiotherapists who finished their final examinations last year got employment in the HSE.</P>
        <P>People in the north-east will not forget that the Minister and her Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues have <Col N="1612"/>failed to deliver the services they guaranteed five years ago.  They knew in their hearts that they had no intention of getting involved.  I was glad to hear the Minister is going to Wexford this week.  We would be glad to see her coming up to Monaghan also.  I know it is a long journey of 80 miles but it would be worthwhile.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Would I be welcome?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister would have been welcome if she had come on time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>And the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael played a major role in getting services brought back on stream at Monaghan General Hospital.  Both our party leader and Deputy Twomey were up there two days in a row trying to do something about the situation.  No doubt, they will provide the extra beds, extra medical cards, the 1,500 consultants needed and an additional 1,500 convalescent beds.  In their short two and a half years in Government, Fine Gael and Labour left a proud record of achievement in the health services and the economy generally.  I have no doubt that they will do the same again, if given the mandate.</P>
        <P>We hear a great deal about primary care teams and home help packages, but when one seeks such services in the Cavan-Monaghan region one does not find them.  All areas have a right to fair play and no services, including hospital services, should be withdrawn from a region until a workable alternative is available.  That is not happening, however, and it is a disgrace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion, which has been proposed by my colleagues Deputies Twomey and McManus.  I am disappointed by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s remarks earlier in response to questions posed by Deputy Kenny concerning the roll-out of the BreastCheck service and cervical screening.  The Taoiseach deliberately tried to throw sand in our faces by attempting to give the House the impression that Deputy Kenny was mixing up the issues of diagnosis and treatment.  It is clear that both BreastCheck and cervical screening are designed to see if there are difficulties and to make diagnoses.  There is no disagreement on the fact that treatment is the next issue that comes into play.  I do not believe these services will be rolled out by the end of this year, which is the new time-frame that has been announced.  The slow pace of delivery on these services has been evident to women around the country.  It is nothing short of disgraceful.  I raised this matter in the House last week.  Some 16 nurses in the midlands area have been trained for the past two years to carry out cervical screening.  They are ready, willing and able to do it but they must get <Col N="1613"/>the HSE&rsquo;s consent to proceed.  There is no good excuse as to why this has not happened.</P>
        <P>Last year, 1,199 operations were cancelled in the Midlands Regional Hospital in Tullamore.  The Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s colleague in my constituency tried to say that if we have a problem with this we are just against the staff involved, but that is not the case.  That this number of operations was cancelled in one year is symptomatic of the serious problems facing the entire health service.  The hospital services only four counties so that indicates a huge number of cancelled operations for that region.  It proves that we need urgent investment in step-down facilities and the establishment of urgent care centres to free up extra beds.</P>
        <P>Hospitals should operate on a full-time basis.  At weekends, one sees empty beds in hospitals and in my constituency I frequently hear of people being sent home on Friday evenings and asked to return on Monday mornings.  That should not happen.  I realise that extra capacity is required for emergencies but hospitals should not send sick people home at weekends, as is often the case.  That matter needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight the dangers faced by hospital staff in accident and emergency units.  I have spoken to nursing staff and the Garda about an incident in Tullamore last week.  Garda&iacute; had to be called to put somebody into an ambulance and then had to follow the patient to the hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency room where they spent much of the evening keeping a woman under control at great risk to others, including themselves.  Had those garda&iacute; not been available due to another crisis in the town, with the limited number of garda&iacute; on duty, hospital staff would have suffered the consequences.  We should examine others proposals and in this context I support my colleague&rsquo;s idea of wet rooms to ensure that safety for hospital staff and other patients is a priority.</P>
        <P>I reiterate my opposition to the Minister&rsquo;s proposals to build private hospitals on public hospital sites.  It is accepted that, by their very nature, private hospitals want to make money, so they will cherrypick the most profitable and least care-intensive procedures.  They are there to make money.  However, public hospitals&rsquo; land is a diminishing resource, especially in our major towns, so it should be kept for public use.</P>
        <P>I also question the facilities available in the community because they are putting pressure on our hospital system.  For example, Edenderry with a population of 9,000 has only four GPs.  Over one weekend last year, two of the GPs were sick and a third was on holidays so one GP was left to cover 9,000 people.  There is still no out-of-hours patient service in the midlands, so the only alternative for such people is to attend an accident and emergency unit.  The lack of an ambulance service in a town such as Edenderry causes <Col N="1614"/>its own difficulties.  These matters have to be examined.</P>

	<P>On the issue of therapies, some of which were mentioned by Deputy Twomey, while some physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and psychologists can gain employment, they are still not available locally, particularly for children who need such services.  The waiting lists for the vast majority of those therapies are disgraceful, if people can get on them at all.  Giving a child a few hours of speech and language therapy for a year is insufficient.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We all acknowledge that, from the taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective, expenditure on health has increased four-fold in ten years.  We also know that in 2006, more than 1 million patients were treated in our public hospitals, either on an inpatient or day-case basis.  We know 2.5 million patients were seen in our outpatient departments, 1.3 million arrived at accident and emergency units and there were 65,000 births.  By any standards, for a country with population of 4.3 million, that is a considerable output of activity, which was performed by the approximately 120,000 staff working in the health services, not including those working in primary care, community care or continuing care.</P><?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The purpose of the health reform agenda is to ensure that as we invest more money in new facilities and treatments, we also change the way we do business so we can have a better and speedier experience for patients.  Many of the initiatives pursued by Government in the past ten years had this aim, in particular the establishment of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which sought to use the facilities available in this jurisdiction or, in the case of some treatments, in other jurisdictions to treat those waiting longest on the public hospital waiting lists.  I am happy to say almost 60,000 patients have been treated to date.  Instead of people waiting two to five years for 17 of the top 20 procedures, they wait on average two to five months, which is a huge improvement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking from my experience and it is not the case.  There is no way any <Col N="1618"/>of my patients are being seen in two to five months for procedures.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Minister to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is false.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not true.  What goes on the record should be true.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>There is no provision for interruptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>People do not get on the waiting lists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the data verified by the National Treatment Purchase Fund and it is fact.</P>
        <P>There is great debate about hospital beds.  Since the health strategy was introduced, 1,200 hospital beds, both day and inpatient beds, have been put into the public hospital system.  On average, we have invested in 170 new beds per year whereas in the three years preceding 1997, there were 30 new beds per year.  The debate is not about the number of beds; it is about ensuring we use whatever beds we have as effectively and efficiently as possible.</P>
        <P>Patients in this country spend 50% more time in an acute hospital bed for the top 20 procedures than they do in Australia, for example.  They spend between 3.5 and 5.5 days in an acute bed for an appendix operation whereas in many countries they would go home the day after such a procedure.  For a hip replacement, the period in hospital is 11.5 days.  There is no point in having the taxpayer constantly invest in more facilities if we do not also deal with the length of stay of patients in the acute hospital system.  Central to the length of stay is the new consultant contract of employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about the average stay in Irish hospitals in 2005.  Central to appropriate discharge policy is having a consultant in the hospital whenever one is required, and certainly to have 24-7 cover for the main specialties.  The reality is that if this does not happen, daily ward rounds and daily discharges cannot happen.  We all know that doctors who are not at consultant level tend to admit people more frequently and do not tend to make decisions on discharges except when the consultant is away on holidays or otherwise.</P><Col N="1619"/>
        <P>Above all else, with this new consultant contract we want to ensure consultants work on a 24-7 basis and as part of a team, not as single operators.  We want to ensure a clinical director is in charge of that team because everybody will acknowledge that having administration and management interface with clinicians does not deliver positive outcomes as far as best practice is concerned.  That is how the best hospitals in the world are organised &mdash; indeed, Ireland has some small examples of hospitals organised on the clinical directorate model.  That is the essence of the contract of employment the Government wants for new consultants, hopefully with as many of the current consultants as possible working in our health care system.</P>
        <P>With regard to the public private mix, the Deputies opposite talk about co-location as if we had no private activity in our public hospitals.  Governments for many years, certainly since the 1970s, have ensured that when a hospital is built, 20% of the beds are private beds.  In our major hospitals, the situation is as outlined by Deputy McManus, namely, there is a private wing or private wards and the beds in those wards are only available to private patients, insured patients.  No matter what public patient case arrives, no matter how urgent, the patient cannot access those beds, and that is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I beg the Deputy&rsquo;s pardon.  Private patients&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Emergency patients have access to private beds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The private beds are ring-fenced for private patients.  There may be an occasional exception, but that is the reality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Furthermore, if a private patient, insured patient arrives in a public hospital, no matter what bed that patient is in, the consultant gets a fee for that patient.  I have described it previously as being akin to having an airline where the pilots got paid for all the business class passengers, even if they sat in the economy seats.  It is ludicrous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Who gave them that contract?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>These are the factors that mitigate against public patients getting access to services in the public hospital system when they require them.  It is not good enough and must end.</P><Col N="1620"/>
        <P>There are 2,500 private beds out of 13,500 beds in our public hospitals.  I want to move 1,000 of those beds from the private system to the public system.  I want to convert them into public beds so all patients can have access to them so the nurses, the administration, the management and all of the radiology and pathology facilities, which are paid for by the taxpayers, are available to all patients, not just some.  I want to replace those beds by having a private facility built, invested in and managed by private individuals and companies.  The land will not be given away, it will be either sold or leased.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister foresee any problems?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Twomey suggests there will be clinical issues.  Is he suggesting there are clinical issues at St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital in Dublin, which is a co-location hospital, or at the Mater hospital?  I do not believe that is the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is making a bigger issue.  Significantly sicker patients are being moved out of a hospital.  Serious clinical issues could arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am simply converting private beds to public beds, a policy I would have thought would win fairly universal support in this country.  It is not correct to suggest there is not much support.  For example, the medical teams in eight of our biggest hospitals are involved in co-location projects throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>They make money from them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is huge interest in co-location because people see it as an effective way of achieving additional capacity.  It is effective because we will get the beds for no more than 48% of the cost of providing them in the traditional way.  That is a fact.  They will be provided quicker and cheaper through this model than through any other.  I do not believe a private facility within a public hospital should have nurses and all other facilities paid for by the taxpayers.  No company would tolerate a situation where a core group of its workers were working within its operations for one of its competitors, using its computers, diagnostics and equipment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>

	<P>Deputy McManus raised the issue of medical cards.  For the Deputy to compare the number of medical cards in terms of a percentage of the population given the situation in 1997 does not stand up.  In 1997 there was 11% unemployment and 6% long-term unemployment and take-home pay was 45% lower.  There is no comparison.</P>

Will Deputy Twomey&rsquo;s proposal be compulsory and will the service be provided free to all of them?  These are significant issues.</P>
        <P>I must be honest about this.  Twenty years ago, it was Progressive Democrats policy to ensure universal insurance for everybody.  However, when analysed and studied, the proposal caused serious problems.  First, it is a compulsory tax on some and second, the insurance companies decide what health facilities are kept open and what hospitals to do business with depending on whether they like their rates.  In such a scenario, the insurers drive where the activity happens.  In a system like ours, where we are committed to paying the salaries of those we have employed for the rest of their working lives and their pensions, there are serious issues with universal coverage.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>We are talking about the system for which the Minister is responsible tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am dealing with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The people of Monaghan would enjoy listening to this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of nurses, they make up the largest number in the health care system at 35% of the workforce.  We have the highest ratio of nurses in the health system, not just registered nurses, with 15.5 per 1,000, the highest in the OECD.  In the workforce there are 12.2 nurses per 1,000.  In Canada that figure is seven, across the EU it is approximately 8.5 and in the UK it is eight.  We have a lot of nurses in the health care system.</P><Col N="1623"/>
        <P>As I have said previously and not just with regard to nurses and other allied professions, we need different patterns of working and different skill mixes.  We need people working as part of teams and longer days from some of the allied professionals because patients do not just get sick between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  All of these issues must be addressed in the context of reform of work practices in the health care system.  Otherwise the reform will not work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the Minister address them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>We know the problems, we want answers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Within the health system I meet well motivated individuals from different specialties and each one tells me we need so many beds for each specialty.  If I added them all up, we would need to double the number of beds we have in the system.  We cannot adopt a piecemeal approach.  We must work on the basis that everybody works together to deliver the service and that the system responds to patients when needed.  This is particularly the case at weekends, for example, with regard to care of the elderly.</P>
        <P>The focus now is on trying to strengthen primary, community and continuing care, which gets 65% of the health budget, despite the fact that hospitals tend to form the biggest part of public debate.  Primary, community and continuing care must remain the emphasis as we move forward.  I am pleased that the new out-of-hours service on the northside of Dublin, which serves 500,000 people, has been successful.  There has been a positive response to the service and it is incredible we did not have it until recently and that three doctors were expected to cover the on-call service for that population base.  It is for that reason significant pressures were placed on hospitals on the northside of Dublin.</P>
        <P>I accept there are gaps in the out-of-hours service &mdash; Deputy Enright mentioned Tullamore &mdash; but over 80% of the population is covered by an out-of-hours service.  Generally, where the service operates, it works well and is responsive to the needs of patients.  The service has experienced doctors, general practitioners, dealing with patients that require services after 5 p.m. and over the weekend.</P>
        <P>I want to deal with the issue of the cancer report and radiotherapy strategy.  On behalf of the Government I issued a policy directive to the HSE to provide this facility in a number of centres around the country and two satellite centres in Waterford and Limerick, and to do so on the basis of a public private partnership by 2011.  The management of the HSE felt this was not deliverable, but the board of the HSE did not accept that and neither do I.  When we see the <Col N="1624"/>facilities that sprang up over a two-year period in Whitfield in Waterford, I cannot accept that we cannot roll out radiotherapy facilities over the next four years.  Last week, the board of the HSE confirmed the facilities will be provided in that kind of timeframe.  We must all, myself included, think outside the box to find speedier responses to issues confronting patients in our health care system.</P>
        <P>Patient safety must govern where services happen at hospital level.  Up to recently, 35 hospitals in the country performed breast surgery.  This number has been reduced and must be reduced further.  International evidence, which has been backed up by what I have been told here, shows that where surgery is performed by a unit that does not carry out at least 100 similar surgical procedures a year the outcome is not good.  Our outcomes across a number of cancers do not compare favourably with other European countries.</P>
        <P>The one area where we perform extraordinarily well is that of children&rsquo;s cancer.  When we moved children&rsquo;s cancer haematology from Tallaght Hospital to Crumlin Hospital and centralised it, the outcomes improved by 70%, which proves when we bring the expertise together and centralise the planning of the service for delivery on a more localised basis, we get better outcomes.  We must have the courage to do the same in other areas throughout the country where international evidence and best practice dictate this should be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to deal with a number of issues raised in the motion before the House.</P>
        <P>The development of primary care services is an essential component of the health service reform process.  In a developed primary care system, 90% to 95% of people&rsquo;s day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting.  The emphasis is on keeping people well and supporting them so they can live in the community rather than in institutional care.</P>
        <P>The key objective is to give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, home helps and others.  These teams will be able to provide people with integrated, comprehensive services to meet their health and social care needs in the communities where they live.  This has been characterised as providing the right care, in the right place, at the right time.</P>
        <P>Funding totalling &euro;32 million has been provided in 2006 and 2007 for the establishment of 200 primary care teams involving 600 new frontline professionals.  Approximately 450 general practitioners are currently involved in teams, with a further 700 projected to join teams in 2007.</P><Col N="1625"/>
        <P>In November 2004, as part of the health Estimate the Government set a number of priorities including the provision of an additional 30,000 medical cards and the introduction of a new benefit, the GP visit card which would be available for up to a further 200,000 people.  The Government provided the HSE with an additional &euro;60 million for these measures.  Last month 1.221 million people held a medical card, almost 77,000 more people than two years ago.  On 25 January, almost 58,000 people held GP visit cards.  Since their introduction, an average of 4,000 people have received a GP visit card each month.  Approximately 30% of the population now has free access to the services of a GP under the general medical services scheme.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children introduced the GP visit card as an innovative measure to provide a graduated benefit so that people on moderate incomes, and especially parents with young children who do not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred from visiting their GP on cost grounds.</P>
        <P>Significant changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility is assessed.  Those measures now mean that income is assessed after income tax and PRSI.  The income guidelines, including allowances made for children, were increased by a cumulative 29% in 2005.  In addition, allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage or rent, child care and cost of travelling to work.  In June 2006, the Minister agreed to a further adjustment in the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards.  They are now 50% higher than those in respect of ordinary medical cards.</P>
        <P>With the increased number of people in employment, the continuing bright economic situation nationally, and people on higher wages, a greater proportion of the population can access services using their own means.</P>
        <P>In making policy changes, the Minister sought to address the needs of people on low and moderate incomes by ensuring that they were not deterred on cost grounds from accessing GP services.</P>
        <P>Between 2000 and 2006, approximately &euro;139 million was allocated to the HSE to develop out-of-hours GP co-operatives.  Those figures do not include the fees of participating doctors.  In 2007, the Government provided a further &euro;3 million to meet the full-year cost of co-operative developments commenced in 2006.  GP co-operative services are now available in all HSE areas, providing part or full coverage in all counties.  In late November 2006, the north Dublin GP out-of-hours service commenced providing services to a population of approximately 500,000 people.  As with other GP out-of-hours co-operative services, patients can contact the service using a lo-call telephone number to receive medical advice and, <Col N="1626"/>as required, be seen at a treatment centre or at home by a GP.</P>
        <P>The Government accepts that we must ensure that sufficient general practitioners are trained to meet the future needs of the population.  Agreement has been reached with the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and the HSE on an increase of 66 GP vocational trainee places, on a phased basis.  To date the Government has funded 44 such places in line with that phasing.</P>
        <P>I now come to the vexed topic of postponed operations.  The public acute hospital system admits over 1 million patients overnight or as day cases annually.  The number of operations postponed represents a small percentage of the overall activity of acute hospitals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It was 40,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I stress that it is a very small percentage of the total.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a great many people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is regrettable that some patients have their operations postponed, and everyone recognises that it can cause upset and inconvenience to them and their families.  The public hospital system endeavours to keep postponements to a minimum and to have postponed operations rescheduled as soon as possible.  However, owing to the nature of the demands on the acute hospital system, in some instances it is necessary to reschedule planned treatment when priority must be given to emergency cases or for a variety of other reasons, such as infection control.</P>
        <P>The issue of postponing elective admissions to hospital was highlighted last week in the case of St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  The HSE, having been made aware of recent pressure on ICU capacity at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, has offered full support to hospital management to fast-track post-acute patients to other settings and free ICU beds.  Discussions have also begun with hospital management with a view to increasing the number of high-dependency beds at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised me that intensive care capacity at the hospital has increased over the past three years, with an additional five intensive care beds now available on top of the existing nine.  It is also worth noting that overall bed numbers at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital have increased by 140 in recent years.</P>
        <P>The Minister has already mentioned the increase in consultant numbers in 2006.  Of the 125 additional consultants approved in 2006, the greatest number last year was in psychiatry, owing in part to the implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001.  In 2006, as part of the growth in mental health services to improve capacity and fulfil the requirements of the Mental Health Act 2001, the HSE established an additional 18 multidisciplinary teams in adult psychiatry.  In 2006, <Col N="1627"/>some 383 new posts were created in mental health.  This year, the HSE will have 254 extra posts.  An additional 1,800 posts are envisaged during the seven-year lifetime of A Vision for Change.</P>
        <P>The Government is taking measures to ensure that Ireland produces enough suitably trained doctors to meet the needs of the Irish health service by implementing the reforms in medical education and training outlined in the Fottrell and Buttimer reports.</P>
        <P>A co-ordinated approach to policy-making undertaken in the area across the education and health sectors includes stronger workforce planning.  A legislative and structural framework will also be put in place to improve the governance and delivery of medical education and training.  Associated initiatives include curriculum reform, doubling the number of medical places for Irish and EU students, the introduction of a new graduate entry system and implementation of graduate retention policies.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to investment and reform in the health services.  We are confident that there are gains to be made from a radical restructuring of the system in efficiency, effectiveness and value for money.  I will not understate the scale of the task before us.  There are no quick fixes, and many challenges lie ahead.  However, the system&rsquo;s potential will be realised only through a combination of continuing investment and reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Naughten, McEntee and Deenihan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that the Minister of State can talk the good talk with regard to health issues.  If talking were all that was required, we would probably have the best service in the world, with more consultants, more beds, more doctors in training, and public-only contracts for doctors and consultants.  Owing to that good talk, we all bought into this agenda, which we have now supported for ten years.  The problem is that we never got anything promised regarding the health service, and that is why this motion has been tabled.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, we are getting things not promised to us, which have emerged like rabbits pulled from a hat, for instance, the use of land adjacent to public hospitals for private hospitals.  Where did that originate?  Why, if the Minister for Health and Children is as serious as she says about doing away with public private contracts and moving to public-only ones, do we need private hospitals beside the public ones?  A consultant&rsquo;s working life is roughly 15 to 20 years.  By the time the hospitals have been built, all those <Col N="1628"/>consultants will have retired, and we will have only public consultants in them.</P>
        <P>Surely the best use of that land would be for community beds, which do not exist in Dublin.  That way, people in acute hospitals, when they are ready to leave, could receive relevant therapies, medical care, rehabilitation and opportunities to convalesce before returning home.  That facility simply does not exist in Dublin, and it would certainly relieve pressure on the expensive acute beds from which the Minister is so anxious to move people, not to mention delivering better care to patients.</P>
        <P>If private beds are taken out of public hospitals, as the Minister is promising, all she will achieve is a two-tier system.  Perhaps this is what the Minister wants but it is not in anybody&rsquo;s interest to do this, be they private or public patients.  Insurance costs for private patients will go through the roof, whether VHI, Vivas or anybody else provides it.  Money will be taken from public hospitals and such action will ultimately result in lower standards in public hospitals.  There will be one service for private patients and a lesser service for public patients.  This is the only result from that type of two-tier system.  I believe in and support private hospitals, but only when services are being provided to both public patients paid for by the State and private patients through health insurance.  If we create a two-tier system we will live to regret it, and I ask the Minister to go back to the drawing board on that matter.</P>
        <P>In the short time available, I want to raise another matter against the backdrop of the Minister&rsquo;s promise to provide additional beds within the system.  There is a gross and widely-accepted shortage of beds throughout the system.  I refer to the plan to close the paediatric beds in Tallaght Hospital and concentrate a tertiary service in the Mater Hospital.  I support the development of a tertiary paediatric hospital but I do not support the removal of beds from Tallaght, where expertise and experience has been built up over many years.  There is also a very large catchment area of children.</P>
        <P>Last year, some 65,000 children passed through accident and emergency departments in Tallaght and Crumlin, which is also to close.  The vast majority of these were not acute cases from around the country requiring tertiary services for very complex illnesses.  They were children local to the Minister&rsquo;s constituency, from my constituency and the burgeoning adjoining constituencies in Kildare, Wicklow and in south and west Dublin.  These children had normal childhood illnesses or injuries from accidents.</P>
        <P>If the Mater plan goes ahead these children will have nowhere to go, despite the Minister&rsquo;s claims they will go to a quality hospital.  There are issues surrounding access and it is hard to see anywhere more difficult to physically access than the Mater <Col N="1629"/>site.  My problem is with the medical access.  Where will these children end up?  The Mater Hospital is smaller than the hospitals being closed, so there will be fewer beds.  However, it will have to deal with the really complex medical cases from around the country.</P>
        <P>Inevitably, a tertiary hospital must deal with the more acute and complex cases first, which is correct.  This leaves local children competing at the bottom of the queue for beds and facilities.  I ask the Minister to rethink the matter as it is folly against the background of a burgeoning population.  In other cases we have seen hospitals closing because we do not have the population to sustain them or the critical mass, but it is certainly there in Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Mr. McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Olivia Mitchell for sharing time.  The health service changes by the day so, like the Minister, I will not be speaking from a script.  I have been in this House for a year and a half in which we have had many debates on the health service.  The Minister correctly stated there is no Deputy in the D&aacute;il for whom the health issue is not the biggest one on the doorsteps or in the office.</P>
        <P>In my time in the House, GPs and nurses have been blamed for the problems in the health services and cleaning staff have been blamed for the diseases within hospitals.  Last week was the final straw when consultants were being blamed.  Tonight the Minister has stated that patients are staying in hospitals too long, so it is now the patients&rsquo; fault.</P>
        <P>The issue was simpler 20 years ago when every area had its own hospital, and 95% of sickness could be dealt with therein.  Complications have set in and now 95% of incidents cannot be dealt with in a local hospital like that in Navan now, from where a person would have to be transferred to Drogheda or Dublin and then go on a waiting list.</P>
        <P>In my time in the House, I have heard how we spent billions on the health service but people feel they are worse off.  Nobody in this House would disagree that people are worse off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Mr. McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know why the issue cannot be kept simple.  Last week one of my constituents, married to a Lithuanian girl, had a serious sinus problem.  He went to a consultant and was told he needed an operation.  The procedure could not happen for three weeks because no bed was available, and the man would have to give up work.  His wife booked a flight and brought her husband to Lithuania.  He had an operation that evening, paid a fee of &euro;30 and was given medicines worth &euro;65.  He was sent back to Ireland and was back to work within a week.  He received treatment in a basic hospital with a top-class operating service.</P><Col N="1630"/>
        <P>I checked this again today as I thought I might have dreamed that an Irish citizen had to get on an aeroplane and fly to Lithuania, paying &euro;30 for an operation before being able to go back to work.  That is what is wrong with this country&rsquo;s health service.  When I was growing up, the hospital in Navan was one of the finest hospitals in the country.  I was a patient several times myself, sometimes through my own fault and sometimes when I could do nothing about it.  One could access basic services and almost any operation could be performed.</P>
        <P>I spent 17 hours in the same hospital two weeks ago with my own child and I eventually had to take her out of it at 8.30 a.m. because nobody could provide a diagnosis for her.  Monaghan General Hospital has an operating table and there are hospitals in Cavan and Drogheda.  It is like a refugee camp in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda because it is the only bit of comfort we have.</P>
        <P>This has nothing to do with consultants, most of whom are finished work at 2.30 p.m. because there are no operating tables or beds available.  I blame nobody but this Government.  Why did it not assess what was going on?  It had the necessary money and people, and it knows how many extra people are entering the country on a daily basis.  We now have a system where if a person is sick, he or she does not know where to turn.  It will not be sorted out in two or three months.</P>
        <P>Blaming others will not help and we must go back to the basics, where every Deputy will look after his own hospital, ensure the operating tables are opened again and that consultants &mdash; Irish or otherwise &mdash; are put in place.  There is no point in putting in place 1,500 extra consultants and paying them over &euro;30 million a year if they are finished work at 11 a.m.  Under this Government&rsquo;s plan that will happen.</P>
        <P>Every hospital and operating room in Ireland should be reopened.  The issue should not be complicated as too much money is already being spent on consulting on what should not be done.  I realise elections are approaching but it is not time for playing politics with people&rsquo;s lives.  The Minister for Health and Children did so last week and I am glad that the proper answer will be given by the people in three months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  Over the past ten years we have seen significant spending on our health service, yet last year the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, handed back &euro;300 million to the Department of Finance because she could not spend the money.  That money could have been used to provide additional home-help hours, operations, medical cards or orthodontic treatment.</P>
        <P>The &euro;300 million, on a <i>per capita</i> basis in my own constituency, would have had a serious <Col N="1631"/>impact on problems we have to deal with every day.  It would have provided an extra 4,300 families with a medical card, an extra 400 inpatient elective surgeries in local hospitals and an extra 76,000 home-help hours could have been provided in every parish in the Longford-Roscommon or Sligo-Leitrim constituencies.  Some 400 additional children could have been called for orthodontic treatment rather than being bullied in school because they have low self-esteem and cannot get access to treatment.</P>
        <P>Last week the Taoiseach stated that operations were not being cancelled; they were being postponed.  There were 8,300 operations cancelled in the past two and a half years in the west.  It is a serious symptom of what is happening in the health service, where it is failing to deliver for patients.  We need significant investment in step-down facilities and urgent care centres which would provide extra beds and take pressure off accident and emergency services.</P>
        <P>On emergency services, a decision was taken in the dying days of the last millennium to locate a ambulance base in west Roscommon, the single biggest blackspot in ambulance services in the west.  For some reason that base was moved from west Roscommon to Knock, County Mayo.  Tenders are being sought for that ambulance base.  I plead with the Minister at this late stage to postpone that decision and re-evaluate the location of that ambulance base.  When I questioned the Minister in the House on a number of occasions about the timetable for the delivery of the ambulance base to west Roscommon, she always responded on the development of the service in west Roscommon, not east Mayo, but for political reasons it was diverted to Knock, County Mayo which happens to be the home town of one of the Members on the far side of the House.  That is disgraceful.  Last summer when the Government spoke of taking the surgery services out of the county hospital in Roscommon, the Health Service Executive stated it would evaluate relocating that proposed ambulance base to west Roscommon.  When it suited them they could move it to west Roscommon and when it did not they could move it to Knock.</P>
        <P>There has been a stay of execution in the closure of the surgery services in the county hospital in Roscommon.  The Health Service Executive is still not prepared to give clarity on where the surgeons will be based in the new reconfigured hospital service between Roscommon hospital and Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe.  If the surgeons are based in Portiuncula Hospital, that is where the surgery will take place and, in effect, the surgery services will be closed in Roscommon.  It will be the same as what happened in Monaghan Hospital.  That is what is being planned.  The decision is being postponed until after the general election.  If the services are <Col N="1632"/>based in Ballinasloe, that is where the surgery will be carried out and that involves the effective closure of the county hospital in Roscommon.  The threat looming over the people of Roscommon is that if they do not agree to this, the HSE will not appoint the third consultant physician on a permanent basis.  We are seeing smoke and mirrors used on this issue.  There is a lack of clarity from the Government, which wants to postpone its inevitable plan under the Hanly report to close small effective hospitals like the county hospital in Roscommon.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>The hospice service is also affected.  There has been a state-of-the-art hospice bed in Boyle in County Roscommon for the past number of years.  The nurses have been appointed to run that service, and yet that bed has not been in use due to industrial relations difficulties.  Anyone who saw the television programme about St. Francis&rsquo;s Hospice in Raheny during the week would understand the importance of providing such a base in the community of north Roscommon, and yet due to industrial relations problems that bed still remains closed.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Government will be leaving office in a few months having presided over the greatest chaos in the health service since the foundation of the State.  When people look back on the legacy of the Government, it will stand indicted for not providing the people with a decent health service, spanning both the public and private sectors.</P>
        <P>What is happening at Tralee General Hospital, or Kerry General Hospital as it is now called, is a microcosm of the rest of the country and I will refer to it briefly.  Kerry General Hospital is seriously understaffed by comparison with hospitals of its size in the rest of the country.  It is now regarded as a band 1 hospital and it is really staffed and equipped to meet the needs of people 25 years ago.  The population of Kerry is growing, people are getting older, there are more cases of cancer and more bones broken, and there are less services available for those people.</P>
        <P>Kerry General Hospital depends considerably on student nurses.  As a result the regular staff are suffering from stress and losing time through sickness etc., and they are very fed up at this point.</P>
        <P>I am informed that in the ongoing review the nursing staffing levels of Tralee hospital will be found to be down by between 60 and 80 nurses.  That is a really serious indictment.  It is affecting the service that the hospital and the nurses themselves would like to provide the population of Kerry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The accident and emergency department in Tralee hospital was built to provide for a throughput of approximately 15,000 patients and currently the throughput is approximately 31,000.  It has a temporary locum consultant.  He will be leaving at the end of March and there will be no consultant left.  There is no registrar in the accident and emergency department in Tralee <Col N="1633"/>hospital.  There are five senior house doctors who are trainees.  The locum is there for only 33 hours a week.  There is no one present to guide these young trainees, who are making serious decisions.  If there is not a consultant upstairs, they have no one with whom to consult.  As a result, I understand that one of the senior house doctors has written to the Health Service Executive outlining his concern for his position in case anything should go wrong.</P>
        <P>Tullamore Hospital, which is the same size as Kerry General Hospital, has an accident and emergency consultant, who left Kerry to take up that post, and six registrars.  In Kerry General Hospital, there are five senior house doctors.  That speaks for itself.  The service can not be given in Kerry as it is given in other parts of the country.  In any case there should be two consultants in Kerry General Hospital.  I understand an accident and emergency department was opened recently in Cashel, where two consultants were appointed.</P>
        <P>I refer to the cleaning staff issue in the accident and emergency department at Kerry General Hospital.  Currently the department has a temporary cleaner who works three hours a day.  She is shared with other departments in the hospital.  With the MRSA bug, it is not acceptable that the accident and emergency department has a cleaner for just three hours a day.  If there is a spillage or somebody gets sick overnight, they call on staff from the rest of the hospital and the nurses themselves do the cleaning.  Morale is low at present.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      
        <P Just="Center">&ldquo;PART 2</P>
        <P Just="Center">Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission &amp; Advisory Forum</P>
        <P LI="2">4.&mdash;(1) The Act of 1952 is amended in the Third Schedule by the deletion of paragraph 6(1) and the insertion of the following:</P><Col N="1634"/>
        <P LI="3">&ldquo;6. (1) (<i>a</i>) One senior and one junior member shall be elected by stakeholders in each jurisdiction for a period of five years.</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) If a casual vacancy occurs among the members there shall be a by-election in the jurisdiction which elected the outgoing member to fill the vacancy.&ldquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I will make three brief points before coming to the amendments.  This is the first occasion the House has had a chance to discuss fishing and coastal issues since the terrible tragedies of the <i>Pere Charles</i> and <i>Honeydew II</i>.  At the outset, I express the condolences of the Labour Party to the families and communities involved in those great tragedies, and also sympathise with the crew of the <i>Discovery</i> from Castletownbere for the ordeal suffered more recently.  The pressure on coastal communities is such that workers felt it necessary to go out in inclement January weather to try to make a living.  That is a heavy responsibility for the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since we last met in a full session in this House the Government&rsquo;s new marine strategy report, Steering a New Course, has been produced.  It was launched a couple of weeks ago by the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, and the Taoiseach, and I hope we get a chance to debate it fully before the session ends because there are some important issues in it that are related to the business before us today and to the difficult time being experienced by many coastal communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcomed this Bill on Second Stage.  The Labour Party was very supportive of moving the legislation through this House in the speediest and easiest way possible and is committed to doing so again this evening.</P>
        <P>The three amendments in my name, on behalf of the Labour Party, sum up one of the outstanding concerns we still have and that is why I resubmitted the amendments.  Amendment No. 1 seeks to ensure that the Foyle Fisheries Act 1952 is amended so that there will be an election to decide the board of stakeholders for a period of five years.  Amendment No. 2 seeks to amend the Fourth Schedule of the Foyle Fisheries Act 1952, suggesting the advisory council should consist of members elected directly by stakeholders in the Foyle fisheries.  Amendment No. 3 states that in the Fourth Schedule of the Foyle Fisheries Act 1952 the members should consult, liaise and advise directly the members of the advisory forum.</P>
        <P>We met the Foyle fishermen while carrying out the preparatory work for this Bill and these amendments arose from the fact that there was a strong feeling among the stakeholders on Lough Foyle, in Greencastle and other ports in Inishowen that there had not been sufficient consultation regarding the Bill.  The key stakeholders, including, we heard, people employing more than 20 members of staff and investing per<Col N="1635"/>haps &euro;2 million, were not adequately consulted and there was a feeling that the Loughs Agency implementation plan, based on a Centre for Marine Resources and Mariculture, CMAR, study, was considered flawed as many of the stakeholders refused to participate in that survey.  Others who were surveyed were not involved in shellfish activities.  Issues were also raised relating to security of tenure for existing operators on Lough Foyle and the fact that people who had spent years and millions of euro developing the mussel fishery or pursuing the wild oyster fishery were let down and ignored by the legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was a general feeling that the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission and advisory forum should be made more democratic and transparent.  In particular it was felt the commission should have elections in a more transparent and democratic way.  The Minister told me, in response on Committee Stage, that the Foyle Fisheries Act 1952 had been superseded, with regard to the Third and Fourth Schedules, by the Belfast Agreement of 1998.  This matter affects the jurisdictions of both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission was the superseding body.  As a result the advisory forum was set up with 48 members but there was a feeling among stakeholders who came to see me that some members represented very few stakeholders and, effectively, represented only themselves.</P>
        <P>The Minister gave an assurance, which I would like him to address this evening, that the North-South Ministerial Council, which referred to this project under the St. Andrews Agreement, would give some degree of accountability and democratic control of the commission and advisory forum to us.  There is a Deputy here tonight from the area in question.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Stakeholders told us that the commission, on the Northern side, was governed by the d'Hondt system relating to the agreement in Northern Ireland.  This seemed to be a very democratic system whereby all parties and all stakeholders would be represented.  I seek assurances from the Minister that there will be an ongoing, high level of consultation in this area.  In particular the Minister might comment on the proposal the Taoiseach made last week regarding the new D&aacute;il committee for North-South business and the North-South Ministerial Council.  When will it be up and running?  What activities will it engage in?  Will this legislation and the similar legislation we will cover this time next week on the all-island electricity Bill come within its remit?</P>
        <P>I seek to reflect the views of stakeholders as they were put to me, the fact that the mussel fishery, the oyster fishery and aquaculture are long established in the lough and that people felt, at the very least, they should have received the same rights and guarantees under this legislation as those applied in Wexford harbour.  I have referred to this in a forthcoming amendment.  From our point of view, in the current jurisdiction <Col N="1636"/>on the Donegal side of Lough Foyle, the key issues we wish to see addressed regarding the fishermen should be reflected in this Bill.  In a previous discussion on amendment No. 1 the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, informed us of this.  I think that amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are valid if we are to have fully democratic control of the commission and the Loughs Agency.</P>
</Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I think amendments Nos. 1 to 3 are akin to amendment No. 17.  The stakeholders, the people who fish the area, should be central to this and should have a significant voice.  There should be as much gender equality as possible or practicable.  I understand the value in hearing outside voices on the matter but, in the context of the agency in question, the history of distrust means people who know the area best should have a voice.  I do not wish to detract from people currently on the advisory board.  </P>
        <P>I want the Minister to know that people in Inishowen and the Foyle region generally are anxious to have their voices heard with regard to the Bill and how it is formulated.  A key concern is that it should not mean a hand-over of all power to any particular agency but that the Minister and the Department should have as much interest after this Bill is passed as they had during the weeks spent putting it through Committee and Report Stages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s vote of sympathy on the loss of life of the people off the south-east coast.  Our hearts are with them and I hope, in the not too distant future, there will be closure on this appalling tragedy that demonstrates the perils of the sea and the risks people have to take.  It has been an extraordinarily difficult time for all the families concerned and we sincerely hope that the matter will be brought to a conclusion.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>While it is recognised by all that this Bill is very important as it contributes to the Good Friday Agreement, we cannot ignore the fact that it also contains many flaws.  As it stands it could cause problems for and divisions between stakeholders on the Foyle and Carlingford Lough.  I was in north-east Donegal last weekend and the lack of concentration in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, as mentioned by Deputy Broughan, was brought to my attention.  The study on which the implementation plan for this Bill is based has been cast in doubt by the stakeholders.  Clearly adequate consultation would have prevented much difficulty.</P>
      
        <P>One of the concerns expressed to me related to the level of driftnetting that will be allowed on Lough Foyle.  The ban on the driftnetting of salmon is contentious in terms of the cutting back in the number of licences to 35.  Will the Minister of State explain the position on the operation of driftnets on the Foyle?  Although there are coun<Col N="1637"/>ters available, there is no quota system operating on the lough.  People are concerned about the effects of the implementation plan on driftnetting on the Foyle.</P>
        <P>Security of tenure for existing operators on the Foyle was brought to my attention.  The Minister has accepted the advice of the Office of the Attorney General on the definition of &ldquo;shellfish&rdquo;, for which I am thankful.  However, he has given advice on several other areas that impinge directly on the future implementation of the Bill.  What thoughts has the Minister of State given to this?  The Bill refuses to recognise adequately the work and millions of euro invested by existing operators in aquaculture sites.  They took risks to create sustainable jobs in an area of high unemployment and used their own money without assistance from any Government.</P>
        <P>Deputy Keaveney raised issues concerning the mussel and oyster industries.  Unfortunately I was not present for the committee hearing on the matter but I read its note on duplication in the area of licensing.  This is also a very contentious issue.  Neither the Government nor its predecessor would accede to the operators&rsquo; request for licences for their aquaculture sites.  It is not the operators fault they are deemed unlicensed.  Had the two Governments applied the same logic to the Foyle as they did in Carlingford, licences would have been issued.  The operators on Carlingford Lough will have their work and risk capital recognised but their colleagues on Lough Foyle will not.</P>
        <P>Targeting social need is a declared objective of this Bill but, by not recognising the investment of the operators, over 100 jobs are being put at risk in an area with one of the highest unemployment levels in Ireland.  Those who know most about developing a sustainable fishery are not being given a proper opportunity to continue their work.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will refer to the suggestion by local fishermen based on the Wexford Harbour experience, as indicated by Deputy Broughan.  Like Lough Foyle fishery, the one in Wexford developed over many years through a lot of hard work.  There have been successes in many areas.  When the Department proposed to introduce a licensing regime, the <i>status quo</i> regarding the existing sites was accepted.  A time period and methodology were introduced to allow existing issues regarding site boundaries, area designation, etc., to be resolved.  When this process was completed, legislation was introduced that accepted the <i>status quo</i> as a starting point and covered future plans for enhancing the sustainability of the resource.  The Foyle situation is very similar to that in Wexford and the lessons learned from the Wexford experience should not be dismissed summarily.</P>
        <P>The Minister has reassured fishermen that an appropriate weighting will be given to existing track records when applying for aquaculture licences for the Foyle.  He pins his faith on the <Col N="1638"/>Loughs Agency taking his view on board, but does not enshrine these assurances in law.  The Loughs Agency has great responsibility with regard to appointments to the board.  It is equally important that there be sufficient accountability and that consultation takes place.  There is much uncertainty regarding accountability and Deputy Keaveney is more aware than me of the uncertainty over public consultation on the salmon, mussel and oyster industries.</P>
        <P>The success of aquaculture development on Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough was brought to my attention last week.  It is dependent on access to sufficient seed mussel.  At present neither lough has sufficient natural seed to sustain the industry and it must therefore must be obtained from sources outside the loughs.  This is inequitable in that any UK-registered vessel can enter Irish waters to fish mussel seed but an Irish boat does not have similar rights.  It can only gain access to Northern Irish waters and thus the system is open to abuse by UK operators.  This issue ought to be discussed.</P>
        <P>There is no Northern Ireland register of fishing vessels; rather, there is only a UK register.  The United Kingdom&rsquo;s single register does not differentiate between Belfast, Liverpool, Cardiff or London as ports of registration.  Thus, mussel dredgers and non-fishing vessels beneficially owned in Wales or England, can access seed mussel off Wexford, but Irish boats cannot access seed off Wales.  Irish mussel dredgers have no reciprocal access to mussel seed in Welsh waters, where there is currently a vast untapped seed resource.  There is no restriction on where the seed may be re-laid.  This means UK-registered boats beneficially owned outside Northern Ireland could continue to harvest seed in the Republic and simply leave their native seed untouched for future use.  Any UK-registered vessel can access a Belfast fishing identification number that allows that vessel to fish in the waters of the Republic.  Does the Minister propose to revisit the inequitable <i>voisinage</i> agreement to secure an even playing field?  Irish vessels should either have fully reciprocal rights to access UK seed or the Irish seed resource should be accessible to Irish beneficially-owned boats only.</P>

	<P>I join Deputy Broughan in expressing sympathy to the families of those lost at sea.  I visited the families on a number of occasions and witnessed at first hand the grief suffered as a result of the tragedies along our coast, particularly at Dunmore East.</P>
        <P>I have no problem debating the Cawley report in the House given that it contains good news.  If the Whips can arrange the debate, we will certainly facilitate it.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, concern the composition of the former Foyle Fishery Commission and Foyle Advisory Council, as provided <Col N="1639"/>in the Third and Fourth Schedules, respectively, to the Foyle Fisheries Act 1952.  The amendments are concerned with ensuring stakeholders or representatives are consulted on issues of concern to them.  The provisions of the Third and Fourth Schedules were repealed by the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, which established the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.  The 1999 Act provides for the composition of the commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The principle informing the Deputy&rsquo;s proposed amendments, which is that stakeholders should be consulted on issues of concern to them, was shared by the North-South Ministerial Council, which directed that the Foyle and Carlingford Area Advisory Forum be established.  The current forum has 48 members, including recreational and commercial salmon fishermen, wild shellfish fishermen, aquaculturalists, environmentalists and hospitality providers.  There are three working groups working on the agency&rsquo;s proposals in respect of the salmon fisheries for 2007, the agency&rsquo;s proposals for a marine and water-based leisure strategy, and the roll-out of<?oasys _jy ?>aquaculture licensing and its interface with the loughs&rsquo; wild fisheries.</P>
        <P>The Deputy wants to ensure that people&rsquo;s views, including those of the stakeholders, are considered in the development of future plans for the area.  His concerns are addressed adequately by the arrangements I have outlined and, accordingly, I do not propose to accept his amendments.  As the advisory forum was established under the direction of the North-South Ministerial Council, it is open to the latter to consider how it is working.  Creating a body comprising elected representatives would require new legislation.</P>
        <P>The Loughs Agency has published its proposals to end indiscriminate mixed-stock salmon fishing, as required by the habitats directive.  This issue was raised by Deputy Perry.  No decisions have been made on the number of licences or the criteria to be applied in allocating them.  The North-South Ministerial Council will have to approve any regulations to implement changes in the licensing regime.  I am well aware of the voisinage agreement the Deputy mentions, but this is <i>sub judice</i>, as it is the subject of court proceedings, so I cannot comment on that.</P>

	<P>I wanted to try to ventilate as many of the amendments as possible.  I wanted to ask the Minister of State about that Oireachtas committee, which should be helpful to Members of the 30th D&aacute;il, hopefully most of us.  What is the plan in that respect?  Has the Taoiseach given any indication that the business such as tonight&rsquo;s could continue to be monitored, as regards this very important commission on the Loughs Agency so that our people on both sides of Loughs Foyle and Carlingford could be adequately represented in their business and livelihood in this House?

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;All existing licences granted for specific Lough sites by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will be recognised.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Before I begin, I should like also to be associated with the message of sympathy for the crew and skipper of the <i>Pere Charles</i> and also the <i>Honeydew</i>.  I knew both Tom&aacute;is&iacute;n and Pat Hennessy, personally, over the years.  I fished in Tralee Bay with them and they were highly experienced people.  The circumstances where fishermen find themselves having to meet a quota by the end of the week &mdash; if not, there is no carryover &mdash; is creating enormous problems for the whole fishing industry as people believe they must take chances in order to make a living.  It is a terrible tragedy for the entire coastal area and particularly in the south east, in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency.</P>
        <P>I want to address amendments Nos. 4 and 11.  As regards amendment No. 4, after line 8, I want the following inserted: &ldquo;All existing licences granted for specific Lough sites by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will be recognised.&rdquo;  I find amendment No. 5, as put by Deputy Broughan on behalf of the Labour Party, however, to be far more substantial and I will be supporting this and withdrawing amendment No. 4.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 11 seeks, in page 8, line 36, after &ldquo;licence).&rdquo; to insert the following: &ldquo;The position and limits of existing licensed areas will be retained by the existing licence holder.&rdquo;.  I have met with the fishermen from the Foyle.  Having listened intently to them and given that many of them have long-standing stakes in that they have been involved in aquaculture in that area for quite a time, built up a small industry and invested considerable time and money in it, <Col N="1641"/>it is only right and proper that the right of tenure they have established over the years be protected.  It is somewhat similar to what happened in Wexford Harbour where the licensees in that area had their rights protected for the future.  In the circumstances it is only right and proper that their efforts, given the work they have put in, be maintained.   Amendment No. 11 refers mainly to the sites on which people have lived and worked in that area.  They have developed them and have established sites, from the very fact that they have been working there consistently, many of them for more than ten years.  I hope the Minister of State will take on board amendments Nos. 5 and 11.   Amendment No. 4 has been overtaken by Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s amendment.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) In granting licences the Commission must recognise existing and historic rights of tenure for current long-standing operators on Lough Foyle.  The allocation of such licences on Lough Foyle should follow precedent established at Wexford Harbour.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">In respect of aquaculture licences, the amendment seeks to provide that in granting them, the commission must recognise existing and historic rights of tenure for current long-standing operators on Lough Foyle and that the allocation of such licences should follow the precedent established at Wexford Harbour.  As I mentioned on Committee Stage the stakeholders believe that this section of the Bill is badly framed and is based on a false premise.  The experience of Wexford Harbour in this regard should provide the way forward for the legislation on Lough Foyle.  In Wexford a very substantial unlicensed fishery developed over many years and operators in the area continued the successful development there, as in the Foyle, without a legislative regime.  There were some inherent problems with boundaries and so on, but stakeholders in the south east seemed to be able to resolve these on a local basis.  When the Department eventually introduced a licensing regime, as is proposed for Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough in this legislation, the <i>status quo</i>  on the sites of existing operators was accepted.  On meeting some of the fishermen from the area I recall them referring to one of the historic fisheries off Redcastle, for example, where there was a short season where people had operated for perhaps, 15 or 20 years.  A sustainable type of aquaculture has developed in the Foyle, and in some ways is a very interesting model, as I mentioned on Committee Stage.  By comparisons with other forms of aquaculture it seems to be very sustainable environmentally.  It was felt that a similar time period and methodology to allow for existing issues relating <Col N="1642"/>to site boundaries, area destinations etc. to be resolved was put in place in Wexford.  When the process was completed and the legislation passed, the successful <i>status quo</i> there served as a useful model.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I mentioned earlier, the Foyle fishery has been built up with the investment of much blood, sweat and tears from the people of Inishowen.  On the exploitation of that fishery, there are some impressive operators and decent employers who presented a very strong case here in the Oireachtas for Opposition spokespersons and their own local Deputies as well as for the Minister of State.  I believe this is a  reasonable amendment that seeks to give proper standing in this legislation to existing and historic rights of tenure.  The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, responded the last day on Committee Stage to the effect that this was a public fishery and there could be no recognition of the <i>status quo</i>.  The historic standing provided that people operated among themselves but this could not be established on a legislative basis, he said.  However, as I rightly pointed out, and as my colleague, Deputy Perry has mentioned, there is at least one other precedent on the Irish coastline where this has happened.  We know that a large section of the lough has been mapped, where people were able to operate with ease outside Redcastle and other areas, in agreement.</P>
        <P>I again urge the Minister of State to give some consideration to this argument.  Even if he does not accept this amendment he could still, even at this late stage of the night, frame one of his own which would provide security and ease people&rsquo;s worries.  My colleague mentioned a very important issue about the seed management advisory committee and the whole situation with UK operators chasing our scarce seed resources in Lough Foyle.  I asked on Committee Stage whether this was an issue we could address.  We are moving to some extent into uncharted waters in that these are the two great waterways we share with our sister jurisdiction, which all Members of the House hope will be a single jurisdiction in time to come.  We are all citizens and people of this country on both sides.  We have concerns about operators from other jurisdictions who did not look after their own resources sufficiently well.  It is reminiscent of the discussion we had about the white fish regime in the north-east Atlantic.  Our first duty should be to protect our people.  The concerns put to us by the stakeholders should be reflected back to the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues in Belfast in the North-South Ministerial Council.  We should come up with some system which would ensure the protection of the seed resources of our operators in the Republic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend my sympathy to those who were lost at sea.  Greencastle and Inishowen have had their share of very sad losses.  It is one of the worst tragedies for people not to <Col N="1643"/>be able to find their loved ones.  It occurred with the loss of the <i>Carrickatine</i> in Greencastle and we have heartfelt sympathy for those people who lost loved ones.</P>
        <P>If I had realised that there was a certain amount of latitude, apart from the fact that I would have declared my interest that I live by the Foyle, I would have asked about the salmon fishery as well.  Whatever decision is to be taken, it must be taken quickly.  This time last year, people had already applied for the licences and were certain as to what would happen in the summer.  People want certainty.</P>
        <P>If an Irish or British boat can be registered in Belfast and thus can fish all waters in the UK and Ireland, it is too bad that a boat registered in Greencastle does not have the reciprocal arrangement.  However, I know that the Minister of State cannot comment on that because there is a court case pending.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 11 will probably not be accepted on the basis that there is no existing licensed areas, which is what the Minister stated on Committee Stage.  However, I follow the spirit of amendment No. 5.  We are not starting from a situation where people have been licensed, but neither are we starting from a greenfield site.  We are starting from a situation in which we are trying to legitimise the people who are there.  We would not have aquaculture licensing if we did not have aquaculture.  We have both wild and farmed aquaculture and we must recognise the reality.  There is strong recognition of the history of the people there.  Had we started from a greenfield site, nobody would put in a greater claim than anyone else.  However, the mussel fishermen would say that about 40% of the Foyle is mapped out for mussels, yet only 10% has been occupied because of the lack of seed.  The oyster fishermen would say that they have mapped out about 49% for oysters, although whether it is all used is another question.  The environmental studies that were mentioned on Committee Stage might yield results on this issue.</P>
        <P>There must be strong emphasis from the Department and the Minister of State that the people who have invested their time, energy and money in this are recognised.  One cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs, and many of these people had to invest money that went nowhere.  They had to make mistakes to achieve success.  It was not a great honey pot for anybody.  I would like to see not only the rights of tenure for those who are currently there, but also some opportunity for new entrants.  However, I worry about too many licences being given out for a scarce resource.  Unless we can solve the problem of seed, it will be unrealistic for the Department to think that aquaculture can be the bright new dawn for the Foyle area.  A cake can only be divided in so many parts so it must be done in a sensible manner.  Access to the seed is a golden <Col N="1644"/>goose, but it cannot lay the eggs to match its potential at the moment.</P>

	<P>I support the amendments tabled by Deputy Ferris and Deputy Broughan.  I was in Inishowen last weekend and the debate is very sensitive, particularly in regard to salmon.  The fact that a tag will cost &euro;7 is contentious, as will be the fact that the number of drift netting licences will be cut from 100 to 35.  The politics of this is different from that of inland fisheries.</P>
        <P>The Farrell Grant Sparks report commissioned by the Government has not been debated in this House, but it should be discussed.  The management of the Foyle is different from the management of fisheries within our jurisdiction.  With the differences between oyster, mussel and salmon fishermen, there is a great lack of trust up there.  The oyster fishermen were at loggerheads with the mussel fishermen regarding the duplication of licences.  People have invested heavily and as this Bill updates the 1952 Act, it is very important.  There is a huge element of trust involved.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State indicate the level of accountability involved in the appointment of those from the South?  There has been a lack of consultation with the stakeholders.  Deputy Keaveney pointed out that there is a huge demand for mussels, but if that industry is to be grown, we must get the seed.  That is a very contentious issue up there.  People with oyster beds feel that mussels are to the detriment of oysters.  Salmon fishermen are annoyed that drift netting is being allowed.  We have spoken about banning drift netting, but the Foyle is a huge stretch of water.  Only 35 licences are being issued for drift nets, which is down from 100 licences.  Last year, 20 licences were apparently not reissued.</P>
        <P>Having met a number of people there last weekend, I felt that the politics of this are difficult.  Different people have different concerns and many of them are uncertain as to who is in charge.  With the joint authority, very few people knew who was effectively in charge.  Very few public meetings were called with the stakeholders and their contributions were not taken on board.  It is important that we assure people that there will be accountability under this new agency.  If the vested interests have a grievance they must be able to approach somebody.  It is important that the Minister of State indicates that those appointed on this side have the resources to deal with complaints.  There must also be complete transparency.  Until now, this has not taken place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What has happened in the Foyle is quite extraordinary when compared to the inaction within the seven fisheries boards in this State.  There are fish counters in all the rivers going into the Foyle and the authorities know the exact number of salmon there.  There is no quota whatsoever and the whole thing is based on the assessment of the availability of salmon.  However, there is now talk about charging &euro;7 per tag for salmon.  Perhaps the Minister of State has some information on that. <Col N="1645"/> I ask him to explain.  It is quite different to the management of the inland fisheries within the Minister of State&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>While this legislation is welcome in some respects, many questions have not been answered.  Many people are unhappy because they lack confidence in the ability of management to ensure the future survival of those working in the oyster, mussel and salmon fisheries and to develop aquaculture businesses and wild aquaculture.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the level of accountability that is in place to protect taxpayers who are investing a considerable amount of money in the management and funding of our fisheries resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Broughan proposes in amendment No. 5 that when the commission grants licences, it must recognise the existing and historic rights of tenure of current long-standing operators in Lough Foyle.  I understand that existing operators do not have any legal right to operate in any particular area.  It is important to bear in mind that as the Lough Foyle area is a public fishery, individuals cannot have exclusive rights.  This situation will change when this legislation is enacted, as aquaculture activities in the area will be licensed.  Individual licence holders will have exclusive rights in the licensed area to cultivate that area.  The ownership of any fish that is farmed will be vested in the licensees.</P>
        <P>The aquaculture implementation plan for Lough Foyle sets out how the agency proposes to regulate aquaculture activities in that area.  The plan provides that consideration be given to applicants&rsquo; history, commitment and experience in the aquaculture sector, including previous financial investment.  The circumstances in the Foyle area are different to the circumstances that pertained in the Wexford area prior to the licensing of aquaculture activities there, as there are some special areas of conservation in the Foyle area, as well as wild mussels and oyster fisheries.  The agency will conduct a strategic environmental assessment, followed by an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment under Article 6 of the habitats directive.  The assessments will enable the agency to determine which areas are suitable for aquaculture.  They will identify sites that are unsuitable, or protected under environmental legislation.  Consequently, some operations may not be permitted to continue in their present location.  The details of the suitable sites and protected areas will not be available until the studies have been completed.  In the circumstances, having seriously considered the views of the Deputies, it is not possible to incorporate an amendment of this nature.  However, following the Wexford analogy there will be full consultation.  The various studies will be published for consideration by interested parties.</P>
        <P>I will now speak about amendment No. 11.  Section 53 of the 1952 Act provides that aquaculture licences shall define the position and limits <Col N="1646"/>of the licence area.  Current licences in Carlingford Lough are covered by section 53B, which provides that when the Bill is enacted, these licences will be treated as if they were granted under this legislation.  A similar provision is contained in the draft Northern Ireland order for licences issued by the Northern Ireland authorities in respect of Carlingford Lough.  The Bill also provides that the Loughs Agency will be empowered to vary licences in the public interest, and where appropriate at the request of the applicant.  In such circumstances, this amendment is not required because the Bill does not affect the provisions of existing licences.  Moreover, the amendment would not be compatible with the need to ensure that the Loughs Agency has the necessary discretion to act in the public interest if required.</P>
        <P>On an issue that was raised by Deputy Perry, the environmental studies will facilitate the designation of wild oyster and mussel fisheries, as well as areas suitable for aquaculture and special areas of conservation.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State referred to the proposed new section 53B, which relates to Carlingford Lough and the southern side of Lough Foyle, which is in Northern Ireland.  Is there not a discrepancy between the licences, in the sense that the operators on the Southern side of Lough Foyle are being treated differently to the operators on the Northern side of the lough and the operators on both sides of Carlingford Lough?  While the implementation plan sounds fair and interesting, was it not possible to include a reference to it somewhere in the Bill, for example in one of the Schedules?</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 6, line 19, after &ldquo;sea&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or an oyster bed,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments relate to aquaculture licences, which I have spoken about previously.  I am keen to ensure that oyster fisheries be included in this section.  It is unfortunate that this legislation neglects to refer to the protection of wild oyster beds.  I hope these amendments will be accepted.  The Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997, which states that an aquaculture licence should not interfere with oyster beds, is the only protection given to wild oyster beds in the Republic.  I am not sure why this protection is not included in the Bill.  Wild oyster fisheries provide employment.  Careers in this area have been handed down through the generations.  I was disappointed with the response to this amendment on Committee Stage, when the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, said that &ldquo;oyster fisheries in Lough Foyle are public fisheries &mdash; they are not owned by any individual or body&rdquo; and, therefore, &ldquo;it is not necessary to seek consent&rdquo;.  It may not be necessary to hold discussions with the parties involved in this area.  It is shocking simply to ignore the many years of hard work done by fishermen in Lough Foyle to develop the oyster fisheries there.  This issue affects those who work in the mussel, oyster and salmon fisheries.  There is a great deal of uncertainty within the industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fully recognise that this Bill forms part of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  However, I have referred to many issues that cannot be ignored.  When one examines the development of the industry over recent years, it is obvious that a great deal of funding has been allocated to it.  Updating of the relevant legislation has also played a part in the satisfactory development of the sector.  The lack of development of the State&rsquo;s inland fisheries over the years contrasts with the astute management in this area.  It is clear that great progress has been made with wild aquaculture and farm aquaculture.  This Bill will regulate aquaculture to a fair degree.  There is a great deal of uncertainty in the industry.  While I do not doubt what the Minister of State has said, it is important that assurances are adhered to in <Col N="1648"/>line with the spirit of the Bill.  The degree of credibility that will attach to the board will depend on the people who are appointed to it by the Minister.  The public will be reassured by the level of transparency and consultation with the stakeholders.  I have no doubt the tenure and investment of the licence holders in the past will be taken on board in the future issuing of licences to them and new entrants.  It is possible there will not be many new entrants; it will probably be the same stakeholders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has been frank that this does not encompass everything but I believe he is taking account of the concerns of people who have invested heavily up to now.  It is regrettable there was not more public consultation about this Bill.  People might have been given a level of reassurance they have not received to date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand what was said on Committee Stage.  It is the same as the argument regarding mussels.  We need legislation because there is no ownership and there are no licences.  That is the reason this Bill is necessary.  Amendment No. 8 provides that the commission shall not license a person to engage in aquaculture within the limits of an oyster fishery that is the property of a private person.  That is what the legislation is about; there is no ownership of either mussel or oyster fisheries in the Foyle area.  However, there is a traditional element of oyster fishing and people have invested in the oyster fishery in the same way as there has been investment in the mussel fishery.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the mapping that will be done by each sector and by the Department in the context of examining special areas of conservation and other environmental matters will take account of all the different interests.  I do not know enough about the science to know whether it will form a neat package that will discriminate one area from another.  The Minister spoke on Committee Stage about sanitary areas between mussels and oysters.  I hope that can be worked out and will not cause major arguments.  I am told by most of the fishermen I have talked to that there is room in the Foyle for everyone.  In that context, I hope those who have invested in oyster and mussel fisheries will be given adequate recognition so they can become the owners of licences and become the real owners and stakeholders.  The Department, through the Loughs Agency, should recognise the investment they have made.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendments.  Deputy Perry correctly raised the rights of people who have been involved in the oyster fishery in particular and seeks to ensure that their historical entitlements are recognised.  As Deputy Keaveney said, the rights of all the stakeholders should have a place in the implementation plan.  It appears we must wait for that plan.  The Minister does not seem to be of the view that we can insert a protective amendment for the oyster fish<Col N="1649"/>ery.  The argument for it has been well made by my colleagues and I ask him to reconsider accepting these amendments.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Oyster fisheries in Lough Foyle are public fisheries.  As they are not owned by any individual or body, it is not necessary to seek such consents as requested by Deputy Perry in the amendment.  Regional fisheries boards may issue oyster licences in the jurisdiction under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959.  However, this Act does not apply in the Moville area and no such licences have been issued with regard to the Foyle.  Oyster fishery orders may be made under the 1959 Act but such orders do not apply in the Moville area.</P>
        <P>Wild oyster fisheries will be regulated under section 13 of the 1952 Act if this Bill is enacted.  The environmental study will identify the different fisheries and aquaculture interests.  The amendment of the definition of &ldquo;fish&rdquo; on Committee Stage will greatly facilitate the fair and transparent regulation of aquaculture and fisheries, mussels and oysters, in the interests of all the stakeholders.  In these circumstances, the proposed amendments are not necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is regrettable that the 1959 Act does not apply to Moville.  I respect Deputy Keaveney&rsquo;s remarks because she knows better than anybody how sensitive the issue is there.  The derogation in the 1959 Act does not give the Minister many powers with regard to the implementation of what would apply elsewhere in the State.  As Deputy Keaveney stated, there should be enough for everybody in Lough Foyle but it will depend a great deal on the science.  Given the huge scientific resources available, it should be possible to identify areas to ensure there is not an overlap of mussel and oyster fisheries.</P>
        <P>It is a huge area.  I do not know the size of the body of water but it looks huge when one drives into the peninsula.  Obviously, the concern is that there would be an intensity of licensing in one area.  It is important that the mussel and oyster fisheries are clearly and separately marked out.  Apparently, the people who fish for oysters do not fish for mussels.</P>

If there is public con<Col N="1650"/>sultation with all vested interests, the lack of trust could diminish.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 7, line 14, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This relates to subsection (2) of section 53B of the 1952 Act which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Without prejudice to any other provision of this Part, regulations under subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) may contain provisions similar to the provisions of Directive 85/337/EEC and may, in particular, require the Commission, when considering whether to grant an aquaculture licence, to take account of any information received by, or representations made to, the Commission which relate to the impact of aquaculture on the environment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment seeks to change &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  The requirement should be mandatory.  The provision I quoted seems to contradict the revised section 53C which follows it.  That states: &ldquo;In determining any application for an aquaculture licence, the Commission should consider any written representations relating to the application which are received by the Commission within the period of 28 days...&rdquo;.  This was discussed on Committee Stage.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s amendment.  He has stated that he would consider my amendment even though he had some doubts about it.  He has extended the provision to include any representation made to the commission which relates to the impact of aquaculture on the environment.  At the Government&rsquo;s presentation on seafood a few weeks ago there seemed to be <Col N="1651"/>a view held by the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Minister of State, that aquaculture must be the way forward in the long term if there is to be a sustainable seafood industry which could meet the challenge of the massive requirements for nutrition, given the benefits of seafood.  The environmental impact is critical.  One of my first contributions in the House and in the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, was to do with complaints I received regarding Lough Swilly and the environmental impact of aquaculture in that waterway on the other side of Inishowen which is very beautiful and famed.  The environmental impact is critical to the issue of the sustainability of aquaculture if this is the way forward in increasing the supply of seafood.  The Labour Party and my colleagues in Fine Gael and Sinn F&eacute;in have our own views about the targets put forward in the Government&rsquo;s seafood strategy and the question of funding.  The Minister put forward a proposal for 3.5% of the total national development plan budget for his Department to be put into fisheries.  This amount should be revisited by the next Government, whatever its composition.</P>
        <P>I do not see why the Minister should not make it mandatory that there be a requirement for submissions on environmental impact on our coastal waterways because we all have to live in the environment.  These waterways must be protected at all costs while encouraging coastal communities to develop sustainable seafood industries.</P>

	<P>Section 53 of the Bill is an enabling provision empowering the Loughs Agency to make regulations concerning applications for aquacultural licences.  As an enabling provision it is written in discretionary terms.  The amendment proposed by the Deputy is mandatory in nature and as such is not compatible with an enabling provision such as this.  Any regulations made by the agency will require the prior approval of the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>
        <P>Members will recall that the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, shared Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s concerns on Committee Stage and undertook to obtain legal advice on the matter to see how best these concerns might be addressed.  My officials have discussed the position with their Northern counterparts and the legal advisers in the two jurisdictions.  On foot of the agreement reached in the course of these discussions, I am proposing amendment No. 10 which I believe meets the concerns expressed on Committee Stage.  One of the points made on Committee Stage was that obligation on the Loughs Agency in respect of the consideration of representations on the environmental matters in section 53B is discretionary whereas section 53C imposes a mandatory obligation on the Loughs Agency to consider any written representations made in respect of an aquacultural licence application.  The amendment I have proposed ensures that this mandatory obligation in section 53C will apply to representations <Col N="1652"/>made in respect of the impact of aquaculture on the environment.  I propose that amendment No. 10 be accepted and that amendment No. 9 need not be accepted in these circumstances.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On the same point, in my constituency the same people are fishing both in Lough Foyle and Lough Swilly.  There has always been a stricter regime in Lough Foyle than in Lough Swilly.  I ask that the assurances given previously by the Minister with regard to indexing and an equal playing field with regard to fees be considered.  I am not sure if it needs to be included in the legislation but the assurances were given before by the Minister and I want to reiterate my concerns that my constituents can be treated in two different ways on the same peninsula.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Aquacultural licence fees are calculated differently in the two jurisdictions.  In this jurisdiction the same Minister has responsibility for licensing aquaculture and the foreshore.  The bulk of the fees are levied through the aquacultural licence, having regard to the productivity of the licensed site.  In Northern Ireland the bulk of the licence fees relate to the foreshore and are levied by the Crown Estates Commission.  In terms of aquaculture operating in Lough Foyle, it has been agreed that the fees in respect of the foreshore will be shared between the Crown Estates Commission and my Department.  The scale of the fees is the subject of ongoing negotiations between my Department and the Crown Estates Commission.  It is intended that as far as possible the fees applicable to Lough Foyle should be consistent with the fees applicable in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Fees in respect of fishing licences are calculated by the Loughs Agency, having due regard for the existing policy in the two jurisdictions.  Any regulation that the agency may make in respect of fees will have to be approved by the North-South Ministerial Council.  Deputies will appreciate that as this is a North-South Body, it is not possible to index its fees to those applicable in Ireland.  Any decision relating to the North-South Bodies must be agreed jointly.  Accordingly, it is not appropriate to make this type of amendment.</P>

I thank officials from the North, particularly those in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Office of the Legislative Counsel and the Loughs Agency, who have made a major contribution to advancing the Bill.

The Fine Gael Party was pleased to co-operate with him on progressing this important cross-Border legislation.  I understand the reason clarification cannot be given in certain areas.  The new cross-Border body will set an example for future management of inland fisheries.  I compliment the Minister of State on his openness and frankness as regards the legislation.  I am certain the commitments given but not enshrined in the legislation will be taken on board by the secretariat which is given responsibility for its implementation.  </P>

	<P>People in the Foyle region have waited 13 years for the legislation.  On 2 April 2007 it will be 11 years since I was elected to the House.  Promises were given in the run-up to every new legislative programme that it would include this Bill.  I thank the Minister and Minister of State and their officials.  I also thank Opposition Deputies for working with the Government.</P>
        <P>The most significant element of the Bill was the change in the definition of shellfish and ensuring its provisions extend to the fish the legislation <Col N="1655"/>must cover.  This issue was missed by many in the media who appeared to find it too complicated to understand.  I note the interest of members of the media today.</P>
        <P>We did not want legislation to touch a cap to the concept of North-South bodies.  Fishermen will have to implement the provisions.  The issue has not been fully addressed by any stretch of the imagination and difficulties will arise in the implementation phase.  However, if the implementing plan is made as clear as possible, these difficulties will be minimised.  The Bill provides a badly needed framework which we will be able to work.</P>
        <P>I thank everyone involved in the Bill and I do not underestimate the difficulties involved in bringing it to this point.  I ask Ministers and their officials to maintain their interest in the Foyle fisheries, which are as much a part of this country as any of the Ministers&rsquo; constituencies.</P>

I am also grateful to him and the Minister for accepting a number of Labour Party amendments. </P>
        <P>As Deputy Keaveney noted, this is an important Bill for people on either side of Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough.  Its enactment will constitute a practical realisation of the work under way since the British-Irish Agreement entered into force in 1999.   A similar Bill will come before the House next week.

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue and welcome my fellow Limerick man, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, to the House.  The Irish Psychiatric Association has published an evaluation of the first 12 months of the national men<Col N="1656"/>tal health policy, A Vision for Change.  Entitled A Vision in Hindsight, its report examines developments since A Vision for Change was launched a year ago to great fanfare as the bible for the development and modernisation of psychiatric services.  </P>
        <P>The Irish Psychiatric Association has been scathing about the work completed over the past 12 months.  Its public relations officer, Siobh&aacute;n Barry, stated that experience at the coalface has been so disappointing that the enthusiasm felt by service providers 12 months ago has dissipated and been replaced by a feeling of betrayal.  After one year, structures should have been established and there is disappointment and dismay at developments.  Dr. &Eacute;amonn Moloney stated that one third of community-based psychiatric teams, the establishment of which is a key proposal in the new policy, have fewer than 50% of staff.  He noted that at the current rate of appointments &mdash; 24 posts were filled last year &mdash; it will take 25 years to implement the recommendations on staff requirements set out in A Vision for Change.  Siobh&aacute;n Barry described the approach to capital development as &ldquo;shameful, shabby and shoddy&rdquo;.  The national mental health directive, she added, which is cost neutral, has not been implemented.</P>
        <P>The Government is not serious about implementing A Vision for Change.  A Vision in Hindsight states:</P>
        <P LI="1">There has been little evidence that the task of implementing <i>A Vision for Change </i>has been seriously tackled by the HSE to date.  The HSE Implementation and Expert Advisory Groups took almost 6 months to be established and they have each met only 3 times since.  No formal geo-mapping exercise has yet been conducted by the HSE and this would, in our view, be a fundamental task.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Insufficient funding has been allocated to implementing the recommendations of A Vision for Change.  A Vision in Hindsight notes that although &euro;26 million was committed nationally to the development of new mental health services in 2006, at the time of commencement of A Vision for Change, the level of funding received by individual services has been small, with none of the services receiving more than &euro;500,000.  This funding has been insufficient to create the new multidisciplinary teams the report recommended, and for which it was allocated.</P>
        <P>Last week, the Minister of State was unable to provide information I sought in a parliamentary question concerning the percentage of health expenditure allocated for psychiatric services.  He indicated the figures were being calculated and would be forwarded to me later this month.  The Irish Psychiatric Association has calculated the figure.  Its report states:</P>
        <P LI="1">An unprecedented increase of &euro;1.1bn in the health spend was announced in the 2007 budget &mdash; bringing the total to &euro;14 billion.  Of that, <Col N="1657"/>&euro;800m is allocated to mental health as revenue funding and &euro;25m to new service developments. <i> A Vision for Change </i>advised that implementing their recommendations would require the mental health percentage of the health budget to increase from its previous 6.9% to 8.24% &mdash; the meagre increased funding for mental health in 2007 brings that percentage down to below 6%, indicating clearly that we are moving in the opposite direction!</P>
        <P FLI="0">Almost one third of the &euro;25 million development funding the Minister of State committed to mental health services in 2007 has been earmarked for child and adolescent mental health services.  More than one fifth of this funding has been committed to contingencies brought about by the commencements, as required by the Government, of the Mental Health Act 2001 and the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  This leaves little funding to be shared out among disparate areas of need.  Only &euro;1.8 million of the money for new services has been allocated to generic adult mental health services in 2007.  It is clear from those sums that a continuation of the expanded community services that began in 2006, at the time of the launch of A Vision for Change, has not been incorporated within this year&rsquo;s budgeted programme.</P>
        <P>One year after the document&rsquo;s publication, the Irish Psychiatric Association says that at the most senior level little thought appears to have been given to organisational development, financial or otherwise, to enable its implementation.  If the funding issue is being debated at all, it is being done in the abstract.  The Irish Psychiatric Association states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The vision is vanishing and with it the opportunity and goodwill to make it possible.  Those affected by mental ill health are close to yet another political betrayal.  The public service users and carers in our organisation are angered, disappointed and cannot accept this lack of progress.  We, together with service users and providers, now demand urgent political and administrative action or, failing that, seek electoral accountability.</P>

	<P>I suggest to the Deputy that other people have views, as well as the consultants.</P>
        <P>The past year has been one of great change within mental health in Ireland with the launch of A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health policy in January 2006, the full implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001 from 1 November 2006, growing service capacity and additional investment.  I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to the full implementation of A Vision for Change and has accepted the report as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the individual recommendations of A Vision for Change is a matter primarily for the Health Service Executive.  In July 2006, the HSE established an implementation group to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in A Vision for Change a reality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of the work carried out to date includes informing all relevant  stakeholders, including staff, voluntary agencies, service user representatives and media of the recommendations in the report; developing additional capacity in child and adolescent services to reduce the dependency on adult services for this client group; commencing the establishment of 18 additional multi-disciplinary adult psychiatric teams; preparing for eight additional child and adolescent multi-disciplinary psychiatry teams; developing a population based resource allocation model; processing the full economic value of psychiatric hospital buildings and lands for reinvestment in the mental health services; training for 5,300 staff employed in the service; establishing the interim national service users executive, which I launched last week together with a mental health resource pack for use in primary care; and establishing the project team to develop the new Central Mental Hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In March 2006, I appointed an independent monitoring group to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of A Vision for Change.  The group will monitor and assess progress on the implementation of all the recommendations, including those which fall under the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, Departments and other relevant agencies.  The group is to submit its first annual report in mid-2007.</P>
        <P>The chairpersons of the implementation group and the monitoring group will meet in the near future.  Following that meeting, the Health <Col N="1659"/>Service Executive will publish a progress report and will outline the proposed implementation programme over the ten-year life of A Vision for Change.  Both these groups will play an important role in ensuring that the recommendations are implemented in a co-ordinated and timely manner.</P>
        <P>The Government has almost trebled expenditure on mental health from &euro;326 million in 1997 to &euro;835 million in 2006.  We have already allocated a total of &euro;51 million additional funding for 2006 and 2007 to implement A Vision for Change.  This is one third of the total funding estimated by the expert group to implement fully the mental health strategy over seven years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A Vision for Change outlines a comprehensive model for mental health service provision for Ireland.  It describes a framework for building and fostering positive mental health across the entire community and for providing accessible, community-based, specialist services for people with mental illness.  This Government is committed to the further development of our mental health services throughout the country and to ensuring they will continue to be improved and enhanced in the coming years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to have an opportunity to discuss this important issue today, the date chosen to focus attention on the eradication of female genital mutilation.  I feel it is incumbent upon me to raise this issue.  The United Nations Family Planning Association and UNICEF estimate that every day approximately 6,000 girls are subjected to this cruel fate.  The practice is continuing and it says much about the role of women.  It is incumbent on Deputies to raise this matter.  I note that over 20 Members of the House are women.</P>
        <P>Female genital mutilation is a violation of the basic rights of women and girls.  It is a dangerous and irreversible procedure that negatively impacts on the general health, child-bearing capability and educational opportunities of girls and women.  There is anecdotal evidence that this practice is being carried out in Ireland.  Health workers and voluntary sector groups have been approached by women querying how they can get the procedure done to their daughters in Ireland.  This reflects the fact that we have not made it clear that such a practice is illegal.  We should take every opportunity to make it perfectly clear to people that it is against the law and not something we would countenance.  When we get the opportunity to highlight the matter on a day like today &mdash; the international day for the eradication of female genital mutilation &mdash; we should do so.</P>
        <P>We know of parents who are seeking refuge in Ireland to ensure that their daughters are not circumcised.  Intolerable societal and family press<Col N="1660"/>ures result in women fleeing the country with their children, leaving behind other family members, including husbands and older children, to ensure their own daughters are not cut.</P>
        <P>Agencies such as the UNFPA and UNICEF estimate that at least 130 million women have been forced to undergo female genital mutilation.  Another 2 million are at risk each year from this degrading and dangerous practice.  We have a responsibility to ensure the elimination of this practice wherever it occurs.  In many ways we are working towards that goal.  I applaud the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, whose initiative allowed Irish Aid to become involved in preventing and responding to gender-based violence, particularly in conflict situations.  Our leadership in highlighting the issue has earned the country great kudos.</P>
        <P>Our support of UNFPA is also vital in this respect.  UNFPA supports women&rsquo;s groups and parliamentarians in promoting laws to protect women and girls against female genital mutilation.  The agency recognises that legal action alone is often not enough to deal with such traditions.  Therefore, it takes a culturally sensitive approach, working with local power structures to mobilise communities and undertake broad advocacy campaigns to offer alternative rituals.</P>
        <P>We need to have the courage to recognise that these practices are beginning to permeate our society.  In September 2006 the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child urged the State to continue its efforts to implement targeted programmes which sensitise all segments of the population as to its extremely harmful effects.  We are not doing enough.  Rather than merely continue as we have done, we should make stronger efforts to prevent the practice taking root in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity afforded to me to highlight the issue.  I look forward to the response of the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley for the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  I apologise on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who cannot be present.</P>
        <P>Female genital mutilation is a barbaric act which constitutes an assault causing serious harm to the girls and women on whom it is performed.  It is a deeply-rooted traditional practice which continues in countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.  The age at which it is performed varies from area to area.  It may be performed on infants, female children and adolescents or, occasionally, on mature women.  It is not only extremely painful but results in serious mutilation and may cause infection and death.  It exposes young girls and women to high health risks and seriously affects the quality of the rest of their lives.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children has obtained legal advice from the Attorney General <Col N="1661"/>that female genital mutilation is an offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  The advice states, <i>inter alia</i>, that it is likely that performing an act of female genital mutilation would comprise an intentional act which causes serious harm and would thus be an offence under section 4 of that Act.  If the act of female genital mutilation was not found to have resulted in &ldquo;serious&rdquo; harm, it would still be open to the Garda to prosecute for the similar, though less serious, offence of assaulting a person causing harm, provided for by section 3 of the 1997 Act.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children wrote to the then health boards in 2001, and again in 2004, drawing their attention to the issue of female genital mutilation and requesting that personnel working with immigrant populations take opportunities to educate them about the dangers and unacceptability of the practice.  The Department also wrote to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2004 with regard to the issue.  It asked that staff under the aegis of that Department whose work brings them into contact with persons from regions where female genital mutilation is practised should be made aware of the issue and should educate and inform such communities about the illegality and unacceptability of female genital mutilation.  The Department will be writing to the Health Service Executive on the matter again shortly to ensure female genital mutilation continues to be the subject of appropriate awareness and attention within the health services.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  Female genital mutilation is a barbaric practice and the Government will of course take any further steps which may be necessary to promote awareness of its illegality and unacceptability in our society.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, for attending.  I also thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this very important matter.  I do so both as a spokesperson on health and children and as a Deputy representing Cavan-Monaghan, a constituency where the poultry industry is one of the cornerstones of the local economy.  Hundreds of people are employed in the industry, which has thriving businesses in a region which has not benefited from industrial development to the extent experienced in the east and south.  For that reason, any damage to this vital sector would be catastrophic for the region.</P>
        <P>The confirmation of the outbreak of the H5N1 virus among poultry on the Bernard Matthews plant in Suffolk, England is a cause of very grave concern.  This is the strain that when contracted by human beings can prove fatal.  The first confirmation of such an outbreak in Britain brings the danger right to our doorstep and it requires the most vigorous response from the Government.  I <Col N="1662"/>believe more stringent precautionary measures are needed in the face of this threat.</P>
        <P>The decision of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, to ban imports of birds from Britain for shows and gatherings is not enough.  Four states &mdash; Hong Kong, Japan, Russia and South Korea &mdash; have already banned all poultry imports from Britain.  While I note the European Commission has today criticised this move, it nonetheless underlines the seriousness with which this threat is viewed.  In that context, the Minister should not limit her reaction to the extent that she has already announced.</P>
        <P>Our priority must be to safeguard human health and the poultry industry on the island of Ireland.  For that reason, the import of all poultry and poultry products from Britain to any part of Ireland, north or south of the Border, should be stopped until the all-clear is given.  This will be objected to on the grounds that it is excessive and would damage trade.  However, such a short-term &mdash; I emphasise it would be short-term &mdash; disruption to trade would be negligible if it helped to ensure this virus did not spread to Ireland, devastating the poultry industry and posing a real threat to human health.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in Britain has been unable to confirm whether eggs may have been imported to the infected Bernard Matthews plant in Britain from its plant in Hungary, where there was another outbreak of H5N1 last month.  One of the possible ways in which birds at the Bernard Matthews plant were infected was if one of the eggs in the hatchery was already infected from its mother, perhaps because hatching eggs were imported.  The British Health Secretary, Ms Patricia Hewitt MP, has said that while the risk to human health is remote, the British Government is preparing &ldquo;very, very seriously and thoroughly for the possibility of a pandemic flu&rdquo;.  Should we prepare any less?  The United Nations co-ordinator for human influenza and avian flu, David Nabarro, has highlighted the high number of cases of the disease throughout the world at present.  He stated that everybody needs to be anxious about the situation.</P>
        <P>All of this emphasises the need for more stringent measures here.  I respectfully urge the Minister to immediately review and revisit her approach and to return with a revised programme of more strict precautions in order to protect human health and the very important poultry industry.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for allowing me the opportunity to give the response of my Department to the confirmed outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu on a turkey farm in Suffolk.  As the House will be aware, this case was confirmed on Saturday morning last, by which time the management committee of my Department&rsquo;s National Disease <Col N="1663"/>Control Centre, NDCC, had met.  One of the key lessons learned, following confirmation of a case of avian flu in a swan last April in Scotland, was the need to assess the level of risk posed before taking any action and then to respond accordingly and, most importantly, appropriately.</P>
        <P>On Saturday last my officials concluded that the very fact of a case in England increased the risk to Ireland but also concluded this was precisely the type of event our contingency arrangements would have anticipated and were designed to cater for.  On that basis, I was satisfied as to the adequacy of the measures in place and concluded that no immediate further measures were necessary other than to place our veterinary and laboratory staff on a higher state of readiness and to ensure the Department&rsquo;s helpline was sufficiently staffed.</P>
        <P>The situation was kept under constant review over the weekend and I was in constant contact with my officials, who were themselves in contact with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, DEFRA, in London, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, DARD, in Belfast and the European Commission in Brussels.  I did not consider that additional measures were merited over the weekend.</P>
        <P>On Monday morning, DEFRA introduced a ban on shows and bird gatherings in Britain.  After the situation had been reviewed by the NDCC management committee and officials had consulted with colleagues in DARD in Belfast, I took the decision to ban the importation of birds from Britain for shows and gatherings in Ireland.  The Northern Ireland authorities introduced an identical ban and, in maintaining the all-island approach to this issue, neither ban extended to the movement of birds on the island of Ireland and shows and bird gatherings continue to be permitted on both sides of the Border.</P>
        <P>This measure is a natural extension to what DEFRA has done and is entirely proportional to the increased risk posed by the case in Suffolk.  At no time was a ban on the importation of poultry or poultry products contemplated.  Such a measure would have been entirely disproportionate and, under Community law, illegal.  Contrary to the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion, the British Government is not imposing any such ban.</P>
        <P>It is important to understand what happens when a case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu is confirmed.  A 3 km protection zone and a 10 km zone are put in place and where considered necessary a further restricted zone can be applied.  In this case, the UK authorities did so, comprising an area of some 2,000 sq. km.  Trade of poultry and poultry products from these areas is restricted.  The idea of a further restricted zone is to act as a buffer between the affected areas and the rest of the country and to facilitate trade from the rest of the country.</P><Col N="1664"/>
        <P>Trade in poultry and poultry products is governed by EU Single Market rules.  Specific measures on avian flu were transposed into Irish law last year, providing for regional restrictions where an outbreak occurs.  I am entirely satisfied that the measures put in place in England will fulfil their purpose and I am satisfied also that the rest of Britain should be allowed to trade freely.  In the unfortunate event that we were to be affected by avian flu, such a regional approach would be of great value to the Irish poultry industry with which the Deputy is more than familiar.</P>
        <P>I share the view expressed by Commissioner Kyprianou that restrictions to trade should affect regions or areas and not whole countries as an entity.  My officials have been maintaining close daily contact with colleagues in London and Belfast since the outbreak was confirmed and, this morning, officials attended a meeting in Brussels at which UK officials made a presentation on the outbreak.  Tomorrow the issue will be further considered at a meeting of chief veterinary officers in Brussels.</P>
        <P>Earlier today, I spoke to the Secretary of State, David Miliband MP, and wished him well in his stated aim of stamping out the disease, protecting public health, protecting animal health and welfare and regaining the UK&rsquo;s disease-free status.  I also reiterated the value of the close contacts between our respective Departments and emphasised the need to maintain constant and immediate contact between us.</P>
        <P>Based on the information available to me and my Department, I share the assessment of the European Commission spokesman yesterday that the UK measures are in place and are working well.  Given the manner in which DEFRA appears to have responded to the outbreak and the manner which, to date, it appears to have been contained, I am of the view that additional protective measures are not warranted at this time.  The situation will continue to be kept under constant review and should circumstances change such that additional measures would be appropriate, I will not hesitate to introduce such measures.</P>
        <P>Earlier this afternoon, the avian influenza expert group, which I established under the chairmanship of Professor Michael Monaghan last year, met to review events since the weekend and, in particular, to assess the response of my Department.  It was the group&rsquo;s conclusion that the steps we have taken are entirely appropriate.</P>
        <P>I am particularly anxious to maintain an all-island approach to this issue.  It has worked very well over the past 18 months or so and the manner in which the two Departments, North and South of the Border, announced similar measures virtually simultaneously yesterday is clear evidence of the close working relationship between the Departments.  The commitment of DARD to working together with my Department to minimise the risk to the island of Ireland is recognition of the value of an all-island approach.</P><Col N="1665"/>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to the threat to human health.  There is little or no human health aspect associated with this outbreak and it has little or no human implications for this country.  There are no recorded cases of workers in the poultry industry contracting avian flu and, as the Deputy well knows, there are no dangers associated with consuming properly cooked poultry meat, a point emphasised time and again by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, Safefood, the European Food Safety Authority, the Food Standards Authority in the UK, etc.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment briefly on suggestions in the media and from Members of the House that there is an inevitability about Ireland being affected by avian flu.  Let me be clear, there is no such inevitability.  Of course, there is a possibility and as the most likely source of introduction is through migrating wild birds, the Department and I are limited in what we can do to prevent such a possibility.  Our focus, therefore, is on ensuring that all the necessary means are in place to ensure the early detection of any case or outbreak, the efficient control and management of such a case and the speedy eradication of the disease and the restoration of the country&rsquo;s disease-free status.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF"><NameTxt>Mr. &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue for Kildare on the Adjournment of the House and I thank the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, for being here at this late hour to address the issue.</P>
        <P>Kildare town, with a population of approximately 9,000 people, is serviced by an antiquated waste water treatment plant which discharges into the Tully River.  The treatment plant is overloaded, with just about 9,000 person equivalents and, in any event, the Tully River is incapable of absorbing any further discharge.</P>
        <P>The need for a new sewage treatment works was highlighted in the mid-1990s and the objective was firmly written into the 2002-08 development plan for Kildare town.  Despite this, it was not until late 2005 that Kildare County Council completed its environmental impact statement on the waste water treatment plant.  This was duly approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 10 March 2006.  Considerable documentation and correspondence passed back and forth between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Kildare County Council between May and November 2006, when the Department rejected the council&rsquo;s procurement strategy for the waste water treatment plant.</P>
        <P>I understand that following discussions between the council and Department officials, Kildare County Council will now consider delivering the treatment plant by way of a public private partnership arrangement or the design, <Col N="1666"/>build and operate option which it had previously ignored.</P>
        <P>The protracted delay which has surrounded the delivery of this vital infrastructure for Kildare town has had serious consequences for the local community and the local economy.  All construction work, other than that being undertaken by the local authority itself, is at a standstill and businesses have already moved out of the area as the council has operated a policy of refusing practically all planning applications until recently, when development proposals were permitted with the proviso that no construction take place until contract documents are signed for the new treatment works.</P>
        <P>Kildare town was long regarded as one of the worst bottlenecks on the N7, until its bypass was completed at the end of 2003.  It was generally expected that in returning the town to its people, a new development dynamic would be released which would see the town grow and prosper.  This has been the experience in many other towns throughout the country, but has not yet come to pass in Kildare, because of the sewage treatment plant logjam.</P>
        <P>I am extremely disappointed with the lack of priority which the council has given to this vital project over the past five years and with the lack of progress on a number of other important waste water projects in County Kildare.  It has recently emerged that the major mid-Kildare waste water facility at Osberstown is near capacity and that it may be 2008 before a contract is in place for its extension.  This situation is already beginning to impact negatively on developments in Naas and Newbridge.</P>
        <P>When one looks at the lack of progress by the council on a variety of such projects across the county, one wonders whether the council, contrary to the provisions of its development plans, seeks to suppress the growth in the county&rsquo;s population by allowing these infrastructure deficits to prevail.</P>
        <P>In terms of the current proposal for Kildare town, what is envisaged by Kildare County Council is a modular plant discharging via a lengthy pipeline to the River Barrow.  The initial package would have a capacity for 14,000 person equivalents, which I suggest is wholly inadequate.  As the lack of sewerage capacity has rendered the 2002 area plan for Kildare town totally redundant, we can expect an explosion of development on long-zoned lands as soon as treatment facilities are in place.  It would be completely irresponsible to disregard this fact.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to issue the speediest possible approval for the Kildare waste water treatment facility, which should have a minimum capacity for 25,000 person equivalents.  I further request the Minister to review the delivery by Kildare County Council of water and sewerage schemes in the county.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to clarify the position on this important issue.  I admire the forthright and candid submission he has made to the House.</P>
        <P>I appreciate fully the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns about the negative impact on Kildare town of the lethargic approach adopted on this matter to date.  The Kildare town sewerage scheme is one of a total of 19 water services projects being progressed in County Kildare at present, with the support of unprecedented Exchequer funding from my Department under the national development plan.  The investment in new water services infrastructure all around the country has made a key contribution to economic growth that has benefited every part of Ireland.  I am therefore as impatient as Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l with any unnecessary bureaucracy, red tape or delay in introducing proposals of local environmental importance.</P>
        <P>The range of new water and sewerage schemes planned or in progress in Kildare provides strong evidence of the Government&rsquo;s determination to safeguard the environment while making provision for new housing and jobs, and all the other requirements of a successful and growing economy.  The Department&rsquo;s current water services investment programme covering 2005 to 2007 commits over &euro;220 million to water and sewerage schemes in County Kildare.  All those should be in place as soon as possible.  Many towns and villages around the county can look forward to a new or upgraded water supply and sewerage facilities.  Those projects should be approached with ambition locally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The &euro;20 million Kildare scheme involves a major expansion and overhaul of the waste water treatment plant, with capacity almost to treble from the current population equivalent of 9,700 to above 28,000.  The scheme also provides for the rehabilitation of the existing collection system and the construction of new sewers to the west and south west of the town.  It is, therefore, very important to the residential, commercial and industrial life of Kildare and its growth and <Col N="1668"/>development.  The new infrastructure will also, of course, improve water quality in the Tully stream, the Finnery river and, in turn, the River Barrow.</P>
        <P>All the multi-million euro projects being funded by the taxpayer must undergo detailed planning and assessment to ensure that they meet their objectives and are designed and constructed in as economical a manner as possible.  However, I am glad to report that the Department&rsquo;s examination of Kildare County Council&rsquo;s preliminary report on the Kildare scheme is now very close to being finalised.  I once again accept the Deputy&rsquo;s points regarding issues that have delayed the scheme; he is quite right in his analysis.</P>
        <P>I also fully agree that this project is vitally important to the development of Kildare town as a whole.  In particular, I am anxious to ensure that it be advanced as expeditiously as possible to facilitate redevelopment of the former Magee barracks under the affordable housing initiative.  The Magee project offers an exciting opportunity, not just to deliver affordable housing but to secure a major regeneration covering a large area close to the heart of the town.  The Department will work closely with the council towards that end.</P>
        <P>The Department is fully committed to starting the scheme as quickly as possible.  I expect and will accept nothing less in terms of local ambition.  I assure Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l that we will complete the assessment of Kildare County Council&rsquo;s report very shortly, with a view to putting the scheme out to tender as soon as possible.  I have taken very careful note of the Deputy&rsquo;s points and will bring them to the attention of the relevant departmental personnel.  I will request that the various serious observations made be fully examined.  I reiterate the extraordinary work he has put into achieving this scheme and the contacts he has made with me and locally to see that it is delivered for the people of Kildare town as expeditiously as possible.  I assure him that no effort will be spared on my part or that of the Department to get the scheme up and running as early as possible.</P>

	<P>In the context of the 2000-2006 EU rural development framework, amendments introduced in 2003 extended possible support options.  The additional options included support for food companies and farmers in respect of compliance with EU standards.  The 2003 amendments did not, however, provide additional funding.</P>
        <P>While funding later arose through the modulation process, support for small food companies was excluded.  I decided to target the modulated funds at farmers in the disadvantaged areas.  That decision took account of the relative priorities, the outcome of a well-publicised consultative process and the then limitations on the use of modulated funds.</P>
        <P>The support options related to EU standards were carried forward to the 2007-2013 EU rural development framework.  In the case of food companies, however, the relevant option is now limited to micro-enterprises.  My Department conducted an extensive consultative process on the strategy and measures that should be pursued in line with the EU framework.  That process included press advertisements seeking submissions, information on the Department&rsquo;s web<Col N="1671"/>site and seminars.  The consultative process was completed in December and a rural development programme was sent for EU Commission approval before the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>The new rural development programme addresses three priorities &mdash; competitiveness, environment and quality of life/diversification.  It bears in mind the outcome of the consultative process, the relative priorities and the available funding.  While it does not envisage support for compliance with or upgrading to EU standards, the relevant environmental, hygiene and animal welfare issues are addressed through other measures such as on-farm investment and agri-environment.  For food companies classified as micro-enterprises &mdash; having fewer than 10 employees and a turnover/balance sheet of less than &euro;10million &mdash; the programme offers support options under its quality of life/diversification priority.  When EU approval for Ireland&rsquo;s new rural development programme has been secured I will, together with my colleague the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, who has responsibility for the quality of life/diversification priority, ensure that small food producers will be well briefed on all the opportunities for support under the programme.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, in the new decoupled support environment, small food producers need a deep understanding of changing consumer requirements and routes to market to secure a sustainable return for their produce.  Bord Bia has introduced a range of measures to assist small food producers to adapt to emerging market opportunities.</P>

	<P>Under the EU Energy Crops Scheme, aid of &euro;45 per hectare is available for areas sown under energy crops provided they are intended primarily for use in the production of biofuels and electric and thermal energy produced from biomass.  I intend to introduce an additional national payment of &euro;80 per hectare in 2007 as a further incentive for farmers to grow energy crops.  The &euro;80 payment will be paid as a top-up to the EU premium of &euro;45 per hectare, bringing the overall payment to &euro;125 per hectare.  It is intended that the &euro;80 additional payment will apply for three years and will be subject to a maximum ceiling per producer over the three years.  The current maximum area per producer is 37.5 hectares. </P>
        <P>Set aside land can also be used for a variety of non-food uses including the growing of crops for energy purpose and will therefore qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme.</P><Col N="1672"/>
        <P>I also intend to introduce a new Bioenergy Scheme for a limited period to encourage farmers to plant willow and miscanthus for use a renewable source of energy.  The Scheme will provide establishment grants to farmers for up to 50% of the costs associated with establishing miscanthus and willow on set-aside land and on areas, which have been subject to an application for the EU premium of &euro;45 per hectare.  &euro;8 million is being allocated to this Scheme over the period 2007-2009.  The scheme details are being finalised and will be announced shortly.</P>
        <P>On the demand side, the recently announced Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme valued at &euro;205m will provide an additional stimulus for the production of energy crops.  When fully operational in 2008, it will deliver some 163 million litres of biofuels per year and provide farmers with a stable market to supply feedstock for production of biofuels.</P>
        <P>I am confident that these measures will increase the production of energy crops in Ireland and encourage farmers to consider energy crops as an alternative land use options.</P>

	<P>The rules governing the production and use of GM crops within the Community are set down in EU legislation which has been jointly adopted by the European Parliament and the Council.  This legislation is binding on all Member States and does not provide for the declaration of a GM free country or region.  There are, however, options available to restrict the growing of GM crops within regions of a country.  One option is the concept of voluntarily developed GM free regions, where there is a voluntary agreement among all growers in a region not to grow a GM crop or crops.   Another option is to seek a derogation from the Commission that, on the basis of sound scientific evidence, coexistence of GM crops with non-GM crops is not possible in certain regions in respect of certain named crops.  The cultivation of these crops can then be legitimately prohibited if the case made is accepted by the Commission.</P>

	<P>Since the initial outbreak of Equine Infectious Anaemia, or &lsquo;swamp fever&rsquo;, in June 2006, my Department has taken significant steps to contain the outbreak and progress its eradication and to protect the very valuable Irish bloodstock industry.</P><Col N="1674"/>
        <P>To date, twenty-eight cases have been confirmed, the most recent on 10 December 2006, over eight weeks ago.  This is, by some considerable distance, the longest interval between any two previous cases and, with over 14,000 blood samples having been tested last month, gives increasing confidence that the outbreak has been contained and very significant progress made towards its eradication.</P>
        <P>Following confirmation of the first case, my Department put in place a strict control regime aimed at containing and eradicating the disease, which involved the restriction on the movement of horses and an extensive surveillance programme, including all of those horses which were subject to movement restriction.</P>
        <P>As well as restrictions on the movements of individual horses from their home premises, the Department placed restrictions on the movement of horses on to or from fifty-three premises, other than under permit.  Of the fifty-three premises restrictions, only seven remain in place.  In all, over 1200 horses have, at one time or another, been subject to movement restrictions and, at this time, almost ninety per cent of those restrictions have been lifted.  Assuming no further cases are confirmed, all movement restrictions should be lifted by mid-March.</P>
        <P>My Department did meet recently with representatives of a number of horse owners whose premises were subject to movement restriction to discuss the issue of financial assistance in respect of losses claimed to have been incurred as a consequence of their having been restricted.  My officials made clear at that meeting that the Department does not intend to make any such payments and that remains my position.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s principal aim, since the outbreak was confirmed, has been to contain and eradicate the disease and the current situation would indicate that the outbreak has been contained and that we are well on the way to ensuring its eradication.  All of the measures taken, including the introduction of appropriate legislation, the imposition of movement restrictions and the introduction of surveillance programmes, were taken to achieve that aim and to protect the industry.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the financial burden, associated with the cost of testing restricted horses, I introduced a package of financial measures in August 2006 to support those owners whose horses had been restricted and subject to a surveillance programme of at least ninety days.  This included a financial contribution for each visit by a veterinarian to take blood samples as well as the cost of testing those samples.  To date, the cost of this package to the Department has been in excess of &euro;100,000.  In addition, veterinary inspectors from my own Department have taken several thousand blood samples as part of a specifically targeted surveillance programme in Counties Meath, Dublin and Kildare, a significant proportion of which were subsequently tested at my Department&rsquo;s Central Veterinary Research Lab<Col N="1675"/>oratory.  The entire cost of this phase of the extensive surveillance programme is being met by my Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The most practical help that I and my Department can provide to any horse owner in this country is to take such measures as are appropriate to ensure that this outbreak is contained and eradicated.  We are determined to do that and, in doing so, it is incumbent on me to express my gratitude to the Irish bloodstock industry, both thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred sectors, for the responsibility they have shown and for the cooperation and assistance that they have given my Department in our shared aim of ridding the country of equine infectious anaemia.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Climate change has serious implications not just for agriculture but for all sectors of the economy.  The Government is committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol and the National Climate Change Strategy published in 2000 sets the framework for Ireland to achieve its targets under the Protocol, i.e. to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels over the commitment period of 2008&ndash;2012.  The target set for agriculture to reduce emissions is 10% below the projected &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; levels for 2010.  In fact, the agriculture and forestry sectors look likely to exceed this target and to achieve a reduction of 12%. </P>
        <P>Furthermore it is these sectors that are making the largest contribution to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.  An independent assessment in March 2006 found that the total projected annual reduction in emissions would come to 7.95 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.  Over 56% of this would come as a direct result of policies, measures and actions in the agriculture and forestry sectors &mdash; 2.4 million tonnes from agriculture and 2.1 million tonnes from changes in land use from agriculture to forestry.</P>
        <P>The decoupling of direct payments from production plays a very significant part in the reduction of methane emissions from agriculture because of the projected fall in livestock numbers.  The results of the latest Teagasc National Farm Survey indicate that these numbers will remain at their reduced levels in the medium term.</P>
        <P>The environment is central to the agriculture and forestry measures in the National Development Plan.  The forestry measures are the principal instrument designed to mitigate climate change, but the new REP Scheme will also include elements that will reduce emissions.  Environmental sustainability will also be pro<Col N="1679"/>moted through agricultural education and training.</P>
        <P>My Department closely monitors ongoing research programme both on climate change in Ireland and its likely impact.  I am aware that increased precipitation and water shortages are major issues for agriculture worldwide and it has been suggested that such changes in our own climate may have both positive and negative long-term effects on Irish agriculture.  Accordingly, my Department is funding various research projects to assist in identifying sustainable greenhouse gas emission reduction measures.  Amongst these are studies focused on reducing methane emissions in ruminants and an examination of nitrous oxide emissions from grasslands.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the commitments made in the National Development Plan to combat climate change and I intend, through my Department&rsquo;s network of local offices, the offices of Teagasc and by providing support to relevant NGOs, to pursue a campaign to increase awareness of, and the need for adaptation to, the impacts of climate change in the agriculture and forestry sectors.</P>

	<P>The regulatory framework governing plant protection products in Ireland which is set out in SI 83 of 2003 is designed to ensure a very high standard of protection for human health and the environment.  Enforcement of the legislation involves inspections to ensure that only approved products are present in the market and are used by farmers and growers.  Inspections normally take place at wholesale/distribution level.  However where there is evidence of possible misuse of plant protection products generated through the residue monitoring programme at wholesale/distribution level or from any other source, specific inspections at end-user level take place. </P>
        <P>The pesticide residue monitoring programme conducted by my Department on behalf of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI), is agreed on an annual basis with the FSAI.  This programme is risk-based and involved the analysis of some 1,350 samples of agricultural produce in each of the years 2005 and 2006 for up to 150 different pesticide compounds.  The number of <Col N="1680"/>samples of mushrooms taken and analysed in 2005 and 2006 was 10 and 13 respectively.  All were found to be free of illegal residues.</P>
        <P>Penalties involving fines of up to &euro;5,000 and or 6 months imprisonment can be imposed where evidence of misuse is uncovered, at the discretion of the courts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 176 together.</P>
        <P>The negotiations on a new WTO agreement were launched at Doha in November 2001. While significant progress has been made towards concluding an agreement, most notably in the framework agreement which was reached in Geneva in August 2004 and at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005, the negotiations broke down and were suspended in July 2006. Following a period of inactivity, they resumed again in December 2006 in a low-key manner based on discussions in Geneva at official rather than Ministerial level. No significant new proposals have been made by any of the key negotiating partners.</P>
        <P>An informal meeting of WTO Ministers from the main negotiating partners took place in the margins of the World Economic Forum in Davos on 28 January at which there was a general commitment to resumption of more formal negotiations. Accordingly, I expect that there will be a full resumption of the negotiations in Geneva with a view to making early progress in the next few months.</P>
        <P>I am committed to an ambitious and balanced outcome to the negotiations. As an open economy dependent on trade Ireland has much to gain from a successful deal. I am concerned that the Commission has indicated recently that it is prepared to consider making an improved offer on the EU position, especially in relation to market access or tariff cuts. I remain determined that agriculture must not be sacrificed for the sake of an overall agreement and that, in accordance with the agreed EU negotiating mandate, a new WTO agreement will not necessitate further reform of the CAP. The EU has undertaken CAP reform in preparation for the negotiations and I believe that it has already made a generous offer to reduce trade distorting subsidies and to provide substantial Special and Differential Treatment for developing countries.</P>
        <P>I have consistently outlined my position in the clearest possible terms in the Council of Agriculture Ministers, most recently on 29 January, and I have emphasised the absolute necessity that the Commission remain within the terms of the negotiating mandate. I will continue to work closely with like-minded Ministers in other Member States to seek support for my position.</P>

In the years preceding the ban, a substantial trade had developed in the export of Irish beef to Saudi Arabia which was worth some &euro;34m in 2000. To put this in context, Irish food and drink exports to Saudi Arabia were valued at &euro;140m in 2005.</P>
        <P>The UAE was also a good market for Irish beef until it was banned in January 2001. In 2000, Irish beef, worth an estimated &euro;17, was exported to the UAE. In 2005 Irish food and drink exports there were valued at &euro;25.4m.</P>
        <P>The Saudi Arabian and UAE markets are therefore very valuable markets for Irish food exports and potentially for beef, if the current restrictions were relaxed. I made a strong case during the visit for the full re opening of the beef markets in both countries.</P>
        <P>The visit was very successful and I had very positive discussions in Saudi Arabia on the question of Irish food exports in general and beef exports in particular. As a result of these discussions, the Saudi authorities have now offered to send a team of experts to Ireland to inspect our food safety and animal health controls.  I trust that the proposed visit will be successful and lead to the re-opening of the market there for Irish beef in due course.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also had fruitful talks during my visit to the UAE.  Although that market is open, only beef from animals under 12 months is eligible and my aim is to have this age limit raised to at least 30 months. I am pursuing this issue with the authorities in the UAE and would be hopeful of a positive reaction.</P>

	<P>The deliberate release of genetically modified crops into the environment is legislated for under EU Directive 2001/18/EC which provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for controls governing the assessment and authorisation procedures for GM crop cultivation. The EPA is the competent authority for the implementation of this Directive in Ireland.</P>
        <P>This Directive is part of a suite of GM legislation, adopted by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament which is binding on all Member States and is aimed at achieving the highest possible degree of human health and environmental protection for the citizens of the EU.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s general position in developing and implementing this legislation is informed by the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of the recommendation set out in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Modern Biotechnology (October 2000) that Ireland&rsquo;s stand at EU level and in international fora should be one of positive but precautionary &mdash; a position which acknowledges the benefits of genetic engineering, while maintaining a fundamental commitment to safety and environmental sustainability based on scientific risk assessment and management.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied these authorisation procedures, coupled with effective coexistence measures, can adequately safeguard the environment and human health in the context of authorised GM crop cultivation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Climate change has serious implications not just for agriculture but for all sectors of the economy.  The Government is committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol and the National Climate Change Strategy published in 2000 sets the framework for Ireland to achieve its targets under the Protocol, i.e. to limit greenhouse gas <Col N="1684"/>emissions to 13% above 1990 levels over the commitment period of 2008&ndash;2012.  The target set for agriculture to reduce emissions is 10% below the projected &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; levels for 2010.  In fact, the agriculture and forestry sectors look likely to exceed this target and to achieve a reduction of 12%.</P>
        <P>Furthermore it is these sectors that are making the largest contribution to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.  An independent assessment in March 2006 found that the total projected annual reduction in emissions would come to 7.95 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.  Over 56% of this would come as a direct result of policies, measures and actions in the agriculture and forestry sectors &mdash; 2.4 million tonnes from agriculture and 2.1 million tonnes from changes in land use from agriculture to forestry.</P>
        <P>The decoupling of direct payments from production plays a very significant part in the reduction of methane emissions from agriculture, because of the projected fall in livestock numbers.  The results of the latest Teagasc National Farm Survey indicate that these numbers will remain at their reduced levels in the medium term.</P>
        <P>As regards the likely impact of changes to climate on Irish agriculture, my Department closely monitors ongoing research programmes both on climate change in Ireland and on its likely impact.  I am aware that increased precipitation and water shortages are major issues for agriculture worldwide and it has been suggested that such changes in our own climate may have both positive and negative long-term effects on Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>My Department is funding various research projects to assist in identifying sustainable greenhouse gas emission reduction measures.  Amongst these are studies focused on reducing methane emissions in ruminants and an examination of nitrous oxide emissions from grasslands.  Under the  Stimulus Research Programme, my Department has set aside funding for research designed to improve the understanding of the impacts of climate change on agricultural production at the farm level.  The outputs from this modelling will be used by the Teagasc Rural Economy Research Centre (RERC) to further investigate impacts of climate change and identify sustainable alternatives at farm scale.  These programmes are in addition to agricultural-related research undertaken by the EPA under the ERTDI programme which we continue to monitor closely so as to identify what areas of agriculture are vulnerable to climate change and how farming systems are likely to be adapted in response.</P>
        <P>A review of the National Climate Change Strategy is currently under way.  My Department along with the other Departments on the interdepartmental climate change team, is considering the stakeholder submissions received as part of the public consultation process on the review of <Col N="1685"/> Ireland&rsquo;s National Climate Change Strategy, which was first published in 2000.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 122 together. </P>
        <P>I am very aware of the need to promote sensible and healthy eating habits among our young people. Not alone do health, diet and nutrition impact on societal well-being, mental health and life expectancy, it pervades into every area of our economy, from lost work days to increased healthcare costs. The case for targeting the dietary habits of young people in their formative years is compelling. That is why I have introduced a range of measures in the area of research and in the area of promotion, all of which recognise the need for a collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach.</P>
        <P>The Scientific Study on Children&rsquo;s Diet, which was co-funded by my Department and the Food <Col N="1686"/>Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI), was the first study to benchmark dietary intakes of a nationally representative sample of Irish children. The work was carried out by researchers in Trinity College, Dublin and University College, Cork who surveyed 600 children aged 5-12 years from primary schools throughout Ireland during 2003 and 2004. The researchers collected information on diet, physical activity and body measurements on each child in addition to lifestyle information for both the children and their parents.</P>
        <P>In relation to diet, the Scientific Study identified inadequate consumption of milk, fresh meat and fruit and vegetables among the young. Responding to this study and to the recommendation of the Obesity Task Force, last August I launched a new school milk scheme. The new revamped scheme has a broader range of milk products on offer including flavoured milk, low-fat and fortified options and the improved packaging will I believe encourage more milk consumption among schoolchildren.</P>
        <P>In addition my Department in conjunction with the European Commission and Wholesale Produce Ireland is funding a pilot healthy eating initiative (known as the Food Dude Programme) to encourage fruit and vegetable consumption among primary schoolchildren. Managed by An Bord Bia it is now in its second year in operation and will, on completion, have been introduced to 120 primary schools over 3 years.  This programme was developed by the University of Wales, Bangor and is based on positive role models (the Food Dudes characters), repeated tasting and rewards.  Studies show that it can deliver long-lasting results across the primary age range, regardless of gender, school size, geographic and socio-economic factors.  It is designed to enable children enjoy healthy diets, and to create a healthy eating culture within schools.</P>
        <P>In fact, the results of the first year were so very encouraging and the activity so well received by pupils, parent and teachers that I have decided to extend the Food Dude programme to more primary schools on a fully exchequer funded basis.  An amount of &euro;4million is being provided for this purpose in 2007 and, subject to evaluation further funding will be provided in following years. EU state aid approval has recently been received for the extended programme.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture published its report on the Early Retirement Schemes in February 2005.  The report dealt with a range of issues and I responded to it in detail in September 2005.  As I explained in my response, certain of the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations were precluded by the EU Regulations under which the Scheme and its predecessor were operated.  The Scheme closed to new entrants on 31 December 2006.</P>
        <P>I saw some merit in other aspects of the Committee&rsquo;s report, specifically those relating to income limits and in line with the Joint Committee&rsquo;s recommendations, I increased the off-farm income limit for transferees in the Scheme from &euro;25,400 to &euro;40,000 and abolished the income limit for transferors with effect from 1 September 2006.</P>
        <P>The Committee paid particular attention to two further issues.  One was the implication of decoupling for retired farmers who had leased out land and quota to transferees before or during the Single Payment Scheme reference period.  I believe we secured the best deal that we could for people in this situation, in spite of the reluctance of the Commission at the outset.  A specific mandatory category was included in the National Reserve arrangements under the Single Payment Scheme.  This category caters for farmers who inherited or otherwise received a holding free of charge or for a nominal amount from a farmer who retired or died before 16 May 2005 where the land in question was leased out to a third party during the reference period.  Under these arrangements, where a farm reverted to the retired farmer at the end of a lease without any entitlements, the farmer taking it over will have access to the National Reserve.  Retired farmers in the Early Retirement Scheme who farmed during part or all of the reference period and who held Single Payment entitlements could activate <Col N="1690"/>entitlements and lease them to their transferees.  If the transferee did not wish to use the entitlements, a transferor has until 2007 to lease the entitlements with land to another farmer.  Once at least 80% of the entitlements have been used by the lessee, the transferor has the option to sell the entitlements with or without land; otherwise he can continue to lease the entitlements with land.</P>
        <P>The second issue the Joint Committee focused particularly on was the levels of payment under the two Schemes.  In the course of discussions on this issue, the European Commission had pointed out that the rate in the earlier Scheme was set at the maximum amount for co-funding that the Regulation allowed, and that it would not be possible to secure co-funding for an increase in the rate of pension for existing participants in the 2000&ndash;2006 Scheme.  The Commission, however, agreed to increases for existing participants in both schemes, funded entirely from the national exchequer as a State aid.  I therefore announced substantial increases in the maximum pension rates payable under both Schemes which took effect from 1 November 2006.  I increased the maximum pension rate payable under the 1994&ndash;99 Scheme from &euro;12,075 to &euro;14,075 per annum and the maximum pension rate payable under the 2000&ndash;2006 Scheme from &euro;13,515 to &euro;15,000 per annum.  These increases will cost some &euro;33 million extra over the remaining period of the two Schemes, and over 5,000 retired farmers will benefit from them.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125, 134 and 146 together.</P>
        <P>Under the relevant EU regulations, the restructuring aid for the sugar industry has to be drawn <Col N="1691"/>down on the basis of an aid application submitted by the sugar processor.  The applications must contain a restructuring plan, including a social plan detailing the actions planned in particular with respect to re-training, redeployment and early retirement of the workforce concerned.  In July 2006, Greencore duly submitted such an application, which indicated that the proposed redundancy payments were in accordance with the ruling of the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>I have met representatives of the workers on a number of occasions and I am aware that there is an ongoing dispute between the company and the workers over the interpretation of the Labour Court recommendation.  I regret that the parties have not yet resolved their differences but I have no function in that regard.  The position regarding that dispute was fully explained by my colleague the Minister for Labour Affairs, Mr Tony Killeen TD, in reply to a Parliamentary Question last Wednesday.</P>
        <P>The aid application submitted by Greencore was approved in September subject to the outcome of the Judicial Review proceedings instituted by Greencore in respect of the Government decisions regarding the allocation of the aid.  In view of these legal proceedings, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</P>
        <P>I have no function in relation to any planning applications by Greencore.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that I have no plans at present to commission any further evaluations on the economic implications of the use of genetically modified organisms.  The Deputy will recall that Teagasc, at my request, carried out in 2006,  a study on evaluation of the possible national economic implications for the Agri-Food industry from the use of GMOs in crop and livestock production.  Teagasc based their study on the following scenarios: </P>
        <P LI="1">(i) The economic implications of only allowing the importation into Ireland of certified GM-free soyabean and maize livestock feed ingredients; and</P>
        <P LI="1">(ii) The economic implications of GM-free crop cultivation in Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the first scenario the study showed that substantial additional costs would be placed on the livestock sector, particularly on specialist dairy and beef farmers, if they were to use certified GM free soya and maize only in feedingstuffs. In the second scenario the study examined five hypothetical GM crops which could be grown here &mdash; herbicide tolerant sugar beet, Septoria resistant winter wheat, Fusarium resistant winter wheat, Rhyncosporium resistant spring barley and blight resistant potatoes.  This study showed that increased profits could be generated for growers of these crops compared to their conventional equivalent.  However, the study showed that there is a significant cost in relation to Identity Preservation for conventional growers in a coexistence arrangement.</P>

	<P>There are adequate poultry processing facilities in this country having regard to such criteria as the overall volume of poultry being reared and produced here.  Poultry processing plants must strive to compete efficiently with operators in other countries and volume throughput is essential to this efficiency.  Our poultry slaughter plants are small by comparison with the main players in other countries and increasing the number of processing plants would not serve the interests of the Irish poultry industry.  The need to seek economies through rationalisation and reduction in the number of poultry plants was identified in the Agri Food 2010 report.</P>
        <P>Poultry processors have faced major challenges over the last couple of years.  A number of the remaining plants have increased their throughput to make up in part for the void created by plant closures.  I am aware that many suppliers to now-closed plants have entered into contracts with new processing outlets.  Others are converting their production facilities from conventional to <Col N="1694"/>free range systems in line with the good demand for free range poultry meat and my Department is assisting them in this transition.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 132 together.</P>
        <P>I am participating in a Ministerial Taskforce on Bioenergy, chaired by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Noel Dempsey, TD to develop a strategy on Ireland&rsquo;s bioenergy resources to 2020.  The Government has already announced a number of initiatives both on the supply and demand side to develop the biofuels sector and a National Bioenergy Action Plan will be published shortly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Developing an indigenous biofuel industry from native raw materials depends on a number of factors including the availability and suitability of land for the various crops, taking account of rotation restrictions and current area in tillage. Other factors such as geographical location and small farm size will probably limit the potential area that could be devoted to growing energy crops.  The main possibilities for growing energy crops in Ireland are rape-seed, wheat (annual crops), and willow, miscanthus, reed canary grass (perennial crops).</P>
        <P>The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which was agreed in 2003 gives farmers the freedom to exploit new farming opportunities, including agricultural production for non-food uses.  At present, production of energy crops in Ireland is relatively undeveloped, with some 4,000 hectares of oilseed rape grown in 2006.  Some trial plots for growing miscanthus and willow for biomass are also in place.  Profitability for growers and others in the sector is marginal as energy crops compare unfavourably with conventional crop tillage.  Farmers will only produce energy crops if returns are greater than those offered by more traditional uses.  However, as yields increase through better varieties and tech<Col N="1695"/>niques the profitability of growing energy crops should improve.</P>
        <P>As announced in the Budget, I will be introducing an national payment of &euro;80 per hectare in 2007 as an incentive for farmers to grow energy crops.  The &euro;80 payment will be paid as a top-up to the existing EU premium of &euro;45 per hectare available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme and increases the overall payment to &euro;125 per hectare.  It is intended the &euro;80 additional payment will apply for three years and will be subject to a maximum ceiling per producer over the three years.  The current maximum area per producer is 37.5 hectares.</P>
        <P>It is also intended to introduce a new Bioenergy Scheme for a limited period to encourage farmers to plant willow and miscanthus for use a renewable source of energy. The Scheme will provide establishment grants to farmers for up to 50% of the costs associated with establishing miscanthus and willow on set-aside land and on areas, which have been subject to an application for the EU premium of &euro;45 per hectare.  &euro;8 million is being allocated to this Scheme over the period 2007-2009. The scheme details are being finalised and will be announced shortly.</P>
        <P>Set-aside land can also be used for a variety of non-food uses including the growing of crops for energy purpose and will therefore qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme.</P>
        <P>On the demand side, the excise relief programme announced by Minister Noel Dempsey, TD, will help drive additional demand for production of energy crops for the manufacture of liquid biofuels.  When fully operational in 2008, the scheme will deliver some 163 million litres of biofuels per year.</P>
        <P>I have also expanded the scope of the Research Stimulus Fund to provide for consideration of projects dealing with biofuels.  Five of the projects selected under the 2005 and 2006 calls for proposals directly relate to biofuels and energy crops and were awarded total grant assistance of some &euro;1.5m.  Projects supported under this Programme will complement the research work being done by Teagasc and others in this area.</P>
        <P>Teagasc provides a range of advisory services to farmers to maximise profits at farm level and to exploit new opportunities in the marketplace, including agricultural production for non-food uses.  Teagasc research programmes are aimed at developing more efficient production systems and improving crop yields.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am aware of the concerns expressed by the farming organisations in regard to this issue and am conscious of the need to ensure that usage of metered water on farms for agricultural purposes is kept to a minimum.  Thus, for example, the technical specifications for farm buildings operated by my Department for the purposes of the Farm Waste Management Scheme require the installation of adequate arrangements for the separation of clean and dirty water as part of the conditions of any new investment.   In addition, I extended the terms of that Scheme in March 2006 to include the provision of grant-aid for the installation of guttering on existing buildings as a further new eligible item.</P>
        <P>As far as the new 2007-2013 Rural Development Programme is concerned, I have provided that grant-aid will be available under the new Farm Investment Scheme for, the installation of water retention equipment on farms.   This Scheme will be introduced as soon as EU approval is received for the Programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The main deficits in the supply of Irish-produced organic food are in fruit and vegetables and in cereals.  Whether to convert to organic production, or to step up existing production, is ultimately a business decision for food producers themselves.  However I am strongly committed to the development of the organic sector in Ireland and my Department supports it in several ways which, I am satisfied, offer strong encouragement to producers.</P>
        <P>My Department provides substantial financial supports through the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and the Scheme of Grant Aid for the development of the organic sector. Since REPS began in 1994, it has delivered some &euro;37 million to the sector.  The draft Rural Development Programme for the period 2007&ndash;2013 includes measures designed particularly to encourage development in the organic tillage and horticulture areas. It is proposed, for example, to allow organic farmers to obtain organic support payments without having to be in <Col N="1697"/>REPS, and the payments themselves will be increased.</P>
        <P>Lack of technical expertise has been recognised as a barrier to progress in both the organic tillage and horticultural areas. To address this information deficit, my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, arranged last year to bring in two specialist agronomists from the UK on a pilot basis. Through farm visits and workshops, they shared their experiences with producers and this has been of immense value.</P>
        <P>Another successful initiative has been the demonstration farm programme. It continued during 2006 and a total of 14 farms were used throughout the country to promote organic farming systems. My Department will continue to expand and improve this programme, which is a major instrument in encouraging conventional growers to switch to organic.</P>
        <P>Substantial progress has also been made on the implementation of the recommendations in the Organic Development Committee report, published in 2002. The three additional structures recommended are now into their second three-year terms. The National Steering Group advises me on all policy issues relating to the sector. The Steering Group is supported by two sub-Groups, the Partnership Expert Working Group and the Organic Market Development Group. The Partnership Expert Working Group is responsible for training, education, advice and research.  The Organic Market Development Group has overall responsibility for developing a national marketing strategy for organic food.  Bord Bia, in consultation with the Market Development Group, has recently produced a three-year Organic Marketing Plan and I have approved substantial funding of &euro;1.5m for it.</P>
        <P>The decoupling of farm payments has established a policy framework in which farmers have the freedom to farm in response to market demands.  In this more market-oriented scenario, there is real scope for local organic production to expand with the help of the incentives that I have outlined already.</P>

        <Quest> the provision she will make for an appropriate advance notification scheme for part-time farmers who might be subject to on-farm inspections at times when they are engaged in off farm work; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy of my Department towards on-farm inspection has been to give advance notification of up to 48 hours in all cases.  This policy of systematic pre-announcement of inspections was questioned by the European Commission in July 2006 and its unacceptability was conveyed to my Department in a formal communication in August.  As a result, my Department was obliged to agree to a proportion of Single Payment Scheme inspections being carried out in 2006 without prior notification.  Some 650 farms out of 130,000 involved in the Single Payment Scheme were subsequently selected for unannounced inspection.  The balance of inspection cases, representing some 92% of the 7,514 farms selected for Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme inspection in 2006, were all pre-notified to the farmer.</P>
        <P>The EU regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme would allow my Department to give pre-notification of inspection in all cases where certain elements of cross-compliance are involved e.g. the Nitrates Regulations.  However, my Department is committed, in the Charter of Rights for Farmers 2005-2007 to carrying out all Single Payment Scheme and Disadvantaged Area Scheme checks during a single farm visit in most cases.  This then obliges my Department to respect the advance notice requirements applicable to the most stringent element of the inspec<Col N="1700"/>tion regime viz. maximum of 48 hours notice but with no advance notice in a proportion of cases.</P>
        <P>My Department is also committed in the Charter of Rights to pursuing with the European Commission a strategy to deliver advance notification of 14 days for inspections.  The matter has been raised with the Commission on a number of occasions since 2004, particularly in the context of the Irish situation where we are operating a fully decoupled and essentially area-dependent Single Payment Scheme.  I have personally made the case again recently to Commissioner Fischer Boel and this issue will be a key point for Ireland in the CAP simplification initiative of the Commission which is now underway.</P>
        <P>My Department believes that pre-notification of Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme inspections fits in with the practicalities of Irish agriculture where increasingly, farmers are also engaged in off-farm employment.  In a decoupled Single Payment Scheme system, the provision of advance notification of inspection to the farmer should not negatively impact on the effectiveness of the control.  However, as the EU regulations stand, my Department is obliged to carry out a small proportion of inspections without prior notification and this is what was done in 2006.  My Department is seeking authority to allow advance notification in all inspection cases for 2007 and I will continue to press this point in the CAP simplification process.</P>

	<P>The current Milk Quota system was extended to 2014/15 as part of the Mid Term Reform of the CAP in 2003.  The so called &lsquo;health check&rsquo; to be carried out by the Commission in 2008 will consider the future of quotas as part of its overall examination of the CAP instruments. It is clear that detailed consideration is being given at Commission level on the future of the quota regime in the overall context of market supports. Indeed the Commissioner herself has made known her own views on the future of the quota regime in recent speeches and interviews.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is too early in my view to take any definitive position on the future of quotas but clearly I had in mind the more competitive trading conditions that are looming in deciding to introduce a market led Trading Scheme for transferring milk quotas for the next quota year. I have also commissioned Teagasc which, together with FAPRI, has commenced an examination of the quota regime and its future relevance to the Irish dairy sector. This work will consider scenarios that would provide a soft landing should the Com<Col N="1701"/>mission bring forward proposals in favour of the future abolition of the quota regime.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the first case of equine infections anaemia, or &lsquo;swamp fever&rsquo;, was confirmed in June 2006, a total of twenty-eight cases have been confirmed, the most recent on 10 December 2006. The increasing intervals between cases, over eight weeks since the last case, and the amount of blood testing being done &mdash; over 14,000 samples tested in January &mdash; give increasing confidence that the outbreak has been contained and that significant progress has been made towards its eradication.</P>
        <P>The considerable progress that has been made is largely attributable to prompt and comprehensive actions of my Department, including the imposition of movement restrictions and the introduction of an extensive surveillance programme, with over 42,000 blood samples having been tested by the Irish Equine Centre and my Department&rsquo;s Central Veterinary Research Laboratory since June 2006.  My Department could not, however, have achieved the progress made to date without the support and cooperation of the Irish bloodstock industry &mdash; both the thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred sectors.</P>
        <P>It is my view that the most practical way in which my Department can assist horseowners affected by EIA is to take such measures as are appropriate to ensure its containment and speedy eradication.  I am entirely satisfied that my Department did take such measures promptly and effectively and that the progress made to date reflects that approach.</P>
        <P>In all, fifty-three premises were, at one stage or another, placed under movement restriction while the number of horses placed under restriction was in excess of 1200.  All but seven of the premises have been lifted while almost ninety per cent of the horses have now been derestricted.</P>
        <P>My Department did meet recently with representatives of a number of horse owners whose premises were subject to movement restriction to discuss the issue of financial assistance in respect of losses claimed to have been incurred as a consequence of their having been restricted. My officials made clear at that meeting that the Department does not intend to make any such payments and that remains my position.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the financial burden, associated with the cost of testing restricted horses, I introduced a package of financial measures in August 2006 to support those owners whose horses had been restricted and subject to a sur<Col N="1702"/>veillance programme of at least ninety days. This included a financial contribution for each visit by a veterinarian to take blood samples as well as the cost of testing those samples.  To date, the cost of this package to the Department has been in excess of &euro;100,000.  In addition, veterinary inspectors from my own Department have taken several thousand blood samples as part of a specifically targeted surveillance programme in Counties Meath, Dublin and Kildare, a significant proportion of which were subsequently tested at my Department&rsquo;s Central Veterinary Research Laboratory.  The entire cost of this phase of the extensive surveillance programme is being met by my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am strongly committed to the development of the organic sector in Ireland. While the sector in Ireland is still small by European standards, it is growing.  The total area in conversion or with full organic status rose by 15% in 2005 and by a further 14% in 2006.</P>
        <P>My Department already provides substantial financial supports for organic producers, through the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and the Scheme of Grant Aid for the development of the organic sector.  Since REPS began in 1994, it has delivered some &euro;37 million to the sector.  The draft Rural Development Programme for the period 2007&ndash;2013 provides for continued support and increased payments.  In an effort to encourage development in the organic tillage and horticulture areas, I am proposing that organic farmers will be able to obtain organic support payments without having to be in REPS, as they have had to do up to now.  I hope that this initiative will result in a further increase in the land area under organic production throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The National Steering Group for the Organic Sector advises me on all policy issues.  Two sub-Groups, the Partnership Expert Working Group and the Organic Market Development Group, support the Steering Group.  The Partnership Expert Working Group is responsible for training, education, advice and research.  The Organic Market Development Group has overall responsibility for developing a national marketing strategy for organic food.  In this regard Bord Bia, in consultation with the Market Development Group, has recently produced a three-year Organic Marketing Plan.  The objective of the Plan is to develop the organic sector in Ireland for existing suppliers and new entrants.  My Department has approved funding for the Plan, <Col N="1703"/>amounting to a significant sum of &euro;1.5m over the 3-year period.</P>
        <P>Another successful initiative has been the demonstration farm programme. It continued during 2006 and a total of 14 farms were used throughout the country to promote organic farming systems. My Department will continue to expand and improve this programme, which is a major instrument in encouraging conventional growers to switch to organic.</P>
        <P>To improve technical expertise among existing organic farmers, my Department and Teagasc arranged for two specialist agronomists from the UK to run a series of farm visits and workshops in 2006, at which they shared their experiences with producers.</P>
        <P>The decoupling of direct payments from production has established a policy framework in which farmers have the freedom to farm in response to market demands.  In this more market-oriented scenario, there is real scope for organic production to expand with the help of the incentives that I have outlined already.</P>

	<P>Wood biomass is one of the most versatile of renewable energy sources and has the potential to play a major role in Ireland&rsquo;s future energy strategy.  Wood energy, in the form of logs, chip and pellet, is renewable, carbon neutral, sustainable and can be produced locally. Solid biomass, mainly in the form of solid wood, is already the largest source of renewable energy in Ireland, accounting for 57% of Ireland&rsquo;s total renewable energy consumption in 2004.  </P>
        <P>My Department, working in co-operation with COFORD (the National Council for Forest Research and Development) and Teagasc, actively encourages the development of the wood-energy sector through a range of support measures aimed at creating an effective and efficient supply chain from producer to end user.  These measures complement more recent support schemes introduced by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources targeting the user side of the chain through the Pilot Bio-heat Boiler Deployment Programme and the Greener Homes Scheme. My Department offers 100% grants and attractive premiums for up to 20 years to encourage the establishment of new forests on agricultural land.  In addition my Department supports a number of individual projects and initiatives which focus specifically on wood-energy.</P>
        <P>During 2006 COFORD, which is wholly-funded by my Department, has been running a <Col N="1704"/>series of thinning and chipping demonstrations across the country under the banner Forest-Energy 2006.  The programme is being organised in cooperation with Teagasc, Waterford Institute of Technology, Bord na M&oacute;na and the major private forestry companies. In addition, COFORD has put in place a series of workshops on Wood Biomass Harvesting and Supply Chain issues.</P>
        <P>In terms of new schemes, I hope to announce details shortly of a Wood Biomass Harvesting Machinery Scheme which was included in my Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2007.  The purpose of the proposed scheme is to encourage investment in wood biomass processing machinery, such as whole tree chippers and forest residue bundlers.</P>
        <P>My Department is also introducing a new Bioenergy Scheme to grant aid the planting of willow and miscanthus as a renewable source of energy. &euro;8 million is being allocated to this Scheme over the period 2007-2009. The scheme details are currently being finalised and will also be announced shortly.</P>

	<P>The Irish food and drink industry has made significant strides over the past decade consolidating itself as the key indigenous industry.  The value of exports during 2006 are estimated to have grown by 10% and exceeded &euro;8 billion for the first time.</P>
        <P>The landscape in which the industry operates is changing rapidly.  All elements of the landscape including policy, the regulatory environment, retail and food service buying-power/configuration, consumption trends, supply structures, and production/processing technology are changing &mdash; with the pace of change increasing.</P>
        <P>The continued success of the industry in this increasingly complex and dynamic environment will be determined by the ability of its stakeholders, both producers and processors, to anticipate and to respond to market opportunities in an efficient and effective manner. The need for the sector to adapt to the more market oriented policy environment in which it now operates was recognised in the Agri-Vision 2015 Action Plan published early last year and now being implemented.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan 2007-2013 provides significant funding for the continued development of the food industry. Besides the specific food related initiatives, the industry will <Col N="1705"/>benefit from the huge investment in transport and other infrastructure, which are key to sustained competitiveness, and to growing the exports. The industry will also have full access to the generic industry supports in the Plan for research, technology, knowledge building, skills and people and will benefit from the increase in funding for food research in the NDP.  Department expenditure on food research carried out by Teagasc, the universities and ITs under the Food Institutional Research Measure (FIRM) is set to double to &euro;14 million a year from the &euro;7 million average over 2000-2006.In addition, some &euro;289 million is provided specifically for the food industry for capital investment and marketing.</P>
        <P>A capital investment envelope of up to &euro;200 million will underpin huge investment in key areas of the food industry.  This includes a core &euro;100 million fund to support investment of &euro;300 million in the dairy sector for which evaluation of proposals is underway; an investment fund of up to &euro;50 million, which will shortly be launched for the beef sector, and funding of projects in other Annex I sectors which have been approved and are due to start.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;90 million will be provided for marketing. This includes funding for An Bord Bia for generic promotion, market supports in line with EU rules, promotion of quality and quality assurance. Through its Overseas Office network and its primary focus on market investigation and promotions, Bord Bia is playing a significant role in assisting this development of a market led and sustainably competitive industry.</P>

	<P>My Department is represented on the inter-Departmental team established to oversee implementation of the National Climate Change Strategy and is taking an active part in the current review of the Strategy.  My Department has identified, for consideration by stakeholders, a range of potential greenhouse gas reduction measures in the agriculture area.  These potential measures include the promotion of  low-emission slurry application technology, support for bio-energy crops, alternative carbon-neutral fuel sources, deployment of renewable energy technologies at farm level, improved manure management through the use of new and emerging technologies, optimisation of nitrogen use, minimum tillage systems and the development of forestry. Decoupling of support for agriculture under the Single Payment Scheme will continue to be the most significant contributory factor in <Col N="1706"/>the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural sources.</P>
        <P>My Department is funding various research projects to assist in identifying sustainable greenhouse gas emission reduction measures.  Amongst these are studies focused on reducing methane emissions in ruminants and an examination of nitrous oxide emissions from grasslands.  These are in addition to agricultural-related research managed by the EPA.</P>

	<P>41 cases of BSE were confirmed in 2006.  The following table gives the location of each case by county.</P>
        <P>There has been a dramatic reduction in the incidence of BSE in Ireland.  The number of cases peaked in 2002 at 333, following the introduction of mass surveillance at slaughter plants and knackeries in 2001.  Almost 700,000 animals are tested per annum in Ireland under this surveillance regime.  Despite this, the numbers of animals confirmed with the disease fell to 182 in 2003, 126 in 2004, 69 in 2005 and 41 last year.</P>
        <P>The vast majority of these cases were in animals born prior to the introduction of additional controls in 1996 and 1997.  Investigations are carried out into the feeding regimes of all herds in which BSE is identified and in particular in herds in which cases born after the feed controls were re-enforced are confirmed.  To date, 18 animals born after 1997 have been diagnosed with BSE and 12 cases were confirmed in 1997 born animals but some of these were born before all the re-enforced measures were fully in place. No cases have been confirmed in any animals born after 2001. The diagnosis of BSE in a small number of cases in animals born after 1997 which may relate to circumstances specific to the farms in question and which do not conform with the general trend as the incidence of the disease in the national herd recedes which was not unexpected.  There is, however, no basis for suspecting that these cases are indicative of either a systemic failure in controls or of a reversal of or deviation from the overall positive trend in relation to BSE in Ireland.</P><Col N="1707"/>
        <P>The shift in age profile in BSE cases as well as a reduction in case numbers indicates that the additional controls have been effective in significantly reducing the exposure of animals born after 1997 to the infectious agent.  It is expected that the incidence of disease will continue to decline as cows born prior to 1998 leave the system.</P>

	<P>I travelled to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as part of the recent trade delegation there led by An Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>Saudi Arabia imposed a ban on the importation of beef from Ireland and other EU countries in December 2000, due to concern about BSE.  In the years preceding the ban, a substantial trade had developed in the export of Irish beef to Saudi Arabia which was worth some &euro;34m in 2000.  To put this in context, Irish food and drink exports to Saudi Arabia were valued at &euro;140m in 2005.</P>
        <P>The UAE was also a good market for Irish beef until it was banned in January 2001. In 2000, Irish beef, worth an estimated &euro;17, was exported to the UAE. In 2005 Irish food and drink exports there were valued at &euro;25.4m.</P><Col N="1708"/>
        <P>The Saudi Arabian and UAE markets are therefore very valuable markets for Irish food exports and potentially for beef, if the current restrictions were relaxed.  I made a strong case during the visit for the full re-opening of the beef markets in both countries.</P>
        <P>The visit was very successful and I had very positive discussions in Saudi Arabia on the question of Irish food exports in general and beef exports in particular.  As a result of these discussions, the Saudi authorities have now offered to send a team of experts to Ireland to inspect our food safety and animal health controls.  I trust that the proposed visit will be successful and lead to the re-opening of the market there for Irish beef in due course.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The potential for plant derived plastics is something that is recognised both here in Ireland and at EU level.  I am aware that some supermarket chains plan to use packaging materials from sustainable or recycled sources.  This can only be good news for the consumer and the environment.  It also represents good news for farmers as suppliers of raw materials.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s public good competitive programme, the Research Stimulus Fund Programme, has placed significant emphasis on non-food land uses.  In the past two years five projects in this theme area have been funded to the tune of &euro;1.5 million.  To date biological plastics have not featured in the Programme since no suitable research proposals in that area have been submitted for funding.  However, in the recently published 7th EU Framework Programme on Research and Technological Development (FP7) in the theme area &ldquo;Food, Agriculture and Fisheries and Biotechnology&rdquo; the Commission included a specific project examining the conversion of biomass, agricultural by-products and waste into a diverse range of value products including, potentially, plastics from grass.  The National Sup<Col N="1709"/>port Structures for FP7 in my Department are actively encouraging and assisting Irish Researchers wishing to participate in this Call.  Furthermore, the development of expertise in the area will undoubtedly lead to the development of a research critical mass in Ireland and hopefully to the submission of a suitable Research Stimulus Project in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The fresh fruit and vegetable sector is a very important sector that is capable of further substantial growth and development. Last year farm gate production was valued at around &euro;230m with the domestic retail market valued at around &euro;1 billion.  However, producers have for some time faced strong pressure from the highly concentrated retail chains, which play a major role in setting prices, and from imported produce. As a result of these pressures, there has been consolidation of grower numbers which has been compensated somewhat by an increase in scale of enterprise. </P>
        <P>My objective for horticulture is to develop a competitive sector with the maximum number of producers and in the Agri-Vision 2015 Action Plan my Department committed itself to providing grant support that is strategically targeted at horticultural projects in production, processing and marketing to improve the overall development and competitiveness of the sector.</P>
        <P>Under the 2000-2006 NDP Scheme of Investment Aid for the Commercial Horticulture Sector my Department has paid grant aid amounting to some &euro;20m to producers while under the NDP Capital Investment Scheme for the Marketing and Processing of Agricultural Products a total of  &euro;18.7m has been awarded to operators in the fruit, vegetable and potato sectors.  Taken together, these two schemes have leveraged an investment of over &euro;110m in these sectors so far in the new millennium.  Under the new Rural Development Programme 2007-2013, it is anticipated that further substantial funding will be provided.  This Programme remains to be cleared by the EU Commission and must also fulfil EU State aid criteria.</P>
        <P>Another key to arresting the decline in producer numbers is participation and working together in Producer Organisations (POs).  POs provide their members the opportunity to concentrate marketing, reduce production costs and stabilise prices. The proposals for reform of the Common Organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables, which were presented to the Agri<Col N="1710"/>culture Council on 29 January, identify a strengthening of the role for POs as the core part of the strategy for improving the competitiveness of the fruit and vegetable in the future.  The proposals include measures for crisis management organised through POs and enhanced aid for measures both within and outside the PO framework to promote consumption of fruit and vegetables particularly by young people.</P>
        <P>Since 2000, twenty Irish POs have benefited from EU funding amounting to &euro;24m.  With proposals now on the table for greater flexibility in the EU rules governing the formation and operation of POs, I hope to see them playing a much greater role in the future in supporting Irish producers of fruit and vegetables.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no role in establishing contractual relationships between multiple retail buyers and growers of fresh produce and a move on my part to do so could contravene EU competition law.</P>
        <P>However, I am acutely aware of the difficulties faced by many producers in trying to meet the higher and higher quality standards and conditions of supply being demanded by retailers but at lower prices.  This is not sustainable in the long term and I would also remind retailers, given the growing consumer demand for quality local produce, of the importance of helping to maintain a reliable local production base.</P>
        <P>One of the most important instruments for counteracting the influence of the multiples is the EU Producer Organisation scheme. These organisations enable growers to join together and concentrate their supplies within a planned production/marketing strategy, thus enabling them to face up to pressures from the retail sector.</P>
        <P>Proposals for reform of the EU common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables, as presented to the Agriculture Council on 29 January, were formulated by the Commission with the express aim of enhancing the role of producer organisations and helping them to assume a stronger role in the determination of market prices.  My principal objective in the negotiations on those proposals is to ensure that the most flexible arrangements possible are put in place for producer organisations, so that more Irish producers are attracted to use this valuable instrument.</P><Col N="1711"/>
        <P>The radical changes that the horticulture sector in Ireland, as in other EU countries and beyond, is undergoing in terms of competition and rapidly changing consumer lifestyles, smaller households, new demands for convenience and &lsquo;ready-to-go&rsquo; foods represent opportunities as well as challenges for the sector.  Under the 2000-2006 National Development Plan my Department provided on-farm and near farm investment aid of &euro;20m and &euro;10.56m respectively to the sector to improve marketing and processing.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia which comes under the aegis of my Department has been active in providing producers with market research, support for quality assurance and promotion opportunities to complement the expertise provided by Teagasc&rsquo;s training and advisory services.</P>
        <P>Preparation and packaging facilities have been modernised and supports for the organic sector, which is an important component of the horticulture market, have been increased. The mushroom sector has adapted to meet increasing competition on export markets.  On the domestic market producers and growers have expanded the range of high premium crops such as strawberries and peppers, which are now being produced in Ireland on a commercial scale.</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Minister for Labour Affairs and I launched at the World Ploughing Championships in Carlow last September a &ldquo;Code of Practice for the Prevention of Accidents and Occupational Ill Health in Agriculture&rdquo;.  The aim of the Code of Practice is to provide practical guidance to farmers and to help improve the level of safety and health in the agriculture sector.  The Code is the result of a joint initiative between the Health and Safety Authority and the farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee of the Authority, on which Department of Agriculture and Food is represented</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />My Department in conjunction with the Department for Labour Affairs circulated <Col N="1712"/>some 160,000 copies of the Code of Practice to all farmers in late November/early December 2006.  On the 10th January 2007, I attended and fully supported the launch of the Health and Safety&rsquo;s public awareness campaign surrounding the Code of Practice.</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Teagasc, the statutory body responsible for training in the agriculture sector, aims to provide training for 9000 farmers on the Code of Practice.</P>

        <Quest> if she will introduce a single farm payment reserve fund to allocate a top up payment to persons who fared poorly under the national reserve allocation due to the DED averaging system; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the Single Payment Scheme is applicable to farmers who farmed during the three-year reference period 2000-<?oasys _jy ?>2002, who drew down livestock or Arable Aid premia in at least one of those years and who continued to farm in 2005.  The Single Payment Scheme entitlements established for individual farmers, therefore, are a true reflection of their farming activity and premia draw-down during the reference period.   Special provisions were made for farmers (including young farmers) who entered farming for the first time in either 2001 or 2002.  Their Single Payment was determined based on the average of the years 2001 and 2002 or on the basis of premia paid in 2002 as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The EU regulations also provided for the setting up of a National Reserve.  The Reserve was <Col N="1713"/>created by reducing each farmer&rsquo;s individual Single Payment by an amount of up to 1.82%.  The purpose of the National Reserve is to try and minimise the impact on farmers who, for a variety of reasons, may find themselves disadvantaged in the transition to the new decoupled support regime as a result of changes in their businesses during or since the reference period.  Categories of farmers catered for by the National Reserve have included those who inherited land that was leased out during the reference period, those who made investments in production capacity or purchased or leased land on a long-term basis or who converted from dairying to a sector for which a direct payment would have been payable during the reference period, new entrants to farming and certain hill sheep farmers.</P>
        <P>There were mandatory and non-mandatory categories in the 2005 National Reserve.  The non-mandatory categories in Ireland&rsquo;s case were those dealing with new entrants and certain hill sheep farmers who were prevented from increasing production during the reference period pending the publication of commonage framework plans.  Separate application arrangements were in place for this latter group.</P>
        <P>In allocating entitlements to successful applicants in the mandatory categories, the Member State must apply objective criteria and ensure equal treatment between farmers.  In allocating entitlements to successful applicants in the non- mandatory categories, the Member State must ensure that the allocation does not have the effect of increasing the value of any existing entitlements above the regional average value of entitlements.   Similarly, the value of any new entitlements allocated to non-mandatory categories must not exceed the regional average.  The Member State was allowed to determine what constituted the regional average.</P>
        <P>I established a Single Payment Advisory Committee comprising representatives of the farming organisations, Teagasc and officials from my Department to assist me in considering the objective criteria that should be used in making allocations from the reserve to the mandatory categories and also the most appropriate way to determine the regional average value of entitlements in the case of the non-mandatory categories.  Having considered the Committee&rsquo;s views, I decided that the regional average value of entitlements would be the average value of entitlements in the District Electoral Division (DED) associated with the applicant&rsquo;s herd number.  This was considered to be a reasonable interpretation reflecting, as it did, the average value of payment entitlements and therefore the average farming activity in the DED concerned during the reference period.</P>
        <P>The total amount of money available for distribution under Ireland&rsquo;s 2005 National Reserve was some &euro;22.7m of which some &euro;18m has already been allocated.  Any remaining balance <Col N="1714"/>will be carried forward to the 2006 and subsequent years&rsquo; Reserve.  In this connection the Member State is only obliged to have one mandatory category from 2006 onwards &mdash; for farmers who inherited land that was leased out during the reference period.  However, I have already announced that new entrants to farming would again be catered for under the 2006 National Reserve.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the National Reserve is a scarce resource created by reducing the entitlements of existing farmers and will only be replenished by a claw-back on sales of entitlements and the relinquishing of any entitlements that remain unused.  My Department must therefore be prudent in determining how the funds in the reserve are administered.  I have no plans therefore to create a new reserve as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The proposed new EU Regulation on organic production states unequivocally that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and products produced from or by GMOs may not be used as food, feed, processing aids, plant protection products, fertilisers, soil conditioners, seeds, vegetative propagating material, micro-organisms and animals in organic production.</P>
        <P>However the Regulation recognises that there is some risk that GMOs may be introduced unintentionally to organic crops.  The proposed co-existence measures will focus on creating conditions during the cultivation, harvest, transport and storage of crops that minimise the possibility of contamination and on ensuring that conventional and organic growers can keep the adventitious presence of GMOs in their crops below the labelling thresholds established in Community law.  Measures are also proposed to provide redress to an organic farmer who suffers verifiable economic loss as a result of admixture of GM crops with non-GM crops.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 169 together.</P>
        <P>Despite the challenges brought about by the further implementation of the Mid Term Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, 2006 turned out to be a successful year for the dairy sector.  Exports increased in value to &euro;2.08 billion, a rise of 4% compared with 2005.  This rise in value was due to strong returns particularly for protein on the internal market.  Prices on international markets were operating 5% lower than in 2005.  However, since November 2006, international market prices have surged, particularly for protein, with world prices 30% higher than this time last year.</P>
        <P>At EU level, I have consistently challenged the pace and level of reduction in support level implemented by the Commission.  In my view it is crucially and strategically important that the EU consolidates its international market share while challenging competition on its domestic market.  I have urged the Commission to maintain a competitive combination of aids and subsidies to achieve these objectives.</P>
        <P>The key to meeting the challenges ahead is being adaptable to changes in the environment in which our dairy sector operates.  The outcome of the current WTO Doha Round of negotiations will have a significant impact on our export orientated dairy sector.  I will continue to fight for the best possible outcome in the WTO Negotiations; in the meantime, we must continue to develop the quality and competitiveness of our dairy product offering.</P>
        <P>Last September, I established a &euro;300 million investment package for the dairy sector.  The investment fund includes &euro;100 million of Government grant assistance.  The purpose of this investment fund is to stimulate the development of the Irish processing sector and generate greater efficiencies.  I am confident that the Irish Dairy Sector will avail of the opportunities presented by this investment package and thereby ensure the continued success and development of this important sector.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the Nitrates Directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  A number of measures to help farmers meet their obligations under the Regulations are already in place.  In accordance with the Sustaining Progress agreement, improvements to the Farm Waste Management Scheme and the Dairy Hygiene Scheme and substantially increased REPS  payments were delivered in 2004.  In March 2006 I announced further significant improvements in the Farm Waste Management Scheme, designed specifically to assist farmers meet the requirements of the Nitrates Directive.  Following on the Towards 2016 agreement, and subject to the approval of the European Commission, I am making proposals in the new Rural Development Programme, specifically in the context of REPS, that will help farmers further.</P>
        <P>With the support of Teagasc and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I secured the agreement of the EU Nitrates Committee to a derogation which will be available to grassland farms on an individual basis and will allow farmers to operate at a level of up to 250 kg organic nitrogen per hectare.  This is a very significant development for intensive farmers, particularly those in the dairying sector.  Under the new Rural Development Programme I am also proposing that farmers availing of this derogation should have access, for the first time, to REPS.</P>
        <P>My Department is also committed to giving farmers practical help where possible and to keep the burden of paper-work to a minimum.  To assist farmers in complying with their obligations on record keeping, where possible my Department will utilize the information at its disposal to provide organic nitrogen and phosphorus statements to farmers in respect of each calendar year.  Statements in respect of 2005 were issued for farmers&rsquo; information in October last and statements for 2006 are being prepared and will issue as early as possible.  As regards record keeping generally, records that are already being kept for other purposes and meet the requirements of the Regulations are acceptable; and most of the information needed is already on the Single Payment Scheme Application form, stock registers and CMMS profiles.  There are some additional records that must be kept, and examples of how to keep these are contained in the Explanatory Handbook that was issued to all farmers in November, 2006.</P>
        <P>In addition, my officials and Teagasc staff held a series of 36 information meetings throughout the country last November and December.  At these meetings, farmers were given information to help them understand the practical aspects of the Regulations and had an opportunity to ask <Col N="1717"/>questions about any particular concerns they might have.</P>

	<P>There is a long history of co-operation between the administrations north and <Col N="1718"/>south on animal health issues.  The administrations have traditionally shared information at local and national levels on disease control and surveillance issues and have worked together to combat illegal movements of animals and animal products.  During the Foot and Mouth emergency of 2001 the co-operation and consultation at official, Ministerial and political levels was vital.  </P>
        <P>The establishment of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) offered an opportunity to build on existing co-operation arrangements and provided a framework for the development of an all-island animal health policy.  The main objectives of the Council are to foster co-operation and to devise a common, unified animal health strategy for the island as a whole.  This involves the convergence of animal health policies and the development of joint strategies for dealing with animal diseases.  The ultimate objectives of an all-island animal health policy are to establish a common import regime and equivalent internal arrangements with a view to achieving free movement of animals and animal products within the island.</P>
        <P>The programme of work, mandated by the NSMC, is being progressed by nine working groups at official level.  The remit of these groups includes TB and Brucellosis, TSEs (BSE and Scrapie), veterinary medicines, other Zoonoses and animal diseases, disease surveillance, animal welfare, import and export of live animals and animal products, animal identification, traceability and cross-border aspects of fraud.</P>
        <P>These working groups meet regularly and their work has focused on three main themes:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Common or equivalent controls at points of entry to the island;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Convergence of internal animal health policies; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Development of joint strategies for the control of animal disease.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The main achievements to date are the development of a co-ordinated and complementary approach towards import policies and portal controls at points of entry to the island, the convergence of policies in regard to animal identification and Scrapie and the strengthening of co-ordination and co-operation between both administrations on a variety of issues such as T.B, Brucellosis, FMD, BSE, Avian Influenza, cross-border fraud, etc.  These groups continue to report progress in exchange of information and in implementation of initiatives aimed at policy convergence and the development of a common unified strategy for the island as a whole.</P>
        <P>The Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council includes representation from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, (DARD). A representative from DARD also attends the Avian Influenza Advisory Group.</P><Col N="1719"/>
        <P>Since the decision at EU level to lift the BSE ban on exports from the United Kingdom from 3 May 2006, arrangements are in place and working well between the two administrations facilitating the trade of cattle from Northern Ireland for slaughter, breeding and production.</P>
        <P>The achievement of an all-island animal health strategy involves complex dialogue and negotiation over a range of areas between the Irish, Northern Irish and British authorities and will require the agreement of the European Union ultimately.</P>

	<P>The Food Agency Co-operation Council (FACC) met on 20 occasions between 2000 and 2003 to promote co-operation between the State Agencies involved in the food industry.  Since 2004 the food development agencies directly concerned with the National Development Plan 2000-2006 have met periodically to assess progress under the Plan.  Two meetings were held in 2004 and one each in 2005 and 2006 while my Department was examining future arrangements in the light of changes in the CAP and the 2015 Agri-Vision Report. </P>
        <P>Arising from this, the Agri-Vision 2015 Plan of Action, which I launched last year, included the establishment of a high level group of CEOs of food agencies, chaired at Ministerial level.  This group subsumes and replaces the FACC. In tandem with this group a Food Industry Committee was also established.  The Agri-Vision 2015 Agency CEO Group and the 2015 Food Industry Committee met place in July and November 2006 respectively.  Both groups are scheduled to meet again this month. In addition under the Regional Food Fora initiative all the state agencies supporting the food industry have been brought together by my Department at three regional venues in the last year to promote regional and local food enterprises.</P>

	<P>My Department has certain statutory responsibility for the welfare and protection of <Col N="1720"/>farmed animals under the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984, and the European Communities (Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes) Regulations 2006 (SI 705 of 2006).  In addition there is specific legislation in relation to pigs, calves and laying hens.  </P>
        <P>Welfare matters are dealt with generally by officers based in my Department&rsquo;s District Veterinary Offices, who also have responsibilities in a wide number of other areas related to animal health, disease control etc.  Funding is available to deal with emergency care, feeding, transport etc. of welfare compromised farm animals.  I am satisfied that the resources available within my Department are sufficient to deal with these matters.</P>
        <P>In 2004 the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council developed an Early Warning/ Intervention System for dealing with animal welfare cases.  This involves my Department, Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals.  The objective of the system is to provide a framework within which farm animal welfare problems can be identified before they become critical or overwhelming.  The new system allows for concerned individuals to approach their local IFA representatives, their local SPCA or my Department in the knowledge that the matter will thereafter be dealt with in the most effective, timely and sensitive manner.</P>
        <P>In addition to the foregoing, my Department makes ex-gratia payments annually to organisations directly involved in the provision of animal care and welfare services, to assist in their on-going work.  To date, a total of &euro;7.2m has been paid to such bodies, some &euro;1.24m of which was paid to organisations in December last to assist them during 2007.  A provision of &euro;1.3m for this purpose is included in my Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2007.  ISPCA has benefited from these payments.  The headquarters of the Association has received a total of &euro;414,880 to date.  That figure does not include significant payments to affiliated branches of the organisation at national and local level.</P>
        <P>The main statutes governing cruelty to animals in this country are the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965.  Responsibility for pursuing cases under that legislation rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who may on receipt of a complaint, investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an act of cruelty against an animal.  Officers of my Department are regularly involved in assisting the Gardai in such cases.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 and 184 together.</P>
        <P>Research and Development are central to the future well being of the agri-food sector and I am committed to ensuring that the sector remains part of the Knowledge Economy.  In line with the national &ldquo;Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation 2006-2013&rdquo; and my Department&rsquo;s <Col N="1722"/>Agri-Vision 2015 Plan of Action, the National Development Plan 2007-2013 commits &euro;641m to Agri-Food Research.  This funding will provide scientific support to the sector and will assist the generation of new knowledge and technologies that are critical to the growth of a competitive, market-orientated and sustainable industry.</P>
        <P>The Agri Vision 2015 Action Plan identified the need for research in sustainable agricultural production, research in food quality, safety and nutrition, especially food for health and well-being, research on product innovation as well as research on forestry and on the rural economy.  The priority is to ensure that the whole industry will operate to the highest standards, built on a strong foundation of modern scientific knowledge, skills and innovative practices so that it remains competitive in the global marketplace.</P>
        <P>Under the new NDP my Department will continue to operate its competitive research programmes in sustainable agriculture, food and forestry, including development of non-food crops such as bio-fuels.  These programmes provide funding on a competitive basis to researchers in Teagasc, the Universities and the Institutes of Technology for public good research projects, the themes of which are decided in consultation with all stakeholders.  These measures are operated in a coherent way with linked programmes in other Departments.  In addition, the Teagasc R&amp;D programme will continue to be a priority for my Department.</P>
        <P>The programmes are targeted at increasing collaboration and capabilities and also towards building research teams who will be capable of competing for EU 7th Framework Funding.  Indeed, the recently launched 7th EU Framework for Research and Technological Development offers significant opportunities for Agri-Food, Forestry and Fisheries researchers in Ireland.  My Department has the support structures in place to ensure that Irish researchers build on our excellent performance in FP6.</P>

	<P>The current situation is that organic farmers in REPS with holdings of 3 hectares or more qualify for a supplementary organic payment of &euro;181 per hectare on the first 55 hectares, and &euro;30 per hectare over 55 hectares during the in-conversion period.  The equivalent rates when full organic status is attained are &euro;91 and &euro;15 per hectare respectively.  Organic farmers also qualify for basic REPS payments.  Significant increases in the basic REPS payments were introduced in 2004; &euro;200 per hectare for the first 20 hectares, <Col N="1723"/>&euro;175 per hectare between 20 and 40 hectares, &euro;75 per hectare between 40 and 55 hectares and &euro;10 per hectare over 55 hectares.  </P>
        <P>Organic farmers in REPS with holdings of less than 3 hectares are eligible for payments of &euro;242 per hectare during conversion and &euro;121 with full organic status, on top of the basic REPS payment.</P>
        <P>Subject to the approval of the European Commission, I am proposing to increase the payments to organic farmers under Ireland&rsquo;s new Rural Development Programme for the period 2007 to 2013.  I am also proposing that the system of organic payments should be operated separately from REPS, though organic farmers will be able to join REPS as well.</P>

	<P>The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 were made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in July 2006.  </P>
        <P>In order to inform and assist farmers with the Regulations, my own Department produced an Explanatory Handbook for farmers setting out in clear terms their obligations under the Regulations.  This Handbook, together with a copy of the Regulations, was sent to all farmers in October 2006.  In addition, my Department made use of its data holdings to send organic nitrogen and phosphorus statements to farmers in respect of the 2005 calendar year.  Statements in respect of 2006 are being prepared at present, and will issue as early as possible.</P>
        <P>A series of open information meetings took place between 20 November and 4 December 2006, conducted by my Department in conjunction with Teagasc.  The dates and venues of these meetings were widely publicised by way of advertisements in the farming press.</P>
        <P>While my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, has thus made major efforts to inform farmers about their obligations under the Regulations, the responsibility for compliance rests ultimately with the occupier of a holding.  Farmers should therefore ensure that they have read and understood their obligations under the Regulations and they should, if necessary, obtain professional advice from their agricultural advisers.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The overall national strategy for the eradication of TB provides for a comprehensive range of measures, including the mandatory annual testing for all cattle in the national herd, the early removal of reactors, a wildlife programme involving the targeted removal of badgers where they are implicated in a TB outbreak, the use of the gamma interferon test in problem herds, as an adjunct to the tuberculin test, and the depopulation of infected herds where the level or duration of infection indicates that this is necessary to clear the herd and/or protect the neighbourhood. </P>
        <P>In addition, my Department also provides advice to farmers in relation to bio-security against TB infection such as maintaining satisfactory stock-proof boundary fencing, avoiding contact with other herds, exercising care in buying-cattle and ensuring that only recently tested animals are allowed move onto the farm.  The ERAD compensation schemes are designed to encourage good bio-security practices and breaches of the various animal disease, welfare and identification regulations are subject to prosecution.</P>
        <P>The present eradication programme is scientifically based and is kept under constant review, as evidenced by the changes that have occurred in recent times.  Such recent changes include a more focused contiguous herd testing policy and greater use of the ancillary gamma interferon blood test in target herds.  On the technology side, new and enhanced computer systems have been developed including an individual bovine animal unique identification and passport system, a computerised movement monitoring system for bovine animals (CMMS) and an animal health computer system (AHCS).</P>
        <P>In addition, in view of the recognition that the incidence of the disease in wildlife is a major impediment to eradication of the disease, the current eradication scheme contains a significant wildlife strategy aimed at removing badgers in adjacent areas where they are implicated in tuberculosis breakdowns.   The wildlife strategy is implemented under licence from and in co-operation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>These measures have improved the effectiveness of the programme as evidenced by a significant reduction in the incidence of the disease from 4.2 reactors per thousand in 1998 to 2.7 in 2006.  A total of approximately 6.3 million animals were subject to at least one test within twelve months and approximately 8.9 million animal tests were carried out.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to monitor and review the effectiveness and efficiency of the programme on an on-going basis with a view to <Col N="1725"/>the eventual eradication of the disease. In this context, notwithstanding the fact that the existing wildlife strategy has contributed to a reduction in the incidence of bovine TB, it is accepted that the development of a vaccine for badgers is a prerequisite if eradication of tuberculosis from the cattle population is to be achieved.  My Department, in conjunction with the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis (CVERA), plans to commence a large-scale field trial of BCG in badgers in the near future to test the efficacy of a vaccine.  However, any vaccine will not be available in the immediate future and in the meantime, the existing programme, updated as appropriate in light of developments, will remain in place.</P>

These decisions were based on the recommendations of an independent expert following an open consultation exercise with interested parties.  The Government decisions are now the subject of Judicial Review proceedings instituted by Greencore in the High Court and, in the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the serious concerns of these poultry producers from my meeting with them last November.  </P>
        <P>There is no scope under EU Common Market Regulations to give financial support or aid to these producers.  Many commercial broiler producers, however, who were under contract to <Col N="1727"/>Castlemahon have taken the opportunity since the closure of adapting their premises to free-range poultry production units.  My Department is in the process of inspecting many of these units with a view to assisting this transition and registering them as free-range producers.  I understand that there are more producers showing interest in this area as well.</P>
        <P>In addition to this some commercial broiler producers who were under contract to Castlemahon Foods are now supplying four other major poultry slaughter plants, and this figure may rise.</P>
        <P>The Government and the Industrial Development Agencies recognise the need to create employment opportunities in Co. Limerick that will provide sustainable jobs whether in the food area or otherwise and recent announcements indicate success in this regard.</P>
        <P>A recent example of the attraction of Limerick as a location for new business was the decision by Northern Trust Corporation to create 300 high quality jobs in the financial services sector.  Another example is Vistakon which recently announced its intention to expand its Limerick operation and create 120 jobs in high-end manufacturing.</P>

	<P>The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 contain a number of require<Col N="1728"/>ments in relation to record keeping. Much of this information, such as stock numbers and farmed area, is already maintained by farmers on their herd registers or contained in their declarations for the Single Payment Scheme.  </P>
        <P>To assist farmers in complying with their obligations on record keeping, my Department will, where possible, make use of its data holdings to send organic nitrogen and phosphorus statements to farmers in respect of each calendar year.  Statements in respect of 2006 are being prepared at present, and will issue as early as possible.</P>
        <P>My Department has already produced an Explanatory Handbook for farmers setting out in clear terms their obligations under the Regulations.  The handbook contains explanations of and suggested formats for the records required, and helpsheets that farmers can use as examples.  This handbook, together with a copy of the Regulations, was sent to all farmers in October 2006.</P>
        <P>While my Department is committed to minimising the practical burden of compliance with the Regulations, responsibility for compliance rests ultimately with the occupier of a holding.  Farmers should therefore ensure that they have read and understood their obligations under the Regulations and they should, if necessary, obtain professional advice from their agricultural advisers.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 and 193 together.  </P>
        <P>I am fully committed to reducing unnecessary bureaucracy in the administration of the CAP and one of my priorities is to pursue simplification of procedures at farm level.  The adoption by Ireland of full decoupling under the Single Payment Scheme, thereby replacing six EU subsidy schemes each with complex application, qualification and implementation procedures, demonstrates in a very tangible manner the extent of my commitment. I have also, on a continuous basis, applied the benefits of IT, wherever possible, in the interests of quality customer service.</P><Col N="1729"/>
        <P>I fully support the EU Commission&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to reduce the regulatory burden of administration on producers, food processors and national administrations.  I am contributing actively to this process.  I have raised this issue on a number of occasions with the Commissioner and, indeed, with the German Presidency which is giving the highest priority to the process of simplification and the reduction of the bureaucratic burden of the CAP.  On 10 January, I wrote to Commissioner Fischer Boel and the Presidency outlining my concerns in relation to a number of specific issues.  My main concerns relate to the advance notification of inspections under the Single Payment Scheme and the level of sanctions to be applied under cross-compliance, including the extent of tolerance applied where non-compliance is inadvertent or negligible.  I also raised these issues in the Council of Ministers on 29 January and urged the Commissioner to present proposals to improve the current situation as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>I believe that other aspects of the Single Farm Payment System should also be simplified. Specifically, I am seeking additional flexibility in the management of the National Reserve and in the leasing arrangements for payment entitlements.  I have also sought rationalisation in the payment dates, additional flexibility in application of the &lsquo;ten-month rule&rsquo; and simplification of the current &lsquo;modulated funds&rsquo; deduction procedure.</P>
        <P>I intend to pursue these issues actively with the Commission over the coming months.</P>

	<P>My Department, in the context of delivering the Single Payment Scheme, is required to carry out on-the-spot inspections on a number of farms covering such issues as eligibility under the Scheme, compliance with EU legislation in the areas of the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health and ensuring that the farm is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition.  </P>
        <P>A minimum of 5% of Single Payment Scheme applicants are required to be inspected under the eligibility rule.  Up to two-thirds of these inspections are carried out without a farm visit and using the technique of remote sensing.</P>
        <P>The rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance is 1% of those farmers to whom the Statutory Management Requirements (including the Nitrates Directive) or good agricultural and environmental condition  (GAEC) apply.  However at least 5% of producers must be inspected under the Bovine Animal Identification and Registration requirements as this level is prescribed under the relevant Regulations.</P>
        <P>In 2006, 7, 514 farmers have had their holdings selected for on-the-spot inspection out of some 130,000 who have applied for the Single Payment Scheme (over 100,000 of these are also applicants for the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme).  The value of both schemes to Irish farmers is some &euro;1.55 billion in 2006.</P>
        <P>The policy towards on-farm inspection has been to give advance notification of up to 48 hours in all cases.  This policy of systematic pre-announcement of inspections was questioned by the European Commission in July 2006 and its unacceptability was conveyed to my Department in a formal communication in August.  As a result, my Department was obliged to agree to a proportion of Single Payment Scheme inspections being carried out in 2006 without prior notification.  Some 650 farms out of 130,000 involved in the Single Payment Scheme were subsequently selected for unannounced inspection.  The balance of inspection cases, representing some 92% of the 7,514 farms selected for Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme <Col N="1731"/>inspection in 2006, were all pre-notified to the farmer.</P>
        <P>The EU regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme would allow my Department to give pre-notification of inspection in all cases where certain elements of cross-compliance are involved e.g. the Nitrates Regulations.  However, my Department is committed, in the Charter of Rights for Farmers 2005-2007 to carrying out all Single Payment Scheme and Disadvantaged Area Scheme checks during one single farm visit in most cases.  This then obliges my Department to respect the advance notice requirements applicable to the most stringent element of the inspection regime viz. maximum of 48 hours notice but with no advance notice in a proportion of cases.</P>
        <P>My Department is also committed in the Charter of Rights to pursuing with the European Commission a strategy to deliver advance notification of 14 days for inspections.  The matter has been raised with the Commission on a number of occasions since 2004, particularly in the context of the Irish situation where we are operating a fully decoupled and essentially area-dependent Single Payment Scheme.  I have personally made the case again recently to Commissioner Fischer Boel and this issue will be a key point for Ireland in the CAP simplification initiative of the Commission which is now underway.</P>
        <P>My Department believes that pre-notification of Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme inspections fits in with the practicalities of Irish agriculture where increasingly, farmers are also engaged in off-farm employment.  In a decoupled Single Payment Scheme system, the provision of advance notification of inspection to the farmer should not negatively impact on the effectiveness of the control.  However, as the EU regulations stand, my Department is obliged to carry out a small proportion of inspections without prior notification and this is what was done in 2006.  My Department is seeking authority to allow advance notification in all inspection cases for 2007 and I will continue to press this point in the CAP simplification process.</P>
        <P>I believe it is important to point out that the total level of cross compliance penalties in 2006 amounted to about &euro;706,203.38.  This represents just 0.05% out of the total Single Payment financial envelope of more than &euro;1.3 billion available to Ireland.</P>

	<P>I am supportive of initiatives to promote food on all-island basis where this is of mutual benefit and leads to closer economic co-oper<Col N="1732"/>ation.  The development of an all-island animal health policy is a necessary prerequisite to the establishment of an all-island food label.  The development of the animal health policy is being actively pursued in the context of North/South co-operation.

	<P>All beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector is now required by law to carry an indication of country of origin.  There are EU Regulations, which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultrymeat at retail level. The information which these regulations require on the label includes the registered number of the slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.  There are no specific EU regulations governing the labelling of pigmeat or sheepmeat beyond the general food labelling regulations, which do not require &lsquo;country of origin&rsquo; information.</P>
        <P>The general EU food labelling regulations covering all food sold in Ireland require that the information be given clearly, accurately and in a language understood by the consumer.  Among these requirements is origin marking in cases where failure to provide such information would be likely to mislead the consumer to a material degree.  This legislation comes under the remit of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The primary legislation enacted by the Oireachtas last year, under which our beef labelling requirements on country of origin were extended to the catering sector also allows for the extension of country of origin labelling to other meats.  However, because different origin labelling requirements apply to other meats in the retail sector under current EU legislation and, different systems of traceability are in operation coupled with some import/export complexities, it is not as straightforward as it is for beef.  The European Commission, the Deputy will be aware, has opposed Member States introducing legislation in this area that is in excess of common EU <Col N="1733"/>requirements.  Nonetheless, my Department has been involved in consultations with the Department of Health and Children on draft new regulations to require operators in the retail and catering sectors to provide country of origin information on poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat.  It is my intention to submit these regulations, when they are finalised, to the European Commission for approval as required by EU legislation.</P>
        <P>Of course, the preferred way forward is that the Commission would progress the question of country of origin labelling of all meat at EU level.  I have been in regular contact with the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection on this subject.  I have also raised this issue in the Agriculture Council and will continue to take every opportunity to press for progress on this matter.  I have used the opportunity provided by bilateral meetings with EU Ministerial colleagues to seek their support for EU action on Country of Origin Labelling and so far have been encouraged by their response.</P>
        <P>Last year the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate of the European Commission undertook a consultative process on a wide range of issues in this area, under a document entitled &lsquo;Labelling: Competitiveness, Consumer Information and Better Regulation for the EU&rsquo;.  I arranged for my Department to make a submission on food labelling and country of origin labelling of meat in particular to the Department of Health and Children, who co-ordinated the Irish contribution to this process.  This confirmed my strong preference for origin labelling of meat and meat products and the desirability of there being common EU-wide legislation to support a labelling regime.</P>

	<P>Capital investment and research and development are priorities in the Agri Vision 2015 Plan of Action, which I launched in 2006 and which set out actions for building a knowledge-based, competitive, innovative and consumer focussed agri-food sector.  </P>
        <P>The Dairy Processing Investment Fund, which I launched last September, represents an investment package of &euro;300 million for the dairy sector over the next three years.  The investment fund includes &euro;100 million of Government grant assistance.  The objective of the Dairy Processing Investment Fund is to support capital investment related to the processing of dairy products.  The intention of the fund is to underpin competitiveness and viability of the dairy industry in Ireland.</P><Col N="1734"/>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland are responsible for the management of the scheme and implementation of the Fund.  They will play a key role, together with my Department, in the evaluation of the suitability of investment projects submitted for grant assistance.</P>
        <P>All applications have now been received and the fund has been oversubscribed with projects from all the major dairy companies.  The commercial and technical evaluation of applications has begun and announcement of grant awards will take place later this year.  One of the key aims of this package is to generate greater efficiencies for Irish dairy processors, which will support better prices paid to producers.</P>
        <P>There is also a need for improved efficiency and long-term competitiveness at producer level.  Reducing costs and increasing scale means getting more milk quota into the hands of active and committed producers at the lowest possible cost.  The Milk Quota Trading Scheme run last week was a successful step towards meeting these objectives.  Over 73m litres was transacted in the scheme successfully and I believe that this will build confidence in trading milk quota through a market-based system in future.</P>
        <P>The development of a modern, competitive, innovative, market focused and highly efficient dairy sector is absolutely essential within the context of global challenges.  The greatest of these for 2007 is the Doha Round of WTO Negotiations.  There is significant pressure on all participants to reach an agreement and I will continue to push for the best possible outcome for the Irish dairy sector.</P>

	<P>The SCENAR 2020 Study was carried out by a number of EU institutions to identify future trends and driving forces that will form the framework for the European agricultural and rural economy up to the year 2020.  The study took twelve months to complete and built up a reference scenario based on an analysis of trends from 1990 to 2005.  These trends were then projected to the year 2020 as a baseline and were then compared with two alternative scenarios.  These two scenarios are intended to demonstrate two possible variations of policy, one for example allows for the implementation of a full WTO agreement, during the period up to 2020.  </P>
        <P>In the context of the future for EU agriculture, the Study concludes that the on-going structural change process will continue, regardless of policy changes.  While there will be fewer farms in the EU than at present, overall farming productivity will be higher and also the average income of farmers as well.  The study also notes that the current policy of making the agricultural economy more responsive to market forces will stimulate the competitiveness of farmers and strengthen the viability of agricultural enterprises in to the future.</P>
        <P>This study&rsquo;s conclusions are closely in line with the analysis in this country on likely future trends. It sets out the present and forthcoming challenges which, in effect, mean that markets for Irish products are becoming ever more competitive and challenging, demanding even greater levels of innovation.  This is the reason I launched the Agri Vision 2015 Action Plan, as the Government&rsquo;s response to the future needs of Irish farming.  Implementing this Plan will underpin the State&rsquo;s continuing role in creating a climate that allows Irish farming to meet these challenges by facilitating the competitive drive and the attainment of higher standards of innovation, thereby maximising viable farm numbers and farm income.  The measures in the National Development Plan (NDP) address the recommendations of the Agri Vision 2015 Action Plan and encompass the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 that currently awaits EU approval.  The NDP embraces the Action Plan vision with an overall package totalling &euro;8.7 billion in public expenditure and provides clear and concrete commitment to that vision and to the continued success of the agri-food sector.</P>

	<P>My Department is fully committed to ensuring that consumers can have full confidence in the organic food they buy.  For that reason, extra staff resources were assigned to the Organic Unit last year and my officials are now systematically inspecting retail outlets, including supermarkets, shops and farmers&rsquo; markets, and checking to ensure that all product identified as organic has been produced fully in accordance with the organic regulations.  </P>
        <P>The introduction of the European Communities (Organic Farming) Regulation 2004 (S.I. No 112 of 2004) gave my Department powers to prosecute contraventions of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2092/91 on organic production and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs.  To date one operator has been convicted of an offence for labelling product in contravention of these Regulations.</P>
        <P>Consumers can play an important part in identifying traders and retailers who may be trying to abuse the Regulations governing the organic sector.  My officials will carry out full and rigorous investigations in any such cases and will bring prosecutions where appropriate.</P>

I respect the European Parliament&rsquo;s decision to oppose this proposal.  It does not have direct implications for Ireland&rsquo;s new Rural Development Programme.  The Programme which provides for substantial EU and Exchequer funding for a range of rural development measures was submitted to the Commission for approval in December and does not envisage recourse to voluntary modulation.  </P>

	<P>In keeping with commitments given in the Agri-Vision 2015 Action Plan, I announced over recent months, investment packages totalling &euro;150 million to support the development of the dairy, beef and sheepmeat processing sectors. &euro;100 million is for the dairy sector while &euro;50 million is being provided for the beef and sheepmeat sectors. This substantial grant assistance, which should trigger investment in excess of  &euro;400 million, is yet another clear indication of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the continued development of a modern, competitive, innovative and market-focused food industry.</P>
        <P>Financial support will be made available towards the cost of the construction and acquisition of buildings, new machinery and equipment and will significantly assist the industry in improving efficiency and competitiveness.  Indeed, it is important to acknowledge the constructive response in recent years, of the dairy, beef and sheepmeat sectors to the challenges presented in an ever-changing market.  This has made a major contribution to the enhanced status and reputation of Irish produce abroad.  In Government we strive to lead that progress and assist stakeholders by adopting pragmatic, if ambitious, policies in supporting the development of the sectors.</P>
        <P>The investment schemes will be managed by Enterprise Ireland who will evaluate the suitability of investment projects submitted for grant assistance.</P>
        <P>I launched the Dairy Investment Fund in September 2006 with applications accepted until 23 November.  The Dairy Fund will support Annex 1 dairy projects where the input and output is a minimum of 75% Annex 1.  I was very pleased to be informed by Enterprise Ireland that the Dairy Investment Fund was over subscribed.</P>
        <P>The scheme for the beef and sheepmeat processing sectors was announced on 8 November 2006 and the initial response from the industry was very positive. In order to underpin the effectiveness of this fund, ongoing consultations are continuing between officials in my Department and Enterprise Ireland aimed at finalising the full eligibility criteria and terms and conditions of the scheme.  These will be announced once they are finalised.</P>

	<P>One of the key features of the agriculture chapter of Towards 2016 has been the Government&rsquo;s willingness to provide a major increase in funding for agriculture from exchequer resources.  This has not only made up for the inevitable decline in EU funding, due to our economic success as a country, but has also provided the finance for the very significant enhancement of some major schemes which support the development of the sector. </P>
        <P>Towards 2016 includes a commitment that National Exchequer funding for the farm schemes under the Rural Development Programme will be &euro;4.7 billion for the period 2007 to 2013.  This is an increase of 135% from the &euro;2 billion in exchequer funds provided for the same schemes in the current round 2000 &mdash; 2006.  The total agreed funding for the agricultural measures is &euro;6.8bn, including &euro;2.1bn from EU and modulation.</P>
        <P>The new draft rural development programme reflects the commitments contained in the partnership agreement and will cover both agricultural and non-agricultural measures.  In line with the EU rural development framework, the measures in the programme will address competitiveness and sustainability. The main elements are as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A 17% increase in payments under the Rural Environmental Scheme (REPS).</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An 8% increase in Disadvantaged Areas Scheme payments.</P><Col N="1739"/>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The average forestry premium will rise by 15%.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Installation Aid rate will increase by 56%, bringing it up to &euro;15,000.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A new Early Retirement Scheme will be put in place with a maximum payment rate of &euro;15,000.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A total of &euro;250m is allocated for an Animal Welfare, Recording and Breeding Scheme for Suckler Herds.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />There is capital investment funding of &euro;100 million to support the dairy processing sector, and a &euro;50m package for the beef and sheepmeat processing sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These are just a few of the measures contained in the agriculture chapter of the partnership agreement, which is a very comprehensive document.  It includes actions on all the main farming sectors, as well as on the development of the food industry.  It also includes important measures on animal health, including a 50% reduction in disease levies, and includes commitments to continuing high levels of service to farmers by the Department.  The strong focus on the future in the document is further underlined in the sections on &lsquo;renewable energy&rsquo;, &lsquo;enhancing the environment&rsquo; and &lsquo;measures to encourage structural change&rsquo;.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of schemes and reliefs have been introduced in recent years to bring about improvements in farm structures.  Low levels of land mobility remain an obstacle for those who wish to enter farming or expand the size of their holding. However, leasing has become an increasingly popular means of securing land as the volume of land sold on the open market declines and land prices rise. </P>
        <P>At present there are a number of generous schemes and reliefs aimed at encouraging land mobility and reducing the cost of transfers to young trained farmers.  These include:</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A rental income tax exemption of up to &euro;15,000 for farmers over 40 years who lease out land for a period of 7 years or more.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A rental income tax exemption of up to &euro;12,000 for farmers over 40 years who lease out land for a period of 5 to 7 years.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Capital Gains Tax &mdash; Retirement Relief for farmers aged over 55 years.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A 90% Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The provision of full Stamp Duty Relief for young trained farmers.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Stamp Duty relief for land swap for the purpose of farm consolidation between two farmers.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Budget 2007 includes a number of provisions to further encourage land mobility and farm consolidation.  The measures include a third rental income exemption threshold of &euro;20,000 for leases of 10 years or over; stamp duty relief for farm <Col N="1741"/>consolidation where only one farmer is consolidating his holding; and a provision whereby farmers who are leasing out land can still, subject to certain conditions, qualify for Capital Gains Tax retirement relief.</P>
        <P>In addition, increased support for land mobility is being provided through a range of enhanced measures included in the draft Rural Development Plan 2007-2013.  The Installation Grant Aid for young farmers is to be increased by 55% to &euro;15,000 and a maximum early retirement pension of &euro;15,000 per annum is being provided for farmers who dispose of their land by gift, sale or lease.</P>
        <P>All these measures help to improve land mobility through early farm transfer or by encouraging greater levels of leasing, land swaps or farm consolidation.</P>

	<P>While no consultants have been engaged, it is the case that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been asked by the Government to develop a new comprehensive approach to public service review and to use this approach to assess the Irish Public Service.  This approach will give us a holistic, system-wide assessment which includes a peer review element whereby senior officials and practitioners from other countries will be actively involved.  </P>
        <P>The terms of reference of the Review have been published and are available on my Depart<Col N="1743"/>ment&rsquo;s website and on www.bettergov.ie.  This review has two main objectives: (1) to benchmark the Public Service in Ireland against other comparable countries; and (2) to make recommendations as to future directions for Public Service reform.  While the Review will not be a detailed audit of individual sectors such as health, education, local government etc., it will examine the effectiveness of arrangements through which government objectives are translated into outputs and outcomes.  It will focus on the connections between the different sectors including the links between Departments/Offices and Local Government, Health and Education Sectors, with a particular focus on delivery of quality public services.</P>
        <P>In order for the OECD to develop this systems level approach and to apply it in the first instance to the Irish Public Service, the Government is increasing our contribution to the OECD on a once-off basis by &euro;490,000.

	<P>The recognised way in law for a death to be investigated, where the circumstances surrounding it may be unclear, is by way of a coroner&rsquo;s Inquest.  While I have no definite information on the coroner&rsquo;s intentions in this regard, I would be very surprised if an inquest were not held in this case.  Such an inquest will enable the full details of the death concerned to emerge into the public arena.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I commenced Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 regarding civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by an adult on 1 January, 2007. A person behaves in an anti-social manner if the person causes or, in the circumstances, is likely to cause, to one or more persons who are not of the same household as the person (a) harassment, (b) significant or persistent alarm, distress, fear or intimidation, or (c) significant or persistent impairment of their use or enjoyment of their property. The application by the Garda Siochana to the Courts for an order under the Act comes at the end of a process. The first step in the procedure set out in the Act is that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issues a behaviour warning to a person who has behaved in an anti-social manner.  The behaviour warning will contain specific information.  It will include a statement from the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issuing it that the person concerned has behaved in an anti-social manner and will give details of the unacceptable behaviour, such as what the behaviour was and the time when and the place where it took place.  It will make a demand either that the person cease the behaviour or otherwise address the behaviour in a way set out in the warning.  Finally, the behaviour warning will warn the person that failure to comply with this demand may result in an application to the courts for a civil order or that issuing of a subsequent behaviour order might also result in an application to the courts for a civil order. If a behaviour warning or a series <Col N="1746"/>of warnings does not result in the person changing his or her behaviour, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may apply to the District Court for a civil order to prohibit the person from doing anything specified in the order.  Only a senior member of the Garda can make the court application, which means an officer not below the rank of superintendent.  An order will remain in force for a period specified in the order, which cannot be longer than two years.  If no period is specified, an order will remain in force for two years. The penalties for breach of an order will be a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or a maximum of six months imprisonment or both.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am informed by the Garda authorities that there have been eleven behaviour warnings issued by members of An Garda S&iacute;ochana (to adults) since the 1 January 2007, which may, if they do not have the desired effect, result in applications for orders. I intend to commence the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 relating to anti-social behaviour by children with effect from 1 March 2007. These provisions set out on incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by children from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the making  of a behaviour order by the Children Court.</P>

	<P>On 18 January, <Col N="1747"/>2007, Tetra Ireland Limited was selected by the Department of Finance as the preferred bidder for the provision of the National Digital Radio Services.  The preferred bidder and the relevant Departments and Agencies have commenced work on a Service Performance Evaluation (SPE) which  involves the provision of a live working system covering a significant part of Dublin and surrounding areas. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as one of the principal users of the service, will play a major role in the evaluation and testing of the network and equipment. The SPE will enable the preferred bidder, Tetra Ireland, to demonstrate that it can deliver all the aspects of the system and provide a fully working solution that meets all of the requirements of an emergency services network.  In parallel with the SPE, the Department of Finance will conduct contract negotiations with the preferred bidder and, subject to satisfactory completion of these negotiations and a successful outcome of the SPE, a contract for the provision of the nationwide services will be signed by that Department.  With regard to the details on the contract costs and running costs requested by the deputy, I am not in a position at this stage to provide these at this stage. In the first instance these are matters which will be subject to contract negotiation between the preferred bidder and the Department of Finance over the coming months. In addition, decisions by the Garda Authorities on the number of radio devices and the nature of the services availed of will also determine the overall cost for the Force.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my response to Parliamentary Question No. 136 on 23 November 2006 wherein I informed him that the person in question did not have five years reckonable residency in the State prior to submitting his application and thus did not satisfy the statutory residency requirements at that time. I have now been informed by officials in the Citizenship Division of my Department that the person concerned has not renewed his position to remain in the State since July 2006.  If an individual is required to have the permission of the Minister to remain in the State and does not obtain or renew that permission as applicable, that person is in breach of Irish Immigration law and may ultimately be subject to deportation proceedings.  The person in question should remedy this situation by contacting his local immigration officer. By allowing his permission to remain in the State to lapse, the person in question will not be eligible to apply for a certificate of naturalisation until he can satisfy the statutory condition of having one year&rsquo;s continuous reckonable residence in the State  prior to lodging his application.</P>

In this latter response, I advised the House that the final report of the completed pilot project was received by my  Department on Thursday 25 January 2007.  Officials of my Department had a meeting with representatives of the NDVIA on 29 January 2007 and explained to the NDVIA  that, in accordance with customary procedures, their final report on the pilot project and its most recent outcomes would now be evaluated by the Department.  The  original external evaluation of the pilot project, completed in early 2006, will also be reviewed again in order to consider fully the options for advancing the objective matter of the pilot project on a nationwide basis.</P>
        <P>My Department has since been in consultation with the NDVIA on the question of a funding arrangement &mdash; on an interim basis &mdash; pending examination by the Government of the report submitted, and of any new developments in the area.

Policing strategies for the area are predicated on the policy of reducing and preventing such incidents and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents. These strategies are, and will continue to be, central to policing plans for the area.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a <Col N="1752"/>package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength for Kinnegad Garda Station and the Longford/Westmeath Garda Division as at 31 December 1997, 2000 and 2006 was as set out here in the table hereunder:</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am further informed that resources are augmented from within the District/Division, to patrol and respond to any calls from the Kinnegad area. Resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units, all of which have had increased resources. Garda management state that the information requested in relation to the Garda personnel strength for Kinnegad Garda Station for 1970, 1980 and 1990 is not readily available and can only be obtained by the disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources relative to the information sought. Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 it is the responsibility of Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  In this regard, I am informed by Garda management that personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs. Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.  The allocation of Garda resources will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Longford/Westmeath Division and Kinnegad Garda Stations will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions and Stations throughout the country.</P>

	<P>In June 2005 I launched the Community Based CCTV Scheme to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems.  The Scheme offers two types of funding: Stage 1 offers a pre-development grant of up to &euro;5,000 to enable qualifying <Col N="1754"/>applicants investigate the need for CCTV in their area and to complete a detailed proposal, for submission under Stage 2 and Stage 2 is a direct Application Process for organisations who consider that they can develop and deliver a CCTV Programme immediately.  It enables communities to avail of grant aid funding of up to &euro;100,000 from this Department to install a CCTV system in their area.  In addition, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has given a commitment to provide successful applications from RAPID areas with a further grant to a maximum of &euro;100,000 subject to the total grant-aid from both Departments not exceeding &euro;200,000 or 100% of the capital costs of the project, whichever is the lesser. Pobal have been engaged to administer the Scheme on behalf of my Department.  Grants pertain to capital expenditure only.  Funding is not available for the operational, maintenance and running costs of the CCTV system.  All proposed Community Based CCTV systems must comply with the &lsquo;Code of Practice for CCTV Systems&rsquo; and &lsquo;Technical Specification for Community Based CCTV Systems&rsquo; authorised under Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides a statutory basis for community groups to operate CCTV systems.</P>
        <P>All applications must have the prior support and backing of the local Divisional Officer of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Section 38(3)(c) of the Act states, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Garda Commissioner shall specify the areas within which, based on the information available to him or her, the installation of CCTV is warranted.   Authorisation may be given by the Garda Commissioner, to persons who meet the established criteria and whose application for authorisation in respect of a specified area has been approved by the local authority, after consulting with the joint policing committee for that administrative area.  The Garda Commissioner may issue directions to authorised persons in relation to installation and operation of CCTV and may with the Minister&rsquo;s consent, revoke, for failure to comply with the terms and conditions or with a direction issued by the Commissioner.</P>

It is in the interest of all that the excellent level of cooperation that exists currently between the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Assets Recovery Agency is maintained and I have been assured that the British authorities are fully committed to ensuring that this is the case. I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the Chief Bureau Officer of the Criminal Assets Bureau has been in contact with the Director and Deputy Director of the Assets Recovery Agency regarding the proposed merger with the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) in the United Kingdom. The Criminal Assets Bureau is confident that the level of cooperation that exists will continue into the future.  I can assure the House that, as I have stated in the past, anyone who is in possession of illegally-obtained assets, regardless of background or affiliation, will be pursued with the utmost vigour.</P>

	<P>Standard procedure in our closed prisons is that all properties of persons committed to custody must be recorded and searched before being issued to the prisoner. In the case of packages of clothing for prisoners, items are generally delivered to the visitor waiting room and each item of clothing or property is recorded in a journal before being taken to the prison reception area.  The information recorded includes the date and time of delivery of the property, the name and address of the person who has delivered the property and the name of the prisoner for whom it is intended.   On arrival in the reception area, the property is then recorded on a prisoner records system.  The property is searched and checked for contraband at this point. Subject to everything being in order, the property is then placed in the prisoner&rsquo;s locker in the reception area.  Prisoners may retrieve items of personal property from their lockers, on request to the Governor in accordance with the 1947 Rules for the Government of Prisons.  If permission is given, the prisoner signs for the property on receipt of same and is advised that the property is received at his/her own risk.</P>

The prisoner may attend the hearing and may have legal advice or representation for the purposes of the hearing.  Under the Bill, the Tribunal may uphold or quash the original finding and may affirm, vary or quash the original sanction applied.  Where a prisoner makes a complaint alleging ill-treatment, the complaint is investigated by the Governor.  In any case where a criminal offence is disclosed, the Governor may request the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to undertake a police investigation with a view to obtaining evidence to support a criminal prosecution. In the circumstances, I do not currently propose to provide for an Ombudsman for prisoners.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have been informed by Pobal, the company engaged to administer the Community Based CCTV Scheme on behalf of my Department, that in 2006 a Stage 1 (pre-development) grant of &euro;4,000 was allocated to the Association referred to by the <Col N="1760"/>Deputy under that Scheme.   This was to enable them to investigate the need for CCTV in their area and to complete a detailed application for submission, under Stage 2 of the Scheme.    In December 2006 Pobal invited all of the groups who received Stage 1 grants to submit applications for Stage 2 funding before the end of January 2007.  I have been further informed by Pobal that a Stage 2 application has now been received and Pobal will carry out thorough assessments of all applications received and this process will take approximately 6 weeks.   Following this assessment, successful applications will be submitted to the Pobal Board and thereafter will be considered by the overall Project Board (a Board comprising of representatives from Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Chamber of Commerce Ireland, Garda&iacute;, Pobal and this Department) for recommendation and my subsequent approval.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms. I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the total strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as at 31 December 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 (figures are calculated on an end of year basis) was as set out hereunder:</P>

	<P>The Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as amended by the Children Act 1997, already encourages parties to think in terms of agreeing to the custody arrangements for their child, the right of access to the child or any other question affecting the welfare of the child without the need for court interventions. Provisions in the Act of 1997 encourage, where appropriate, the effecting of a deed or agreement in writing by the parents on the matter. Where the parties enter into an agreement in writing that includes an undertaking to take custody of the child or there is a provision governing the rights of access of the parties to the child, an application may be made for an order making the agreement a rule of court. The order made is a form of register of the agreement and its effect is to provide a mechanism for the enforcement, where necessary, of the order. The exercise of guardianship rights such as custody, access or decisions about a child&rsquo;s health requirements and other matters affecting the welfare of a child are all matters that <Col N="1766"/>may be agreed between the parents. It is, of course, in the absence of agreement that the parents may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child and in giving such directions by order the court is required to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. A father&rsquo;s right, say, to apply to the court for custody or access to his child is not contingent on his being made a guardian.</P>

	<P>The procurement competition for the provision of national digital radio services to the non-commercial public sector was conducted under EU Procurement Law using a Restricted Procurement Procedure.  It was overseen by an InterAgency Group chaired by my Department.  The initial contract notice was issued on 4 January 2006.  Nine responses were received from which five were shortlisted for receipt of the full tender documentation.  This documentation was issued to these five on 12 June 2006.  One of the five respondents withdrew from the competition and did not submit a proposal.  The remaining four respondents submitted proposals by the closing date of 22 August 2006.</P>
        <P>Qualification criteria are used to determine if a response can be qualified for consideration.  In this case, respondents were required to submit proposals that proved their ability to meet all of the detailed requirements specified in the tender documentation, and proved their ability to sufficiently fund and financially sustain the services required.  The four proposals submitted were evaluated initially against these qualification criteria.  Two of the responses were found to have not qualified because they did not meet all of the specified requirements.  The remaining two were forwarded to an Award Evaluation process.  This process is used to determine which of the qualifying proposals offers the most economically <Col N="1768"/>advantageous proposal.  In this case, the criteria used were technical merit and suitability of the proposed service solution, financial and legal evaluation, service and support arrangements, training, and terminals.  The InterAgency Group&rsquo;s evaluation team used these criteria to compare the two remaining proposals.  The National Development Finance Agency conducted the evaluation of the financial robustness of both proposals.  The proposal that scored the highest total mark following this comparison was announced as the preferred bidder.  This preferred bidder must now prove, within a defined timescale, its capability to deliver the service it proposed, before a contract can be awarded.  I am satisfied that the procurement exercise was conducted in full compliance with procurement law and that my Department has fulfilled all of it obligations in that regard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253 to 255, inclusive, and 271 together.</P>
        <P>Following the exceptional rainfall since mid-November a number of areas throughout the country, including the Lower Shannon area, have been severely affected by flooding. It was with this in mind that I announced on 18th January, that the Commissioners of Public Works will work with Local Authorities to try to identify solutions to the various  flooding incidents that have occurred.  The local knowledge of Local Authority staff, allied to the expertise of the OPW in dealing with river engineering, will assist in devising potential solutions to the individual problems in the most efficient manner possible. Where additional surveys or other information is needed this will be procured. It is my intention that, where solutions are identified which offer an acceptable level of social and financial benefit and which are environmentally acceptable,  these will be implemented as quickly as possible. In most cases the flooding occurred from rivers or watercourses for which the Commissioners of Public Works do not have responsibility and in respect of which consequently they have very limited powers. We will therefore be relying on the full co-operation of the Local Authorities and of local landowners in many cases to implement remedial measures quickly. Where it is not possible to find flood relief measures which are viable other flood protection measures may be considered. With regard to Clonlara, County Clare, I am advised that OPW officials have visited the area with a view to identifying a solution to the flooding problem, in conjunction with the ESB and Waterways Ireland. The provision of Humanitarian Assistance to those affected would be a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with the requirements of Article 11 of the Constitution, revenues accruing to the State including those seized from drug dealers through the functions of the CAB are paid into the Central Fund, from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment. There are no proposals to alter these arrangements.</P>
        <P>With certain exceptions, earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would, in general, constrain the government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy. Furthermore, if certain revenues were earmarked for particular projects within the overall fight against drug abuse, any projects thus funded would be dependent on actual revenue collected from that source.  Therefore, a fall in revenue generated by that source could imply a fall in expenditure on such projects.</P>
        <P>However, the Deputy should note that the Government already is allocating considerable resources to the fight against drug abuse by a range of Government Departments and State Agencies as well as the Community and Voluntary Sector. For example, in 2007 the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has been allocated &euro;43 million for the expenditure subhead &lsquo;Drugs Initiative/Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund&rsquo;.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 258, 265 and 274 together.</P>
        <P>When a particular stamp duty relief for first-time purchasers was introduced into the tax code in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2000, the relief was also extended to spouses in certain circumstances, who, as a result of a judicial separation or divorce, left the family home to their other spouse and did not have an interest in any other property.</P>
        <P>As unmarried cohabiting couples cannot benefit from a judicial separation or divorce, the existing provisions cannot be extended to include them.  As regards introducing a new provision to allow first-time purchaser status to cohabiting couples, and indeed married couples, where one partner leaves the family home outside of the judicial system, I have no plans to introduce such an arrangement.  At  this point, it would be unwise to change the tax code with regard to cohabiting couples in advance of developments in other relevant areas of public policy, for example, in the area of legal recognition of relationships other than married relationships.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 and 269 together.</P>
        <P>The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the levying of DIRT on certain interest paid or credited on deposits held with banks, building societies and certain other financial institutions including Credit Unions. Subject to certain statutory exceptions, financial institutions are required to deduct the tax from interest paid or credited in respect of the income on deposit.</P><Col N="1772"/>
        <P>However, individuals aged 65 years or over and individuals who are permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining themselves, can claim a refund from DIRT  where the income of the individual (inclusive of the deposit interest) is below the appropriate income exemption limit for tax purposes.  In the 2007 tax year the exemption limit for a single person aged 65 or over is &euro;19,000 per annum, and in the case of a married couple, the exemption limit is &euro;38,000 (the equivalent limits for the 2006 tax year were &euro;17,000 single/ &euro;34,000 married).  A partial refund may be due to such individuals whose income (inclusive of the deposit interest) does not greatly exceed the appropriate income exemption limit.</P>
        <P>In the recent Budget, I announced changes to the DIRT refund scheme.  The rules are being changed so that in future interest can be received without deduction of DIRT.  Qualifying elderly individuals will be able to advise their financial institution of their status and receive interest without DIRT.  Further details on the operation of this scheme will be issued after the Finance Bill is enacted.</P>

	<P>The Government has always said that the Decentralisation Programme is a voluntary one.  We are fully cognisant of the fact that it fundamentally impacts on the staff in the organisations affected, on their career choices and their expectations. What is required therefore is both a successful business outcome and an outcome which meets the needs of the staff involved &mdash; both those who wish to relocate and those opting to remain in Dublin.  To ensure that these needs are fully addressed, my Department has put in place detailed arrangements to discuss the full range of staff concerns with staff representatives. The key forum in this regard is the General Council Subcommittee on Decentralisation, which meets monthly.</P>
        <P>Discussions have concluded under this forum on the arrangements to be put in place for civil service general service staff who do not wish to decentralise with their existing or another department. Under these arrangements, a facility is being operated through the Public Appointments Service to allow staff remaining in Dublin to express preferences in relation to the organisations to which they would like to transfer. This will be an ongoing process throughout the transition phase of the Programme and progress in this priority area is being monitored in co-oper<Col N="1773"/>ation with Departments and the relevant unions, to ensure that they are operating efficiently.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Staff may apply for specific departments and if they are interested in working in a specific location, they may apply to move to that location after moving to the new department who will deal with their application in accordance with that Department&rsquo;s normal internal procedures. While every effort will be made to facilitate staff in relation to location, issues such as grade, timing and business requirements may not always coincide to allow departments to guarantee that staff preferences can be met in all cases.</P>
        <P>More broadly, the Office of Public Works is responsible for both property procurement and disposal. The overall objective is to ensure that property being acquired at a regional level is matched as closely as possible, both in time and in cost terms, by the disposal of property currently held in the Dublin region, whether held on lease or otherwise. No final decisions have been made yet on the disposal, retention or re-allocation of office buildings in Dublin, post decentralisation. The Office of Public Works will bear in mind the particular requirements of Departments remaining in Dublin and the need to ensure that all office space remaining in Dublin is utilised in the most cost effective manner possible.</P>

        <Quest> if consideration has been given to the impact on domestic law that may arise from the EU consolidated VAT directive 2006/112/EC; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I should explain that Directive 2006/112/EC is a recast of <Col N="1774"/>the EU VAT Directives which replaces and repeals the First VAT Directive and the Sixth VAT Directive. There are no substantive changes to Irish VAT law arising from the recast of these EU VAT Directives, as the objective of the recast is to provide a single simplified legislative base.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I made Regulations last December entitled &ldquo;European Communities (Value-Added Tax) Regulations 2006&rdquo; (S.I. No. 663 of 2006) to provide for the transposition into domestic VAT law of Directive 2006/112/EC which came into force on 1 January 2007. The Regulations created the necessary legal mechanism to update the references to the Sixth Directive which were used in the domestic law.  In the Finance Bill 2007, I published the comprehensive set of details of every reference in the VAT Act which is affected by the new Directive, with the appropriate amendments required.  These are in Schedule 2 to the Finance Bill as initiated.  When the Finance Bill is enacted, it will replace and revoke the Regulations in S.I. No. 663 of 2006.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Generally, the amount of VRT to be paid on a kit-car is determined by the Revenue Commissioners and is comparable to the amount payable in respect of a conventional car of the same size and specification.  I understand that a specialist consultant is engaged by the Revenue Commissioners to assist in this determination.  It is ascertained by reference to the type of kit used in the manufacture of the vehicle and the donor vehicle used where appropriate.  The current legislation ensures equality of treatment in relation to VRT as between kit-car and conventional cars.</P>
        <P>As you are aware, I have signalled an intention to introduce into the VRT system from 2008 some mechanism which will take account of the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions of cars. As to whether the position of kit-car requires special treatment under the new regime, I cannot say at this stage. Those who have concerns in this regard should make a submission to my Department as part of the public consultation process announced in the Budget and also advertised on my Departments website and in the national daily newspapers of 15 December 2006. Submissions must be received by my Department by 1 March 2007.</P>

	<P>The National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013 was launched by the Government on the 23rd of January, 2007 in Dublin Castle. At the present time not all of the invoices for the various services related to the production of the document and for the launch have been received. However, it is estimated that the total cost of the production of the NDP document and of the launch was some &euro;340,000. If there is any significant difference from this estimate when all invoices are received, I will communicate this directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The cost of the production, printing and translation of the NDP document was some &euro;265,000. The residual cost of some &euro;75,000 includes costs associated with the production of a multimedia resource for use at the launch, development of the NDP 2007-2013 logo, design and construction of backdrops, screen and lighting, photographic services, the hiring of an Audio-Visual technician and equipment for the launch and catering for the event.</P>
        <P>Finally, there were no costs associated with event management or public relations for the launch as the launch was managed by staff of the Department of Finance with the assistance of staff of the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 276 and 277 together.</P>
        <P>Section 473 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 allows income tax relief at the standard rate for rent paid in respect of a residential premises held under a tenancy.  Different ceilings apply depending on the marital status and age of the claimant.</P>
        <P>The relief applies where there is a payment in the nature of rent made in return for the special possession of, or for the use, occupation or enjoyment of the residential premises (which can include part of a building used or suitable for use as a dwelling).  Rent for purposes of section 473 does not include payment for goods or services (for example, meals, contribution to utility bills or laundry services), or indeed payment for any benefit other than the bare right to use, occupy and enjoy the residential premises.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not have details of the number of section 473 claims made by persons living in the family home, or the number of such claims that have been refused.  I am advised that the Revenue <Col N="1779"/>Commissioners have increased their level of checking of such claims in recent months to ensure that the conditions of the relief are being complied with.  I understand that their main concern is to ensure that relief is not claimed for contributions to household expenses and that there is a bona fide tenancy agreement in existence under which rent is paid.  I am advised that where claims have been questioned by Revenue, the nature of the additional evidence required to validate the claim will have been set out in Revenue&rsquo;s letter to the claimant.</P>
        <P>I do not see that the checking of claims in these particular circumstances in any way undermines the wider public campaign of encouraging taxpayers to claim their entitlements. The Revenue Commissioners have a duty to ensure that claims are genuine and in accordance with the legislation.  The number of section 473 claims made in 2003, the latest year for which statistics are available, was 102,380 at an Exchequer cost of &euro;28.1 million.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if he will introduce a provision exempting non-profit making cultural organisations from VAT on fees to international artists; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[4179/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I should explain that not-for-profit organisations are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive with which Irish law must comply. This means that non-profit making organisations do not charge VAT on their services and cannot recover VAT on goods and services which they purchase. Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT.</P>
        <P>The VAT Act lists a range of activities that are exempt from VAT.  Included in this list is the promotion of and admissions to live theatrical or musical performances. This very broad exemption is allowed under Article 132 of the EU VAT Directive. In effect, this means that the promoter realises the full value of admission fees as no <Col N="1780"/>VAT is applied to admission fees. In this regard, the current exemption is already very generous covering a broad range of actives accessible to the wider public.</P>
        <P>In addition, one of the basic tenets of EU VAT law relates to the proper functioning of the internal market. This means that it is not possible to use VAT law to favour artists not resident in this state over artists that are resident in the state.</P>
        <P>In relation to providing a VAT exemption for performance fees charged by musical or theatrical performers to not-for-profit arts organisations, the position is that the VAT treatment of a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the status of the customer. There is no provision in European VAT law that would allow for an exemption from VAT on supplies by non-resident artists when they perform for not-for-profit cultural organisations as such an exemption would have to apply to all such performers. It is estimated that this would cost in excess of &euro;20 million. All perform<Col N="1781"/>ance fees are therefore liable to VAT at the standard rate of 21 per cent.</P>

	<P>The use of live animals in scientific research and other experimental activity is strictly controlled in accordance with the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, as amended by the European Communities (Amendment of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876) Regulations 2002 and 2005.  Under the Act, experiments on live animals can only be performed by persons licensed by the Authority (Minister for Health and Children) and in premises registered by the Authority for that purpose. Each licence applicant must satisfy the Authority that they have the appropriate education and training (including instruction in a relevant scientific discipline) for the task; are competent to perform the task in accordance with the conditions specified in the licence; and have the appropriate competence to handle and take care of the experimental animals specified in the application.</P>
        <P>Section 5 of the Act deals with the &lsquo;General requirements about care and accommodation of experimental animals&rsquo; and provides that: &mdash; all experimental animals shall be provided with housing, an environment, at least some freedom of movement, food water and care that are appropriate to their health and well being; any restriction on the extent to which an experimental animal can satisfy its physiological and ethological needs shall be limited to the absolute minimum; the environmental conditions in which experimental animals are bred, kept or housed shall be checked daily; the well-being and state of health of experimental animals shall be observed by a veterinary surgeon or other suitably qualified person in order to prevent pain or avoidable suffering, distress or lasting harm; arrangements <Col N="1782"/>shall be made to ensure that any defect or suffering discovered is eliminated as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Inspections of registered user establishments are carried out in accordance with Section 10 of the Act.  The Act provides for all registered establishments to be visited from time to time by inspectors for the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of the Act.  Veterinary staff of the Department of Agriculture and Food act as inspectors. Officials of my Department do not carry out these inspections.</P>

	<P>In 2005, a process was begun to examine all aspects of the drugs supply chain, with a view to achieving greater value for money in the pricing <Col N="1786"/>and supply of drugs and medicines to the health services and the GMS and community drugs schemes, consistent with patient safety and continuity of supply. This process was agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health.  A joint HSE/Department of Health and Children negotiating team was put in place to advance this process.</P>
        <P>In mid-2006, the negotiating team reached agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI). Discussions then began with the wholesaler representative body, the Pharmaceutical Distributors&rsquo; Federation (PDF), as part of the agreed process on supply to community pharmacies and the health services.  However, PDF advised the State that a legal issue precluded it from negotiating a new margin for distribution to community pharmacies.  The negotiating team then obtained legal advice, which subsequent legal advice to the Department confirmed, that this issue also had implications for negotiations with community pharmacists.</P>
        <P>The position is as follows.  Section 4(1) of the Competition Act, 2002 prohibits all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the restriction or distortion of competition, including agreements to fix prices, unless the agreement, decision or concerted practice meets certain conditions. Those conditions are not met in this case.</P>
        <P>Wholesalers and pharmacy contractors are undertakings.  PDF and the IPU are associations of undertakings under Section 4(1) of the Act.  The coming together of wholesalers under PDF or pharmacy contractors under the IPU to negotiate prices would be a breach of Section 4(1).  Entering into an agreement, making a decision or being involved in a concerted practice in contravention of Section 4(1) is a criminal offence and would expose those parties, their directors, managers and officers to the risk of criminal prosecution.</P>
        <P>In light of the above, it is not possible for the HSE to engage in negotiations with PDF or the IPU in relation to fees or margins.  The HSE has written to all community pharmacy contractors, setting out the position in relation to these issues in detail.</P>
        <P>The negotiating team is now examining how best to address this issue for pharmacy contractor services.  However, negotiations must comply with the law. To this end, the team has engaged with the IPU, has set out the legal position and clarified the situation in relation to contract negotiations.  The team is currently considering, in the context of the legal position, proposals from the IPU with a view to agreeing a process for contract review that would comply fully with competition law.  It is hoped that this ongoing dialogue will allow this matter to be resolved.</P><Col N="1787"/>
        <P>With regard to IPU representation of pharmacists, both my Department and the HSE recognise the IPU as the collective representative body for its members.  There is, and will continue to be, ongoing dialogue with the IPU, within the constraints of the legal advice provided.  I wish to see that dialogue continuing in a constructive manner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care.  All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive will have their charges repaid in full.  The estates of all those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged for publicly funded long term residential care and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full.  The scheme does not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died prior to that date.</P>
        <P>Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.</P>
        <P>The repayment scheme was launched publicly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Scheme Administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald in August 2006.  The Scheme Administrator has commenced scanning the records of long stay facilities around the country and to date 167 locations have been visited for this purpose.</P>
        <P>In relation to dates of repayments to applicants, the HSE has informed the Department that over 24,000 forms have been submitted to the Scheme Administrator applying for repayments and these applications are being processed at present. The timeframe for repayment is predicated primarily on whether the applicant is alive or whether the application is being made by the estate of a deceased person. Living people who were wrongly charged will be prioritised to receive repayments. It is estimated that there are now in the region of 14,000 people within this category. Queries in relation to individual applications, including details on the timeframe for a <Col N="1788"/>repayment, should be referred to the Scheme Administrator. Complainants are also requested to contact the Scheme Administrator for details concerning the anticipated date of repayment.</P>
        <P>In addition, the HSE has put arrangements in place whereby it can make applications on behalf of living persons in  long stay institutions where there is no other connected person to make an application and where the applicants are unable to apply themselves due to ill health, or mental or physical disability.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that offers of repayment commenced in November 2006 and that the first payments have already issued with further payments continuing on an ongoing basis. The HSE has indicated that over &euro;17 million has been repaid to date and that the average repayment is approximately &euro;21,000. It is expected that the bulk of payments to estates will commence in the Spring.  Provision has been made for applications to be received up to 1 January 2008. It is anticipated that final repayments will be made by mid 2008.</P>
        <P>No deadline has been established for when claims received will be repaid due to the fact that some applications will take longer to process depending on the complexity of the application and the accuracy and detail of records which are available. However, a dedicated website (www.repay.ie), an information phone line (1890 886 886) and an e-mail facility (queries@repay.ie) have been established by the Scheme Administrator to assist the public in accessing claim forms and general information on the scheme.  The information line operates between the hours of 8.00 am and 9.00 p.m. from Monday to Saturday.</P>
        <P>A national oversight committee was appointed in August 2005 to provide an independent input into the design of the scheme and continues to monitor the operation of the scheme in order to ensure that it is being implemented quickly and in the most equitable and effective way possible. The committee is representative of service users, including Age Action Ireland and the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament. The committee is fully briefed on all aspects of the scheme and has provided valuable input into the process to date.  Officials from my Department liaise with the HSE on an ongoing basis to monitor the implementation of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act, 2006.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Some of the benefits and key commitments to individuals as part of A Fair Deal will be: Nursing home care will now be affordable to every person and fair to all; for those currently in private care, their costs will be reduced significantly; individuals will be asked to make a contribution towards the cost of care, limited by the cost of care; the basis for contributions will be fair, based on each person&rsquo;s means and assets; contributions during a person&rsquo;s lifetime will be less than their disposable income; care recipients will not have to sell or mortgage their house to meet the contribution; a spouse or dependent child will not have to sell or mortgage the house to meet the contribution; and the deferred contribution from the principal private residence will be capped at a maximum of 15%. I would also like to inform the Deputy that under the new scheme the State will continue to fund the largest part of care costs overall.</P>

	<P>The consensus of scientific opinion to date regarding possible adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields (EMF) exposure from mobile phone masts is that there is no evidence of a causal relationship between such exposure and ill health. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has assessed the many reviews carried out in this area and has indicated that exposures below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) in their 1998 Guidelines do not produce any known adverse health effects. These guidelines are based on a careful analysis of all peer-reviewed scientific literature and include thermal and non-thermal effects.</P>
        <P>In 1999, the European Community introduced recommendations on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields, based on the ICNIRP guidelines. Ireland complies with these recommendations. The Commission for Communication Regulations (ComReg) monitors compliance with regard to telecommunication masts.</P><Col N="1792"/>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that approval for the erection of a mobile phone mast in a particular area is a matter for the local planning authority. Guidelines for Planning Authorities in relation to Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures are a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Research is ongoing in relation to this issue and my Department will continue to monitor developments concerning the possible health effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, was launched in January 2006.  It provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over the next seven to ten years.  The Government has accepted the Report as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.</P>
        <P>In 2006, a sum of &euro;26.2 million was allocated for the development of mental health services in line with &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;.  A further sum of &euro;25 million has been allocated in 2007 to continue this development.  Implementation of the individual recommendations of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, is a matter primarily for the HSE.  In July 2006, the HSE established an implementation group to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; a reality.  The HSE has also informed my Department that it is currently examining how best to give effect to the recommendation, contained in A Vision for Change, to establish a National Mental Health Service Directorate.  Proposals are being developed which will take account of the HSE&rsquo;s existing management structures and the existence of the Expert Advisory Group on Mental Health.</P>
        <P>Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA) and the Irish Nurses Organisation (INO) are pursuing a number of cost increasing claims in respect of pay and conditions, including claims for parity with therapeutic grades and a reduction in working hours from 39 to 35 hours per week. </P>
        <P>The claims were heard by the Labour Court on 20 June 2006 and were the subject of an in-depth examination.  The Labour Court issued its recommendation (LCR 18763) on 9 November 2006.  This Recommendation has been accepted by health service employers.  In its recommendation the Labour Court noted that the social partnership agreements have brought significant benefits to workers, employers and to the economy overall and they provide a fair mechanism within an agreed framework by which workers can obtain improvements in pay and conditions of employment.  In relation to the specific claim for parity with the therapeutic grades the Court stated that <Col N="1796"/>it was &ldquo;of the view that the only available mechanism by which this claim can be processed is through Benchmarking&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In relation to the claim for a reduction in working hours the Court stated that concession of this claim at this time would have profound consequences for both health care delivery and costs unless effective countervailing measures could be put in place.  The Court did recommend that the parties explore the possibility of initiating an appropriate process aimed at achieving a major reorganisation of working arrangements within the health service generally.  Such a process would have to involve representatives of a variety of grades and professions across the health service.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Health and Children I would like to place on record that I hold the nursing and midwifery professions in high esteem and view the care they provide to patients as a critical component of our health services.  I believe that a solution to the current dispute can be found within the context of the Labour Court Recommendation and the prevailing national agreements.  In this regard I arranged for an exploratory meeting to be held between all the parties concerned at the offices of the HSE-Employers Agency on 19 January 2007.  While I understand the discussions provided clarity as to the respective positions of the parties the meeting adjourned without agreement on the way forward.  However, I remain hopeful that a resolution to this dispute can still be found and I believe it remains open to the INO and PNA to enter the Benchmarking process and have their pay claims processed through this forum.  Two other unions, SIPTU and IMPACT, which also represent nurses are currently participating in the Benchmarking process and have made a submission for improvements in pay and conditions on behalf of their members.  In addition the INO and PNA could also decide to accept the national agreement, Towards 2016.  If they accept this agreement their members would be eligible for pay increases of 10%.</P>
        <P>I believe that the industrial action which the unions concerned now propose to take would not be in the interests of patients, staff or employers and I would urge the Unions to give further consideration to the proposals contained in the Labour Court Recommendation.</P>

        <P>Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the number of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.</P>
        <P>Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of the Actual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued to the Deputy.</P>

A significant amount of this year&rsquo;s funding  &mdash; &euro;7.95m &mdash; is for the development of child and adolescent psychiatric services.

	<P>There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements are made to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</P>
        <P>I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.  My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service.  While considerable work has taken place to develop arrangements which would ensure that no top-up charges are applied, it is necessary to ensure that any such arrange<Col N="1805"/>ments and the process by which they are arrived at comply with the terms of the Competition Act 2002.  In this context legal advice is at present being sought in relation to the permissibility of negotiating contractual fee arrangements with organisations representing self-employed health professionals.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.</P>

        <P>In 2006 I announced the Government&rsquo;s commitment to co-fund an innovative programme of prevention and early intervention for children.  This Prevention and Early Intervention Programme is being run for a five-year period and will have a fund amounting to &euro;36 million in total, half of which will be provided by Government and half by The Atlantic Philanthropies.  The Programme is being managed by my Office (OMC) and administration of the fund is also overseen by it.</P>
        <P>Three projects (Tallaght West Childhood Development Initiative, YoungBallymum and Northside Partnership) were invited to submit proposals to the OMC under the Programme.  I am please to confirm that Tallaght West CDI was successful and a service level agreement has been signed between Tallaght West CDI and the OMC.</P>
        <P>The Prevention and Early Intervention Programme will examine innovative methods for improving outcomes for children in an integrated way.  The intention is to ensure that local services connect effectively with one another, making them more focused on the multiple needs of children and families.  The strategy will also provide for some new services and the re-orientation of existing services in the identified area to meet the specified needs of the community.  Apart from the impact on the community in Tallaght, the monitoring and evaluation of this and related projects <Col N="1806"/>should help to guide the development of services into the future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 350 and 351 together.  </P><Col N="1813"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Dunquin prospect is still being explored and, as yet, no discovery, commercial or otherwise, has been made. Seismic data was acquired over the prospect last year and subject to positive results it is hoped that an exploration well will be drilled there in the next couple of years.  No wells have been drilled on the structure to date.</P>
        <P>Spanish Point was drilled by Phillips Petroleum in 1981 and flowed small amounts of oil and gas on test.  Both the original operator and a subsequent operator, who both relinquished licences over the area, viewed the discovery as non-commercial.  The present operator is seeking to show that Spanish Point may contain larger volumes of hydrocarbons and therefore warrant the drilling of an appraisal well.  At this stage no decision has been made with regard to drilling such a well.  Therefore the question of either Dunquin or Spanish Point containing commercial amounts of oil or gas is hypothetical at this stage.</P>

	<P>The Local Advisory Committee, made up of stakeholders and State Agencies, for wild molluscs operating within the framework for managing Ireland&rsquo;s Inshore Shellfisheries is developing proposals for the management of wild molluscs within Waterford Estuary and Tramore Bay.  The Local Advisory Committee requested <Col N="1814"/>the Minister to introduce a moratorium on the taking of cockles until a full assessment of the cockle fishery has been carried out and new management arrangements are put in place.  While assessments of part of the area were carried out, the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara have recommended that an assessment of the entire area is required to inform the introduction of management measures and this approach has been endorsed by the Local Advisory Committee. </P>
        <P>The moratorium was introduced to prevent over exploitation of cockles in the area until the appropriate management measures, that will deliver a sustainable cockle fishery into the future, are introduced.  The closure has been put in place until 31 May 2007 or until such new measures are introduced.  The appropriate surveys required are currently being undertaken by Bord Iascaigh Mhara in conjunction with local fishermen.  The results of these assessments will inform the management plan being developed in consultation with the Local Advisory Committee.</P>

	<P>Since 2002, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is a statutory independent body, has been charged with all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002. </P>
        <P>Last year, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) directed BG&Eacute; to implement a new Gas Connections Policy, which determines the economic viability of connecting towns to the gas network.  The new policy allows for the appraisal of a new town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.  Having regard to this new policy, BG&Eacute; carried out a comprehensive review of towns being considered for connection to the national gas network.  The review is being conducted in two phases, and phase 1, which covers the towns in the proximity of the Mayo-Galway Pipeline, has already been completed.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of this phase of the review, the CER made the decision to allow Bord Gais to extend the natural gas network to eleven towns along the route of its Mayo-Galway gas transmission pipeline, including Ballina and Crossmolina, and it is envisaged that the connection of the eleven towns will take two to three years to complete.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  The enabling of exchanges to provide DSL broadband is a matter for the service providers. </P>
        <P>My priority remains that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country. However I am aware that despite Government and private investment in broadband infrastructure there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  I would like to expedite the roll-out of broadband to these remaining areas that cannot receive a commercially viable service. Accordingly, I recently announced my intention to introduce a scheme to ensure broadband is available throughout Ireland.  This Scheme, which will supersede the Group Broadband Scheme, will, when it is fully rolled out, ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met.  A Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently considering all elements of the proposed scheme. This scheme will be confined to areas of the country that are not yet served by any broadband service provider, currently thought to be 10-15% of the population.</P>
        <P>Under the joint industry/Government initiative which established the Broadband for Schools Programme, high speed broadband connectivity is being provided to all primary and post primary schools in the country at no cost to the schools themselves. 96.8% of schools have broadband installed to date.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s website www.broadband.gov.ie gives full details of broadband availability in all areas, including ADSL, cable, fibre, satellite and fixed wireless.  The website also lists prices of the various service levels on offer and contact details for each service provider.</P>

	<P>The Irish National Petroleum Corporation Limited (INPC) business and commercial assets were sold on 16 th July 2001. The INPC was paid in full for these assets on 16 th July 2001.  An undertaking, by the purchaser, and its successors, to operate the facilities on a fully commercial basis for at least 15 years, was a key element of this transaction.</P>
        <P>While the headline payment figure was $100 million (&euro;117 million) for the 2001 transaction, it was always accepted that the net cash return arising from the transaction would be considerably less as the INPC had, for example, to use some of the proceeds to discharge the company&rsquo;s significant debt (circa &euro;88 million).</P>
        <P>After taking account of all the company&rsquo;s matured liabilities it was estimated that the INPC would have funds in the region of &euro;30 million.  The INPC has paid &euro;20 million to the Exchequer (2002) but the company is not in a position to pay over remaining balance, as, under Company Law, it must retain sufficient assets to meet potential liabilities.</P>
        <P>The INPC retains rights and obligations under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) relating to the 2001 transaction.  I would refer the Deputy to the Annual Reports and Accounts of the INPC, laid before the Oireachtas, for the years 2001 to 2005.</P>

The Government&rsquo;s clear objective throughout has been to ensure that our territory is not used for extraordinary rendition purposes.  As a result of swift and decisive action on the part of the Government, we received early, clear, and categorical assurances to this effect from the US authorities at the highest level. In this regard, I would draw attention to the fact that such categorical assurances were not given to most other Member States.  Moreover, nowhere has it been suggested in the various investigations into extraordinary rendition that Irish territory was used for this pur<Col N="1818"/>pose. Indeed, the clear implication, including in the recent European Parliament Committee&rsquo;s report, is that no extraordinary rendition took place on Irish territory. </P>

	<P>As set out in previous PQ replies, most recently on 23 November 2006, I am aware of allegations regarding the harvesting of live organs from Falun Gong practitioners, including as set out in a recent report by two Canadian human rights experts, Mr. David Matas and Mr. David Kilgour, on behalf of the Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of the Falun Gong in China (CIPFG). I view these allegations seriously and enquiries on this issue have been made by the Department of <Col N="1820"/>Foreign Affairs within the EU and UN frameworks, as well as through our Embassy in Beijing. A senior official from the Department also met with Mr. David Kilgour during his visit to Dublin last November to discuss the findings of the report prepared by him and Mr. Matas. To date, no concrete evidence has been revealed to substantiate the allegations contained in this report. However, the matter is being kept under review by my officials and enquiries by the EU and other organisations are continuing. I also understand that Mr. Kilgour and Mr. Matas intend to present further material arising from their work. </P>
        <P>Without prejudice to the outcome of the above enquiries, Ireland and the EU remain concerned about the situation of Falun Gong practitioners in China. This remains, within our wider concerns about human rights in China, a constant and important point of dialogue with the Chinese authorities at both bilateral and European Union levels.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am especially concerned at the increased rate of rape and gender based violence in parts of Darfur and the lack of progress being made by courts there to address these crimes as detailed in the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s report of 28 December 2006. Since 2003, gender based violence targeted at women and girls has been a consistent feature of the conflict in Darfur. Women have been raped during attacks on their villages, while fleeing such attacks and within camps for the displaced. Sexual assaults against female international aid workers have also occurred recently. A staff member of a French humanitarian agency, based in a rebel-controlled town in Southern Darfur, is reported to have been raped in December 2006 and in January 2007 a female UN staff member is reported to have been sexually assaulted by Sudanese police. </P>
        <P>In my meetings with the Sudanese Foreign Minister, Lam Akol, in July and September 2006, I underlined the importance of ensuring that the vulnerable in Darfur have full and unimpeded access to humanitarian support and protection. I also urged similar action in discussions with key international actors with a capacity to influence Sudan, most recently in my meetings with the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Aboul Gheit, and the Arab League Secretary-General, Amr Mussa, in Cairo on 1 February 2007.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid assistance to Sudan, which totals &euro;33 million since 2004, has mainly funded humanitarian activities to aid those affected by conflict, including large numbers of women and girls. This funding includes &euro;3 million provided to support the work of the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS), which has largely been used for the recruitment of humanitarian and human rights monitors and the construction of protective police posts in camps for internally displaced people in Darfur.</P>
        <P>Ireland urged the holding of the UN Human Rights Council Special Session on Darfur, which took place on 12 December 2006, and we supported the NGO forum that was held in its margins. Our intervention at the Special Session noted how women and girls have been persistently made victims of sexual violence, while gender based violence was the first of the topics dealt with by the NGO forum. We encouraged the Special Session to dispatch a fact finding mission to Darfur, which is expected to arrive in Sudan within days. Ireland has also requested that the <Col N="1822"/>increasing use of violence against women as a weapon of war be included in the EU&rsquo;s statement at the upcoming annual meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women, specifically raising the issue of complicity by governments who take no action against perpetrators of violence against women and the aura of impunity which this creates.</P>
        <P>In late 2004, in response to the appalling levels of gender based violence in Darfur, Irish Aid and a number of Irish and international NGOs, including Amnesty International, formed the Joint Consortium on Gender Based Violence, which has begun working on Gender Based Violence as an international problem and now includes the Defence Forces among its members. The consortium&rsquo;s report on Darfur was discussed with its Special Adviser, former President Mrs. Mary Robinson, at a meeting in the Department of Foreign Affairs in November 2006 and a strategy to implement its recommendations is now being finalised.</P>
        <P>While the situation is most acute in Darfur, the position of women in the Sudan as a whole remains a matter of concern. The United Nations Children&rsquo;s fund (UNICEF) has estimated that almost 90% of Sudan&rsquo;s female population are subjected to female genital mutilation, often in its most severe forms. This occurs despite a commitment by the Government of Sudan to eradicate this dreadful practice. While Sudan&rsquo;s interim national constitution guarantees respect for fundamental human rights, the authorities have not yet adhered to the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. EU Embassies in Khartoum maintain a regular dialogue with Sudan on human rights issues at which these key issues are addressed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s official programme of development assistance, Irish Aid, has as its primary aim the reduction of poverty. Africa is the primary geographic focus of Irish Aid. </P>
        <P>The White Paper on Irish Aid, published last September, sets out in the most comprehensive and detailed way, since the inception of the aid programme in 1974, the principles and policies underlying the aid programme. It outlines the vision for the future and a number of key initiatives.</P>
        <P>The White Paper was the subject of extensive consultation with the Irish public. Public meetings were held throughout the country. Aid agencies and other stakeholders took part in a consultative forum in Dublin Castle. Consultations were also held with UN agencies and with Ireland&rsquo;s partners in the developing world.</P>
        <P>The White Paper was debated and welcomed by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad last November. I had an extremely useful discussion with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on 10 October last, which highlighted, once again, the close working relationship between Irish Aid and the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>My Department cooperates closely with other Government Departments in implementing policy on Overseas Development Aid. Arising from the White Paper, an Interdepartmental Committee will shortly be established in order to formalise this cooperation.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid delivers assistance to over 30 countries in Africa, but has a particularly deep relationship with six countries. These are Tanzania, Zambia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Uganda and Ethiopia. These countries are termed Programme Countries and are a particular focus for Irish Aid.</P>
        <P>The first three countries listed were designated as programme countries in the 1980s based on their poverty, links with Ireland and with Irish missionaries and on the comparative advantage which Ireland had in relation to their needs; there was also, in the case of Lesotho, the desire to show solidarity with a country that was surrounded by the then apartheid South Africa. The latter three were designated in the mid 1990&rsquo;s based on visits by Irish Aid appraisal teams, which looked at the respective poverty indices and on the emergence of these countries from years of conflict. Malawi has been designated as the seventh Programme Country in Africa on the basis of its poverty and the assistance which Irish Aid provided on an emergency basis over many years.</P>
        <P>The overarching objectives of the aid programme are poverty reduction and sustainable development. We address fundamental human <Col N="1824"/>needs such as food security, basic education, primary health care and safe water supplies.</P>
        <P>We also place a particular emphasis on building good governance. This includes assistance for enhancing parliamentary oversight, building democratic systems of government that are underpinned by free and fair elections, strengthening the rule of law, enhancing respect for human rights, improving transparency and accountability through initiatives to enhance public financial management and building civil society.</P>
        <P>A guiding principle of Irish Aid&rsquo;s policy is that Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the developing world will be based on a spirit of partnership and equality. The governments and peoples of our partner countries are primarily responsible for their own development and will lead the development process. Ireland will offer advice, expertise and assistance but decisions on development planning must, to the greatest extent possible, be locally owned and led.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid Country Strategy Papers are formulated in close consultation with the partner Governments, other donors and various stakeholders in-country. The strategies take as their reference point the partner Governments&rsquo; national development plans, which form the basis on which priorities are made. They are informed by the principles of partnership, harmonisation and coordination, in accordance with the Paris Declaration and the principles of NEPAD. Irish Aid also works very closely with civil society organisations in our partner countries building their capacity to influence and monitor public policy decisions.</P>
        <P>The Irish Aid programme is growing rapidly. The commitment of the Government to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012 presents an enhanced opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of millions of poor people in Africa and beyond. This practical and tangible assistance will also be matched by strong international advocacy for poverty reduction and a fairer global order.</P>

        <Quest> the adoption of a new UN target, under millennium goal five, to achieve universal access to reproductive health by 2015, his Department is taking steps to increase international action on maternal health issues and to develop an Irish Aid Health strategy which addresses the rate of maternal mortality and the unmet need for contraception; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Universal access to <Col N="1825"/>reproductive health is one of the goals of the Programme of Action agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994. The Government is committed to action in support of this goal which is essential to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and is important in tackling HIV and AIDS. </P>
        <P>Limited progress has been made since the Cairo conference in 1994. Reproductive health problems account for 18% of the total global burden of disease and, tragically, half a million women die every year from complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Underlying this tragedy is the lack of access by women, especially in developing countries, to good quality maternal and reproductive health services, including family planning.</P>
        <P>The Government welcomes the new UN target under Millennium Development Goal 5 to achieve universal access to reproductive health. This will provide much-needed impetus to international action to improve women&rsquo;s health and reduce maternal illness and death.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on Irish Aid outlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting the specific health needs of women within our overall approach to health in developing countries. It states that &lsquo;addressing women&rsquo;s health needs, particularly in the areas of basic healthcare and maternal and reproductive health must lie at the heart of an effective overall response to improving health in developing countries&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>A strategy document setting out Irish Aid&rsquo;s policy on health is being finalised. It will address the issues of maternal mortality and the unmet need for contraception. Through its country programmes and support for international organisations, Irish Aid will continue to promote the particular health needs of women, emphasising sexual and reproductive health services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Maternal health is a priority of Irish Aid support for health through bilateral programmes. Funding is provided to support Governments in Ireland&rsquo;s priority countries in sub-Saharan Africa to deliver a package of basic health care, including reproductive health services. Additional support is granted for specific initiatives on maternal health, such as the new midwifery school in Northern Province, Zambia which opened in 2006.  Another example is our commitment of &euro;2.3 million in 2006 to a four-year project in Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawi, which aims to improve the provision of maternal health services by mid-level health workers.</P>
        <P>In addition to this funding, Irish Aid works through several partner agencies in the UN system to address maternal health issues and the unmet need for contraception. One of the main barriers to achieving universal access to reproductive health is the lack of empowerment of women in developing countries. These issues <Col N="1826"/>form the core mandate of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), with which Irish Aid has a close relationship. In light of its important mandate, the Government has increased core funding to UNFPA in the last five years from &euro;1.8m in 2002 to &euro;3.1m in 2006. Additionally, in 2006 the Government made a contribution of &euro;500,000 to the newly established UNFPA Trust Fund for Global Reproductive Health Commodities Security, which aims to ensure that Governments have a constant supply of reproductive health commodities.</P>

	<P>Since 2000, the company concerned undertook two assignments for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In 2002, the Irish and British Governments conducted a joint review of the activities of Encounter, an organisation established by both Governments in 1983 to contribute to improved relations between the two countries. Following discussions with the British authorities, it was agreed that this company would conduct the review in consultation with a firm of consultants in Great Britain. The contract was jointly awarded and it was agreed that the cos t would be shared by both administrations. Our share of the work came to &euro;31,100.60. </P>
        <P>The firm also completed work for the Department in 2004 on economic links with Arab countries in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s overall trade; the cost of this assignment was &euro;9,000 (excluding VAT).</P>
        <P>Given the nature of these assignments and the modest scale of the work and costs involved, it was not deemed necessary to advertise in these cases.</P>

        <P>Since the current round of the programme closed in July, 2000, 57 projects have or are being dealt with &mdash; 23 projects have been completed, 16 are under construction or about to start construction and the remaining 18 are at various stages in the process.  In terms of funding being committed to projects, formal grant approval is given to local authorities following the tender process, when the contract is approved.</P>
        <P>In the case of the 23 projects that have been completed, a balance of &euro;2.1m is outstanding in respect of grants not yet fully drawn down.  In this regard, a contingency of 10% of grant aid is withheld pending final certification of completion by the relevant local authority.</P>

        <P>Under the current round of the programme, the question of the location of public swimming pools was essentially a matter for local authorities.  Projects are considered on a case-by-case basis and consideration is given to such issues as to whether the area is classified as disadvantaged, the number and geographical spread of similar projects within and between counties, the viability of the project, particularly in relation to operational and maintenance issues, overall funding package for the project, technical details and the Department&rsquo;s annual estimates provision for the Programme.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes is a matter for the parties involved.  Dispute resolution machinery is provided to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing a solution on the parties to an industrial dispute.  </P>
        <P>I understand that the Labour Court has considered the dispute referred to by the Deputy and has recommended that the parties should seek to reconcile their differences through an intense process of engagement.   In this regard, I further understand that the parties have agreed to attend talks to which they have been invited by the Labour Relations Commission.  I would encourage all the parties to engage fully in this process and seek to resolve their differences.</P>

	<P>All proper procedures were adhered to in this case and all necessary action was taken.  The person concerned was employed on a short term contract as a Temporary Service Attendant.  His contract was due to expire on 12th May 2006.  His contract was extended until 28th July 2006 to allow for a number of appeals he made in writing and orally.  The Secretary General of the Department, having fully considered the matter, and following legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, confirmed to the person concerned in writing that his contract would expire on 28th July 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have seen the letter referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  The letter focuses on a recent confirmation that members of the Richardsons Fertilisers Staff Retirement Benefits Plan have been deemed eligible for support under the UK Government&rsquo;s Financial Assistance Scheme for insolvent pension schemes.  Accordingly, it appears that members now have the prospect of receiving up to 80% of their pension entitlements.</P>
        <P>At the time IFI went into liquidation, the Richardsons scheme (covering the employees in Belfast) had a significant shortfall and was not in a position to pay active members (i.e. the employees still working at the time the company ceased operations) their full entitlements.   The regulations applicable in Northern Ireland require that existing pensioners are given priority and, as a result, they were largely unaffected by the shortfall in the fund.   It had been suggested that the active members could receive a figure as low as 25% of their accrued benefits.  However, it is understood that this estimate did not take account of any recovery from the liquidation on foot of the claim made by the trustees of the scheme.  I understand that the liquidator, acting on legal advice, admitted this claim and that he has paid out some &euro;7m to the trustees in respect of this claim to date.</P>
        <P>The specific financial position of the Richardsons&rsquo; scheme appears to have arisen primarily from a combination of the statutory rules which applied on the winding up of a pension fund in the UK at the time IFI went into liquidation and a shortfall in the assets of the Belfast <Col N="1836"/>fund compared with its liabilities as a result of the fund trustees&rsquo; investment strategy coupled with a significant fall in the equities market.  New regulations were introduced in the UK in 2005 to enhance the protection for members of defined benefit pension schemes in insolvency situations.  The Financial Assistance Scheme was established to address difficulties arising in schemes prior to the introduction of the new regulations.</P>
        <P>In relation to the employees in the Republic, it is my understanding that the two main schemes covering them had sufficient funds to meet all of the entitlements provided under the scheme, as well as pensions increases of up to 3% per annum.  While staff had hoped to receive some additional benefits, it would appear that the payment of such discretionary benefits was always subject to sufficient funding being available to meet the costs involved.  Against this background, I do not believe that an Exchequer contribution to the pension funds is justified and I have no plans for any such contribution.</P>

        <Quest> the number of IDA led visits by potential employers to the north west region and specifically Inishowen from January 2006 to January 2007; and if he will make a statement on the regional development strategy of the IDA as it pertains to the north west. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In  2006 there were twelve IDA led visits by potential investors to the North West. Seven of these investors visited County Donegal and three visited Buncrana.  IDA Ireland is actively marketing the North West, including County Donegal and the Innisowen Peninsula, for additional investment and jobs through it network of overseas offices. Target sectors that the Agency is pursuing for the region are Medical Technologies; Pharmaceuticals; International Services, including Financial Services, and High End Engineering. Companies in these sectors not alone bring high wage jobs but they have also have knock-on benefits in other sectors such as supply, distribution and transport, thus creating further investment and employment opportunities for local people in the immediate vicinity and surrounding areas.</P>
        <P>I was pleased to announce in March 2006, the establishment of a new enterprise managed service centre (EMS) by AssetCo to be based in Buncrana. Supported by Enterprise Ireland, the project involves an investment of &euro;5.2 million and will lead to the creation of 130 new jobs.</P>
        <P>I am confident the strategy and policies being pursued by the Development Agencies, who are working closely with each other to maximize <Col N="1837"/>investment and job opportunities, together with the roll out of the new National Development Plan, will bear fruit in terms of additional investment and jobs for the people of the North West, including those living in Donegal and the Innisowen Peninsula.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> his plans for business for the provision of employment in business and industry at the Business Park, Askeaton, County Limerick. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for the development of property solutions for enterprise promotion in the Mid West Region lies with Shannon Development. Responsibility for grant assistance to companies locating in the Region is an operational matter for the relevant development agencies. IDA Ireland is the national agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions (incl. Co. Limerick), while Enterprise Ireland is now responsible for indigenous industry in the Mid-West region. Both Shannon Development and IDA Ireland work closely together in the development, promotion and marketing of tailored property solutions throughout the Mid West which includes the Askeaton Business Park.</P>
        <P>The Business Park is a Shannon Development-owned land bank, comprising 228 acres situated on the southern bank of the Shannon Estuary.  The site has been identified as an important site from a business and employment perspective for both Co. Limerick and the wider Region in the Planning and Land Use Transportation Study, the Mid-West Regional Planning Guidelines and the Limerick County Development Plan. The typical investment projects which both Shannon Development and IDA Ireland seek to win are in advanced higher-value manufacturing and services activities (often containing an R&amp;D element) requiring high-level skills, infrastructure and advanced business services. This reflects the changing nature of modern FDI projects whose primary needs can be summarised as follows: a high-quality serviced environment within proximity of a critical population mass capable of providing a skilled workforce, world-class access infrastructure (e.g. road access to key cities, sea ports and international airports), telecommunications infrastructure with multiple broadband carriers and proximity to third level educational institutions including universities and technical colleges.</P>
        <P>The Askeaton Business Park is considered to be nationally significant given its location on the deep-water estuary, proximity to Foynes and Limerick Ports, proximity to urban clusters in Limerick City and Askeaton, railhead access on <Col N="1838"/>the Foynes-Limerick route and its site boundary with the N69 providing direct access to southern ports such as Cork and Rosslare. The completion of the Southern Ring Road and the proposed Limerick Tunnel will furthermore enable direct road access to Shannon Airport for passenger and freight services and will facilitate access to the West and East Coasts including Dublin Port.</P>
        <P>The Askeaton Business Park is marketed through IDA Ireland&rsquo;s network of overseas offices as a location for international export-orientated projects. Ultimately, however, decisions regarding where to locate a project are taken by investors based on a variety of criteria and on the capability of any particular location to support their business needs.  Shannon Development is currently reviewing its strategic options in relation to the Askeaton Land Bank.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a rent supplement to assist eligible people who are unable to provide for their immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The Executive has advised that it recently completed a routine review of the amount of rent supplement payable to the person concerned and that following this review; it has decided that payment will continue at its existing rate. The Executive has further advised that payment of rent supplement to the person concerned was not suspended during the course of this review.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a rent supplement to assist eligible people who are unable to provide for their immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. </P><Col N="1844"/>
        <P Just="Left">Participation on a drug treatment programme does not in itself result in a reduction in support under the rent supplement scheme. However, the amount of rent supplement payable in any individual case is subject to a means test. Payments are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent has an income equal to the SWA basic weekly payment rate, less &euro;13. This &euro;13 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. The regulations governing rent supplement stipulate, that in general, in addition to the minimum contribution, recipients are also required to contribute towards their rent any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate.</P>
        <P>In recent years a number of measures have been introduced in the rent supplement scheme for those wishing to take up either an employment or training opportunity to assist in the transition from welfare to work. These measures aim to be responsive to the needs of those who depend on income supports while providing incentives to assist people to become more financially independent.</P>
        <P>Where a person has an additional income as a result of participation on a training course or from part-time employment the means test for the rent or mortgage interest supplement scheme provides for a weekly &ldquo;additional income disregard&rdquo; of up to &euro;60 per week of additional income with half of any additional income between &euro;60 and &euro;90 also disregarded for means assessment purposes. For those participating in approved training courses, any lunch or travel allowances that are paid may also be disregarded. In addition where a person has additional income from part-time employment which has been deemed by the Executive to be of a rehabilitative nature, up to &euro;120 per week of additional income may be disregarded.</P>

	<P>State Pension (Non-Contributory) is a means tested payment and all income is assessable as means.  This includes cash income, private pensions, foreign pensions, the value of any property (excluding the claimant&rsquo;s own home) and the value of any investments and capital which the claimant may have.  A pensioner is obliged to declare all means, and to inform this Department of any change in his/her circumstances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this customer&rsquo;s case the file was forwarded to the Social Welfare Inspector for the area where the customer resided at that time.  However the Inspector was unable to locate the customer as enquiries showed that he had entered hospital.   Follow-up efforts by the Social Welfare Inspector to interview the customer at the hospital were unsuccessful as he had moved to a nursing home.  Recent enquiries indicate that the customer is now residing in a nursing home nearer to his original residence.</P>
        <P>As a result, the file has been referred to the Local Officer for that area, who will arrange to call to the customer shortly to access his means.  On completion of all enquiries a decision will be made and the customer will be notified of the outcome.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 390 and 391 together.  </P>
        <P>It is Government policy to maintain a viable network of post offices throughout the country and my Department has no policy of assisting in the closure of offices.  In 2006 approximately 39 <Col N="1846"/>million payments were issued to social welfare customers through post offices at a cost of &euro;48 million.</P>
        <P>My objective is to ensure that a wide choice of payment options is available to customers of my Department and that service is continually improved by providing access to an increasing range of payment services.  Customers opt for a particular payment method having regard to their own circumstances.  Currently 52% of overall customers have chosen to receive payment through their local post office, 9% are paid by cheque through the postal system and 39% have chosen to be paid electronically to their bank or building society account.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2006 a total of 851 customers were in receipt of Widow &amp; Widowers One Parent Family payment.  Of these, 194 were paid by Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) to an account in a financial institution, 580 were paid by book at a local Post Office and the remaining 77 customers were paid by Electronic Information Transfer (EIT) using their Social Services Card at the local Post Office.</P>
        <P>All other Lone Parent customers are paid by electronic or manual postdraft and my Department initiated the transfer from book format to electronic payment methods for Widow &amp; Widowers One Parent Family customers with effect from 16th February 2007.  These customers have in the main opted for electronic payment by EFT at the Post Office.</P>
        <P>Payments made to Widows and Widowers One Parent Families by EIT are held at the Post Office and are available for collection for 12 days from the due date.  Where a payment is not collected on time and has been returned to the Department, replacement payment is made by cheque to the person&rsquo;s home address where there is a valid reason for non-collection.</P>
        <P>An added feature of this payment method is that a person can also avail of a Household Budgeting facility.  This is a facility provided by An Post whereby persons being paid by EIT can make arrangements with An Post to pay a regular amount towards various household bills by direct deduction from their weekly payment.</P>
        <P>I know that An Post is conscious of the need to modernize payment systems.  Recent and ongoing development will enable An Post to respond to changes and  innovation in the money transmission market so that it can maintain its position as a leading player in this area of commercial activity and thus ensure a viable network of post offices throughout the country.</P>
        <P>An Post and my Department have been partners in the delivery of social welfare payments since the foundation of the State and there is no reason why this cannot continue, albeit in a changing payments environment.</P>

The case has been referred to the Social Welfare appeals office and, in accordance with the statutory requirements the relevant departmental papers, including a submission from the Deciding Officer, were sought.

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1st May 2004.  It was introduced in the context of the Government&rsquo;s decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the new EU Member States without the transitional limitations which were being imposed at that time by many of the other Member States.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland.</P>
        <P>EU Regulations provide that migrant workers who are EEA nationals, i.e. EEA nationals who have been employed since coming to this country, are entitled to payment of family benefits under the same conditions as Irish nationals and the habitual residence condition does not apply in their case.  Approximately 1550 claims to Child Benefit for some 2200 children have been refused since May 2004 as the applicant did not satisfy <Col N="1848"/>the habitual residence condition, while more than 13,000 claims were successful during the same period.  Those who are refused are mainly persons whose claim to asylum has not yet been finalised, who do not have a work permit or who have a minimal attachment to the workforce in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Asylum seekers are provided with direct provision accommodation and can also avail of exceptional needs payments from the local Health Board for the period that their asylum application is being processed and as a result it is considered that their welfare and that of their children is provided for.</P>
        <P>The operation of the habitual residence condition in my Department continues to be monitored on an ongoing basis.  The reason for the introduction of the HRC in May 2004 &mdash; to ensure that persons who have not worked in Ireland or who have not established their habitual residence in Ireland should not avail of assistance schemes or child benefit &mdash; continues to be relevant.</P>

	<P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. All carers in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative&rsquo;s allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass. It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person&rsquo;s pension. People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel. </P>
        <P>Spouses of travel pass holders may travel on the same journey with their partner at no cost to them. In addition, the free travel companion pass entitles the pass holder to have any one person, aged 16 years or over, to accompany him/her free of charge when travelling. Such companion passes are available to persons who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone.</P>
        <P>The main objective of the free travel scheme is to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active in the community, thereby reducing the need for institutional care. The purpose of allowing pass holders to be accompanied while travelling is to facili<Col N="1850"/>tate further this mobility. The extension of the scheme to allow the pass holder&rsquo;s companion to travel alone would not be in keeping with this objective.</P>

However, where exceptional circumstances create a difference between this projected figure and the return for the previous year (e.g. the number of cattle sold in the last year is different from the normal number sold in the course of a year), or where the method of farming has been changed, such circumstances will be considered.

	<P>The supplementary  welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible tenants in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.</P>
        <P>In order to qualify for rent supplement a tenant must satisfy a number of conditions.  They must be a bona fide tenant, must be habitually resident in the State, must have a housing need and must satisfy a means test.  In addition, the Executive must be satisfied that the accommodation is <Col N="1852"/>suited to the persons needs and the rent payable is within the prescribed limits.</P>
        <P>Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, tenants must satisfy a number of obligations including not engaging in or allowing anti-social behaviour.  Prohibited anti-social behaviour includes behaviour that interferes with other people&rsquo;s peaceful occupation as well as more serious behaviour that causes fear, danger, injury, damage or loss.  Under the Residential Tenancies Act, the landlord must also satisfy a number of obligations including the enforcement of the tenant&rsquo;s obligations.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, in the case of private rented accommodation, anti social behaviour by a tenant is a matter for the landlord in the first instance.  There are a number of avenues open to landlords in such cases, including the mediation service for landlords and tenants operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  If necessary, the landlord may seek termination of the tenancy which, if implemented, would result in the termination of rent supplement.</P>
        <P>If the landlord does not enforce the tenant&rsquo;s obligations, any other person who is adversely affected as a result can bring a complaint to the Private Residential Tenancies Board about the failure.</P>

Accordingly, the issue of cost benefit analysis in relation to proposed expansion projects at Dublin Airport is a matter which falls within the responsibility of the management and board of the DAA. The DAA, of course, are required to comply with the capital appraisal guidelines issued by the Department of Finance and responsibility for compliance with the guidelines rests with the Board of the company.</P>

        <P>Taxes are generally imposed by Government, whereas charges are imposed by airports or airlines. Different airlines have different policies on refunds.

        <P>In 2006, I approved a request from Galway County Council for funding to develop a QBC on the N17 from the Parkmore junction to the junction with the N6 at the Font Roundabout.  However, the County Council subsequently reconsidered its plans, and eventually altered the design to a dualway.  As part of the dualway, the inside lane would be reserved as a QBC. I understand that the County Council is in discussions with the City Council regarding its proposals.  When the Councils have reached agreement on their plans, funding will be a matter to be considered by the County Council, the City Council, my Department, and the NRA.</P>
        <P>Galway County Council has also produced proposals to develop a south-bound QBC on the N17 from the Kinincha junction north of Claregalway to the N18 junction for Oranmore, and is designing a north-bound QBC from the Cregboy junction to the N18.  My Department has agreed to allocate funding for these works in 2007.</P>

	<P>The Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) are charged with researching, developing, implementing and monitoring a co-ordinated response to illicit drug use in their areas.  Each of the ten RDTFs produced strategic plans for their respective regions and they have now begun the process of implementing specific actions identified in those plans.</P>
        <P>In 2006, approximately &euro;4.175m was expended by the RDTFs on around 90 projects.  By and large, this expenditure was in relation to specific initiatives identified in their strategic plans, though they also have a small grants fund of &euro;30,000 each available to them.  It is envisaged that funding will be increased on an incremental basis to achieve the full roll-out of the RDTF <Col N="1858"/>plans, currently estimated to cost &euro;14.1m on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>Overall, significant progress was made by the RDTFs in the implementation of their strategic plans in 2006.  I am confident that they will continue to build on this to achieve accelerated progress, and increased impact, over the coming year.</P>

	<P>The Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) are charged with researching, developing, implementing and monitoring a co-ordinated response to illicit drug use in their areas.  Each of the ten RDTFs produced strategic plans for their respective regions and they have now begun the process of implementing specific actions identified in those plans.</P>
        <P>In 2006, approximately &euro;4.175m was expended by the RDTFs on around 90 projects.  By and <Col N="1859"/>large, this expenditure was in relation to specific initiatives identified in their strategic plans, though they also have a small grants fund of &euro;30,000 each available to them.  It is envisaged that funding will be increased on an incremental basis to achieve the full roll-out of the RDTF plans, currently estimated to cost &euro;14.1m on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>Overall, significant progress was made by the RDTFs in the implementation of their strategic plans in 2006.  I am confident that they will continue to build on this to achieve accelerated progress, and increased impact, over the coming year.</P>

	<P>As I have previously indicated to this House, these regulations have been published and laid before each House of the Oireachtas in draft form.  This was in order to give Deputies and Senators the opportunity to debate the draft regulations and to make suggestions for amendments, if they so wish, before I sign them.  I indicated at the time of their publication that I would also welcome input from Irish language organisations and the wider public.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I had the opportunity to debate the draft regulations with the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on 29 November 2006 and again on 13 December 2006. Both Houses of the Oireachtas approved the draft regulations on the 14 December 2006. Members of the Joint Committee made a number of suggestions for amendment to the Regulations and I am currently considering these and other suggestions for amendment that have been made to my Department.</P>
        <P>In addition my Department has recently written to each of the 660 public bodies that come within the scope of the Official Languages Act giving them the opportunity to make any comments or suggestions on the draft regulations they might wish to offer.   I intend to make a further announcement in relation to these draft regulations shortly.</P>

	<P el="0">The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Community, Rural, and Gaeltacht Affairs was established in June 2002.</P>
        <P>My Department has made available on its website details regarding consultancies (excepting those of a minor value, i.e. less than &euro;5,000 excluding VAT) relating to the period since its establishment in June 2002 up to the end of December 2006. The relevant link, which will take the Deputy directly to these details, is: http://www.pobail.ie/en/CorporateSupport Services/Finance/Consultancies</P>
        <P>Two contracts were awarded during the period June 2002-December 2006 to the company referred to by the Deputy. The values of the contracts were &euro;99,559 and &euro;94,235, respectively. For the Deputy&rsquo;s convenience, I have arranged for details regarding the contracts in question to be sent directly to him at his Oireachtas e-mail address.</P>
        <P>In the case of both contracts, a restricted tender procedure was utilised in line with the public procurement guidelines that apply to contracts with a value above &euro;50,000 and below the threshold for advertising in the Official Journal of the EU.  Both of the contracts in question were in this category of expenditure. The procedure entailed circulation of the request inviting the submission of tenders to at least five suitably qualified firms in each case. Both contracts were awarded on the basis of objective criteria and a comparative assessment of tenders.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was very pleased with the results of the first milk quota Trading Scheme, which I announced last Wednesday. As the Deputy will be aware the scheme has two elements &mdash; a Priority Pool and a Market Pool, the latter functioning through an exchange mechanism.  The Trading scheme allocates some 70% of the total quota offered for sale to the Exchange at which a market-clearing price is computed based on a supply demand model. </P>
        <P>In the first exchange the market price ranged from 11 cent per litre to 23 cent per litre, reflecting the regional diversity of quota demand. The remaining 30% was allocated to buyers who qualified as priority category producers either being successors, lost leaseholders, young farmers or category 1 producers. The price at which the Priority pool was allocated was fixed at a maximum of 12 cent per litre and this price was achieved in all but one Co-op.</P>
        <P>The total amount offered for sale was 121 million litres and a total of 173 million was demanded. Some 73 million litres was sold through the Trading Scheme of which 44.4 million was sold at the exchange or market price and 28.6 million litres was sold at or below the maximum price of 12 cent from the priority Pool.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the exceptional circumstances of the first ever market trading of milk quota in Ireland and the significant learning curve involved for all concerned, dairy farmers and co-ops particularly, this outcome was extremely encouraging. Of course it was but the first of two schemes that will enable the transfer of quota for the 2007/2008 milk quota year that commences on 1st April next. I expect that there will be very significant interest in the next scheme given the additional knowledge now available to buyers and sellers as a result of the first scheme.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances that all parties understood that there would be two schemes available for the next milk quota year I do not propose at this stage to make alterations to the next scheme, which I will announce very shortly after consultations with the main farm organisations and ICOS have concluded.</P>

	<P>The position as regards the welfare and protection of animals is that my statutory responsibility relates to the welfare and protection of farmed animals only and does not extend to other animals. The Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act, 1984 and the European Communities (Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes) Regulations 2006  (SI No 705 of 2006) is the legislation that applies in this area.</P>
        <P>In relation to circus animals, my Department&rsquo;s responsibility relates to ensuring that animals imported for use in a circus are imported in accordance with animal health certification requirements. Licences are issued in accordance with the Rabies (Importation, Landing and Movement of Animals) (Amendment) Orders 1972-1976.   In addition Commission Regulation 1739/2005 lays down registration, passport and animal health requirements in the case of circus animals that move between Member States.</P>
        <P>The Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965 are the principal statutes governing the welfare of animals in this country. The responsibility for pursuing complaints under that legislation rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. On receipt of such a complaint, the Garda&iacute; have a statutory basis on which to investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an act of cruelty against an animal.</P>

	<P>The price paid to milk suppliers is a commercial decision between the supplier and purchaser over which I have no influence. Traditionally, milk has been paid for on the basis of its butterfat content but in practice nowadays, processors test for a number of other constituents, including protein, lactose, SCC and TBC levels when calculating the price payable to any given supplier for the milk. </P>
        <P>I understand that a Co-Op has notified its suppliers that it requires milk to have minimum lactose content of at least 4.2% and that it imposes a price penalty where this level is not achieved.  This is a matter for the Society itself and it is not open to me to intervene.</P>
        <P>As part of the partnership agreement Towards 2016 my Department will extend its monitoring and cross checking of the milk testing regime to include all constituents used for payment purposes and, in consultation with the partners, shall ensure transparency in the milk testing regime.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>A Felling Notice was received by my Department in September 2006 in respect of 81 trees on the lands in question, comprising a mixture of conifers and broadleafs.  In accordance with normal practice the felling site was inspected by the Forest Inspector for the area.  His recommendation was that the trees concerned were over-mature and a felling licence should issue.  His report provides the primary basis for issuing the felling licence concerned and I am satisfied that it represents an accurate assessment of the situation on the ground. </P>
        <P>The Planning Department of South Tipperary County Council was also consulted and they advised that the site was the subject of planning permission granted on 19th October 2005 under the Planning and Development Act 2000-2004. The Council also supplied a Tree Description Table outlining the trees to be removed and to be retained together with a map indicating the location of the trees on site.  Further consultations were also carried out with the National Parks and Wildlife Service who informed my Department that they had no objections to the proposed felling and advised that most of the trees were over mature.  They also recommended that as some of the trees were hosts to an active rookery they should be felled before 1st February 2007 to ensure that nestlings were not affected.</P>
        <P>Following examination of the information supplied, my Department issued a Limited Felling Licence on the 5th January 2007 in respect of 46 trees.  In granting the licence care was taken to ensure that only trees listed for removal under the Tree Description Table supplied by the County Council were included.  Consequently this resulted in the exclusion from the licence of over 40% of the trees applied for.  Furthermore a condition was included in the licence to the effect that any trees referred to as being for retention in Condition 36 of the Planning Permission granted by South Tipperary County Council were to be retained and protected.  The individual reference numbers of the trees concerned were not included in the licence but were clearly identifiable from both the Tree Description Table and the map supplied by the County Council.</P>
        <P>I cannot comment on the accuracy of the tree survey carried out.  This survey was not carried out at the request of my Department, nor did it form any part of the documentation required for licensing.  The survey was carried out in connection with an application for planning permission and was supplied to my Department by the <Col N="1871"/>Council for the sole purpose of indicating which trees it had ordered to be retained. I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the information supplied by the Council but in any case it is matter for the Council to decide, in this instance, which trees it wishes retained.</P>
        <P>As regards the implications of the felling of these trees for water drainage in the area, I would point out that under Condition 4 of the licence all felling operations must be undertaken in accordance with Code of Best Forest Practice and must adhere to the Forest Service guidelines on Water Quality, Landscape, Biodiversity, Forest Harvesting and the Environment.</P>
        <P>Finally any concerns in relation to the suitability of this land for housing development is not a matter which comes under the remit of my Department and is a matter that should be taken up with the local authority concerned.</P>

	<P>While baseline data on the pollution control facilities on Irish farms has been compiled for 2002, I am informed that there is little detailed historical data which could be used for comparison.  However the level of investment over that period, taken together with other developments, is likely to have given rise to a considerable improvement. </P>
        <P>Over the past ten years my Department has provided grant aid of some &euro;225 million for investment in farm waste management.  During the same period the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) has had a significant impact on pollution control and awareness on Irish farms.  REPS has detailed requirements in relation to nutrient planning and the storage and management of organic fertilisers.  The number of farmers currently in the Scheme is more than 59,000 and I expect the numbers to grow further <Col N="1874"/>under a revised Scheme to be introduced as part of the new Rural Development Programme.</P>
        <P>Further improvements in the control of farmyard pollution are likely to result from the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 which were made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in July 2006.  The Regulations address pollution from agricultural sources and include detailed provisions in relation to the storage, management and application to land of organic and chemical fertilizers.  The Regulations form part of the Cross-compliance requirements under the Single Payment Scheme.</P>

	<P>Payments are currently being made under two Schemes of Early Retirement from Farming.  A total of 10,278 farmers entered the 1994-1999 Scheme of Early Retirement from Farming, which closed to new applicants on 31 December 1999.  Under the 2000-2006 Scheme, which was introduced in November 2000 and closed at the end of December 2006, 2,958 cases have been approved for payment to date.  Proposals for another Scheme are included in the draft Rural Development Programme for the period 2007-2013, which is currently with the European Commission for approval.</P>

	<P>I expect that there will be major benefits for producers and consumers in 2007 <Col N="1875"/>arising out of the on-going implementation of reformed CAP and the wide range of measures envisaged under the National Development Plan. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The introduction of the full decoupling of direct payments under the Single Payment Scheme ensures that farmers now have the &lsquo;freedom to farm&rsquo; and that the CAP will be geared towards the demands of the market and consumers.  The Single Payment Scheme is linked to respect of food safety, animal welfare and environmental standards. Farmers will receive payments of about &euro;1.3 billion in 2007 while consumers will be guaranteed a supply of safe food, produced to high animal welfare and environmental standards, at a reasonable cost. In addition, producers will benefit from CAP market supports such as export refunds and intervention arrangements which are implemented by reference to developments in the markets during the year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Producers and consumers will also benefit from the wide range of measures provided for under the National Development Plan which includes the draft Rural Development programme which was submitted to the Commission in December and is awaiting approval.  Total funding of &euro;8.7 billion is provided for the agri-food sector over the period 2007 to 2013.  The objectives are to improve competitiveness at farm level, promote <Col N="1876"/>environmental protection, develop the food processing industry and fund Research and Development.  The overall programme of expenditure is based on my vision for the future of the sector as outlined in the AgriVision 2015 Action Plan.  My aim is to establish an efficient, competitive, consumer focused industry which will contribute to a vibrant rural economy, society and environment. Focusing on the needs of the consumer will be vital to the development of the sector and is a key element of my policy approach.</P>

	<P>Following the introduction of new mapping technology, my Department became aware that the area of some forest plantations currently in receipt of premium payment had been incorrectly calculated.  In many cases, the difference is negligible, but there are other cases where more significant over-claims have occurred. </P>
        <P>This type of discrepancy can happen when different mapping technologies are used. However, my Department is obliged by EU regulation to ensure that it does not continue to over-pay in any instance where it knows that the claim is too high.  Where it identifies such cases, my Department writes to the beneficiary advising that there appears to be an overclaim, encloses a map of the correct area and invites the beneficiary to indicate whether they disagree with the new area.</P>
        <P>All such claims will be paid on the correct basis, going forward, but my Department will not seek a recoupment of any over-payments made in previous years, except where it is clear that this is due to a deliberate intention to mislead.</P>

	<P>The requirement that all bovine animals over 30 months of age, slaughtered for human consumption, must be tested for BSE is provided for in Regulation (EC) No.999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council, laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (The TSE Regulation).  Accordingly I do not have the discretion to raise this age threshold as I would wish to do in view of the major progress achieved here in relation to BSE. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I have been making repeated efforts to have the age thresholds for the various categories of animals changed, based on the results of surveillance carried out here.  Under the recently amended TSE regulation there is provision for a revision to Member States' monitoring programmes (including changes to the age at which healthy slaughtered animals for human consumption must be tested for BSE) on the basis of applications by Member States in response to their improved BSE situation.  Such applications will have to be assessed according to criteria for evaluating the improvement of the epidemiological situation that has yet to be laid down.  The matter is currently under discussion at TSE working group level in Brussels and will take some time to finalise.</P>
        <P>Any request for such changes would require to be approved by the European Commission and the other Member States within the framework of the Standing Committee on Animal Health and the Food Chain.

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The 30-day pre-movement test was introduced in 1998 to curtail the spread of Brucellosis following an upsurge in the disease.  The veterinary advice at the time, which continues to apply, was that the movement/buying-in of cattle was deemed to be a major contributory factor in the spread of the disease and the 30 day test has contributed significantly to the effort in reducing the incidence of the disease, particularly in that it reduces the movement of brucellosis susceptible animals.  A range of other measures was also introduced at the time.  These included the early removal of reactors, the rapid depopulation of herds, the taking of blood samples from cows at slaughter plants, the Milk Ring Test (MRT) (subsequently replaced by the Milk ELISA Test), and the lime treatment of slurry on infected farms on all Brucellosis depopulated farms.</P>
        <P>The impact of these measures has been very positive and very substantial progress has been made since 1998 in reducing disease levels.  The 2006 figures show only 3 herds were depopulated compared with 27 in 2005 and 68 in 2004.  Accordingly, we cannot become complacent about this highly contagious disease and all elements of the programme must be retained in their present form for the time being.  Otherwise, we run the risk of losing the progress made in recent years. I am however keeping the various control measures under review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was very pleased with the results of the first milk quota Trading Scheme, which I announced last Wednesday. As the Deputy will be aware the scheme has two elements &mdash; a Priority Pool and a Market Pool, the latter functioning through an exchange mechanism.  The Trading scheme allocates some 70% of the total quota offered for sale to the Exchange at which a market-clearing price is computed based on a supply demand model.</P>
        <P>In the first exchange the market price ranged from 11 cent per litre to 23 cent per litre, reflecting the regional diversity of quota demand.  The remaining 30% was allocated to buyers who qualified as priority category producers either being successors, lost leaseholders, young farmers or category 1 producers.  The price at which the Priority pool was allocated was fixed at a maximum of 12 cent per litre and this price was achieved in all but one Co-op.</P>
        <P>The total amount offered for sale was 121 million litres and a total of 173 million was demanded.  Some 73 million litres was sold through the Trading Scheme of which 44.4 million was sold at the exchange or market price and 28.6 million litres was sold at or below the maximum price of 12 cent from the priority Pool.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the exceptional circumstances of the first ever market trading of milk quota in Ireland and the significant learning curve involved for all concerned, dairy farmers and co-ops particularly, this <Col N="1881"/>outcome was extremely encouraging.  Of course it was but the first of two schemes that will enable the transfer of quota for the 2007/2008 milk quota year that commences on 1st April next. I expect that there will be very significant interest in the next scheme given the additional knowledge now available to buyers and sellers as a result of the first scheme.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances that all parties understood that there would be two schemes available for the next milk quota year I do not propose at this stage to make alterations to the next scheme, which I will announce very shortly after consultations with the main farm organisations and ICOS have concluded.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The negotiations on a new WTO agreement were launched at Doha in November 2001. While significant progress has been made towards concluding an agreement, most notably in the framework agreement which was reached in Geneva in August 2004 and at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005, the negotiations broke down and were suspended in July 2006. Following a period of inactivity, they resumed again December 2006 in a low-key manner based on discussions in Geneva at official rather than Ministerial level. No significant new proposals have been made by any of the key negotiating partners.  An informal meeting of WTO Ministers from the main negotiating partners took place on the margins of the World Economic Forum in Davos on 28 January at which there was a general commitment to resumption of more formal negotiations. Accordingly, I expect that there will be a full resumption of the negotiations in Geneva with a view to making early progress in the next few months.</P>
        <P>I am committed to an ambitious and balanced outcome to the negotiations. As an open economy dependent on trade Ireland has much to gain from a successful deal. I am concerned that the Commission has indicated recently that it is pre<Col N="1882"/>pared to consider making an improved offer on the EU position, especially in relation to market access or tariff cuts. I remain determined that agriculture must not be sacrificed for the sake of an overall agreement and that, in accordance with the agreed EU negotiating mandate, a new WTO agreement will not necessitate further reform of the CAP. The EU has undertaken CAP reform in preparation for the negotiations and I believe that it has already made a generous offer to reduce trade distorting subsidies and to provide substantial Special and Differential Treatment for developing countries.</P>
        <P>I have consistently outlined my position in the clearest possible terms in the Council of Agriculture Ministers, most recently on 29 January, and I have emphasised the absolute necessity that the Commission remain within the terms of the negotiating mandate. I will continue to work closely with like-minded Ministers in other Member States to seek support for my position.</P>

	<P>The enforcement of all food labelling regulations has been centralised in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  This came about as a result of one of the recommendations of the Food Labelling Group which reported in December 2002.  The effect of this is that it not only streamlines the enforcement measures but it also provides a one-stop shop for any complaints on mislabelling of food.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children has responsibility for the European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs Regulations 2002 (S.I. No 483 of 2002, as amended) which is the main legislation in Ireland dealing with the general labelling of prepackaged foodstuffs.  It also requires information on food labels to be given clearly, accurately and in a language understood by the consumer.  There are many other separate labelling provisions in national and European legislation, such as provisions relating to nutrition, natural mineral waters, novel foods, food additives, food supplements, sweeteners and declaration on price indication, weights and measures and merchandise markings.</P>
        <P>This Department is responsible for more detailed legislation on the labelling of specific food products including beef, poultry meat, milk and milk products, spirit drinks and wines.  The labelling of fish and fish products comes within the remit of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>Labelling inspections are carried out as part of the routine control work of the official agencies. <Col N="1883"/> Food labelling forms part of the Departments service contract with the FSAI.  In this context liaison meetings are held throughout the year between the FSAI and the relevant officials of this Department where any specific areas of concern are addressed.  The FSAI has also provided training for a number of inspectors on food labelling laws.</P>

	<P>I am satisfied that all poultry imported into Ireland is compliant with both EU and National regulations. Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that Member States must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin, including poultry meat and poultry meat products, as well as to imports of these products from third countries.  Under harmonized legislation a series of health and supervisory requirements are applied in the Member States to ensure that animal products are produced to standards that guarantee the safety of food and the protection of human and animal health.  The application of these standards in the Member States is monitored by the FVO (Food &amp; Veterinary Office) of the EU. </P>
        <P>It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, Member States. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU.   The FVO carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
        <P>Import controls form a part of the EU&rsquo;s integrated policy of guaranteeing that the food produced and placed on to the market is safe and that animal and public health is not put at risk.

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Beef must be considered as one of the most robust and successful Irish export industries. This reflects the significant efforts of producers, processors and Bord Bia. In 2006, the Irish beef industry was worth &euro;1.5 billion in foreign earnings to the Irish economy. Ireland is the largest export supplier within the EU and the largest net exporter in the northern hemisphere. Irish companies are major suppliers across Europe and have now the best portfolio of retail accounts of any food sector in Ireland. Continual investment in production and marketing has resulted in Irish companies leading the way in added value beef products that satisfy consumer demand.</P><Col N="1886"/>
        <P>The market position of Irish beef has changed considerably over recent years reflecting the emerging deficit in the EU beef market and an improving market profile of Irish beef in key markets. In 2006, 93 per cent of beef exports were destined for EU markets, which compares to just 50 per cent as recently as 2000. The proportion of exports going directly to retail customers has also increased strongly.  While international markets continue to be important in the market mix, with ongoing efforts to re-open markets and develop trade, the majority of promotional activity has taken place in the EU.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Within the EU, a great deal has been achieved through Bord Bia&rsquo;s Strategy for Irish Beef, which has resulted in a significant increase in market penetration for Irish product in this high value marketplace.  Over recent years that agency&rsquo;s marketing strategy has focused on the development of additional markets, attracting the more discerning customer and solidifying the reputation of Irish beef in the mind of consumers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current phase involves direct consumer promotion at point of sale, encouraging product trial, building loyalty and growing the market.  Promotions include on-pack offers of holidays to Ireland, branded kitchenware, recipe books and calendars to keep the Irish beef brand foremost in consumers&rsquo; minds, as well as extensive point of sale material which serves to make Irish beef highly visible on supermarket shelves.  In September 2005, Bord Bia, in its first ever pan-European campaign, launched a three year, &euro;10 million Irish Beef marketing initiative with a view to growing sales in 8,000 retail outlets. The campaign had the objective of building sales of Irish beef in European supermarkets and establishing the &lsquo;Irish Beef&rsquo; brand in the minds of consumers.</P><Col N="1887"/>
        <P>During the autumn of 2006, the second year of the campaign, on-pack promotions were run in 7,500 stores across nine countries &mdash; Britain, the Netherlands, Italy, France, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Czech Republic and Poland. Thirty supermarket groups, with a throughput of at least 40 million people per week, participated. The promotion was tailored appropriately for maximum impact in each country.</P>
        <P>In 2007, the final year of the current European Beef Promotion programme, promotion will be ongoing throughout the year, in order to take account of the increased de-seasonalisation of Irish beef supplies. Central to the campaigns will be additional promotions with the inclusion of additional retailers and markets, support for new products and listings and concentrating on the premium image of Irish beef in order to build a preference for our product in the minds of consumers.  During 2007 Bord Bia will be in consultation with the industry in order to develop a new beef strategy to build on the position of Irish beef and especially the development of our presence in specialty and niche markets.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s decision, in the context of CAP reform, to opt for full decoupling at an early date took account, among other considerations, of Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  It recognised the fact that agriculture was still the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions (though proportionately a declining one), and that a large proportion of these emissions came from grazing livestock.  The decision offered a clear opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the sector, not alone as a result of the fall in animal numbers but also from the attendant fall in fertiliser associated with the decrease in the size of the national herd.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>My plans for the development of the beef sector can be summarised as follows: Advanced processing methods and product development; Sophisticated and targeted marketing; Efficient farm production with quality assurance; and better scientifically based animal breeding.</P>
        <P>I recently launched a Capital Investment Aid Scheme for the beef and sheepmeat sectors, directed towards preparing the industry to improve efficiency and competitiveness in both primary processing sectors.  The support package, amounting to &euro;50 million, should trigger overall investment of some &euro;120 million.  This investment package will, I am confident, contribute to ensuring the strategic and coherent development of these sectors and ultimately position our producers to avail of export opportunities into the future.  The positive response of the beef and sheepmeat sectors to the challenges presented in an ever-changing market in recent years has been a major contributor to the enhanced status and reputation of Irish produce abroad.  In addition to supporting efficiency and competitiveness for primary processors, this scheme will also underpin agricultural incomes.</P>
        <P>Ireland produces over 500,000 tonnes of beef annually and in excess of 90% of that is exported.  More than half of those exports go to the UK with about 40% going to the high value Continental EU markets.  This excellent result, which is in line with stated policy for the sector, has been achieved largely by effective marketing and promotion by the industry and Bord Bia and the delivery of a high quality, competitively priced product.  The outlook for Irish beef exports is also positive with the decreasing production trend throughout Continental Europe.  The EU is predicted to continue a beef supply deficit of the order of 350,000 tonnes in 2007 with this shortfall offering an opportunity for Irish beef producers to further consolidate their position in this market.</P>
        <P>One consequence of the shift towards the internal EU market over recent years has been a decline in amounts available for export to international markets.  However, third country destinations will continue to be important alternative outlets for Irish beef and I will continue my efforts to ensure that as many as possible of these Third Countries are open to our exports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been welcome developments in this area in, for instance, the re-opening of the UAE market in recent months, though this is currently restricted to animals under 12 months. We are making efforts to expand this category to at least under 30 months. The Deputy will be aware that just last month I personally participated in the important trade mission to the Gulf region which was led by An Taoiseach and the opportunity was taken to raise the issue of the beef trade with the <Col N="1889"/>relevant Ministers in both Saudi Arabia and the UAE during my visit.  The discussions were very positive indeed.  Approaches to other potential markets have also been made especially Japan, China and South Africa.  My Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia will keep up all necessary contacts at official, diplomatic and political level to ensure the maximum progress possible.</P>
        <P>To support the beef sector in responding to the very real challenges it faces on an on-going basis in a very competitive environment I announced, late last year, an Animal Welfare, Recording and Breeding Scheme for Suckler Herds for inclusion in the draft Rural Development Programme 2007-2013. The scheme will encourage suckler farmers to record data for animal welfare and breed improvement purposes and to improve practices in important areas such as weaning, so as to achieve standards in animal welfare and husbandry which will assist not only quality and productivity but also contribute to underpinning competitiveness. A budget of &euro;250 million has been provided with annual payments of &euro;80 per cow, over five years, envisaged for suckler cow farmers who undertake to comply with the animal welfare measures provided for in the scheme.  The Programme was submitted to the European Commission last December for approval.</P>
        <P>In 2007, we are continuing the funding I initiated last year for the significant expansion of our beef quality assurance scheme to ensure that the maximum amount of our production is certified to the highest international standard EN45011.  Funding is also continuing with major advances expected in the beef breed improvement programmes being strategically progressed by ICBF through the use of sophisticated science and technology in this field.  I believe that all of these measures, combined with our high level of food safety standards, will best position the Irish <Col N="1890"/>beef sector to maintain and improve its competitiveness on EU and international markets.</P>

	<P>The extent to which sugar beet growing for the purposes of sugar production has ceased can be gauged from the number of aid applications submitted under the EU temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry. This is a four-year scheme which came into operation as part of last year&rsquo;s reform of the EU sugar regime. The deadline for applications in the first year was 31 July 2006 while applications in the second year had to be submitted by 31 January 2007.</P>
        <P>In the first two years, applications have been submitted in 12 Member States. Details of these applications are given, by Member State, in the following table, which is based on provisional information from the EU Commission.  A number of smaller Member States, namely Cyprus, Estonia, Luxembourg, and Malta are not engaged in sugar production.  No applications have been submitted in the remaining nine Member States.  The EU Commission has expressed disappointment with the level of applications to date and has been alerting Member States and sugar operators of the risks arising from failure to reduce quotas under the terms of last year&rsquo;s reform.  The Commission intends to impose a significant temporary reduction in the amount that can be produced under quota in order to avert over-supply in 2007/2008.</P><Col N="1889"/>

        <P FLI="0">I have no detailed information on the extent to which farmers have switched from beet growing to bio-fuels production in each Member State but efforts are continuing to incentivise the growing of energy crops. Under the EU Energy Crops Scheme, aid of &euro;45 per hectare is available for areas sown under energy crops provided they are intended primarily for use in the production of biofuels and electric and thermal energy produced from biomass. I intend to introduce an additional national payment of &euro;80 per hectare in 2007 as a further incentive for farmers to grow energy crops. The &euro;80 payment will be paid as a top-up to the EU premium of &euro;45 per hectare, bringing the overall payment to &euro;125 per hectare. It is intended that the &euro;80 additional payment will apply for three years and will be subject to a maximum ceiling per producer over the three years. The current maximum area per producer is 37.5 hectares.</P>
        <P>Set aside land can also be used for a variety of non-food uses including the growing of crops for energy purpose and will therefore qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme.  I also intend to introduce a new Bioenergy Scheme for a limited period to encourage farmers to plant willow and miscanthus for use a renewable source of energy. The Scheme will provide establishment grants to farmers for up to 50% of the costs associated with establishing miscanthus and willow on set-aside land and on areas, which have been subject to an application for the EU premium of &euro;45 per hectare. &euro;8 million is being allocated to this Scheme over the period 2007-2009. The scheme details are being finalised and will be announced shortly.</P>
        <P>On the demand side, the recently announced Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme valued at &euro;205m will provide an additional stimulus for the production of energy crops. When fully operational in 2008, it will deliver some 163 million litres of biofuels per year and provide farmers with a stable market to supply feedstock for production of biofuels.   I am confident that these measures will increase the production of energy crops in Ireland and encourage farmers to consider energy crops as an alternative land use options.</P>

	<P>The level of compensation provided under the EU scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry is based on a standard amount i.e. <Col N="1892"/>&euro;730 per tonne of sugar quota renounced. The value of the aid to Ireland is approx. &euro;145m. The Government decisions of July 2006 in relation to the allocation of this aid were based on the recommendations of an independent expert following an open consultation process with interested parties. The EU regulations required that the allocation of aid must have regard to objective and non-discriminatory criteria and ensure an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan submitted by the sugar processor. In preparing its recommendations, the independent expert took account of all relevant factors and undertook a rigorous assessment of the costs and losses accruing to the eligible stakeholders concerned, namely the processor, the growers and the machinery contractors, arising from the restructuring of the sugar industry. </P>
        <P>As indicated in my reply to the Deputy on 31 January 2007, I am not in a position to comment on the value of the accrued assets of Greencore at the time of cessation of the sugar processing industry. In view of the fact that the Government decisions are currently the subject of Judicial Review proceedings before the High Court, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</P>

	<P>Funding is allocated to the Life Centre, Pearse Square through the Fund for the Development of Targeted Educational Responses to Certain Children at Risk (CAR Fund) to provide a programme for young people between the ages of 12 and 16 who are out of the mainstream school system.  This fund is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  The objective of the Fund is to develop preventative and supportive programmes, which are targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion.  A key focus of the initiative is the empowerment of local communities to develop innovative and flexible programmes that address identified needs of intended participants.  The Life Centre is also being supported by my Department through an annual allocation of VEC teaching hours.  A review of allocations to VECs under the Co-Operation Hours with Other Institutions is currently being undertaken by my Department and the needs of the Life Centre will be considered in the context of this review.</P>

A key objective of this action plan is to enhance integration and partnership working both within the education sector and between all other relevant Departments, agencies, organisations and groups.  Under DEIS, my Department, through the network of ten regional offices, is enhancing its capacity to work in partnership with locally based agencies and individuals promoting social inclusion measures.  Measures under DEIS range from preschool interventions, supports for tackling children&rsquo;s literacy problems, reduced pupil teacher ratios, increased capitation grants, measures to tackle early school leaving and strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community.</P>
        <P>A key component of my Department&rsquo;s strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving is the School Completion Programme.  This programme was implemented to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and in line with current thinking favours an integrated cross-community and cross-sectoral approach based on the development of local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process.  It entails targeting individual young people aged 4 &mdash; 18, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.  The programme is funded on a multi-annual basis under the National Development Plan (NDP) with assistance from the European Social Fund (ESF).  Increased access will be provided to the inner city second level and urban/town primary schools in the School Support Programme to provide a range of academic and non-academic supports based in-school, after school, out-of-school and during holiday time, based on best practices identified through the School Completion Programme (SCP).</P>

	<P>The Higher Education Grants Schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.  Under the <Col N="1895"/>Higher Education Grants Scheme an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of at least two years duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution.  An approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course, or courses, which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.  Each Year, the Higher Education Grants Scheme specifies a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the Schemes.  The approved institutions mainly comprise of public funded third level institutions.  In this regard, National Training Centre, Dorset Street, Dublin 7 is not an approved college for the purpose of the Scheme.  There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the student support schemes to private colleges or part-time courses.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department both recognises specific learning disability or dyslexia as a high-incidence special educational need in schools and funds the Dyslexia Association of Ireland.  I have given a very high priority to the provision of resources to address the learning difficulties of children with low levels of achievement in reading.  As the Deputy is aware, my Department implemented a general allocation system in all primary schools in September 2005 to ensure that every school has learning support/resource teaching support available to meet the needs of children with high-<Col N="1896"/>incidence special educational needs, including dyslexia.  There are now over 5,500 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special educational needs, including those requiring learning support.  This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998.  In addition, 4 special schools and 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools specifically support the needs of children with dyslexia with a reduced pupil/teacher ratio of 9:1 and an increased level of capitation grant.  Second level pupils with dyslexia are normally integrated into ordinary classes.  In such situations, they may receive additional tutorial support from the remedial/learning support teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers.  Over 2,300 whole time equivalent teachers support students with special educational needs, including dyslexia, in post-primary schools with 534 of these being learning support teachers.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of assistive technology such as computers to assist children with special educational needs, including those with dyslexia, with their education once relevant professionals recommend the equipment.  Schools can apply to the local special educational needs organiser (SENO) directly for this support.  In relation to funding, my Department has been providing the Dyslexia Association of Ireland with annual funding of &euro;63,500 since 1999.  This funding helps the organisation operate an information service for members and the public.  In addition, part of the funding assists in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association.  Furthermore, a grant is awarded annually to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland towards the cost of their adult education activities.  The activities funded by the grant include literacy training, pre-course assessment, teaching materials and educational and administrative support.  In 2006 a grant of &euro;93,000 was provided to the Association towards this service.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  DEIS will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.  The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate.  The ERC&rsquo;s overall approach was guided by the definition of educational disadvantage in the Education Act (1998), section 32(9), as: &ldquo;the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out by the ERC in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved.  The analysis of the survey returns from primary schools by the ERC identified the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in the School Support Programme.  The variables involved were: % unemployment, % local authority accommodation, % lone parenthood, % Travellers, % large families (5 or more children), and % pupils eligible for free books.</P>
        <P>In the case of second-level schools, the Department supplied the ERC with centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations Commission databases. Based on an analysis of these data, the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the School Support Programme were as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Medical card data for Junior Certificate candidates (including Junior Certificate School Programme candidates);</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Junior Certificate retention rates by school;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Junior Certificate exam results aggregated to school level (expressed as an OPS &mdash; &ldquo;Overall Performance Scale&rdquo; &mdash; score), this was based on each student&rsquo;s performance in the seven subjects in which s/he performed best; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Leaving Certificate retention rates by school.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The identification process was in line with international best practice and had regard to and <Col N="1899"/>employed the exiting and most appropriate data sources available.  A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.  The closing date for receipt of review applications was 31 March, 2006.  The Group submitted a report and the review is now concluded. Schools who applied for a review were informed of the outcome in August, 2006.  Schools which have not qualified for inclusion in DEIS and which are receiving additional resources under pre-existing schemes for addressing disadvantage, can be assured that they will continue to receive support in line with their level of disadvantage.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  DEIS will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.  The new action plan represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multifaceted and more integrated approach.  This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for 3-18 year olds in this country.  Targeting resources at the most disadvantaged schools who are working to counteract educational disadvantage will continue to be a priority for the Government.  Under DEIS I recently announced the provision of 80 new posts to add to the 370 posts already in place in order to extend to Home School Community Liaison service to any of the DEIS schools that do not currently have the service.  In addition, all schools will continue to receive HSCL services after 2006/2007.  HSCL services will continue to be provided to some 650 schools (370 primary and 282 second level schools).  However, following a full review of HSCL clustering arrangements by the Department in the coming year, lev<Col N="1900"/>els of service may be varied in some schools to reflect their levels of disadvantage and size and to facilitate local HSCL coordinators working with families of disadvantaged children across both primary and second level.  As a result of the identification process and subsequent review, 51 primary schools and 11 second level schools in Galway have been included in the School Support Programme.  This is in excess of 20% of all primary and secondary schools in the county which for the school year 2004/2005 stood at 233 primary and 47 second-level schools respectively.  Schools which have not qualified for inclusion in DEIS and which are receiving additional resources under pre-existing schemes for addressing disadvantage, can be assured that they will continue to receive support in line with their level of disadvantage.</P>

The NSAC finding came on foot of an application to establish a new Catholic primary school in Edenderry last year.  This finding was endorsed by the New Schools Independent Appeals Committee.  The latter also emphasised the need for this issue to be addressed regardless of the ethos of any new primary school being established.  An application has again been submitted to the NSAC to establish a new Catholic primary school in Edenderry this September.  Therefore, the Patron of the existing schools has formally been asked to address the issue of reconfiguration in accordance with the findings as outlined above.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 489 and 491 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government has shown an unrivalled commitment to ensuring that children and young people with special needs get the extra support they need in order to reach their full potential at school. We have dramatically expanded investment in special education in recent years and we have improved access to the State examinations for young people with special needs.</P>
        <P>Annotations on certificates only apply in situations where a core area of a subject is not assessed, or where the mode of assessment used has the same effect. This is used to ensure fairness and integrity <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other students who have been assessed in these components, and in order not to mislead the end user of the certificate.  The scheme was introduced following the report of an expert advisory group, and the introduction enabled opportunities to be provided for exemptions where a candidate was not in a position to demonstrate achievement in a core area of assessment.</P>
        <P>When the scheme of accommodations was expanded in 2000 an appeals system was provided for, enabling candidates to appeal decisions within the framework of principles recommended by the Expert Advisory Group. It is normal practice for appeals systems to operate with a clear mandate, and the set of principles adopted in this respect was in keeping with international practice. While the appeal process is generally conducted by means of submission of documentation, in order to ensure minimal disruption and expense for appellants, oral appeals are facilitated where they are requested.</P><Col N="1903"/>
        <P>The policy of awarding bonus marks for Irish in the State examinations was introduced by the government in the 1920s as one of a number of initiatives to promote the study of subjects through Irish, reflecting the Constitutional position of Irish as the first language. This continues to the present day in the context of wider public policy to promote the Irish language, and is a facility open to all students. In such cases the candidates have been assessed in all components of the examination, and the issue of annotation does not arise.</P>
        <P>The recent findings of the Equality Tribunal on the issue have been appealed to the Circuit Court.  I have also asked the State Examinations Commission to re-examine policy and practice in this area.  It is important that our system continues to evolve in line with best practice, promoting high standards of quality and integrity while ensuring access, participation and benefit for all our students. I do not anticipate that changes will be made to practice in this area in advance of the outcome of the review and the findings in regard to the appeal.</P>

	<P>The information is not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy.  In relation to PE facilities throughout the country generally, the PE curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary. Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the physical education programme. A similar situation with sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</P>
        <P>The Department fully recognises the key role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve PE and recreational facilities. The provision of such facilities is an integral part of the architectural design process for new school buildings, extensions and/or refurbishments as is the provision of ancillary accommodation to meet administration and other requirements.</P>

	<P>My Department is managing a focused programme of investment in measures from early education to improve access to and participation in higher education by students from under-represented groups in that sector.</P>
        <P>There are clear indications that the increased investment of resources in this area over the last decade and more is now paying dividends and that targets for participation in higher education that were set in the 2001 Report of the Action Group on Access to Higher Education and the last National Development Plan 2000-2006 have been reached. For example, participation by <Col N="1905"/>mature entrants to full-time higher education has grown from 4.5% in 1998 to almost 10% in 2006. Students with a disability have risen from 0.8% of the undergraduate population in 1998 to<?oasys _jy ?>2.4%. Surveys conducted by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) also indicate that access to higher education by young people from under-represented socioeconomic groups continues to improve. For example, in 2004 between 33% and 40% of young people from the semi- and unskilled socioeconomic group nationally went on to study in higher education compared to only 23% in 1998. These targets will be reviewed and new targets developed in 2007, particularly as linked to the implementation of the new National Development Plan 2007-2013.</P>
        <P>The access programmes of third level institutions are targeting students in the first and second level sector, adult learners returning to education, learners with a disability, members of the travelling community and more recently members of new migrant communities in Irish society. In 2003, the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education was established as part of the HEA to co-ordinate and develop policy and funding measures to improve access to higher education by under-represented groups to all publicly funded third level institutions. A new funding model, being phased in by the HEA from 2006 onwards, will reflect further progress by higher education institutions in improving access for these groups.</P>
        <P>In addition to the very substantial student support measures managed by my Department, including the targeted special rate of maintenance grant, in 2006 the National Office managed the allocation of over &euro;16 million in Third Level Access funding for the direct support of students through the Fund for Students with a Disability, the Student Assistance Fund and the Millennium Partnership Fund. This led to improvements in the timing and guidelines for the allocation of these funds. In 2006, over 2,000 students with a disability received funding from the Fund for Students with a Disability &mdash; an increase of some 330 students (20%) over the previous year.</P>
        <P>The National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education is currently implementing a three-year Action Plan for the period 2005-2007. One of the key outcomes of this plan has been the first national evaluation of higher education access programmes. A practical framework of policies and initiatives that are required for a successful access programme has emerged from this evaluation process. This framework will underpin and inform the work both of my Department and of the National Office and its partners in the higher education sector going forward. Implementation and the monitoring of progress will also be linked to the strategic development and allocation of core funding, including access funding, by the HEA and the allocation of increased <Col N="1906"/>third level access funding through the new National Development Plan 2007-13.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 495 and 497 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in accordance with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students in higher education. This will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administration system which will facilitate consistency of application, improved client accessibility and ensure the timely delivery of grants to those who need them most. This is part of my overall plan to introduce service improvements in the administration of the student grant schemes. These will include guaranteed timeframes for the earlier payment of grants, an independent appeals procedure and more efficient arrangements for handling applications and making payments.</P>
        <P>In addition as you will be aware, major improvements have been made by this Government in both the income limits and the payment levels for third level grants. It has been the practice in recent years to increase the level of maintenance grants annually, at least in line with inflation. In this academic year, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 3% in the ordinary maintenance grant to give a maximum grant of &euro;3,110 in the 2006/07 academic year.</P>
        <P>In addition, the reckonable income limits for ordinary maintenance grants have been increased by 5.3% for the 2006/07 academic year. This increase exceeds the increase in the average industrial wage for the September to September reference period. The top limit for grant eligibility where there are less than four dependent children has been increased from &euro;44,350 to &euro;46,700, ensuring that a significantly higher number of students from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the Student Service Charge of &euro;800.</P>
        <P>Special Rates of Maintenance Grant, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, were introduced with effect from the 2000/01 academic year. This <Col N="1907"/>year&rsquo;s schemes are giving particular priority to addressing inequities in participation of students from the lower socioeconomic groups through both rate and threshold increases in the Special Rates of Maintenance Grant. The annual income threshold for the special rate of grant was increased by 7.18% to &euro;16,748. It is estimated that over 12,500 students in receipt of the special rate element of maintenance grants benefited from an increase in this grant of 22.48%, with the maximum rate for the 2006/2007 non-adjacent grant increased to &euro;5,970. The maximum rate for the 2006/2007 adjacent rate increased to &euro;2,390.</P>
        <P>Under my Department&rsquo;s student maintenance grant schemes, I am committed to ongoing improvements in the student support schemes including increasing the rates and income limits, as resources permit.</P>

	<P>The student charge is levied by third level institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and students services. The student charge is &euro;800 for the 2006/2007 academic year. All students who are eligible for means tested student support have the student charge paid on their behalf by the Local Authorities or the Vocational Education Committees, in addition to any maintenance grant and tuition fee grant they are entitled to. I have no plans to abolish this charge.</P>

	<P>The position is that teaching practice is an integral part of the curriculum for the training of both primary and post-primary teachers and, as such, my Department does not provide special financial assistance for students towards costs associated with teaching practice.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that teacher education programmes provided in approved third level institutions are also approved courses for the purposes of the Higher Education Grants Scheme.  Under the terms of the Scheme, grant <Col N="1908"/>holders who are required to participate in off-campus placement as part of their course of study may have their grant entitlement paid in the normal manner. Accordingly, student teachers who are eligible for grant assistance continue to receive their entitlements while undertaking teaching practice.</P>
        <P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students which are administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees.  The Higher Education Grant Scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.  Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
        <P>An approved third level course for the purpose of the HEG and the VEC Scholarship Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year&rsquo;s duration pursued in an approved institution.  The Schemes outline their respective courses which are approved for grant purposes.  Any student who is eligible to receive a maintenance grant under these Schemes continues to have the grant paid to them during their teaching practice.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department allocates funding each year to third level institutions under the Student Assistance Fund. This fund is available in order to assist students who may be experiencing difficulties in continuing their studies because of financial hardship. The disbursement of this funding is a matter for individual institutions in line with guidelines issued by my Department.  My Department has no plans to introduce an additional scheme of financial assistance, over and above the current provision, in relation to the training of teachers.</P>

Once the CEO has been appointed I would expect that the Board will undertake an assessment of their other staffing requirements.</P>

	<P>A decision was taken by the Trustees of the school to which the Deputy refers that it will close in June 2007. This decision was taken because, in line with demographic changes in the area, the school has experienced a steady decline in enrolments in recent years. Current enrolments in feeder primary schools indicate that this decline will continue. </P>
        <P>In fact, a general decline in enrolments in the area where the school is located has resulted in considerable spare capacity at post primary level. Coupled with the decline in enrolments, the Department was also concerned about the ability of the school in question to offer a broad and balanced curriculum given the relatively small number of pupils enrolled. In all of the circumstances, the Department concurred with the Trustees decision to close the school.</P><Col N="1910"/>
        <P>When it closes, ownership of the school property, which is currently vested in the trustees, will revert to the Department. In the period leading up to the closure, the Department will consider all available options with regard to its future use.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware the home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.</P>
        <P>Having reviewed a number of applications for home tuition, details regarding the qualifications of some of the proposed tuition providers gave rise to concern. The Deputy will appreciate, that as home tuition takes place outside of the normal school framework, there is need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned. The usual requirement is a fully qualified teacher. However, other qualifications are acceptable depending on the individual needs of the child. A comprehensive review of qualifications has taken place in consultation with my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate resulting in a definitive list of qualifications acceptable under the scheme as appropriate to the individual pupils. In this context the clarity that now exists in relation to qualifications should assist the parents concerned in sourcing suitable tutors. My Department has no current plans to compile a data base of tuition providers with acceptable qualifications.</P>

        <P>In the current school year (2006/07) the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy comprises of a Principal and three mainstream class teaching posts, based on an enrolment of 85 pupils at 30th September, 2005 as submitted by the Board of Management of the school. The school also has the services of 2 Learning Support/Resource teacher posts and 1 GCEB post.</P>
        <P>The Board of Management has submitted a report indicating that there were 73 pupils enrolled in the school on the 30th September 2006. The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2007/08 school year will be determined on that figure and in accordance with the staffing schedule for the 2007/2008 school year which will be finalised as soon as possible.</P>

        <P>If an individual applicant considers that s/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, s/he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
        <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department.

In general, the Board has the responsibility to ensure that the school operates efficiently and effectively and also has responsibilities in relation to the action of its employees. </P>
        <P>With regard to the specific case referred to by the Deputy, the position is that, on 13th March, 2006, the Patron of the school dissolved the Board of Management and, with my approval, appointed a single manager to manage the school for a period of six months in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Education Act 1998. This period has been extended by a further 6 month period up to and including 13th March, 2007.  The resolution of difficulties in the school is a matter in the first instance for the authorities of the school. In this regard, I understand that the single manager is making strenuous efforts to resolve the outstanding difficulties at the school having due regard to the rights of all concerned.

	<P>The two primary schools referred to by the Deputy have indicated to the Department that they propose to amalgamate to provide for a single co-education national school to serve the area. Before progressing the project further and in order to ensure that any capital funding allocated to assist in the amalgamation being provided represents optimal use of resources and is appropriate to meet the school&rsquo;s long term accommodation needs, it will be necessary to consider the possibility of utilising the existing school buildings.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently received additional technical information in relation to the existing school buildings from the school authorities. The next step is to have a technical inspection of the existing buildings carried out to determine their suitability. When this inspection has been completed, the project will be progressed in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme.</P>

	<P>The Maintenance Grant Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate courses is administered by the Vocational Education Committees on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>Clause 6.3.6 of my Department&rsquo;s Maintenance Grant Scheme for students attending Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) courses provides as follows; &ldquo;Grants may not be paid in respect of a second period of attendance at the same level for a course approved for the purposes of this scheme, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously. The Vocational Education Committee will have discretion to waive this provision in exceptional circumstances such as serious certified illness.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 538 and 539 together.</P>
        <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978/79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. This scheme has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the Ancillary Services grant.</P>
        <P>The standard rate of grant per pupil under the Ancillary Services scheme has been increased substantially in recent years &mdash; from &euro;102 in 2002 to &euro;145.50 from 1st January, 2007. The amount of grant paid to an individual school is determined by the enrolment in the school.</P>
        <P>The Ancillary Services grant scheme is flexible in nature, giving Boards of Management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial services are provided. The grants paid are not directly linked to any objective pay scales. The level and extent of services provided is a matter for the school authorities who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial services as resources permit. As the secretaries are employees of individual schools, my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.  There are no proposals at present to change this position.</P>

	<P>My Department allocates additional teaching hours to Vocational Education Committees to support the delivery of education programmes in a range of facilities including special schools under the heading Co-Operation Hours with Other Institutions. These allocations are made in response to specific applications which are submitted by the relevant VEC&rsquo;s in advance of the commencement of the school year to which they relate.</P>
        <P>St Brigid&rsquo;s Special School is currently in receipt of 1,350 Co-Operation Hours. Co. Louth VEC has sought an increase of 418 hours in their allocation for the 2006/2007 school year.</P><Col N="1928"/>

	<P>The Department has acknowledged the need for a site for a permanent building for the school to which the Deputy refers.  The site on which the school is currently located is not available, however, a 0.93 acre site adjacent to the school was offered by the owner.  This is even smaller than the current school site and is not adequate to provide a modern purpose built 16 classroom school with the full range of ancillary accommodation which all new schools enjoy. Circa 2.5 acres is the minimum amount of land required.</P>
        <P>Enormous difficulties were encountered in trying to acquire a site in what is a built up urban area. In fact, no suitable site at all emerged under the acquisition process. In the circumstances the Department had to consider other options and was fortunate that the County of Dublin Vocational Education Committee not alone had land that could be developed but was willing to make this land available.</P>
        <P>There are any number of schools up and down the country that start in one location and are permanently located in another. It also has to be remembered that unlike other primary schools, Gaelscoileanna do not have catchment areas and are not, therefore, confined to being accommodated in specific locations although the Department will always try to re-locate schools as close to an original location if this is possible. It is not realistic, however, in a large urban area to expect this to be easily achieved. School communities themselves are usually aware of local land issues so re-locations are rarely if ever a problem particularly when what is on offer is a multi-million Euro investment to ensure that the children concerned have a comfortable high quality learning environment.</P>
        <P>The Department engaged with the Board of Management in this matter which comprises parents&rsquo; representatives among others.  This is the correct protocol.</P>

	<P>The compulsory school starting age in a National School is 6 years of age.  Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools, including decisions on criteria for enrolment and cut off dates for entry. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. </P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</P>
        <P>Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to my Department. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, my Department may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of. The existence of an appeals procedure serves to ensure that schools abide by their enrolment policies.</P>
        <P>Details on appealing decisions on enrolment under section 29 of the Education Act are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the conditions of my Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative is that students who have previously pursued but not completed a course which has not attracted any exchequer funding may be deemed eligible for free fees subject to compliance with the other conditions of the Free Fees Initiative.</P>
        <P>In addition my Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students which are administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees. The Higher Education Grant Scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.  Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
        <P>The decision on eligibility for third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.  These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. <Col N="1932"/> The decision on eligibility for third level and further education grants is a matter for the relevant Local Authority or VEC.</P>
        <P>These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.</P>
        <P>Under the prescribed terms and conditions of my Department&rsquo;s student maintenance grant schemes, grant assistance may not generally be awarded in respect of a repeat period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not funding was previously awarded. However, the awarding body may waive this provision in exceptional circumstances such as cases of certified serious illness.  It should be emphasised, however, that this discretion would generally only be exercised where a candidate is repeating a period of study on the same course.</P>
        <P>However, Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in E.U. Member States and in non EU countries.</P>
        <P>The application form (I.T. 31 Form) to claim tax relief on tuition fees is available from the Revenue Commissioners. Further information is available from ones Local Tax Office or alternatively from Revenue&rsquo;s Internet site at  <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Any general extension to the scope of the grants scheme can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands and priorities within the education sector.  There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the student support schemes to students who have previously pursued a course but not completed it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Educational Psychological Service operating within my Department provides a range of services both direct and indirect which support the personal, social and educational development of all children in primary <Col N="1933"/>and post-primary schools.  As outlined in my reply to the deputy&rsquo;s recent question No. 1718 in this regard NEPS provides access to psychological assessment either directly from the National Educational Psychological Service of my Department or through the Scheme for Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).</P>
        <P>As also mentioned NEPS provides assistance to all schools and school communities that experience critical incidents, informing planning structures within which school authorities can prepare for such unfortunate events and, when requested by such authorities, providing the direct support of local NSPS psychologists.</P>

        <P>NEPS processes applications for Reasonable Accommodation in Certificate Examinations and responds to queries in relation to individual children from other sections of my Department and from specialist agencies.  NEPS also provides a service to children with visual impairment irrespective of the school which they attend.</P>
        <P>Along with other elements of my Department NEPs has had direct in-put into the formulation of my Department&rsquo;s General Allocation model introduced for all primary schools last year, which, supported by the provision of over 600 extra resource teachers, means that children with high-incidence special needs no longer have to undergo an individual assessment before they can get access to extra support.  Psychologists from NEPS are assigned to the recently formed National Behavioural Support Service which is currently structuring a piloting of its activities with a number of schools nationwide</P>
        <P>At a broader level NEPS has provided advice input and expertise from the psychological perspective to the formulation of a range of supports aimed directly at personal, social and educational development of students in Primary and/or Post Primary schools.</P>
        <P>Social Personal and Health Education has been part of the national curriculum in all primary schools since September 2003. It is delivered to children at all levels from infants upwards. It provides particular opportunities to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child, to help the child to create and maintain supportive relationships and to become an active responsible citizen in society.  The curriculum is built around 3 strands and deals with issues such as making decisions, developing self confidence, growing and changing, personal safety, relating to friends, family and others, handling conflict, respecting difference and awareness of bullying.</P>
        <P>All post-primary schools are required to implement SPHE as part of the Junior Cycle core curriculum from September 2003. Its content is comprehensive and it is presented in ten modules which address topics and issues relevant to the lives of the students.  The overall aim is to help develop students&rsquo; confidence and self esteem, and <Col N="1934"/>promote the skills for living, for responsible decision making, and for mental, physical and emotional health and well-being.  Psychologists from NEPs have contributed to major aspects of the above programmes.</P>
        <P>All post-primary schools provide a guidance and counselling service for their students and they receive ex-quota hours from the Department for this provision.  The Guidance programme in schools is designed to offer a range of learning experiences to students in the areas of personal development, educational guidance and career development. Guidance counsellors are qualified to provide personal counselling support on a one to one basis to students where needed.</P>
        <P>NEPS and NEPS Psychologists interface at a number of levels with the Guidance Counsellors, having participated in the National Guidance Forum, meeting on an on-going basis with the National Centre for guidance in education (NCGE) and the institute for Guidance Counsellors (IGC) and engaging with guidance practitioner cluster groups around the country.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 552 and 555 together.</P>
        <P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance.  The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P>In January 2005, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) issued guidelines to the management authorities of all primary and post primary schools on reporting student absences, suspensions and expulsions.  These guidelines <Col N="1936"/>advise that a school must report to the NEWB where a decision has been taken to expel a student. Schools are also required to periodically report to the NEWB on student absences.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2007 include a provision of &euro;9.8 million for the National Educational Welfare Board.  This represents an increase of 20% on the 2006 allocation and of 50% on the 2004 level.  This substantial increase in funding is a clear indication of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk.  The increase in funding for the Board will allow it to expand its services further and increase staffing.</P>
        <P>The Board operates through 5 regional teams, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  A service is provided from 26 locations nationwide.  Staff are deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme.  In addition, the Board follows up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education. Educational Welfare Officers monitor school attendance and work to improve it.  They also help parents that are experiencing a difficulty with getting a school place for their child.</P>
        <P>Since January 2004, 20,000 cases involving students with reported school attendance difficulties have been resolved by the Board.  The NEWB has also written to every family with children of school going age advising them of their rights and responsibilities in relation to education and school attendance and where they can get help.</P>
        <P>The first national data on school attendance has also been collected and is being used to inform the Board&rsquo;s work. In relation to the effectiveness of the service, it is encouraging to note research findings that attendance at school in the areas where EWOs are working intensively improved in 2004/05 compared with the previous year. So, while the NEWB was set up just three years ago, a lot has already been achieved by the service and the Government is committed to strengthening its role even further.</P>
        <P>It should, however, be remembered that the Board is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to improve school attendance and encourage more young people to finish school. In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and services such as breakfast clubs and homework clubs.</P>
        <P>In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently some 490 staff within the education sector with a role in school attendance. Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, in working with parents, promote school attendance and its <Col N="1937"/>importance for success in school. School attendance is a central objective of School Completion Programme with attendance tracking a core feature and one of its preventative strategies.  Access to these services is being increased under the new Action Plan for tackling educational disadvantage, DEIS.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 553 and 554 together.  </P>
        <P>While the specific information sought by the Deputy is not readily available, the two recent investment priorities under the ICT in Schools Programme have been the provision of networking grants to schools and the Schools Broadband Access Programme.  Schools were invited to submit proposals for the development of their networking capability in June 2004 and grants totalling some &euro;23m have since issued to schools.</P>
        <P>The roll-out of broadband connectivity to all recognised schools is being undertaken in partnership with industry, in the context of the joint Government &mdash; IBEC &mdash; TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) three year Agreement to fund local connectivity at school level.  The broadband connectivity is being provided via a Schools National Broadband Network supported by HEAnet, in order to provide managed Internet access, email, security controls and content filtering.  A broadband support service is being managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network.  The overall costs of the Schools Broadband Access Programme, including the initial set-up and ongoing costs over the three years, are in the region of &euro;30m.</P>
        <P>A further &euro;25m has been provided in grants to some 500 post-primary schools to enable them to upgrade their facilities to enable them to provide the new Technology syllabus and the revised Design and Communication Graphics syllabus at <Col N="1938"/>Leaving Certificate level, with effect from September 2007.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the benefits that good use of ICT can bring to our children&rsquo;s education and I am conscious of the need for further investment to realise the full potential of integrating ICT into teaching and learning and I intend to publish a comprehensive new ICT strategy this year covering the period of the new National Development Plan to 2013.</P>

Kildare.  The number of staff to be relocated to Newbridge is 200.</P>
        <P>The arrangements regarding the assignment of staff who wish to remain in Dublin are decided, in the first instance, by the Department of Finance. My Department complies with any such arrangements.</P>
        <P>To date, 20 of my Department&rsquo;s staff have volunteered for assignment to the Central Statistics Office, Swords; the Courts Service, Smithfield; the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the civilian area of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been facilitated in this regard. My Department will continue to make every effort to ensure that staff remaining in Dublin are relocated as near to the area of their choice as possible.</P>

        <P>With regard to distance travelled by members of the Government on Air Corps aircraft in 2006, I am advised that the Air Corps does not use this method to calculate aircraft utilisation. Instead, aircraft usage is recorded as hours flown.

	<P>A preservation order under section 8 of the National Monuments Act, 1930 (as amended) placed on Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 17 Moore Street was laid before each House <Col N="1944"/>of the Oireachtas on 25 January 2007. The preservation order applies section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930 (as amended) to No. 16 Moore Street. Under these provisions, any person, including the owner of the national monument, is required by law to apply to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for prior written consent before undertaking any works affecting the national monument, including disturbance of the ground within, around or in proximity to it.  Before giving any such consent the Minister must consult with the Director of the National Museum of Ireland.</P>
        <P>A person who contravenes this provision of the National Monuments Acts is guilty of an offence and liable, upon conviction, to substantial fines or terms of imprisonment.</P>
        <P>The protection and upkeep of No. 16 Moore Street continues to be the responsibility of the building&rsquo;s owner.  More specific measures for the protection and possible enhancement of the building in the context of proposals to re-develop the area in which the building is located are a matter to be considered further in the light of the outcome of legal proceedings currently before the Supreme Court.</P>

	<P>The EU Nitrates Directive aims to protect all waters against pollution from agricultural sources.  Particular care is required for the protection of public health in the case of waters which serve as the source of drinking water. The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 implement the Directive in Ireland and provide statutory support for good agricultural practice to protect waters against pollution from agricultural sources.</P>
        <P>The Regulations include a prohibition on the application to land of organic fertilisers where the ground slopes steeply and where taking into account factors such as proximity to waters, soil condition, ground cover and rainfall, there is significant risk of causing water pollution.  The Regulations also prohibit the application to land of organic fertiliser or soiled water within specified distances from drinking water abstraction points: in general the specified distance for larger sources is 200 metres and for smaller water sources is 100 metres.  These distances are measured from the actual abstraction point.  The specified distance from the edge of a lake is 20 metres. These general prohibitions are considered essential for the protection of sources of drinking water.  However, under Article 17(5)(a) of the Regulations provides that a local authority may, in the case of any particular abstraction point and following consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, specify an alternative distance where, following prior investigations, the Agency is satisfied that it is appropriate for the protection of waters being abstracted at that point.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 571, 580 and 586 together.</P>
        <P>Part H of the Building Regulations (Drainage and Waste Water Disposal) sets out the requirements for the treatment of effluent from wastewater systems. The relevant Technical Guidance Document H (TGD-H) provides guidance on how to comply with the requirements of Part H.  TGD-H calls up the following standards:</P>
        <P LI="1">(1) Septic tanks serving single houses: Irish Standard Recommendations SR6 of 1991 for Domestic Effluent Treatment and Disposal from Single Dwellings, issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI); and</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) Septic tanks serving groups of houses: British Standard B.S. 6297: 1983 (incorporating amendment No. 1 of 1990), a Code of Practice for the Design and Installation of Small Sewage Treatment Works, issued by the British Standards Institution (BSI).</P>
        <P FLI="0">TGD-H also acknowledges that waste water treatment systems other than septic tanks may be <Col N="1947"/>used. Such systems are accepted as satisfactory provided it can be shown that they are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are used. Part D of the building regulations (Materials and Workmanship) specifies alternative ways of proving compliance, including compliance with appropriate product standards or being subject to certification by an appropriate national certification body.</P>
        <P>The Irish Agrement Board (IAB) is the national and European recognized body for certifying new building products or systems for which national standards do not exist.  The IAB is an independent body which operates under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>A new European Standard (EN 12566-3), for small wastewater treatments plants has been introduced and is now in the transitional phase of implementation. The need for new systems to comply with this standard has been brought to the attention of local authorities by Departmental Circular Letter BC16/2006 dated 8 November, 2006.</P>
        <P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently finalising a revised edition of their Manual on Wastewater Treatment Systems serving Single Houses, in consultation with all interested parties. It is understood that the EPA Manual will refer to relevant European Standards and that the NSAI propose to withdraw SR6: 1991, in favour of the proposed new edition of the EPA Manual, when available.  My Department plans to amend TGD-H, to call up the EPA Manual and to consider any related issues at the time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Minimum frequencies for the monitoring of water supplies are set out in the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2000.  These Regulations transpose the provisions of EU Council Directive 98/83/EC on the quality of water intended for human consumption.  Under the Regulations sanitary authorities are responsible for the monitoring of drinking water supplies. Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, it is a matter of the manager of each local <Col N="1948"/>authority to make such staffing and organisational arrangements as may be necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he/she is responsible.</P>
        <P>The recently published EPA report on Drinking Water Quality in Ireland 2005 indicates that there was insufficient monitoring of water supplies by certain sanitary authorities in 2005.  In the case of Limerick County Council the report states, inter alia, that there was no monitoring carried out in 28 public group water schemes and 11 private group  water schemes.</P>
        <P>The funding provided to local authorities through general purpose grants from the Local Government Fund has greatly increased in recent years.  The 2007 general purpose grant I have allocated to Limerick County Council is some &euro;26.1m, an increase of 8% on the corresponding amount provided to the Council in 2006.</P>
        <P>It should be a priority for all local authorities to meet their statutory obligations in an area as important as the quality of public water supplies. I propose, therefore, to strengthen the statutory controls to underpin comprehensive supervision and monitoring regimes for both local authority and group water scheme supplies.  The Water Services Bill will introduce a licensing system for group water scheme supplies, under local authority supervision. The Bill will also amend the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 to provide for supervision of local authority supplies by the EPA.</P>
        <P>As an interim measure, I intend to strengthen the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations, pending the introduction and implementation of the planned new arrangements under the Water Services Bill.  Revised Drinking Water Regulations, which I propose to make in the coming weeks will provide for supervision of local authority supplies by the EPA.  Local authorities will continue to be responsible for supervising group scheme supplies, but all monitoring programmes will in future be subject to approval by the EPA.  The EPA will in turn be required to supervise the performance by local authorities of their monitoring functions.   These provisions will considerably strengthen the level of monitoring and enforcement in relation to drinking water supplies, and should ensure adequacy and consistency in monitoring performance across the country.</P>

	<P>The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006, enacted in December 206 provides for postal voting facilities for prisoners.</P>
        <P>Detailed guidance and application forms in this regard were issued by my Department to all registration authorities on 11 January 2007, including guidance on implementation of the statutory requirement on authorities to give public notice of the new facilities during the period from 19 to 26 January; as part of this process, application forms with accompanying explanatory notes have been made available in all prisons. This material also issued to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for transmission to the Prison Service who are responsible for practical implementation of the new arrangements within the prisons, including the designation of relevant officials to perform specified functions in the registration and voting processes. In addition, to ensure that the new arrangements were publicised as widely as possible, my Department placed prominent advertisements in the main national newspapers on four dates in advance of the public notice period: on Saturday and Sunday 13 and 14 January and on Wednesday and Thursday 17 and 18 January.</P>
        <P>The latest date for receipt of applications for inclusion on the 2007/2008 prisoners postal voters list is 14 February 2007.   Registration authorities are responsible for compiling the register of electors and they will notify prisoners of decisions on applications when they have been fully considered.  Details of the numbers of prisoners on the 2007/2008 postal voters list will be available in due course.</P>

	<P>The power of planning authorities to make a Special Amenity Area Order, subject to confirmation by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, derives from section 202 of the Planning and Development Act 2000-06.  This permits a specified area to be declared an area of special amenity by reason of: its outstanding natural beauty; or its special recreational value; and having regard to any benefits for nature conservation.</P>
        <P>Such an Order may state the planning authority&rsquo;s objectives in relation to the preservation <Col N="1954"/>or enhancement of the character or special features of the area, including objectives for the prevention or limitation of development in the area.  Substantially similar provisions operated in earlier planning legislation, under which a number of Special Amenity Area Orders have been made.</P>
        <P>A Special Amenity Area Order does not necessarily preclude development of lands included in the Order.  However, planning decisions must take into consideration the objectives for the prevention or limitation of development, as set out in the Special Amenity Area Order.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>To address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic, designated facilities are being provided on a temporary, once-off basis by local authorities where farmers may deposit stockpiled farm film plastic and silage wrap.  This arrangement operated on a pilot basis in the first instance in counties Galway, Clare, Mayo, Offaly and Waterford during June and July of last year.   This service is free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities is being made available from my Department through the Environment Fund.</P>
        <P>The collections were well supported by farmers in the counties participating in the pilot phase, leading to large quantities of plastic being deposited at designated sites. A significant finding from the pilot scheme is that it is not possible to operate collections in a large number of counties at the same time due to capacity constraints on the part of recovery operators.  Accordingly, it <Col N="1957"/>was necessary to roll out the scheme to other areas on a staggered basis.  Arising from a comprehensive examination of the information available, I approved further collections of waste silage / bale wrap by Leitrim, Roscommon, Carlow, Longford, North Tipperary and Wicklow County Councils which recently concluded.  Announcements regarding further extensions of collections to other areas, including Westmeath, will follow a review of this second phase of the scheme.</P>
