      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday in reply to a question, the Taoiseach played down the extent of drug abuse throughout the country.  Today I would like to ask him about a report published by UNICEF Report Card 7, Child Poverty in Perspective: An Overview of Child Well-being in Rich Countries.  This report indicates that 20% of children under 16 smoked cannabis in the past 12 months.  I have been dealing with parents, teachers and boards of management for a long time and there is a growing concern about the toll being taken on young people&rsquo;s development by the abuse of drugs and alcohol in a growing number of second level schools.  I know this is a matter of concern to the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>Some weeks ago I suggested that where, on a voluntary basis, boards of management, parents and students in particular schools wish to introduce random alcohol and drug testing, the Department of Education and Science should support such a scheme and where necessary provide facilities and counselling support.  I have spoken to many teachers who are experiencing increasing difficulties with some pupils, particularly as a result of drink and drugs.  In view of the specific reference in the UNICEF report to the abuse of drugs at second level, would the Taoiseach support a voluntary scheme for random drug and alcohol testing in second level schools where teachers, parents and students want such a scheme to be implemented?  They would send out the message &ldquo;in our school, you don&rsquo;t do this&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I made yesterday was that the level of drugs is played up when there is much statistical evidence that the national drugs strategy campaign has enjoyed success. </P>
        <P>Deputy Kenny is suggesting a voluntary scheme in schools and if we are dealing with minors, the agreement of parents is necessary.  If the parents, the board of management and the children agree, however, it is a matter for the board of management to decide, as is the case <Col N="1114"/>with any disciplinary code.  Any indication that it would be compulsory would lead to difficulties.  The Deputy did not say that but when I was asked about this before, I said that if minors were to be asked to undergo any testing, it would have to be done with the agreement of the parents.  It is a matter of discipline for the school authorities to agree with the parents.</P>
        <P>I asked last week if any reports had been published on this but I could not find any school operating such a system.  If the Deputy has information about any school he wants to give me, I will look at it.  There are several schemes where schools and boards of management are trying to deal with under age drinking and many of them have disciplinary codes that do not involve random testing  but involve checks to monitor and control under age drinking.  I could not find any schools checking for drugs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is correct that there must be parental consent when dealing with minors.  I am talking about a scheme on a voluntary basis where there is agreement from boards of management, parents and students.  Several private schools do this and I have looked at the analysis of the facility in Kent which appears to be successful and which is catching on.</P>
        <P>In a case where a board of management, parents and students discuss this and say they are happy to have a random alcohol and drug testing programme for the school, will the Department of Education and Science support that process by perhaps supplying the facilities necessary to carry out random testing?  If cases are discovered where drugs have gone beyond experimental use, could counselling facilities be provided?</P>
        <P>The UNICEF report, in respect of alcohol and cannabis for young people aged 11, 13 and 15, makes the point that regular cannabis use is associated with depression, physical ill health, problems at school and other forms of risk taking.  It may also trigger psychosis, especially in young people already prone to such conditions.  When schools decide to establish a voluntary programme by agreement with the boards of management, parents and pupils, will the Department of Education and Science support that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As a rule, anything that helps to curb under age drinking or misuse of drugs in any form would have my support.  I do not know the extent to which Deputy Kenny thought this through, although I generally support what he is saying, but he continually mentioned random and voluntary checks.  A random check of its nature is not voluntary in the normal way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>Free consent could be given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If a board of management&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Six or eight pupils in a school could be picked.</P>

	<P>The Deputy has made his contribution and should allow the Taoiseach to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the board of management, the school authorities, the parents and the children agree &mdash; in these cases as the children are minors their parents would need to agree &mdash; it would be something we would be in support of.  However, one would need to clarify how random it would be.  Normally in our laws, cases or protocols random and voluntary are two separate things.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is like selecting Nos. 3, 12 and 13 from the Dublin team.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>

	<P>It is like breath testing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Already in education and community needs there is the rehabilitation for drug misusers, which has become a central part of focus in education.  There is a range of available treatments, particularly now the treatment options for cocaine, which is a major problem in some communities.  There are the needle exchange programmes, the reduction services, the emerging needs fund that was devised to provide a flexible and community level response regarding drug misuse, and the local drugs task force, which is a very good scheme and is used very effectively.  There are now more than 65 community-based projects being funded under the emerging needs fund, which are nearly all helping young people &mdash; they are not in schools, but in communities surrounding schools.  There is the drugs awareness programme &mdash; the initiative by Crosscare &mdash; which is partly funded by the Government.  It provides invaluable contacts and covers addiction counselling and treatment support around the State.  Again it is focused very much on young people of school going age.</P>
        <P>There is the health promotion unit, which already publishes a guide for parents on understanding drugs, which is the document the support programme of the Department of Education and Science uses.  It is freely available and is accessible on the Internet.  It is used by boards of management and schools around the country.  It is a good programme.  I cannot comment if some private schools are using it.  The concept of anything that helps to eliminate and control drugs is one I support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach or any member of his Government have any appreciation of the impact of rising prices at the moment?  Did the Taoiseach look at the CSO figures quoted in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> today, which show that food prices have increased by 16%?  The article states that 37 of 50 items in the shopping basket have increased &ldquo;substantially&rdquo;.  On <Col N="1116"/>top of that the <i>Irish Independent</i> quotes IBEC&rsquo;s predictions for the future.  It believes that shoppers are likely to be hit with massive increases for the cost of basic food and that bread, breakfast cereals, fruit juices and canned foods are set to rise in the coming months, with some items to increase by as much as 20%.  Food has already increased by 16% and we have those projections for the future.  We have had a 23% increase in gas prices and a 12% increase in ESB charges.  Bus and rail fares, toll charges and domestic waste collection charges have increased.  The European Central Bank has in effect promised that next month there will be another hike in interest rates.</P>
        <P>Is the Taoiseach concerned about the recently concluded pay agreement, which gave a pay increase of 10% over 27 months, with the first phase being 3% and the second phase 2%, given the prices environment in which we are operating?  Can he explain why both he and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment told us that after the striking down of the groceries order food prices would fall?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>When I heard the Minister, Deputy Martin, say that the prices of the shopping basket over the year would fall by somewhere between &euro;500 and &euro;1,000, I should have known that the opposite would have been the case.  He is one of these Ministers who, so long as his tie is straight and the script is available from the spin-doctor, out he goes.  Anything at all comes off the top of the head.  The impact has been the opposite.  Given the Taoiseach&rsquo;s income and that of the tired band on his front bench, does he have any appreciation of the impact of these increases on ordinary people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on average industrial earnings?  This spate of price increases has resulted in a 4.9% rate of inflation.  Does the Taoiseach agree with those commentators who suggest that this month inflation could rise to as high as 6%?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If I have a few moments silence I will answer Deputy Rabbitte.  There has been an upward trend in inflation for the past four or five months and it could go up for at least another one.  That is the projection of the CSO.  I am not going to make a guesstimate on what that figure will be precisely.  The second point is that under Towards 2016 we have revised the anti-inflation group, which did a very successful job in 2003, when it ran a campaign centred on controlling prices in 2003.  The same model and arrangements that were used in that period are already in place.  The group that is dealing with this, containing a cross-section of Departments and the social partners, has already had meetings with most of the groups involved, including the consumer prices section of the Competition Authority.  It will meet the energy regulator next week and is pressing for a range of initiatives in areas with the support of the Government, which I believe will have an effect.  I do not believe it will have a detrimental effect on the Towards 2016 agreement.</P>
        <P>The inflation rate either for the calendar year 2006 or for the year to date is just over 4.1%.  Half of the increase for the last year was in two areas &mdash; energy and various interest rate increases.  The interest rate increases by the European Central Bank have had a knock-on effect and we will probably get another one in March.  Markets have already discounted another 0.25% increase in March and perhaps even again later in 2007.  If those increases are excluded, which is what the markets have been doing, it is 2.1%.  So the inflation rate for the year has been 2.1%, excluding those two initiatives.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Rabbitte knows the regulator has had a change of heart on the energy issues.  Even though the Government had compensated those on welfare, there have been a number of decreases.  That is good and they will take effect.</P>
        <P>The groceries order was repealed a year ago, on 20 March 2006.  Many of the increases now forecast are as a result of external influences as IBEC has pointed out.  There have been a number of problems with fruit.  The prices of fruit have gone up because of poor fruit harvests last <Col N="1118"/>year.  There have been increases in international commodity prices, such as oil and wheat.  There has been a large increase in the price of wheat, which obviously has been passed on.  These are not factors within the control of the Government and have certainly nothing whatsoever to do with the removal of the groceries order.  The impact of these factors on food costs underlines the importance of competition in the market place.  I pointed out to Deputy Rabbitte yesterday, in reply to another question, that in certain areas the lack of competition has led to increases of<?oasys _jy ?>8%.  According to the most recent CSO figures the price of items previously covered by the order, the so-called groceries order goods, decreased by 0.5% in the month.  Since April of last year, the first month following repeal of the order, the prices for goods that used to be covered by the groceries order are down 1.6%.  Therefore, Deputy Rabbitte is factually incorrect.  These items are at their cheapest since December.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>According to Dublin City pensioners they have increased by 15%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The <i>Irish Examiner</i> got it wrong again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Not for the first time Deputy Rabbitte is shopping in the wrong shop.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The House will accept that it is the CSO that decides these issues, not others.  The items are down 1.6% and are at their cheapest level since December 2002.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is positive thinking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the Consumer Strategy Group report clothing prices decreased significantly in recent years.  Items not previously covered by the groceries order declined by 0.1% in December but have, however, increased by 2.3% since removal of the order in March.  These include mainly fresh meat, fish and vegetables where the real prices are historically more variable due to a less constant cost production.  That is straight from the CSO.   </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is comforting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The combined groceries order and non-groceries order items declined by 0.1% in December and have declined by 0.3% since March.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know what the Taoiseach&rsquo;s diet is made up of but we run through the prices as before and after the groceries order.  Beef is 10.2% higher, lamb 6.6% higher, pork 1.8% higher&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Power, is going to join the Green Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is one of the most imaginative things to emerge from that side of the House this year.  Fish is 24% higher.  I do not think the Taoiseach understands what is going on.  He speaks about energy prices.  A barrel of oil costs $52, the lowest price in 19 months.  Anybody who has to go into the petrol forecourt will know that has happened.  I know that the Taoiseach and none of the comedians beside him has had to go near a petrol forecourt for a long time so that they do not have any idea of the situation confronting the average taxpayer and the average citizen.  How can the Taoiseach seek to deny the facts before his eyes in terms of the cost of living?  Inflation, according to his own figures, is officially 4.9%.  That Ireland is the most expensive country in the eurozone area is something the Taoiseach ought to know excludes some of the items he tried to include.  I asked the Taoiseach what action he proposes to take on this issue.  He said various meetings are lined up and that he will meet the regulator and so on.  When answering a question in the House recently the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, made clear that he had no intention of changing the position where the regulator makes his decisions once a year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach saying that position has changed?  Does he intend to take any action having regard to the fact that people have settled for pay increases of 3%, first phase, and 2%, second phase, while the reality is that the <Col N="1120"/>European Central Bank has promised to increase interest rates again in March? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Taoiseach to deal with the reality of the figures from the CSO.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>CSO figures are the figures we use so let us not try to use other figures.  The CSO figures are the basket of figures we use for measuring inflation.  I said at the outset that the figures were up for the past five or six months and that half of the increase, excluding energy and interest rates, 2.1%,  is the rate of inflation.  The price of the overall basket of food items has been very low.  I gave the facts yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>When did the Taoiseach last go to the supermarket and fill up?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to reply without interruption, please.  Out of courtesy to her Leader, at least allow him to hear the answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is 2.1%.  The regulator has decided to do the same as the airlines and other groups have done.  I am not sure if the Labour Party supplies Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s car but the Government supplies mine.  When I was on holidays last August the price of petrol was &euro;1.25 per litre whereas it is now 99c in competitive garages.  That is a big decrease.  The regulator has taken that into account as well.  Yes, the barrel of oil has doubled in price but I hope the Deputy is not asking me to control the price of the barrel of oil on the international markets.  The CIE group asked for a 10% increase but was given a 2.75% increase which is below the rate of inflation.  There are difficulties in some areas.  In the three items highlighted in the figures, wheat items, fruit and fish, there have been huge increases.  I am not denying that.  The overall price has been relatively low.  I would not in any way denigrate the actions and the efforts made by the social partnership group who, three years ago, did a good job, with the backing of a campaign funded by the Government, and put pressure on the various interests to keep prices down.  As I said yesterday, for IBEC and others there are areas where there is a lack of competition and with the assistance of competition in those areas we could get further increases.  The end point is that inflation, excluding energy and interest rates on all of the food items which represents everything else is at 2.1% which is very favourable in international trends.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach filled with embarrassment this morning over the mess into <Col N="1121"/>which, by the privatisation of the national airline, he has plunged Aer Lingus workers who have felt obliged to vote by 95% to take industrial action to repel a very wide-ranging assault on their income and conditions?  The Taoiseach sold out Aer Lingus workers, he threw them to the wolves on the international Stock Exchange when he refused to invest in the national airline.  He and the Minister for Transport made reassuring noises at the time that workers&rsquo; wages and conditions would be secure.   Only months later, the management of privatised Aer Lingus is arrogantly and unilaterally breaking agreements and imposing wide ranging attacks on workers&rsquo; wages and conditions.  </P>

      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>They have already imposed yellow pack contracts on new entrants, to be extended to all existing employees.  Only last September, a letter to SIPTU signed by both the chairman and chief executive stated that following flotation, Aer Lingus will continue to adhere to all existing collective agreements and continue with existing consultative and negotiating arrangements in accordance with agreed practice and legislative requirements.  The letter also stated that &ldquo;continuous improvement in efficiency, productivity and cost-effectiveness will be achieved through a process of consultation and agreement between management and the signatory Trade Unions&rdquo;.  A few months later, that piece of paper might as well be flying all over Dublin Airport in the slipstream of Aer Lingus jets.  </P>
          <P>In 2005, when the GAMA and Irish Ferries exploitation scandals were exposed, the Taoiseach at least verbally opposed a race to the bottom in terms of workers&rsquo; rights.  Now this company of which he, as Head of Government, still owns 25%, is pushing workers&rsquo; conditions towards the bottom and adopting one of the fundamentals of the race to the bottom, which is anti-trade union action without negotiation.</P>

	<P>There has not been a word of objection from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  The lambs on the Fianna F&aacute;il back bench could not even manage a bleat of opposition.  What is the view of the Government with regard to Aer Lingus tearing up these agreements and attacking its workers&rsquo; rights and conditions in this way?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The company is in active negotiations with IMPACT and the Irish Airline Pilots Association, IALPA, in respect of the proposed changes it is seeking to receive.  It has not been possible to progress discussions with SIPTU and <Col N="1122"/>the craft unions.  On Monday, IMPACT commenced participation in a facilitation process at the Labour Relations Commission.  The union is participating with the National Implementation Body and it is also understood that the company proposes to write to the LRC to request that the entire matter be referred to the National Implementation Body with a view to avoiding industrial action.  Obviously, I hope that can be achieved.  </P>
        <P>On 1 December 2006, the Aer Lingus unions were provided with a detailed presentation by the company of its plans for continual improvement into this year.  The proposed changes in work practices are based on findings of a recent benchmark study, which found practices and costs at Aer Lingus to be outside industry norms in a number of areas when compared with other airlines and that there is a need to reduce staffing and other costs and increase productivity.  This is obviously what one would expect the management of a company to be doing for it and one would expect the workers to be protecting their interests.  They are involved in negotiations and I wish them well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a disgraceful reply.  The Taoiseach did nothing more than read what could be the Aer Lingus management&rsquo;s press statement.  How can workers take anything seriously when they are supposed to begin from the point of view of accepting a complete tearing up of agreements and reassurances that were given by the very top management only a matter of months ago?  The Taoiseach comes in here and lectures me month after month about so-called partnership.  He professes to believe in these mechanisms but when they are torn up by the management which he appointed and a company of which he owns one quarter, he is silent.  This is hypocrisy in the extreme.  </P>
        <P>These workers have made hundreds of millions of euro in profits for Aer Lingus over the past few years.  We have a management which now apes the worst features of the Ryanair outfit, namely, an anti-trade union and anti-worker approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>If Ryanair will resort in the future to charging passengers a penny to go to the bathroom, which surely cannot be very far off, Aer Lingus management will want to go one better and perhaps charge them for the hand dryer as well.  The Taoiseach stands by and unless he replies differently at his next opportunity, he is endorsing this attack on these workers&rsquo; wages and conditions.  How much profit is enough for the speculators to whom he has given the national airline?  Is it not clear that from recent Ryanair examples, that the relentless pursuit of profit by these investors will tragically lead to a very dangerous situation in the future?  </P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>In conclusion, will the Taoiseach at the very least vindicate the workers&rsquo; rights under existing agreements, which were reaffirmed only five months ago, or will he now betray those workers over and over again?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Joe Higgins knows my position on this.  Staff in Aer Lingus have done a tremendous job over the past 15 years and the management of the company is also doing a good job.  In spite of very stiff competition and opposition, it is trying to maintain a strong company.  There are 1,800 members in the company who have been given relatively good conditions which they, obviously, want to hold on to.  As I have said, the company is in active negotiations on the proposed changes with IMPACT and IALPA and I hope it can get to the same position with SIPTU and the craft unions.  I have already said that the National Implementation Body is there.  I do not think anybody in Aer Lingus, be they in the board, management or staff, want to do anything to damage the company.  In general, Dublin Airport is receiving far more competition from more airlines coming in and increased activity.  The staff rightly wish to hold on to their existing conditions.  The company has put forward its presentation and it is a matter for normal industrial relations negotiations.  </P>
        <P>The company&rsquo;s proposals apply to revised terms and conditions for new staff from 1 February and for intensive negotiations on revised terms for existing staff from 1 March.  Obviously, the trade unions in the company want to have their input and say in that and will not agree to changes they believe are to the detriment of the workers.  This is normal industrial relations work between Aer Lingus and the unions.  I know the company is expecting to receive strike notice later today from SIPTU, but I hope there can be a realisation by both sides that they must negotiate this matter.  Based on the good work they have done in Aer Lingus over the past 15 years, I have no doubt that both sides will be doing their utmost to avoid any difficulties and come to an amicable resolution of their difficulties, allowing the company to protect employment and grow and strengthen itself.  I wish them well with this.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3 together. </P>
<P>The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion last met on 7 December 2006.  The next meeting is due to be held on 21 February 2007.  As I have outlined to the House now on a number of occasions, Cabinet committees are an integral part of the Cabinet process.  Questions as to the business conducted at Cabinet or Cabinet committee meetings have never been allowed in the House on the grounds that they are internal to Government.  The reasons for this approach are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the last meeting held in September or December?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>December.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting that nearly one half of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s short reply was devoted to an argument as to why he should not give any information in regard to his own policies and approach to the issue of drugs in this country.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a long-standing rule of the House.  It is a constitutional obligation intended to protect Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>During the previous D&aacute;il and the current D&aacute;il, the Ceann Comhairle has allowed more flexibility with regard to teasing out the drugs issue during Taoiseach&rsquo;s questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate to debate anything discussed at Cabinet or by a Cabinet sub-committee in the House, but it is appropriate to submit questions to the line Minister on issues relating to drugs, if the Deputy wishes to do so.  I would prefer if we did not have this argument.  The Chair has pointed out a number of times in recent years that these questions should be tabled for written answer.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question simply asks when the sub-committee last met and, therefore, in the Chair&rsquo;s view, no scope remains for supplementary questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view of the role of the sub-committee into the future?  What new initiatives does it propose to take?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion comprises a large number of Ministers and Ministers of State and it meets at least once a month.  It covers education and <Col N="1125"/>science; enterprise, trade and employment; community and rural affairs; finance; the environment, heritage and local government; health and children; and social and family affairs.  Usually a number of Ministers of State involved in housing, urban renewal, the drugs strategy, equality, disability and labour issues are in attendance.  The sub-committee involves practically the entire range of Ministers and Ministers of State.  The question about responsibility should be tabled to all Ministers, who will then outline their role in these issues.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be possible for the sub-committee to adopt an overarching approach to the issue of social exclusion whereas Ministers and Ministers of State are coming at it from sectional points of view.  Does the sub-committee benchmark itself in regard to dealing with the serious social exclusion issues in many communities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should submit a question to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the scale of drugs finds over the past year, amounting to approximately &euro;70 million, which is estimated to be only 10% of what is brought into the State and the fact there is no scarcity of drugs, despite the big seizures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should submit a question to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the enormous profits from the drugs trade are&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise out of this question.  I cannot give a different ruling to the Deputy than I gave to Deputy Joe Higgins.  The Chair has pointed out clearly that what is discussed at the Cabinet sub-committee is covered by Cabinet confidentiality.  If the Deputy has a question for the line Minister, he should submit it to him or her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not ask anything about Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I know but, unfortunately for the Deputy and for the Chair, we all have to obey the rules.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>But I did not break any rule yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy did.  He asked a question, which has been ruled out of order by the Chair and which should be submitted to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair does not know what is my question.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1126"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.  The Deputy asked a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What was it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not repeat the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  If he is not happy with it, he should read the Official Report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not ask a question.  I prefaced my remarks about the scale of drug seizures, which represents approximately 10%&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy not to go down that line.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I frankly admit I intended to break the rules but I had not broken them at the time the Chair intervened.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should table a question and Members should take the Chair&rsquo;s rulings seriously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the composition of the Cabinet sub-committee, does its remit cover the demand reduction side of the drugs issue or does it cover the supply side and criminal law as well?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, it is not appropriate to ask what the sub-committee does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is absolutely absurd.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I made a similar ruling regarding Deputy Joe Higgins&rsquo;s questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking about the remit of the sub-committee and the Ceann Comhairle is telling me with a straight face that the Taoiseach cannot outline to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann what is its role.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked about what is discussed at the sub-committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not ask the Taoiseach anything about what was discussed at the sub-committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked about the role of the sub-committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Taoiseach whether the focus of the sub-committee is on demand reduction or whether drugs supply and criminal law considerations are also examined, having regard to the extent that the crime wave is driven by the proceeds&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is going into what is discussed at the sub-committee.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1127"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am asking about the purview of the sub-committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>All aspects of the supply side are discussed but the Deputy would obtain much more information from the relevant Minister.  A great deal of information is available on the supply of these drugs, the international syndicates involved and the locations from which they are sourced, such as Iran and Afghanistan through markets across Europe.  The issue of the supply of drugs has been examined as well as the measures taken by the State to address it and enforce legislation.  All aspects of supply are examined in detail.  The Minister of State with responsibility for this issue has a great deal of information on it.  The sub-committee not only discusses what happens in Ireland, but it also discusses co-operation with international organisations and groups to deal with the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to ask a question and I will try to stay within the terms of the Standing Order, as defined by the Chair, although I am not sure how much interest there is in this, given that the Gallery is empty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy get on with a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do my best.  The Taoiseach stated the remit of the sub-committee covers &ldquo;all aspects&rdquo; and it met last December.  The reason my question was tabled was to establish the frequency of the meetings.  What does the title of the sub-committee mean?  Does &ldquo;all aspects&rdquo; refer to only illegal drugs or does the term cover addictive substances and practices?  Where does the term &ldquo;drugs&rdquo; fit in within the sub-committee&rsquo;s remit?  Does social inclusion take into account ongoing work in communities such as my own in Balbriggan where parent-to-parent courses are provided?  Does the sub-committee examine how social inclusion relates to drug abuse or does it have a wider remit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Drugs are one aspect of the sub-committee&rsquo;s work.  Meetings are held regularly to discuss only the drugs issue because it is a major problem.  We discuss drugs in the community, drugs in the broadest sense that are creating difficulties for individuals, the drugs strategy and everything related to it.  However, the office of social inclusion under the aegis of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has a broad remit.  The Cabinet sub-committee also deals with education issues, difficulties in rural communities and environmental, health and children&rsquo;s issues.  These issues have nothing to do with drugs and, therefore, the sub-committee&rsquo;s remit is broader than just the drugs issue.  The sub-committee regularly dedicates itself to an issue or two.  That is why so many Ministers are <Col N="1128"/>involved and that is why, therefore, questions are relevant to the line Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the sub-committee examined the impact of the drugs problem outside the greater Dublin area because every town and village on the island is affected by it?  Will it examine services for dealing with the problem in those areas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question to the line Minister would be more appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it within the sub-committee&rsquo;s remit and scope to examine such issues?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is nationwide.</P>

        <P>The Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution published its report relating to the family on 24 January 2006.  The relevant Departments are considering its recommendations.  The Government has acted on most of the key recommendations which have emanated from earlier reports of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.  In all, this and the previous Government have brought forward ten referenda.</P>
        <P>The Government will avail of appropriate opportunities to take forward further recommendations of the all-party committee.  The complexities involved in holding a referendum require that careful consideration be given to the frequency with which referenda can realistically be held and the significance of the issues in question.</P>
        <P>On 3 November 2006, I proposed a referendum on the place of children in our Constitution.  I requested the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to initiate a process of consultation and discussion with the D&aacute;il parties and all relevant interest groups.  The purpose of the consultation was to achieve consensus on an appropriate wording for an amendment to the Constitution which would reflect the need to establish robust safeguards and protections for children.</P>
        <P>Since my announcement, the Minister of State has been engaged in a series of discussions with political party representatives, the Ombudsman for Children, non-governmental organisations, represented by the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance, and faith-based groups.  Two weeks ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, with the agreement of the Government, circulated a briefing document outlining the scope of the proposed amendment and subsequently met representatives of the political parties and relevant groups.</P>
        <P>Following the Cabinet&rsquo;s discussion of the amendment last week, a further briefing document was circulated and further consultations took place.  At its meeting this week, the Government approved the wording of the amendment.  A Bill is now being drafted and will be published next week.  In the meantime, the Minister of State awaits the Opposition&rsquo;s response to his second briefing document.  As I have said all along, if we can achieve all-party agreement on this matter, I believe we should hold a referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody has an interest in dealing with the place of children in the Constitution.  I previously made the point that to amend the Constitution in any way requires full, thorough and proper discussion with all the parties involved, the Oireachtas and especially the people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The level of briefing given by the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has not been as extensive as is being portrayed.  That is possibly because he was <Col N="1130"/>not in a position to brief as fully as might be necessary his political colleagues in the House.  Why have we not been able to get the wording of the referendum this week?  The Cabinet approved it yesterday and it will not change between now and next week.  Is there some reason the Opposition spokespersons on justice could not have been given the wording this week so they could at least start to get a legal interpretation of its impact, as distinct from what we have been doing, namely, trying to comment on the intent of what the Government has in mind?</P>
        <P>Is it intended to put two questions to the people or just one question in the form of the wording that has been passed by the Cabinet &mdash; one dealing with the issue of a zone of absolute defence, with which there is no problem, and the second in regard to rights?  Will the referendum include a provision to allow soft information to be made available to those involved in the vetting of children and the vetting process?  Even though a person may have been accused of improper or illegal behaviour with children, there is no formal provision for the release of that information to employers, boards of management or whatever else.  Is that to be included in some way in the referendum also?</P>
        <P>Correspondence has begun to increase on the complex area of the balance between parental rights and children&rsquo;s rights.  I am sure the Cabinet discussed this matter.  Is a reference to this issue included in the wording approved by the Cabinet yesterday?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the briefing documents did not contain the wording which we finalised only yesterday.  A significant amount of debate and consideration took place on the issue, involving the Attorney General and eminent constitutional counsel in this area.  We have to do an Irish translation and this will take a few days.  The Deputy will be aware that is crucial in a constitutional referendum.  The best way of dealing with the matter is for us to put our full proposals into the public domain.  I ask the parties to continue discussions with the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I consider that the best approach as everyone will have the same set of proposals and the issue will be comprehensively discussed.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has tried to provide extensive information in the two memorandums.  We will publish them all on Monday.  We will not have the Bill, the documents and the Irish translation ready until the weekend and, as I stated, we will put them all into the public domain on Monday when further conversations can continue.</P>
        <P>Approximately seven issues are dealt with which relate to problem areas.  They may be incorporated in two questions.  Obviously, there is the decision of the Supreme Court in the CC <Col N="1131"/>case and six other points require to be dealt with also.  The points are not all separate ones; some of them are grouped together.  We have concluded our work but we are open to hearing the views of others.  We have had a good team of eminent people working with us.  We will put our case and the discussion can continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Taoiseach will agree time is very tight.  Reports this morning make clear the referendum cannot be held before Easter.  A general election is pending, whenever the Taoiseach decides to dissolve the D&aacute;il.  I am sure he does not wish anything to be used as a diversionary tactic on an issue as sensitive as this one.  Does the Taoiseach agree, in terms of having a real discussion with all of the people, that the time after Easter between when he can and when he wants to dissolve this D&aacute;il is very tight for the purposes of holding a referendum in accordance with the recommendations of the committee which was chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan?  I am sure the Taoiseach does not wish to have this issue politicised for whatever reason.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I do not.  That would be the worst of all worlds.  I would like if we can agree it and still get it done within the timescale, but if we agree it and cannot get it done within the timescale that would also be an achievement.  There are a number of areas involved, some of which should not create great difficulties.  The rights of all children are to be recognised and affirmed.  Power is to be granted for the State to intervene in respect of all children in all families.  Issues remain to be resolved about children who, in the long term, may be adopted after a defined period.  Children may be voluntarily placed for adoption.  At present, a married couple may not voluntarily place a child for adoption.  Difficulties remain around that issue.  A new section relates to the fact that a child&rsquo;s best interests are to be secured in certain private proceedings concerning adoption and guardianship.  Most of these issues will not create difficulties.</P>
        <P>I do not foresee the legal difficulties of any party advisers as being impossible to overcome either.  I do not consider the issue of reversing the decision on the CC case will present a difficulty.  There may be one or two areas.  We will make the wording available and if the parties can engage, complete discussions and agree on it, we can have a referendum.  The political groups do not present problems as such; it is the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance and the faith-based organisations which would like to deal with this issue that have differences of opinions but this will always be the case.  If we can deal with it, we will do so, if not, we cannot do so.  I ask parties to try.  I will not engage <Col N="1132"/>in a row about it.  If we cannot do it, we will return to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am apprehensive because, like a criminal law measure from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, this grows every time we discuss it.  There are now seven items in this delicate area.  Will the Taoiseach address the matter raised by Deputy Kenny, namely, the balance between parental rights and children&rsquo;s rights?  Does the Taoiseach&rsquo;s work with experts lead him to believe that this aspect would have broad support in the community?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened to opposing arguments on this matter.  In the past 30 years the courts have granted rights to children of unmarried parents under Article 43.  These personal rights are the equivalent to the constitutional rights of a child of married parents.  The legal team has examined this area and is satisfied with its resolution.  In a case like this eminent people are consulted, not just the Attorney General, but there will always be those who take an opposing view, irrespective of the wording or when we hold the referendum.  We have made a great effort in respect of this and I would be glad to raise points on this with the legal team.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a reference in one newspaper to a Government belief that it is not possible to hold the referendum before Easter.  Is that the Government&rsquo;s position?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is not possible to hold the referendum before Easter because of the number of days that remain.  Even if we all agreed next week to pass the referendum Bill in the Houses, we could not hold the referendum by Easter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Time is of the essence and the Government is like a patient facing the end and in a panic about several issues that it has not dealt with and must cram in.  The Taoiseach mentioned seven issues, of which there are difficulties with two.  That does not mean seven separate questions.  There are two questions, one of which will encompass a range of those issues.</P>
        <P>There are seven weeks to Easter, one of which is taken up with the ministerial diaspora at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  In the meantime the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has published legislation that, even by his standards of hyperbole, has profound implications although not in the way the Minister expects.  How is it possible to do justice to the wide-ranging discussion that should take place?  It is not possible to hold the referendum before Easter.  How is it possible to hold a public discussion, allowing the people to analyse what is proposed, and undertake a serious campaign before the D&aacute;il is dissolved and a general election called?  Should the Taoiseach <Col N="1133"/>state that it is not possible and adopt a more realistic timescale?  All these issues can be more satisfactorily discussed at a later period, no matter who is in Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Higgins missed the point.  Most of these issues have been discussed <i>ad nauseam</i>.  I have been involved in referendum campaigns where public attention was not caught until the campaign was almost over.  Those who are interested, including NGOs, professionals and those who have discussed the legal cases, in particular the last one which has been discussed in great detail for the past eight months, have fixed views on it.  It is a question of whether we can finalise our work.  We should finalise our work, and if it is possible to have a referendum we should have it.  Otherwise we will have to return to it.  The issues will not change because of a general election.  If the Deputy believes people need six months to discuss these matters and will be intrigued by them, that is not the way the world works.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>In other countries there are options in respect of amending the Constitution but in Ireland it is the Taoiseach who calls the shots.  He has stated that if we can hold the referendum we will and, if not, we will not.  This does not indicate a firm commitment.  Is there a date by which time a decision will be made that it is too close to the general election and we must wait until a new Government is formed?  The Taoiseach has stated it will not happen before Easter but after Easter people will have to go to polling stations twice in quick succession.  Is he prepared to leave a month between bringing people to the polling stations twice?  At what point can we be clear whether this will happen before the general election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When parties see the proposals, which Deputy Brian Lenihan has explained to spokespersons, and consult with legal people it will not take more than a few days for the Opposition to decide if it will support the wording.  Then we can make a decision on it.  I think we can complete the work.  People who work in this area believe it is crucial we deal with this in the short term, whether that means April or September.  They will be very upset if we do not deal with this in the next few months.  I am trying to manage the situation and it is not the end of the world for me if it takes place in April or September.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach minded to put two questions in a referendum rather than one and is this not preferable?  My party was the only one to propose a text to the all-party constitutional committee to the effect that in all matters pertaining to children, the interests of the child <Col N="1134"/>would come first.  Is that also the Taoiseach&rsquo;s position?</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach deal with the proposal from the all-party committee on the Constitution on the issue of a Northern representation on an Oireachtas committee to deal with issues arising from the Good Friday Agreement and all-Ireland matters?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first matter, it is more than one question and the Government will publish its view on how to deal with it next week.</P>
        <P>We have had various discussions about how best to take the Oireachtas committee forward.  The document is before the Whips and I look forward to making some progress on the committee of the House that will deal with matters on an all-Ireland basis.</P>

The Minister needs to state the impact this decision will have on waste policy here, where incineration is presented as waste to energy.  This vote shows that waste is not an efficient fuel, that burning waste creates high CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions for a low electricity output, that it emits more CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> than recycling, and that it creates health problems and diverts waste from recycling.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek to amend the Standing Order in respect of No. 22.  The Moriarty report is a large document and the tribunal has gone on for years, costing the tax payer a significant sum.  Mr. Justice Moriarty has made clear findings and recommendations.  I propose that the Order of Business be amended to provide a time of 30 minutes for questions and answers arising from the statements in respect of the Moriarty tribunal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment proposed by the leader of Fine Gael.  It is a modest request having regard to the enormity of the contents of the Moriarty report before the D&aacute;il.  It is unconscionable to allocate approximately ten minutes per year of inquiry to discussion of the report.  The Moriarty tribunal has continued for more than nine years and it is proposed that we allocate 90 minutes to it.  This is inadequate to draw the lessons that need to be drawn from the report.</P>
        <P>I do not see the leader of the Progressive Democrats included in the list of speakers.  Is this a precedent for the future?  I do not object to this.  The former leader of the Progressive Democrats, Dessie O&rsquo;Malley will be uncomfortable that the present leader has agreed with the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il to guillotine this debate at 90 minutes.  If Mr. O&rsquo;Malley were in the House he would need the full 90 minutes.  The fact that Deputy McDowell is assenting to this kind of truncated debate on the profound issues raised by the Moriarty report shows that the Rottweiler has become a lap-dog.  It appears that he will not be present in the House to express his views on these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Green Party I support Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s request for an amendment that there be questions and answers on this section of the Order of Business.  Although there has been a clawback and the tribunal has resulted in money coming into the coffers, as well as being expended, we should give due regard to the fact that at 678 pages and a cost of &euro;25 million, the scale of the job set for the tribunal warrants some level of political accountability from the Government.  I urge the Government and the Taoiseach to facilitate Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s request.</P>
        <P>This would give us an opportunity to ask about the operation of standards in public office and the impact of the work carried out by the Moriarty tribunal, rather than leave the report as an historic document to gather dust.  It must be noted and acted upon which requires a question and answer session and a level of accountability we have not experienced.</P>

	<P>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe was briefed this morning by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on the proposal for the constitutional referendum on the rights of children.  In an earlier reply from the Taoiseach, I understood the Cabinet had agreed yesterday on the proposed wording.  Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, however, this morning was informed by the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, that the wording for the seven propositions was approved but that the Attorney General is working on the wording to be inserted in the Constitution.  Is that the case?  Does the Attorney General have to return to the Cabinet with a recommendation of the wording to be inserted in the Constitution?  Did I pick up the Taoiseach incorrectly this morning that when the Cabinet had given approval, that it only pertained to the seven propositions?  Was the wording for the referendum approved yesterday?</P>
        <P>The All-Party Committee on the Constitution recommended that legislation should be published to give effect to the wording.  I understand from the Minister of State&rsquo;s briefing that it will now be a statement of legislative intent.  Will the Taoiseach clarify these matters?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The wording is agreed.  The formula that holds sway in a constitutional refer<Col N="1140"/>endum is the Irish translation of the wording.  That is being undertaken and the translation should be finished soon.  As I informed Deputy Rabbitte yesterday, we will not have the other legislation pertaining to the amendment.  It will be the intent of what the Government will do.</P>

    <Title>Moriarty Report: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>What came home forcefully to me as I read this report is the sheer scale of the amounts of money &mdash; more than &euro;11 million, or some &euro;45 million in today&rsquo;s values &mdash; found by the tribunal to have been either privately donated to Mr. Haughey or misapplied by him during the period under inquiry from 1979 to 1996.  What struck me even more forcefully were the devices employed to conceal the fact of and the nature of those transactions.  We are indebted to Mr. Justice Moriarty and the tribunal team for their outstanding work in painstakingly stripping away the layers of secrecy and obscurity surrounding Mr. Haughey&rsquo;s financial affairs and exposing them to public scrutiny.  We look forward to receiving the second part of the their report soon.</P>
        <P>To those of us who knew Mr. Haughey, who worked with him over the years, who saw him as a dynamic colleague and leader of exceptional abilities, the detailed revelations in this report come as a grave disappointment.  Even now, I and others who worked with him in Government find it difficult to comprehend the complexity of the man and the other life he led.  Mr. Justice Moriarty states in the report:</P>
        <P LI="1">Apart from the almost invariably secretive nature of payments from senior members of the business community, their very incidence and scale, particularly during difficult economic <Col N="1144"/>times nationally, and when Governments led by Mr. Haughey were championing austerity, can only be said to have devalued the quality of a modern democracy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a harsh and damning indictment.  It is also a great tragedy.</P>
        <P>I said hard things on numerous occasions about Mr. Haughey and my disappointment at his lapses from the expected high standards.  I said it at our Ard-Fheis in 1997 and in subsequent statements and interviews.  I stand over those criticisms.  I also stand over my comments made at Mr. Haughey&rsquo;s funeral and on other occasions that he did a lot of good work for this country.  I believe I was right in those comments.  There is no denying that he delivered much political progress but history will be the final judge of that.</P>
        <P>In this forensically detailed report, we have a judgment on a politician and statesman who had it in him to be great but who was seduced by a conviction of personal entitlement that ultimately undermined his vocation to be a true servant of our country and our people.  Regrettably, the account now presented to us is that of the private person who failed to live up to the high standards that we are entitled to expect of those in public life, including elected representatives and officeholders.</P>
        <P>It is a cause of deep personal hurt that the report also found serious misappropriation of donations intended to assist with the medical treatment of the late Brian Lenihan.  The revelation that Mr. Haughey, for his own personal benefit, redirected those and other donations, such as the political donations intended for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, was a matter of grave disappointment for me and for those who worked with him.</P>
        <P>In those times past, the lack of a formal, developed, ethics code and oversight machinery for those in public office no doubt facilitated the years of evasion and deceit that characterised Mr. Haughey&rsquo;s financial dealings, but does not excuse them.  Today we have a highly developed ethics framework that not only provides a mechanism for keeping holders of public office honest, but sets out clearly for them the highest standards of behaviour that they must meet to earn the public trust.  I refer specifically to the enactment of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.</P>
        <P>The 1995 Act provided mechanisms for dealing with conflicts of interest in regard to Members of the Houses, Ministers and officials in the Civil Service and the wider public service.  It established the independent Public Offices Commission and provided for a Select Committee on Members&rsquo; Interests in each House of the Oireachtas to oversee its key provisions.  It required Members of the Oireachtas, senior civil servants, public board members and senior executives of State bodies to disclose their personal interests in order to provide transparency in <Col N="1145"/>decision-making and accountability.  It also regulated the acceptance of gifts by officeholders.</P>
        <P>The 2001 Act, for which I personally pressed, established a new Standards in Public Office Commission, to be chaired by a judge or former judge of the Supreme or High Court.  It was given wide investigative powers into acts or omissions of public servants or officeholders that are inconsistent with the proper performance of their duties, or that would be inconsistent with the maintenance of public confidence in that performance.</P>
        <P>The commission can engage inquiry officers to conduct preliminary investigations of complaints and indicate whether a case exists for further investigation by the commission of a matter of significant public importance.  The commission has tribunal powers; it can summon individuals and papers, administer oaths, order discovery and preservation of documents and require the giving of evidence.  It is an offence to obstruct an investigation of the commission or an inquiry officer.</P>
        <P>The 2001 Act also provided for the preparation of codes of conduct, in consultation with the commission, for Members, for office holders and for directors or others employed by public bodies.  These codes of conduct deal with the standards of conduct and integrity appropriate to the performance of their public duties by the persons concerned.</P>
        <P>The Act also requires Members of the Houses to furnish a tax clearance certificate within nine months of an election.  A statutory declaration that the Member&rsquo;s tax affairs are in order must be made one month either side of the election.  Similar arrangements apply to persons appointed to positions as judges or senior public officials.  Penalties for a false declaration were increased from a fine of &pound;50 to one of &pound;2,000 and a term of imprisonment from three to six months.  The result is a strong ethics statutory framework overseen by a powerful, independent standards commission.</P>
        <P>The strengthening of the ethics framework has also led to the imposition of vigorously enforced standards for the treatment of political donations and expenditure, as set out in the Electoral Acts.  We are preparing proposals to further strengthen the ethics legislation to address issues that arose last autumn.</P>
        <P>As a result of these initiatives, the transparency in the financial affairs of public representatives, now required and enforced by law, stands in sharp contrast to the secretiveness and evasiveness of the transactions revealed in the tribunal&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The tribunal&rsquo;s report also makes several other important findings, not least ones relating to me.  I refer to the operation of the leader&rsquo;s allowance account and the practice that had progressively evolved for administrative reasons of pre-signing cheques.  I accept the view expressed in the report that the practice was undesirable.  I am happy, however, that the tribunal accepted my evidence <Col N="1146"/>and was satisfied that I had no reason to believe the account was operated otherwise than in an orthodox fashion.  I am also pleased that the tribunal said in its report that it is noteworthy that at my insistence amendments have since been made to the governing of the leader's allowance accounts.</P>
        <P>The important point to emphasise is that the issues, which arose in respect of that account, arose more than 15 years ago.  Even before the introduction of statutory controls in 2001, the operation of the account within Fianna F&aacute;il was reformed in 1992 by my colleague Albert Reynolds and was further reformed in 1994 when I became party leader.  For example, I arranged for the party&rsquo;s auditors to present the audited accounts to the party&rsquo;s national trustees, its national treasurers and senior party officials.  This further increased the transparency of the account.</P>
        <P>In Government, Fianna F&aacute;il has changed the legislation governing such accounts.  Under the old system, a party leader had a large amount of discretion as to how the account was to be used and this gave rise to an ambiguity about what was permissible.  The 2001 amendment set out with greater clarity the purposes for which the leader&rsquo;s parliamentary allowance are to be applied.  The categories of expenditure which are to be included in the meaning of &lsquo;expenses arising from parliamentary activities&rsquo; have now been clearly defined.  In addition, the new legislation requires a parliamentary leader to prepare a statement of any expenditure from the allowance.  It requires that such a statement be audited by a public auditor.  This audited report is then required to be furnished to the standards commission.</P>
        <P>The standards commission: considers the statement and the auditor&rsquo;s report; can consult with the parliamentary leader; furnishes a report in writing on the statement and the auditor&rsquo;s report to the Minister for Finance; and causes a copy of that report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Since the reforms by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government in 2001, the system is far more robust.  We did not wait for the Moriarty tribunal to conclude; we went ahead and changed the system.  There are now a large number of restrictions and guidelines as to how this money can be used.  We will closely study the report of the tribunal to establish whether there are any further improvements that might now need to be made.</P>
        <P>On the issue of the pre-signed cheques, it is important to recognise that this was not an uncommon feature of life in past decades.  It was done for convenience and to save time.  There was no reason for me to believe any unusual use was being made of any of these cheques and the vast majority of the cheques drawn on the Fianna F&aacute;il leader&rsquo;s account were put to proper use.  A very small number were used otherwise.  As a result of the reforms I introduced, first within the Fianna <Col N="1147"/>F&aacute;il system and later by legislation, this practice which ended 15 years ago cannot be repeated.</P>
        <P>In the interests of clarity, it is worth pointing out that for as long as I have been leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, the party leader&rsquo;s allowance has been administered from Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s headquarters.  The account is administered by the party&rsquo;s financial controller, each of whom in my time as leader has, at my insistence, been a qualified accountant. The financial controller, in conjunction with our general secretary, operates expenditure of the account under strict criteria based on supporting our parliamentary party.  The account is independently audited and is signed off by the trustees, the treasurers and senior officials.  I sign off on a statement of expenditure.  The cheques go directly into the party account and not to me as party leader.  I would be surprised if there is a party in this House that operates the leader&rsquo;s allowance on a more regulated or strictly controlled basis than the Fianna F&aacute;il party.</P>
        <P>We have learned much from the work of this tribunal, from its predecessor the McCracken tribunal and from other tribunals and inquiries.  We have developed a greater awareness and understanding of the need for explicit measures to underpin the high standards of governance the public deserves and expects.  As I already noted, many important legislative and other initiatives have been taken to address this.</P>
        <P>In addition to the measures I have already referenced, actions have been taken in relation to individual issues of tax evasion; a major reorganisation of structures in the Revenue Commissioners, including the strengthening of anti-evasion operations through the creation of a dedicated investigations and prosecutions division to manage and advance all Revenue prosecutions in cases of tax and duty evasion; conferring of substantial additional statutory powers on the Revenue Commissioners; development of codes of practice and other procedures to guard against conflicts of interest; strengthening of the financial regulatory and supervisory framework.  The establishment of the Financial Regulator as a single financial regulatory authority with an explicit mandate for consumers has placed the Irish regulatory system at the forefront of best international practice; sharing of information by State agencies.  Legislation now allows the Financial Regulator to report suspicions of money laundering, which includes the proceeds of tax evasion, directly to the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners.  The regulator is also obliged to report any suspected criminal offences to the appropriate enforcement authority, for example, the Director of Corporate Enforcement; the creation of independent regulatory authorities for the enforcement of company law and for the supervision of the accountancy and auditing profession.  In this regard, also we are undertaking an ambitious programme of reform of the existing Companies Acts, led by the company law review <Col N="1148"/>group, in order to keep our companies legislation up to date and appropriate for the needs of our economy; and strengthening the prevention of corruption legislation, including a presumption of corruption for non-disclosure of a significant political donation in particular circumstances.</P>
        <P>We will continue to apply the lessons learned from the work of the Moriarty tribunal and other inquiries.  However, the overarching lesson is that the achievement of high standards cannot be taken for granted.  High standards must be promoted, through legislation, through changes in our political culture and, above all, through constant vigilance of which the independent standards commission is the ultimate guarantor.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s response to the Moriarty tribunal today has been mainly to deal with the changes wrought in the intervening period.  From his response to this massive tome, one does not get any sense of the environment or atmosphere in which politics was played out during that period in which many of us here were Members of the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the actions of all men, and most of all princes, where there is no tribunal to turn to, we look to results.  Those are the words of Machiavelli, sometime inspiration to the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and his followers.  Unlike Machiavelli&rsquo;s unhappy subjects, we had a tribunal to which to turn.  It is just as well we did, given the results we faced and so the House discusses the first report of the Moriarty tribunal into those results.  This report is a bleak but essential analysis of the relationship between politics and business and what posed as, and passed for, national leadership in worryingly recent times.  It is a catalogue of corruption.  It is a devastating critique of a powerful elite exposing a gross abuse of privilege, a rank abuse of public office and, most importantly, a devastating abuse of public trust.  In that alone, Mr. Justice Moriarty has done an important job, notwithstanding the lengthy timeframe.</P>
        <P>It is fair to say that the behaviour he uncovered was less than edifying and less than worthy of high office, or indeed of any office in our modern democracy.  Mr. Justice Moriarty returned a devastating verdict on the late Taoiseach, Charles Haughey.  However, to see Mr. Haughey&rsquo;s behaviour as an aberration within Fianna F&aacute;il would be an affront to the tribunal and to every democrat in this country.  Far from being an aberration, Mr. Haughey&rsquo;s behaviour and attitude typified the culture of Fianna F&aacute;il at a significant period, in which Raphael P. Burke accepted corrupt payments related to radio licences, there was serious corruption of the planning process and funds, donated to Fianna F&aacute;il for the practice of democratic politics, were deliberately misappropriated.</P>
        <P>To Fianna F&aacute;il, it may have been just business as usual.  There is an abiding sense and abiding evidence that many in the inner circle wanted, and felt they deserved, a piece of the action. <Col N="1149"/> More disturbing still is the current Fianna F&aacute;il leadership&rsquo;s refusal to condemn the actions of their former colleagues.  Throughout the Moriarty tribunal and in its aftermath, they have been ambivalent, to say the least.  Many of the new breed of Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers were apprenticed into their craft by those who are now in public and political disgrace.  Those usually voluble Ministers have been stunning in their silence on how their masters profited personally from holding high political office.  Recently, individually and collectively, they refused to condemn the practice of serving senior Ministers accepting money from friends for private use.  As to the misappropriation of funds intended for Fianna F&aacute;il, I have yet to hear even one of them demand that the matter and the money be pursued.</P>
        <P>Is time itself the only difference between new Fianna F&aacute;il and old Fianna F&aacute;il?  It seems to be the same old attitudes and same old culture, just bright new, if not tired, faces.  Their attitude is summed up by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s refusal to answer any questions on the tribunal&rsquo;s findings relating to himself.  This is a clear abdication of his duty of accountability to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and to the country.  Until current senior members of Fianna F&aacute;il are willing to acknowledge the wrong and the damage done to public confidence in politics, it will not be possible for them to make a clean break from the culture of corruption that enveloped their party for such a long period.  Many people are sickened by the revelations and want a Government of integrity which will have the public interest, rather than personal gain, as its compass.</P>
        <P>While some in public life equivocate about former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, in his long, considered and detailed analysis, Mr. Justice Moriarty does not.  At the core of his valuable work there is uncovered in the period up to a decade ago a ruthlessness, an ambition and a sense of force and cunning more in keeping with how a banana republic operates than one of the world&rsquo;s most modern and newest Republics.  It was repressive, secretive, corrosive and, as Moriarty now reveals, corrupt.  In that context, the report is an eyewitness to misery.</P>
        <P>Ordinary Irish people tightened their belts almost to the buckle, paid mortgages at 16%, tax at 58% and collected dole at &pound;42 per week.  Meanwhile the docile, biddable, cohort of loyalists scuttled along their party and departmental corridors, signed blank cheques while Ireland was broke, put up and shut up, watching their leader, immaculate in Charvet, smile and smile and be a villain.</P>
        <P>Some say Moriarty holds up a mirror to Irish politics and the people who led it, some of whom still lead today.  Surely, no mirror can reconcile the utterly contradictory views on the late Mr. Haughey.  On one hand, Mr. Justice Moriarty considers Haughey to have devalued the quality of a modern democracy, while, on the other, the current Taoiseach holds that Mr. Haughey had a <Col N="1150"/>proud identity with Ireland.  Mr. Justice Moriarty found that Mr. Haughey volunteered no information on payments to the tribunal, which was set up by the Oireachtas, and that several portions of his testimony were unacceptable and had to be rejected.  The current Taoiseach takes the view that Mr. Haughey was a patriot to the core.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Moriarty said that the man affectionately called &ldquo;Boss&rdquo; engendered elements of fear and domination in individuals, in both the private and public sectors.  The current Taoiseach can reconcile patriotism with the abuse of power and of the institutions of the State, not to mention taking money from friends for private use in public office.  I cannot.  Nor can I, as a public representative, or my party, accept a dig-out or free loans because with power comes responsibility &mdash; the responsibility to apply the highest standards of probity.</P>
        <P>Power is always problematic.  It is not always exercised benignly, justly or morally, as this report confirms.  It is a damning indictment of former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, and far more damning than we might have expected.  He finds that Mr. Haughey lived a lifestyle and incurred expenses vastly beyond public service entitlements, which were his sole, apparent income.  He rubbishes Mr. Haughey&rsquo;s protests that he knew virtually nothing of his financial arrangements and his claims that he never knew where the Cayman Islands were, never mind what they were for, before the tribunal.  He finds that Mr. Haughey had use of &euro;11.6 million over the 17 years to 1996.  That amounts to 171 times his salary in, as Mr. Justice Moriarty notes, difficult economic times and when Governments led by Mr. Haughey were championing austerity.</P>
        <P>According to the report, the former Taoiseach&rsquo;s financial actions were secretive, opaque and frequently involved offshore vehicles.  He siphoned money from friends, party and, ultimately, his country at a time when he held the highest office in Government.  Even the late former Minister, Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s transplant fund was fair game.  Public austerity went with private affluence and avarice.  As for tax, the subtext was &ldquo;I am the Taoiseach; I can be a difficult adversary&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Money is one thing, public duty is another.  This report&rsquo;s findings cast serious doubt over the probity, independence and ethical operation of Mr. Haughey&rsquo;s Governments.  The report notes his disposition to involve himself in the affairs of individual Government Departments.  We have to ask on what basis he did so.  We have to ask what actually took place at the Cabinet table, in Government Departments and in public decision-making fora.  The report finds elements of fear and domination engendered by him in individuals in both private and public sectors.  That fear enabled him to hide the money trail.  The domination meant he could live with impunity on dirty money.  Together, they sent the Haughey gravy train down the tracks because, in that corrosive <Col N="1151"/>climate, he and his inner circle in business knew that nothing or no one could stop them.</P>
        <P>There is a solitary comfort in this report, namely the conclusion that, while what transpired was unacceptable, wrong and must not be replicated, it would be quite unwarranted to conclude that everyone was at it.  Everyone was not at it but the names Haughey, Lawlor and Burke cover politics with something less than glory.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach said that everyone was at it and I know of many cases where treasurers at various clubs around the country sign blank cheques.  At the end of the year, however, they have to account for where they went.  The Taoiseach said he was at an election count on 16 June when a cheque for &euro;25,000 was made out to cash, for personal purposes.  The fact that it was not accounted for properly represents a failure on the part of the Taoiseach, as an accountant and a politician.</P>
        <P>I will finish with the words of Machiavelli:</P>
        <P LI="1">Everyone understands how praiseworthy it is in princes to keep faith, to live uprightly and not craftily.  Nevertheless, we see from what has taken place in our own days that princes have set little store by their word, but have known how to overreach men by their cunning, have accomplished great things, and, in the end, got the better of those who trusted to honest dealings.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I hope this tribunal report will ensure such a thing never happens again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe everything is not all right and that a change of Government is the only way to change the current political culture.  People were rightly shocked by the recent revelations of the Moriarty tribunal which clearly indicated that the Taoiseach was engaged in wrongful practices.  Are we satisfied that it is all right now when the Moriarty tribunal exposed the reality of a Taoiseach who personally netted the equivalent of &euro;45 million from business while serving in office?</P>
        <P>Are we comfortable with the statement of the current Taoiseach that the signing of blank cheques was all right and that it was the wholesale practice at the time?  Was the signing of blank cheques a wholesale practice in each of our community groups, caring organisations or businesses?  Did the current Taoiseach, in any practice of accountability, account for the signing of cheques at the end of a financial year in the same way as those community groups or even the smallest pitch and putt club?  It is outrageous for anyone to insist that was normal practice and, as a former accountant, the Taoiseach should state clearly that it was wrong.</P>
        <P>Do we now accept the words of George Colley that, under the leadership of Charles J. Haughey, there were low standards in high places?  Does the recent report of Mr. Justice Moriarty not indicate that a political mafia operated in Ireland <Col N="1152"/>under Charles J. Haughey?  Does that mafia still exist, as does the Mafia in Italy?  Does anyone believe the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, when he says he did not know the purpose of the blank cheques being cashed?  Should we care?  Does anybody care?  It is time for the people to take note of these matters because recent revelations confirm that when people were paying 65p tax in the pound, political leaders in Fianna F&aacute;il were having a very good time at their expense.  That is not all right.</P>
        <P>The political culture that has been laid bare in recent times requires urgent and effective eradication.  We need a government that removes once and for all the political culture of the Haughey era.  I believe that culture exists to the present day.  When I do not hear outright and unambiguous condemnation of the actions of former leaders, I believe it is proof that the culture still exists.</P>
        <P>It is essential to the political well-being of our country that there is a change of government in 2007.  Fine Gael, with our colleagues in the Labour Party and our democratic allies, will continue to provide the people with a democratic choice that will remove Fianna F&aacute;il from government for the next five years.  We will ask the people to break the link with the Haughey era, and especially with this Government and the Taoiseach, who only recently described the late Mr. Haughey as a patriot to his fingertips.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I record my thanks and appreciation, and that of my party, to Mr. Justice Moriarty and his team for this report.  Tribunal reports are the end product of a tortuous process.  All parties in this House are uneasy about that process, in particular about the delay and extraordinary expense involved, but much of that is due to the stonewalling and destructive tactics of those who have most to lose from the truth.  We have yet to see whether the tribunal will use the new powers available to it to ensure that the eventual cost is borne by those who generated this expense rather than by the taxpayers.</P>
        <P>Despite the attendant reservations that must accompany the publication of a document that was commissioned almost ten years ago, I believe this report is important.  It, together with the McCracken report which immediately preceded it, goes some way towards rescuing our democracy from growing uneasiness that a small group of powerful and wealthy individuals had come to regard themselves as the beneficial owners of the State, while nobody in authority was prepared to call a halt.</P>
        <P>The findings of this, the first report of the Moriarty tribunal, represent a damning indictment.  As Deputy Kenny said, it is an indictment not just of the record of Charles Haughey, but also of the entire political culture in Fianna F&aacute;il during the period when he dominated that party.  It is the reason that a new conventional wisdom has grown up that Fianna F&aacute;il cannot be let out <Col N="1153"/>without an escort.  Even those likely to support the party do not trust them to govern alone.  It is accepted without question that there must be a watchdog.  For years the Progressive Democrats made a good living from riding shotgun on Fianna F&aacute;il.  When the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, went up a pole in Ranelagh during the last election with his &ldquo;Single Party, no thanks!&rdquo; poster, he did not need to explain that he was exploiting the Haughey legacy; Fianna F&aacute;il cannot be trusted to govern alone.</P>
        <P>Whether the Progressive Democrats have discharged that role is a subject for another day.  The fact that the Progressive Democrats today collude with the current leader of Fianna F&aacute;il to allocate just 90 minutes of D&aacute;il time, almost two months after the report was published, to allow for statements only on the issues that arise is testament that the watchdog no longer even barks.</P>
        <P>The point of these tribunals and their reports is not just to conduct historical researches and arrive at the truth about long distant events, but to derive lessons for public policy on the way we conduct our business in future.  This is a very detailed report but it is just part one.  There are still public hearings to be held and then a second and final report.  I hope that final report will contain Mr. Justice Moriarty&rsquo;s recommendations on some of the outstanding issues.</P>
        <P>Despite the attempts of the Fianna F&aacute;il spinners to downplay Mr. Justice Moriarty&rsquo;s findings, the judge, in most cases, is unsparing in his criticism of Mr. Haughey and other senior Fianna F&aacute;il figures, both members of the parliamentary party and those who were key contributors to Mr. Haughey and his party.  This is a sorry tale of misuse of taxpayers money, the placing of public servants under pressure to do the will of the then Taoiseach and a group of craven colleagues who were unwilling to challenge his writ.  I had arrived at my own view on these matters ten years ago and I repeat today what I said in the debate on the setting up of this tribunal.  I stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">What would Mr. de Valera have thought of the Gandon mansion, the estate with the roaming thoroughbreds, the island, the fine wines and the yacht?  A successor of Mr. de Valera posing as a country squire, a man of the arts, a man of the turf, a great helmsman who embodied the spirit of the nation and who was born in, or with an affinity to, a county in each province, a man who was the possessor both of the common touch and wealthy benefactors.  The persona which Mr. Haughey affected, where Miche&aacute;l Mac Liamm&oacute;ir meets the Great Gatsby, seemed to regard the huge private payments not merely as being permissible but as being the natural order of things.  Just as the chieftains of ancient times lived off the fat of the land, our modern day warrior took it all as his due entitlement.  Others, while almost certainly not knowing any of the details of Mr. <Col N="1154"/>Haughey&rsquo;s financial chicanery, also seemed to regard it as the natural order of things.  This was the high point of the new political culture ushered in when the men in mohair suits took over from the men with no arses in their trousers.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Charles J. Haughey was the arch-practitioner of the new culture in a party where only a few rebelled and a majority willingly did his bidding.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Throughout all these controversies. . . we did not hear one word of criticism about the conduct of the main players from any senior figure in Fianna F&aacute;il.  When in Opposition, the Progressive Democrats had no doubts about the reason this was the case, as their then Finance spokesperson, [Deputy] Michael McDowell, made clear in the Goodman debate of 2 September 1994.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="2">We have never heard it and I dare say we never will because the reality is that they were bought and stay bought.  They know that Goodman knows where the bodies are buried; they dare not even rebuke this man because they know in their hearts that he has information on them and that he would bring them down like a group of skittles if the truth ever emerged. </P>
<P FLI="0">That was the Progressive Democrats in Opposition.  These days, it is a mutter from a relieved T&aacute;naiste to an even more relieved Taoiseach after a press conference during the &ldquo;Bertiegate&rdquo; affair: &ldquo;We have survived it, Taoiseach&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is hard to disagree with Mr. Justice Moriarty&rsquo;s conclusion that the payments received by Mr. Haughey during his political career &ldquo;devalued the quality of a modern democracy&rdquo; or the finding that the years from 1979 to 1992 &ldquo;was a dismal period in the interface between politics and business&rdquo;.  Some idea of the scale of the money received by Mr. Haughey under the period examined by the tribunal can be gauged by Mr. Justice Moriarty&rsquo;s finding that it was the equivalent of 171 times Mr. Haughey&rsquo;s salary as Taoiseach for the year of 1988.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the most shocking finding of the tribunal about Mr. Haughey is on the question of the money raised for his friend and lifetime colleague, Brian Lenihan.  It is difficult to believe that somebody as wealthy as Mr. Haughey could actually have set out to raise more money than he knew was required to fund Mr. Lenihan&rsquo;s operation and then apply part of these funds for his own purpose.  Nothing has been more revelatory of the nature of Fianna F&aacute;il as an organisation, and its single-minded focus on retaining power, than the restrained response of those closest to the late Mr. Lenihan.</P>
        <P>I also find it significant that the tribunal has specifically commented that its findings &ldquo;cannot and does not give rise to a finding that all other acts or decisions in public office on the part of Mr. Haughey during the relevant years were <Col N="1155"/>devoid of infirmity&rdquo;.  For example, as someone who gave evidence to the beef tribunal and studied it carefully, the decision not to make a single order for discovery of bank accounts virtually undermined its credibility when it came to its findings as to corruption.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference of the tribunal were geared towards examining Charles Haughey&rsquo;s finances throughout his later ministerial career, and his period as head of Government, rather than examining particular allegations concerning specific public, ministerial or Government decisions.  On the one hand, in trying to determine where the money came from, it was an exhaustive and exhausting exercise.  On the other hand, in the absence of specific allegations and specific leads, we still do not know why the money came nor, despite the stories of fine wines and Charvet shirts, do we know where it all went.</P>
        <P>We do know, however, that during the periods when he raised most money and spent so much, Charles Haughey retained a relentless grip on the reins of power in Fianna F&aacute;il despite the fact that every reasonable assessment both within and outside that party was that he was an enormous electoral liability.</P>
        <P>The misuse of the party leader&rsquo;s allowance, which is taxpayers&rsquo; money, was denied up to the last in this House.  Charles Haughey even resorted to the leader&rsquo;s allowance to give a colleague a &ldquo;dig out&rdquo; from public funds to avoid a bankruptcy that would have cost the party a D&aacute;il seat.</P>
        <P>It was his abnegation of responsibility in the management of that account that has come back to haunt the present Taoiseach.  Introducing the resolution to establish this tribunal back in 1997, the Taoiseach was disingenuous, to put it at its kindest.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Deputy Spring has raised the issue of the party leader&rsquo;s allowance during Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s period in Opposition.  In so far as I could with little available records I am satisfied, having spoken to the person who administered the account, that it was used for bona fide party purposes, that the cheques were prepared by that person and countersigned by another senior party member.  Their purpose was to finance personnel, press and other normal supports for an Opposition leader.  There was no surplus and no misappropriation.  The person involved had sole control of the account.  The money came in, the person lodged the cheque, dealt with the bills and invoices and paid those not covered by the ordinary allowance.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Nowhere in that account of events did he admit the fact that the &ldquo;other senior party member&rdquo; he referred to was in fact himself, or that his practice was to sign blank cheques by the dozen.  If Deputy Spring on this side of the House knew enough about the abuse of the leader&rsquo;s allowance to write to Mr. Haughey about it at the time, how <Col N="1156"/>is it that the man signing the cheques suspected nothing?</P>
        <P>It is true that in the ten years since the tribunal was set up, there have been reforms.  It is also true that every reform has been dragged from this Government like extracting teeth.  My party published Bills in 2000 on tax clearance for candidates, on reform of our prevention of corruption laws and on the registration of lobbyists.  There has been movement on two of those issues but no action at all on lobbying.  That failure is all the more disgraceful given the relentless river of revelations coming from the other tribunal that shows just how debased our public planning process had become due to the interaction of big business, party funding, lobbying and backhanders.</P>
        <P>The Government has failed also, despite some initial signs of movement following the first DIRT report, to do anything to enshrine the independence of the Revenue Commissioners and ensure their freedom of action, free of any fear of political interference.  Both the Revenue and the Department of Finance signalled their acceptance of a need to legislate along these lines but nothing at all has been done about it.</P>
        <P>One other failure also needs to be mentioned.  In the past 20 years or so during which tribunals, judicial and parliamentary, have become a part of the Irish furniture, I cannot recall a single example in a single module of any one of those tribunals where a public servant blew the whistle.  We have no culture of whistle-blowing in this country and our public life is the poorer for it.</P>
        <P>Labour&rsquo;s reaction to this report is not just one of recrimination and &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.  Our reaction is that it sets an agenda for change.  It reaffirms us in our commitment to our registration of lobbyists Bill and our Protection of Whistleblowers Bill, which this Government accepted on Second Stage and then put out to Committee Stage six or seven years ago and left it there.  It strengthens our resolve to reform the Ethics Acts in line with the Standards in Public Office Commission&rsquo;s own recommendations to allow it to hold a preliminary inquiry without the need for a formal complaint and formal hearings.</P>
        <P>We are committed, another promise flagged by the Taoiseach ten years ago but about which we have heard nothing since, to the establishment of a single, independent and resourced electoral and ethics commission.  This single commission will incorporate the Standards in Public Office Commission, the Constituency Review Commission and its constitutionally enshrined status will, in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;guarantee the independence and impartiality of the commission, generate greater confidence in public life, create greater transparency in public institutions and provide an independent source of advice and information in the areas of ethics in public life and electoral law reform&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>At the time of his death I said of Charles Haughey that, in and out of office, he was a domi<Col N="1157"/>nant figure in Irish politics for a period of almost four decades.  He was at all times a hugely controversial figure who attracted great loyalty among his supporters, even if it inspired amnesia in them, and fierce opposition from his opponents.  As Taoiseach and as a Government Minister, Charles Haughey had many achievements of note.  He was a skilled parliamentarian and a genuinely reforming Minister for Justice and Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt, however, but that we must conclude Charles Haughey did this State a profound disservice.  He devalued the State as a political entity because he devalued the profession of politics and, thereby, he devalued our status as fellow politicians.  We have collectively been lowered in public esteem as a result of the self-serving swathe he cut through public probity and, when it came to the Lenihan fund, common decency.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This is the dilemma that faces us.  On the one hand, we must search out the truth and face up to its implications.  On the other hand, the damage that is done in the process is suffered by all of us currently involved in politics.  The only way to rebut the claim that &ldquo;all politicians are the same, they are all at it&rdquo; is to demonstrate convincingly that standards have changed, that the rules are different, that new rule changes are on the way and that there is no going back to that discredited and utterly discreditable way of doing the public&rsquo;s business.</P>

	<P>No one was surprised at the findings of the report of the Moriarty tribunal on the personal finances of the late Mr. Charles Haughey.  The manner in which he conducted himself while holding high office has been well exposed before now and is confirmed by the report.  Equally, if not more important is the light the report sheds on the relationship between privileged people in politics, and big business and financial services.  Charles Haughey benefited from this relationship.  While small customers were treated by AIB with the utmost severity, the privileged, such as Mr. Haughey were allowed to default on huge debts.  As a beneficiary of the Ansbacher scam, the late former Taoiseach was one of a select few wealthy people facilitated in hiding their money offshore and evading tax in the late 1980s.</P>
        <P>Let it not be forgotten that companies that aided the Ansbacher rip-off of the ordinary taxpayer included Cement Roadstone Holdings, from whose head office the scam was run.  CRH is still one of the most powerful players in the Irish economy, with a virtual monopoly on the <Col N="1158"/>construction material market.  It has benefited hugely from the speculator-driven and anti-people planning and development policies of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats in Government for the past decade.</P>
        <P>While legislation has made it more difficult for politicians to benefit personally from the types of dealings exposed by the tribunal, a golden circle still exists.  Without doubt decisions have been taken by Government that were against the public interest and in the interest of its friends in big business.  A classic example is the changing of Part V of the Planning and Development Act after intensive lobbying by developers.  The original Part V required developers to provide 20% social and affordable housing in all developments.  This was changed by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government at the developers&rsquo; behest to allow them to buy their way out of their obligations by paying money to local authorities.  As a direct result, low-income families have been deprived of homes.</P>
        <P>We have seen the granting of major tax concessions to the developers of private hospitals.  The former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, admitted he introduced this concession after lobbying by a private hospital developer in his constituency.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has extended the concession by making public hospital land available to developers of private hospitals.  Just as scandalous as anything in this report is the ongoing robbery of our natural gas and oil by multinationals which were handed these resources by successive governments.</P>
        <P>What of the role of the former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, and other Ministers still with us in making and maintaining sweetheart deals with the multinationals?  Do they not warrant an inquiry?  Instead the Government has ridden roughshod over the community in Rossport and robbed this and future generations of what are rightly ours.  Why have we not had a tribunal on the privatisation of Eircom to the benefit of multi-millionaires such as Tony O&rsquo;Reilly and at the expense of many thousands of small shareholders who were conned?  As a result we have a substandard telecommunications infrastructure in the hands of a private monopoly.  Far from regretting this, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats went on to privatise the national airline, Aer Lingus.  All of these measures are legal, but against the public interest and in the interest of a golden circle that still exists here.</P>
        <P>The report of the Moriarty tribunal states that the conduct of Charles Haughey &ldquo;devalued the quality of modern democracy&rdquo;.  That devaluation continues to this day and never more so than under this politically bankrupt Government.  Efforts should be made to retrieve the taxpayers&rsquo; hard-earned funds.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Moriarty tribunal report, which <Col N="1159"/>dealt with payments to Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry.  It is a very important and detailed report and I commend Mr. Justice Moriarty and his excellent team for their top-class work.  It is a sad day for politics and those in public life &mdash; Deputies, Senators and councillors.  As a former member of Dublin City Council, I know that many councillors are very upset over what has happened over the years on this issue.</P>
        <P>Corruption and sleaze in politics are simply wrong.  There should be no fudge, no dithering and no dodging the issue.  It is simply wrong and all politicians should say so.  Being elected to the Oireachtas is a great honour and privilege.  Many of us have worked hard to get here.  When we witness events such as those outlined in the Moriarty tribunal report it deeply disturbs us.  We are elected on the trust of our people.  That trust should never be damaged or tainted in any way.  The report clearly shows how certain politicians did that.  All the major parties need to examine themselves.  It is not just one or two individuals.  We need to review the role of big business and vested interests, and their political connection.  Even in 2007 big builders, developers and those with big resources are supporting and actively lobbying certain Deputies, which is not acceptable and is dangerous.  The decision-making process can be compromised very easily.</P>
        <P>There is a way forward on this issue.  Many of us believe the two most important things in politics are hard work and honest politics.  We need to challenge those out there.  Sadly we lose 20% to 30% of the voters at each election because they have become disillusioned.  I constantly hear &ldquo;You are all the same&rdquo; on the doorsteps.  We are not all the same and it is not acceptable.  I challenge people who say that and do not vote.  Many of us here do our best.  We try honest politics, try hard work and we get on.  I agree we have a vested interest.  My vested interest is to represent working people, the elderly and the disabled.  That is my mandate and I have the honour to represent the people of Dublin North-Central.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Moriarty&rsquo;s report states that the whole issue can only be said to have devalued the quality of a modern democracy.  This is what happened with those individuals and many other individuals, many of whom have not yet been caught.  I do not take the high moral ground on this issue.  There is nothing wrong in demanding and expecting high standards in our politics, which is crucial to the debate on the Moriarty tribunal report.</P>
        <P>Ireland was once known as the land of saints and scholars.  However, today it is better known as the land of scandals and tribunals.  It is not just politicians.  Banking, the church, business, the medical profession and the Garda have all suffered from erosion of public confidence in the wake of an astonishing list of scandals.  Moreover Ireland has undergone rapid social economic and political change in the past decade, which has had <Col N="1160"/>a profound impact on our value system.  Ireland at the start of the 21st century is fairly prosperous, which I welcome.  However, difficult decisions need to be made about the distribution of resources and questions need to be asked.  How can the tension between the rights of the individuals and the overall good of society be resolved?  To whom do we look for guidance?  The political elite, the church, the medical and legal profession, and business leaders have all had their credibility damaged, which we must also face up to.  I believe these issues are relevant to the debate.</P>
        <P>Earlier I heard the Taoiseach say that history would be the final judge of Mr. Haughey.  In reality the Taoiseach should come out straight and say it was simply wrong.  It is not acceptable for him to ask us to leave it to history.  The serious misappropriation of donations intended to assist with the medical treatment of the late Mr. Brian Lenihan was appalling.  It was disgraceful that money from a medical treatment fund was taken for personal benefit.  It is appalling for something like this to happen in someone&rsquo;s private life or public life.  I welcome the sensible Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.  There are times when we may feel that some of their requirements are over the top, but nevertheless they exist.</P>
        <P>It is not just a question of legislation.  It is up to each individual in the House to get on with the job and root out corruption and sleaze in politics.  As one of the more recent arrivals to this House, I believe this is something on which we should all unite.  I thank Mr. Justice Moriarty for this excellent report and I reiterate that the way forward in Irish politics is through honest politics and hard work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Thar ceann an Chomhaontais Ghlais, f&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an deis seo labhairt ar thuairisc U&iacute; Mhuircheartaigh.  It is regrettable that we do not have the opportunity for question and answers on this matter because the response of the Taoiseach to the report is characterised by a word, &ldquo;surprise&rdquo;.  He tells us he was surprised to discover that Mr. Haughey had a darker side.  He was surprised to find out about the pilfering, equivalent to &euro;41 million, during his career and he said he was surprised if any party had as high standards as Fianna F&aacute;il in the way it operates its leader&rsquo;s allowance, which indicates a see-no-evil, hear-no-evil type of approach.  Parties generally have been ahead of the posse in respect of being accountable for the leader&rsquo;s allowance.  In my party, I would be happy to have absolute clarity and transparency because it is important to have that in regard to all public funding.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to speculate on &ldquo;what if&rdquo;.  As a correspondent in <i>The Irish Times  </i>wrote, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, regrets that he signed blank cheques for Charles Haughey, but who would be Taoiseach today if he had refused?  The RTE programme, &ldquo;What If&rdquo;, which Diarmuid Ferriter presents on a Sunday morning, <Col N="1161"/>has speculated on a number of &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenarios in Irish history.  In terms of modern Irish history, the &ldquo;what if&rdquo; in this case would be quite interesting.  What if the Taoiseach had refused to sign those cheques?  I would certainly like to hear what the Taoiseach would have to say about that if he was present.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach gives the impression that all is well and that things have been put in order, but things are not all well.  First, we are down &euro;25 million so far on the cost of this report.  The country is down another &euro;215 million in regard to the various tribunals so far.  That is money that could have been better spent &mdash; &euro;39 million would have given us an extra 1,000 teachers for our classrooms, thus reducing the pupil-teacher ratio, as promised by the Government, while  &euro;97 million would have provided medical cards for children under six years of age.  We would have been able to get the extra garda&iacute; who might have prevented much of the hyperbole from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which adds to the heartache of crime in society.  Given that we are down that money, an apology is due on that score for a start.</P>
        <P>Second, there is the continuing temptation put in the way of unscrupulous and seemingly wealthy developers who can exploit a dysfunctional property market to the detriment of everyone else.  Those rules have not changed, notwithstanding the indication that they resulted in corruption previously.  I have no reason to believe that has all gone away.  There is the poverty that results from that for people who are locked into high mortgages, the working-poor as they tend to be called nowadays.  There is child poverty caused by great poverty, illness caused by great poverty and also illness caused by great wealth, which is ironic in this country but also in the rest of the western world.  Essentially, we have a dysfunctional property market which is at the root of much of that corruption.</P>
        <P>The long-standing Justice Kenny report on property and building land of 1973 has been studiously ignored by successive Governments.  All the talk about implementing its recommendations has been followed by zilch action.  Therein lies another indication of things not being well and in need of being addressed on foot of this report.</P>
        <P>The corporate donations scenario has huge billboards appearing like mushrooms all around the country, payment for which comes with the acceptance that those with a lot of money can essentially influence the political system by giving donations.  That is what is happening.</P>
        <P>Much of the genesis of the tribunals, certainly the beef tribunal, came from not giving factual replies in the House.  A change in Standing Orders is needed to force replies to be given.  Last week, I referred to an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and the Taoiseach accused me of writing it.  I have a letter here from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which I quoted to the Taoiseach and he accused <Col N="1162"/>me &mdash; as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> today &mdash; of showing him a bogus letter.  There is a need for accountability in the House and if we are not to have that, we are destined for further tribunals, needless expenditure, needless waste and a continuing bad name for politics.</P>
        <P>The Irish branch of Transparency International, on foot of the Moriarty tribunal, has called for additional powers for the Standards in Public Office Commission and full disclosure of financial accounts by political parties, covering not just the three weeks coming up to expenditure on an election, but between one election day and the next &mdash; total transparency.  They acknowledge the benefit of the tribunal in exposing the wrongdoing which facilitated widespread tax evasion, the illegal sale of passports, the theft of charitable and party political funds and the recouping of substantial sums in tax revenue.  Further still, they call for anti-corruption measures.  The fact that we are not getting that from these statements is the reason we need to return to this report and have questions and answers which, hopefully, would lead to some accountability.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This report is necessary, timely and extremely clear.  It is damning, shocking and forensic.  Above all, it is credible.  The greatest respect we can give this report is to implement a programme of fundamental reforms to ensure the events outlined in its pages do not recur.  We do not need gestures, verbiage or crass political narratives but action, delivery, legislation and follow through, reform on firm foundations, new norms and new demands of us all.  Earlier Deputy Finian McGrath said corruption and sleaze in politics is wrong.  Of course it is wrong in every part of society.  That is the reason we change our laws when we become aware of issues in order to ensure they do not recur.  </P>
        <P>This House must show a determination that concrete change flows from the events exposed in the 700 pages of this report.  Our bottom line is that we must shape a political system which lives up to the values and expectations of ordinary decent people.  That is why we introduced the Standards in Public Office Acts.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to whisteblowers.  Section 5 of the Act provides immunity for a person who makes a complaint in good faith and protection against any issue surfacing.  It provides that where a person in good faith makes a complaint, no cause of action shall lie against that person.  We looked at putting the whole issue of whistleblowers into a single Act but the strong advice from those from whom we take it, the Civil Service and the Attorney General, was that rather than put it into one single Act, it should be done on a sectoral basis.  That has happened ever since, based on what was in the Standards in Public Office Act.</P><Col N="1163"/>
        <P>We introduced statutory codes of practice and guidelines for officeholders and oversight for independent standards in the Standards in Public Office Commission.  We introduced electoral Acts which impose high standards regarding political donations and expenditure.  Through these reforms we have fundamentally altered, updated and reformed the old procedures.  That was the most appropriate response to the events outlined in the Moriarty report.  This process of reform, under way before publication of the report, will continue.  The report strengthens our resolve in that respect.</P>
        <P>The Government has moved comprehensively to deal with the legacy of past reform through financial companies and taxation systems.  The fundamental restructuring of the Revenue Commissioners created a dedicated investigations and prosecutions division to drive stronger anti-evasion operations and to bring prosecutions in cases of tax and duty evasion.</P>
        <P>Other measures include granting extensive additional statutory powers to Revenue, advancing codes of practice to guard against conflicts of interest, establishing the Financial Regulator as a single financial regulatory authority specifically mandated to protect consumers and better reporting of financial irregularities between State agencies.  The Financial Regulator is now empowered to report the suspicious proceeds of tax evasion and all forms of money laundering to the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners.  We imposed a proactive obligation on the Financial Regulator to report all suspicious transactions.  We introduced an ambitious programme to update and modernise the Companies Act and went ahead with strengthening the prevention of corruption legislation, including in it, as the Taoiseach already mentioned, a presumption of corruption for non-disclosure of a significant political donation in particular circumstances.  This sort of programme and these kind of forward-looking and concrete reforms is the appropriate response to the Moriarty report.</P>
        <P>Some of the hardest reading in this report relates to the abuse of the party leader&rsquo;s account.  The events outlined in this report have brought about a radical overhaul of the party leader&rsquo;s account system.  The report acknowledges that it is noteworthy that the Taoiseach has insisted on reforming that system.  Within Fianna F&aacute;il, the party auditors must now present the audited accounts of the party to its national trustees, treasurers and senior party officials.  This money must be spent for the good of the party.  Under Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach, we have changed the legislation governing such accounts.  The old system where party leaders had huge discretion in the use of the account has been changed.</P>
        <P>Today, the proper application of the leader&rsquo;s parliamentary allowance is spelled out.  We have defined the meaning of expenses arising from <Col N="1164"/>parliamentary activities and demand an audited statement of the expenditure from the allowance.  We demand that the statement be given to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  We have cleared away the previous ambiguities.  We did not have to wait for this report.  We acted as was proper and on the demand of the people.  If further reforms are necessitated by the findings of this report or the final Moriarty report, we stand ready to implement them.  The greatest respect we can give to this report is to implement a programme of fundamental reforms to ensure the events outlined in these pages do not recur.</P>
        <P>Throughout the 1990s and the early part of this decade, a profound social, economic and cultural modernisation occurred throughout this country.  As part of that process, many of the old elites and stratifications have been questioned, weakened and put in their proper place, not by politicians or commentators but by ordinary people.  The relationship between the people and the church, politicians, banks and even the paramilitaries has changed utterly.  Particular triggers and catalysts, such as the Eamonn Casey affair, the murder of Robert McCartney, the events outlined in this report or the banking scandals, set out profound shifts in the relationship between the public and these groups.  These shifts have been overwhelmingly positive and are a sign of a confident, independent people with positive values who are leading, not being led, and are rejecting corruption, hypocrisy and the blind acceptance of authority.  Our programme of reform is attempting to create the system to live up to those values and to give the people the standards in public office they expect and deserve from those whose sole purpose, as Deputy Finian McGrath said, is to serve the people.</P>
        <P>I do not believe one can contort the complex life and character of Charles Haughey into a single political narrative.  Those who have tried have not been credible.  The public understand the complexities because he was neither all hero nor all villain, neither all good nor all bad.  What the Taoiseach &mdash; the president of Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; said at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard Fh&eacute;is in 1997 and at the grave of Mr. Haughey was true, proper and right.  People understand the complexities of the man.  Let us leave the rest to historians.  Let us focus on the future rather than the past, but let us learn from the past on the job of reform and building a system that lives up to the values of decent, ordinary Irish people.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kenny was incorrect in saying earlier that my party did not condemn wrongdoing.  We did condemn it every time it was proven.  I very much look forward to the later report of Mr. Justice Moriarty and hope that, at that stage, we will have further reforming to do in this House.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="1165"/>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>History will pass judgment on Mr. Haughey and his work.  My father was a Fianna F&aacute;il supporter and thought highly of Mr. Haughey because of certain things he did in his lifetime, particularly in respect of artists and writers.  However, he would be very disappointed to read this report, as I was.  I suppose the most salutary page to read is the one that reiterates the money he received time and time again.  People gave him money and we do not know what happened to it, but we know he received it.  </P>
        <P>It shows that there was something rotten in Ireland at that time.  We have not changed it fully.  We have not changed corruption and the opportunity for corruption in significant ways, notwithstanding the changes that have been made with the Standards in Public Office Commission.</P>
        <P>The most significant possibility for change is around the law governing rezoning and development plans.  Other tribunals have shown that, time and time again, when councillors were about to make decisions on rezoning and development plans, they were visited on their doorsteps, not by people speaking on behalf of the public interest but those speaking on behalf of developers and landowners who pushed and made their way into those people&rsquo;s pockets with cash or cheques.</P>
        <P>We must have more transparency about these times.  When rezoning and new development plans are up for review, if any member of a local authority meets anybody about these plans, he or she should declare this.  A simple register which, for example, could record that a councillor met Johnny Murphy from the residents&rsquo; association who was making representations about specific rezoning issues or met Joe Murphy, a developer, in connection with his plans for 200 houses, would suffice.  There is nothing wrong with discussing things in committees or in public and we should have this forum in a public place, namely, the local authority chamber and nowhere else.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding that, I understand that sometimes communities want to make their points to other people.  If we have transparency, openness and accountability about those times and meetings through recording them and making it publicly known that they have taken place, this in itself will help change the system.  It is a simple process that I believe will work and make public life more transparent and open when millions are made overnight as a result of councillors&rsquo; decisions.  It will allow us to know exactly who met these councillors, what they spoke about and what the issues were.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year ended with yet another report critical of aspects of Fianna F&aacute;il political leadership being laid before the House.  What I read in the Moriarty report leads me to question what it says for our heritage.  It is unsatisfactory that when faced with troublesome past actions and inaction, some can so easily settle for an expedient rationale of mistakes, namely, incompetence, when the core issue is character.</P><Col N="1166"/>
        <P>The question of remembering then arises.  Forgetfulness is something that can happen to us all.  When asked to recall if any alarm bells ever rang and if they ever heard any words of concern about low standards in high places, some claimed they could not remember.  They cannot recall if they ever knew anything.  Yet, the contradiction is that they can now remember with certainty that whatever happened, it did not happen as stated in the report.</P>
        <P>The question becomes what heritage we will bequeath to the following generations.  We want the highest standards of law enforcement and justice when it comes to serious and violent crime, drug dealers, the carnage on the roads, the carelessness of young drivers &mdash; an important issue which must be dealt with &mdash; and in so many other areas of society.  We must demand the same high standards of Government.  If we ask for the highest standards from others, we must also demand them of ourselves.</P>
        <P>I have faith in the commitment of the people to the old-fashioned virtues of integrity and competence.  In the past, when times were hard, people believed that prosperity would come from hard work and honesty.  Grandparents and parents nurtured ordinary decent values through education, by their words and by their actions.  They taught us that honesty, decency, integrity and doing good are simple virtues that matter profoundly.  They set a standard for all our actions.  The ethical test, like life itself, was simple then.  As a country we had our ups and downs.  Mistakes were made and those involved can claim that they were all small.  Anyway, many minor ethical departures did not make for a major concern.  In addition, there was a reluctance to shoulder responsibility for the social consequences of the tough political decisions evaded.  The bill was posted to those who accepted that they should pay their taxes.</P>
        <P>People shape their own character and, thus, their destiny in the initiatives taken to solve life&rsquo;s tough problems and in the sacrifices made in choosing one path over another.  Everything connects together through character.  People have distinctive personalities that shape attitudes and behaviour.  We must make allowances for a few small flaws on the basis that benefits follow from many other more positive talents.  In the past we have been persuaded that the greater the talents, the greater should be our tolerance for a leader&rsquo;s flaws.  People understand ordinary human failings and forgiveness is an enduring feature of Christianity.  We understood the essential difference between the sinner and the sin and there was a healthy scepticism of those who righteously preached values and virtues, which was endorsed by the occasional spectacle of some falling from their lofty perch.  However, as we have grown wiser, the more we understand that the balancing act between private flaws and public duties is unstable for a few powerful people.  Like a spider&rsquo;s web, the flaws morph into threads that reach <Col N="1167"/>out to bridge the gap between the highest standards of personal integrity and the most minimal legal necessity, and then some more.  All who come close are entangled and, after the gale has gone, history and heritage remain.  Our heritage defines part of our identity and there is much in our history in which we can take pride.</P>
        <P>For those events recorded for posterity in the Moriarty report, there is a requirement to formally mark the end of that era, not only with another report, but with a new Government.  The old adage tells us there is a limit to the number of straws the camel can carry.  The report is about events and a blind loyalty to silence that we do not wish to be part of our future.  Only a new start with a new Government can ensure this happens.  This report, which took years to compile, is a damning indictment of the difficulties people encountered throughout the political system.  Young people find it very hard to connect with politics.  It is a great honour to be elected by the people to represent them in the national Parliament and that involves significant trust, which has been so badly damaged that it has affected the body politic.  Clearly, that is why there is much scepticism among young people regarding politicians and their work.  They are quite cynical about the political system, even when one visits schools.</P>
        <P>The report is critical.  The intoxication of power, which was evident during the time under investigation, was the basis of the greatest mistake of all, as people used power for the sake of power and they added considerably to the intoxication.  The next generation of politicians will be subject to the ethics in public office legislation, which is commendable.  However, when there was no money in the economy in the 1980s and 1990s and there was mass emigration and people paid a standard rate of tax of 28% and high corporation tax while being hammered in every sense, it was totally wrong of those involved to take advantage of power for the sake of it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Going forward, the country will demand openness, transparency, honesty and integrity of office regardless of the achievements of those in office.  The ultimate test will be their ability to uphold old, decent values relating to integrity, competence and accountability and to stand for what they believe in regardless.  All one has at the end of the day is one&rsquo;s name.  One will be judged on what one speaks honestly about, what one acts upon and how one represents one&rsquo;s constituents.  That is the ultimate test.  While the duration of the inquiry has been criticised, Mr. Justice Moriarty must be complimented on this extensive report.  It is disappointing that a question and answer session on the report has not been facilitated, given the cost involved, the time it took to compile and the searching questions it addressed.  Members should have been permitted to seek answers.</P><Col N="1168"/>
        <P>I am delighted to have contributed to the debate because the publication of the report represents an important milestone.  What happened during these difficult times cannot be repeated in a free country.  While it is disappointing that these events took place, at least people are being brought to account for it.</P>

	<P>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated, Charlie Haughey was not all hero or all villain and he was not all bad or all good.  However, as I read the Moriarty report last night, I was absolutely astounded by the scale and enormity of the payments made between 1979 and the early 1990s.  The number of payments and the variety of people who made them are absolutely staggering.  Charles Haughey is gone and the reports suggest that in a number of cases the payments influenced actions that were taken.  However, it is a tribunal of inquiry and not a court of law.</P>
        <P>A huge cloud hung over Charles Haughey during his twilight years when he should have enjoyed days of glory, which is regrettable.  At the end of the day, he received in excess of &pound;9 million, which is the equivalent of &euro;45 million today, according to the Taoiseach.  It is paradoxical that as a result of these ill gotten moneys, Mr. Haughey only paid &euro;5 million in a tax settlement, which is a relatively small amount.  The money he received enabled him to retain and improve his estate in north County Dublin, which expanded significantly during the period in question.  At the same time, as I travel around his old constituency, I meet elderly people who point out that he introduced the free travel scheme, provided decent increases in the old age pension and introduced succession rights for women and children.  He was also responsible for significant developments in the arts, such as Aosd&aacute;na, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, as was highlighted during RTE&rsquo;s arts programme last night, as well as the development of Government Buildings, Temple Bar and the IFSC.  As the Minister for Foreign Affairs asked, is he all hero or all villain?  A balance must be struck in this regard.  Deputy Kenny referred to Machiavelli and the princes and an analogy can be drawn between Charles J. Haughey and the princes served by Machiavelli.</P>
        <P>The report does not reflect well on the work of the Revenue during this period.  The then chief inspector of taxes should be commended for seeking from the Taoiseach of the day his income tax returns from the early 1980s until 1991.  The tenacity of the chief inspector &mdash; whom I will not name because he still works in Revenue &mdash; should be acknowledged.  I refer to the issue of tax evasion, which is mentioned in the report.  Many people feel it is worthwhile evading tax because if they can invest their money in an enterprise, they can easily afford to pay what they owe when they are caught five or ten years later on the basis of the increase in the value of their assets.  I suggest the Minister would put in place a system to <Col N="1169"/>ensure some way by which an assessment would be made of the present value of all the moneys, including the gains that are made, rather than the historical value.  I commend Mr. Justice Moriarty on the report.  Lessons are to be learned and we have much work to do to ensure people think highly of politics, politicians and people in high office.  Let us work on that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My maiden speech in this House in September 1997 was on the McCracken report and the foundation of the tribunal we are discussing today.  At that time, cos&uacute;il leis na Teachta&iacute; eile at&aacute; sa Teach anois, bh&iacute;omar l&aacute;n de dh&oacute;chas agus an-bhr&oacute;d&uacute;il as a bheith anseo, taking our responsibilities from a very free, democratic first D&aacute;il and taking on board our responsibilities to the electorate and those who had put their trust in us.</P>
        <P>It was very clear to me then, as it is almost ten years later, that the duties and the way we discharge our duties, the way we perform our work and responsibilities and the obligations we have to our electorate are very legitimate topics for scrutiny by the public.  What we have in the Moriarty tribunal is an indepth analysis of those responsibilities and duties of people in the past.  It is critically important the public would continue to have confidence in us as Members of the Oireachtas, in the people whom they elect and in their Government.  Because if they do not, then the cornerstone of democracy is shaken.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The McCracken report revealed to us for the first time payments that had been made to politicians and leaders which shocked all of us in this House.  We probably did not realise ten years ago it would take ten years for us to get to this stage where we are talking about the report of the Moriarty tribunal, but these findings have proven the value of having set up that tribunal ten years ago.  The findings for any one of us in this House are truly shocking because they show how public life has been let down, how the public has been let down and how I as a Minister and a member of Fianna F&aacute;il have been let down by a former party leader and a former Taoiseach.  What was found in that report was obviously a great tragedy for Mr. Haughey himself, a man who had great potential and did achieve so much, but it also highlighted the wrongs of tax evasion, of gifts received and the misuse of monetary donations.  That has done not just himself but the whole of public life a terrible disservice.</P>
        <P>In my job as Minister for Education and Science, I am trying to encourage young people to take an interest in the political process, in representative politics, for them to become involved in their communities and to be willing to become leaders in their own right and yet when they look to that report, unfortunately, they tar us all with the same brush.  That is why it was critically important legislation and procedures were put in place in recent years to ensure we had the open<Col N="1170"/>ness, accountability and transparency that is now required of us.  The procedures now in place are very strict and rightly so.  The demands on us are very strict and rightly so because we have to ensure our conduct is such that it maintains the integrity of this House.  In so doing, we are maintaining the integrity of the democratic process.</P>
        <P>If we do any of the things our former leaders were found to be doing by the Moriarty tribunal, then we will forfeit the respect of the people.  Democracy is so crucial that we cannot afford to lose that respect.  The Moriarty tribunal has done us all a great service, even if we did not like to hear of the findings and to read them.  We have to make sure the procedures we put in place are protected and strengthened and the shadow that is cast on the entire public service and, unfortunately, on all of us as politicians, is something we can continue to lift to ensure people see us in a different and more positive light.</P>
        <P>Even before we set up the tribunals it came to light that Ireland was not the only place where questions were being asked about standards in public life.  In his report in 1995 to the British Parliament, Lord Nolan commented on standards in public life.  The principles he used then as being required of people in public life and which underpin public life are just as relevant for Ireland.  The seven principles he listed were selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership.  There is no doubt the investigations and the thorough work of Mr. Justice Michael Moriarty and his team have shown up serious deficiencies in a number, if not all of those principles.  With that knowledge and with the regulatory framework that is now in place such as the taxation requirements etc., we have to make sure there is no further departure from those principles and that each of us as Members, who again will face the electorate this year, can proudly stand for those self-same principles.  If one loses honesty, accountability or selflessness, one is doing a terrible disservice to the public who fought for our democracy and the right to vote for us and who believe in our ability to lead them.  That is what leadership is all about.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have evidence of a past leader who has let us down, as members of Fianna F&aacute;il and Members of this House, and who has let the country down.  The only way we can ensure the future respect of the people is for each of us to continue to maintain the highest of standards, not just because the rules, regulations and procedures require that of us, but because people have placed their trust in us.  That is a trust we earn but we must also deserve to keep it because the honour bestowed on us should be transferred into making us honourable persons in public life.  It is a great privilege to be here.  I did not think I would be speaking on the very same topic I spoke on in my maiden speech ten years later.  I sincerely hope I will not be talking about the same topic in ten years' time.  I hope we can continue to maintain the respect of the people.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> when there will be 100% availability of broadband throughout the country; the extent to which he expects the uptake to occur; the extent to which these targets compare to the development of broadband facilities in other European countries; if he has identified the issues that have impeded the development of broadband here; if he has directly or through the regulator set out measures to address the issues with particular reference to the needs of industry, the health services and the domestic sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[5723/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The role of Government is to implement regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of affordable, high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.</P>
        <P>The Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill, which was published this month, is primarily designed to strengthen the regulatory framework for the electronic communications sector.  The Bill will enable ComReg to achieve one of its primary functions, the promotion of competition, thereby leading to better and more competitively priced telecommunications services for consumers.  This Bill is on the priority list of legislation for enactment by the Government during the current term of the D&aacute;il.  I expect to bring it before the House shortly.</P>
        <P>The Government has also taken the initiative to address market failure through investment in the construction of the high speed, open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, while also grant aiding rural broadband projects under the group broadband scheme.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, there are parts of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  It is planned to address the question of availability of broadband to the remaining 10%-15% via a new scheme which, when it is fully rolled out, will <Col N="1172"/>ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met.  A steering group comprising representatives of my Department and ComReg is finalising the outline of the scheme.  This new scheme will supersede the group broadband scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware of the seriousness of the deficiency in broadband availability in many urban and rural areas?  Is he aware that the lack of facilities is similar to the lack of telephone facilities in the late 1970s and early 1980s?  It is impeding the development of the industrial sector, the health services, the education sector and the entire economy.  How will the Minister, along with the private sector, address these deficiencies in the short term given the years of expectations?  The public service obligation should have been able to deliver this service in a much shorter period than has been the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the matters the Deputy raises.  Parts of the country have poor broadband facilities.  The Government initiated the MAN programme in 2002 and the group broadband scheme.  It is now considering a new scheme to target 10%-15% of the country.  Under its new management, Eircom has examined the matter and is willing to address some of the deficiencies.</P>
        <P>There has been a massive increase in the number of subscribers to broadband, particularly in the past 12-18 months.  In the past 12 months there has been an increase of 106% in take-up.  In October 2004, I set a target of 400,000 broadband subscribers at the end of last year.  The figure was exceeded in August 2006.  At this stage, I expect that we have over 500,000 subscribers in Ireland.  The percentage of households covered is over 11%, up from 3% at the start of 2005.  The major increase in uptake is due to the greater availability, the demand side measures and the publicity given to the importance of broadband.  We have not yet arrived, which is why we set up the national broadband scheme in conjunction with the private sector.  We will announce tender details in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Has the Minister assessed the reasons for the delay in the provision of nationwide broadband?  Is it due to failure on the part of the private sector or the Minister&rsquo;s or the regulator&rsquo;s lethargy?  Will he address the issues that have caused this serious delay, such as investment, local loop unbundling, exchange enabling and the modern infrastructure required for a telecommunications service?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The reasons for the delay are obvious.  Initially, the private sector did not invest.  The dotcom collapse at the turn of the decade meant that there was little investment from the private sector.  The Government decided <Col N="1173"/>in 2002 that it needed to stimulate the market.  The private sector would respond that it is in the business of making money and should not be expected to provide broadband where it is not economic to do so.  The Government addressed this through the group broadband scheme.  The take-up of this was good in some areas but the scheme was not available in other areas. </P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to the role of the regulator.  He did everything in his power to make progress on number portability, local loop unbundling and other matters.  He was thwarted at every attempt through the courts.  Unofficially, I have heard that many of the difficulties with local loop unbundling are being addressed.  If other difficulties arise, the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill will grant the regulator additional powers to deal with them.  The Deputy has been supportive of the Bill.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the steps he has taken in view of the fact that the cost of the fuel value of wheat and maize has risen dramatically since the Bush initiative to replace Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on petrochemicals by developing and processing the bio-refining of lignocellulose feedstocks, which would give Ireland ample oil additives and platform chemicals and would have the knock-on effect of increasing domestic employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My primary ministerial responsibility regarding bio-fuels is in the energy context and consequently in the production of bio-fuels to increase penetration in the transport sector.  While I have no specific responsibility for the production of petrochemicals for industrial processes, I am aware that second generation biomass conversion technologies could, over time, provide a suitable fuel and product for both sectors. </P>
        <P>I am giving major priority to the accelerated development of energy research, technology development and innovation to underpin energy policy goals, including bio-energy development and deployment.  The development this year of a comprehensive Energy Research Strategy 2008-2013 overseen by the Irish Energy Research Council will set out the overall priorities.</P>
        <P>The recently announced Charles Parsons awards included funding for biomass-related research.  Under this programme, funding of almost &euro;12 million is being provided to four universities on the island of Ireland for the purposes of accelerating research in several energy-related areas including biomass.  This research will give us valuable information under Irish climatic conditions which will inform policy on the optimisation of land use for biomass purposes.</P><Col N="1174"/>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, is also supporting research work in second generation technologies through, for example, grant aid to an Irish university which is involved in an EU framework programme 6 project investigating the development of biomass-to-liquid, BTL.  In BTL, biomass is converted to synthesis gas through gasification and the synthesis gas can be subsequently transformed to liquid fuel.</P>
        <P>The emphasis on the production of ethanol in the bio-fuels mineral oil tax relief scheme II supports the building of expertise in ethanol production in Ireland.  This could have long-term benefits for the production and blending of second generation bio-fuels which use similar but more complex technologies and processes.  A total of 11 applications were received under the bioethanol category in the second mineral oil tax relief scheme and four of these were successful in being awarded excise relief up to 2010.  This will allow for the production of 306 million litres of bioethanol up to 2010.</P>
        <P>As a contracting party to the International Energy Agency, IEA, bioenergy implementing agreement, Ireland has signed up to participate in task 39, which deals with developments in liquid bio-fuels and particularly second generation technology.  Ireland has also signed up as an observer to the new IEA bioenergy implementing agreement, task 42, which deals specifically with biorefineries.  These international linkages position us well to monitor and benefit from international developments in this field and to identify appropriate applications for the Irish context.</P>

	<P>I tabled this as a priority question to the Minister for Agriculture and Food because my premise was to make farming more viable.  I cannot understand what this question has to do with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  Will the Leas-Cheann Comhairle rule on whether I am in the right place to ask this question which was strictly directed at the Minister for Agriculture and Food?  We cannot grow the crops to which I refer at sea; they must be grown on land.  What does that have to do with this Department?</P>

	<P>Agriculture has been closed down as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is wrong and I protest in the strongest possible terms that my question was not put to the Department to which I wanted it put, the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The Bush initiative would increase the price of wheat by 40% which is good for the Irish farmer.  Extracting ethanol from wheat and maize cannot be considered a feasible option because the price is too high.  The Government was alerted some time ago to the possibility of building a sustainable industry with indigenous produce.  That produce is the lignocelluloses feedstuffs to produce oil additives and platform chemicals that can replace our dependence on petrochemicals.  It would revitalise our agriculture, bring people back to the land and provide employment in hub towns and cities.  What has the Minister done about it?  He can do nothing about it because the question should be answered by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Does the Minister agree with me? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be happy to see the Minister for Agriculture and Food answering this question but responsibility for bio-fuels falls within the remit of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  In keeping with the Government&rsquo;s approach to joined-up thinking, the production of bio-fuels has a value for agriculture.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food made announcements recently about start-up grants and grants for energy-related crops, all of which are designed to feed into a bio-fuels industry.  If I understood the Deputy correctly, there is a link between the bio-fuels and farming.  Growing energy crops such as miscanthus, willow and rape seed will offer a new source of income for farmers.  The Government&rsquo;s policies on bio-fuels attempt to build up that industry, encourage farmers to change practices and sow particular crops for that industry.</P>
        <P>Through the mineral oil tax relief scheme we have encouraged people to set up refineries to put the bio-fuels in place.  The talk about bio-fuels may be positive from a farmer&rsquo;s point of view but not so from other people&rsquo;s point of view.  If people must compete for wheat, maize, rape seed oil or sugar beet for bioethanol or other crops, there could be a danger that because it is attractive to produce bio-fuels from these crops, the amount of the crops used for food or feedstuff might be diminished or push the prices beyond the reach of farmers.  There are advantages and disadvantages in this argument.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1176"/>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I estimate that this crop would yield a profit of &euro;1,000 per hectare.  That is a lot of money, especially in the west.  Does the Minister agree that our over-dependence on foreign produce will cost us jobs in the long run?  I have two letters from major companies in my area of County Clare to the effect that if the cost of energy does not come down, they will relocate to the countries from which they came.  This is serious.  We must have a viable farming community and stop the flight from the land.  A total of 40% of our farmers are part-time.  If we continue to let this happen and not provide an income for farmers, approximately 20% of the farming community will be in full-time farming by 2015. </P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for answering the question but I still believe it was for the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Does the Minister agree that our over-dependence on foreign oils and fuels will put jobs at risk?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no question but that the cost of energy can pose dangers to Irish agriculture and industry.  We have seen examples in this regard.  I agree with the Deputy on that point.  In general terms, however, there are advantages and disadvantages in all such activities.  The move away from fossil fuels, which we must follow, allows us the opportunity to produce bio-fuels, which in turn allows farmers the opportunity in the future to grow crops they have not grown before.  These crops can be grown in REPS areas and set aside and so on, providing an opportunity to earn an income.  Hence, there is an opportunity for people to make an income and to halt the flight from the land to which the Deputy refers.  In the future, and in keeping with what will happen everywhere else throughout the world, the number of people involved in agriculture here will probably diminish further as a result of the introduction of new methodology and much more streamlined food production.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>  the reason the Government did not follow a similar option to that of Scottish authorities with regard to recent difficulties surrounding mackerel quotas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[5523/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The opening of the mackerel fishery for the large RSW pelagic vessels was delayed until the negotiations with the EU Commission were completed and the details of the arrangements were agreed.  The discussions dealt with how the 34,802 tonnes of mackerel reported as landed illegally into Scotland by Irish vessels in the 2001-04 period should be paid back.  We suc<Col N="1177"/>cessfully delivered payback arrangements that minimised the impact on the majority of fishermen who had little or nothing to do with the illegal fishing, set the reductions at reasonable levels and spread these over six years.</P>
        <P>At national level, following careful consideration of all the issues involved and having received detailed legal advice from the Attorney General, I implemented a policy that those vessel owners reported as having landed the undeclared mackerel should bear responsibility for their actions.  The opening of the fishery at the beginning of the year in advance of the EU negotiations being finalised could have compromised the implementation of this policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a matter for the Scottish authorities to implement the quota reductions being applied as they see fit.  There is a significant difference in the situations.  I am advised that the Scottish industry did not challenge the imposition of reductions in respect of large scale illegal landings into Scotland.  Certain individuals here have put the Minister under legal notice that they may challenge the deduction of quota from their vessels.</P>
        <P>The delay in the opening of the fishery is likely to have substantially benefited processors in Ireland.  Mackerel is found in Norwegian waters at the beginning of the year and migrates south towards the waters off Ireland from mid to late January.  The late opening has supported higher levels of landings into Ireland.  To date this year, 82% of the mackerel landed has been into Ireland for processing here.  Last year, when the fishery was opened from 1 of January, only 64% of the mackerel caught during January and February was landed into Ireland.  The late opening is good for processors and is also helpful in maintaining jobs in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Regarding the deferment of the opening, an allegation was made against owners of vessels of the pelagic fleet but clearly this was unproven.  The latter had a considerable impact on a number of people.  I am delighted that it did not prevail in Scotland.</P>
        <P>In respect of the six-year arrangement, will the opening date regarding fishing by vessels of the pelagic fleet be 1 January from now on or will the date be deferred from next year?  What role will the new agency play and what recommendations will the Government take on board in the future regarding the imposition of fines in respect of alleged incidents of over-fishing?  Will the Government delegate responsibility to the new agency, the job of which is to supervise quotas and deal with any illegal activities that may occur.  As regards such activities, I refer to those relating to allegations being made and cases being brought to court and not to those involving hearsay.</P>
        <P>I accept that they may be <i>sub judice</i> but I wish to inquire about recent court proceedings.  Are these linked to the incidents of over-fishing that <Col N="1178"/>had an impact on quite a number of the owners of vessels of the pelagic fleet who had no part in the alleged offences committed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>We inherited this problem.  The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and I had an initial meeting with Commissioner Borg to discuss how the balance of the 34,000 tonnes of mackerel that were illegally landed would be dealt with.  Our objectives were to minimise the impact of the quota reductions on the majority of fishermen who had little or nothing to do with illegal fishing, to set the reductions at a reasonable level &mdash; it is important to recognise that we secured a reduction of 9,000 tonnes on the original 34,000 tonnes &mdash; and to spread these over six years.  I had a final meeting with Commissioner Borg on 18 January and he agreed to the six-year payback, the reduction of 9,000 tonnes on the original figure and backloading.  The deduction for this year will be 3,686 tonnes.  In each of the subsequent years it will be 4,178 tonnes.  This will pay back the amount declared in respect of the incidents of over-fishing.</P>
        <P>The court cases to which the Deputy refers will be subjected to the rigours of the court process.  Neither the Minister nor I would interfere in that process.  The cases must run their course through the courts and be dealt with accordingly.</P>
        <P>We convinced the Commission to accept a deal based on the fact that we wanted to ensure that people who were not involved in illegal fishing would be able to earn a decent living for the next five to six years.  The Commissioner and his committee recognised that and have accepted the proposals we put forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome Dr. Noel Cawley&rsquo;s excellent report &mdash; this mirrors Fine Gael policy &mdash; on the future opportunities for coastal communities.  How confident is the Minister of State that we can encourage more vessels to land fishing catches here for processing in order that sustainable jobs might be created in coastal communities?  Will he comment on the restrictions relating to blue whiting, which were recently a matter of some discussion in County Donegal?  Despite the apparent surplus of blue whiting off the coast, it appears that there has been a dramatic reduction in the tonnage relating to these fish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, Dr. Cawley has agreed to continue as chair of the implementation group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a good development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this because it gives the group a certain level of independence.</P>
        <P>The delay in the commencement in mackerel fishing has, as already stated, ensured a substantial increased in the amount of this fish landed and processed in Ireland this year.  This is good <Col N="1179"/>for the processors and for job creation, particularly in the north-west.  We hope this will continue to be the case in the future.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the report in question is a matter for us and Dr. Cawley to progress as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the position on blue whiting?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I attended the negotiations that took place in Brussels at Christmas.  The final meeting concluded at approximately 4 a.m. and we managed to secure the same quota for blue whiting for 2007 as that which obtained in 2006.  This was despite the fact that practically every other country wanted to substantially reduce the level of Ireland&rsquo;s quota.  We have the same quota this year as we had last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree that there is a huge potential in respect of blue whiting?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>There is always potential.  However, the difficulty lies in securing additional quota.  We were obliged to negotiate the best deal for Ireland.  For the first time in ten years, we managed to secure substantial increases in respect of a number of species and we managed to retain the same quota for blue whiting as that which obtained in 2006.  The latter was quite an achievement.  I must acknowledge the contribution of the UK Minister who, at 4 a.m., decided to allocate some of his country&rsquo;s blue whiting quota to Ireland in order that we might retain it at the 2006 level.</P>

        <QRef>[5525/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Issues relating to the terms and conditions of postmasters and post office closures are, in the first instance, matters for the board and management of An Post and ones in which I have no statutory function.  Despite this, I and some of my Cabinet colleagues have met representatives of the IPU on a number of recent occasions.  I also addressed the IPU&rsquo;s annual conference in 2005 and 2006.</P><Col N="1180"/>
        <P>Last year, to facilitate and broaden the discussions between postmasters and An Post, I appointed Eamonn Ryan to examine issues of mutual concern and to propose a plan for their resolution.  I, therefore, urge all parties to engage in negotiations in a positive manner with a view to reaching a mutually agreeable outcome.</P>
        <P>The Government continues to be committed to the objective of securing and maintaining the largest economically sustainable post office network possible.  This extends to the postmasters, whose financial security and strong relationship with customers are vital to the continued viability of the network.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Last September, Government approval was secured for An Post to enter a joint venture agreement with the Belgian bank, Fortis, to establish a retail banking business.  Key to the Government approval of this joint venture was that it not only offers a real opportunity for the growth and development of An Post and the post office network but that it will, in time, greatly benefit the income streams of postmasters.</P>
        <P>My Department and I receive regular updates on progress being made with the joint venture and have heard nothing to suggest the deal is in danger.  An Post still expects the joint venture to launch its services in early 2007.  I urge the IPU to reconsider the position it has taken in this regard, as the successful roll-out of the joint venture is of great importance to the future viability of the post office network and improving the welfare of postmasters by providing an alternative source of income.  My Department and I, in the course of meetings with An Post, have also impressed upon the company the importance of engaging with the IPU on the joint venture.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to publish a Green Paper on the post office network.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The remaining 1,300 postmasters and postmistresses have voted overwhelmingly not to engage with the Fortis project because of the dire circumstances in which they find themselves.  Next Tuesday they, along with their families and supporters, will protest outside Leinster House at the Minister&rsquo;s management of the network for the past three years.</P>
        <P>The Minister claims he has no plans to publish a Green Paper on the network.  Why not?  The British Government has launched three major postal network strategies in the past ten years to deal with some of the issues that have arisen there.  Over the past several years, the Minister has acted as the undertaker for the postal network.  In 2001, there were approximately 1,900 post offices when today there are barely over 1,300.  Ten years ago it was twice the current figure.  The Minister presides over a situation where a post office closes every ten days.  The Minister&rsquo;s legacy of failure not just includes broadband roll-out and the demise of the fishing industry but also the demise of the post office network.</P><Col N="1181"/>
        <P>The Minister claims he has no responsibility for the salary conditions of postmasters.  He must have responsibility when the majority of them earn less than the minimum wage of &euro;17,900 per annum.  Should any citizen have to live on less than the minimum wage?  Up to 135 postmasters are earning less than &euro;10,000 per annum.  The <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal</i> recently highlighted the individual case of the postmistress in Lombardstown, County Cork, Catherine Healy-Byrne.  Her smiling face has been behind the counter for the past years but she is quoted:</P>
        <P LI="1">To fill the contract with An Post, I must provide a premises, light, heat and insurance and stay open 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., Monday to Friday, and 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturday.  And for providing that service I get &euro;16,500 a year and I have to pay everything after that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that not a disgraceful situation over which the Minister presides?</P>
        <P>Some 400 post offices are still not automated.  The Minister must know the fundamental role played by post offices in rural Ireland.  As the <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal</i> stated in a recent article, the Minister has written the post mortem for rural Ireland in his failure to protect the post office network.  Is it not time he produced a Green Paper on the network?  He only came up with the energy Green Paper several months ago and the fishing Bill last year.  With a few months left to an election, the post office network is disappearing.  People are upset and will protest about it outside Leinster House next Tuesday but he has no answers.  The Minister claims it is not his responsibility.  It is his responsibility and he will be held responsible in 12 weeks time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Deputy Broughan that I am only in this portfolio for two and a half years.  I am delighted he noted I produced an energy Green Paper and shortly will produce an energy White Paper.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>And a fishing Green Paper last Sunday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I met the targets I set on broadband roll-out.  I have tackled the underlying problems in the fishing industry.  It is a formidable record for two and a half years.  The first 12 months of my ministry were spent advancing the causes adopted by the CWU and ensuring An Post reached agreement with it to ensure the survival of the postal service.</P>
        <P>It was nice of the <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal</i> to highlight the plight of the rural postal network.  Many of its readers will also be aware that many creameries and other facilities and employment <Col N="1182"/>in rural areas have closed.  I did not notice the <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal</i> highlight these closures.</P>
        <P>I am sure the IPU did not put a non-participation clause in the talks with An Post when it proposed the Fortis deal to its 1,300 members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the passports and the money transfers?  There was a package.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is strange that a representative body, looking for extra remuneration for its members, would not negotiate on a deal that would do so.  I do not understand that logic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are other services.  It is only one of many.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fortis deal is the one area where the postmasters have the potential to gain extra remuneration.  I cannot understand how a representative body which is demanding more remuneration for its members, breaks off negotiations when an offer, like that of Fortis, is made.  Do all 1,300 members of the IPU realise what is happening?  They should be aware of the possibility of getting some extra finance by concluding the negotiations on the Fortis deal.</P>
        <P>I have a good working relationship with the IPU.  I have been active in facilitating both sides in understanding each other&rsquo;s position.  I appointed a facilitator, Mr. Eamonn Ryan, who produced an excellent report which will form the basis of negotiations.  It is an illogical step to decide to march on the GPO and the D&aacute;il and withdraw from talks that may give one&rsquo;s members extra remuneration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is because they are desperate.  Some 600 post offices have closed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to be offensive to anybody but it seems illogical to me.</P>
        <P>The post office network has one of the highest numbers of post offices per head of population in Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has halved the number.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Even the IPU recognises that.  There are 4.2 outlets per 10,000 inhabitants compared with the European Union average of 2.7.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>That may have been the case in 1997 but the Minister needs to check the latest figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The 900 post offices that were automated are processing 97% of the business of An Post.  Significant numbers among the 400 that are not automated are run by elderly postmasters who do not want them to be automated.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1183"/>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>If negotiations could be concluded and a reasonable severance deal secured, they would be more than interested in moving out.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>  his proposals for the early delivery of products from the Corrib gas field; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[5406/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>While first gas from the Corrib field had initially been expected in early 2004, I understand the developer now anticipates first gas in late 2009.  Completion of the development works by the developers is clearly the principal factor that will determine the date for first <Col N="1184"/>gas.  As I have pointed out to the House on numerous occasions, my statutory responsibilities in this matter relate to the regulatory aspects of petroleum exploration and development.  I again emphasise that all the required statutory approvals are in place in this regard.</P>
        <P>Following the publication of the Cassells report, however, the developer of the Corrib project confirmed that it is actively considering a possible re-routing of the onshore section of the pipeline.  In the event that a significant re-routing is proposed, the developer would be required to make an application to my Department for a new approval under section 40 of the Gas Act 1976.</P>
        <P>I am highly conscious of the strategic importance of the Corrib gas project, and I look forward to the development works moving ahead and the production of gas from the Corrib field.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Having regard to the importance of developing our natural resources to the optimum and the equal importance of ensuring we retain or regain some degree of independence in the provision of a vital resource such as gas, what lessons have been learned in regard to the planning, preparation and implementation of an operation such as this?  Will the Minister indicate what plans he has to change the method of the administration of this proposal to ensure, in future, that any such proposal will be dealt with effectively, efficiently and in keeping with best practice and rules?  We must not display to the world a lethargy or ineptitude in dealing with a major investment application such as this, involving the exploitation of what is a relatively clean fuel which will be hugely beneficial to the public and industry.  Will the Minister agree that when a proposal like this arises in the future, he will guarantee that it is implemented when anticipated rather than five or seven years later?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not matter who occupies my position; there is a wonderful system of laws and judicial reviews in this State to protect the rights of citizens.  There is no way that anybody can offer a definitive prediction of how long it might take to bring a project like this ashore in future.</P>
        <P>Several developments have arisen since this project started moving, not least of which is the new planning and development Bill which will streamline the planning process for projects of national importance. Moreover, it was impossible not to learn lessons as we moved through the long and protracted process of bringing the gas onshore.  Several reports were compiled in regard to the Corrib project, the Advantica report being the most notable.  Some reports were internal to the Department, while external advice was sought in other cases.  All those recommendations will form part of the agreed processes not only for this project but also for future projects.  This should help to allay some of the concerns in regard to safety and so on.</P><Col N="1185"/>
        <P>This project had to secure six consents and permissions under six different Acts, including the Continental Shelf Act, Foreshore Act, Gas Act, Planning and Development Acts and Environmental Protection Agency Act.  This is not an efficient or transparent procedure and it gives rise to the problems we have encountered.  Preliminary work has already started in the Department to examine, based on the advice received during the course of this project, how we can minimise the numbers of consents and permissions required under different Acts.  This is not an attempt to diminish the amount of work that must be done to obtain those consents.  Rather than having six separate processes, however, they should be combined and streamlined under the provisions of one or two Acts.  Lessons were learned during this process.</P>

	<P>I hope so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not seem to have that view several months ago and was, in comparison, rather negative about the prospect.  How will this process operate in terms of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act and the functions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  In regard to the revised pipeline route, will the companies go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, under the provisions of that Act, in terms of the planning that is required?</P>
        <P>Like the Minister, I have ongoing contacts with the parties involved, including Shell, Statoil and the Shell to Sea campaign.  There are ongoing concerns about the siting of the terminal.  Does the Minister see any possibility that the terminal could be moved seaward, which would finally resolve the issue and ensure the gas comes ashore in 2009, which is what we all want?  As energy spokespersons, we know it is desperately needed.</P>
        <P>Constituents and citizens throughout the State to whom I have spoken are interested in the immediate issue but are also concerned with the broader issue of licensing terms in respect of our natural resources.  Under pressure from members of the Opposition, the Minister appointed Indecon to look at the licensing terms and conditions for the major exploration companies.  Will he ensure that report is given to the House before the general election?  If it is, will he introduce legislation?  For example, does he have any plans to amend the Finance Bill to give the country, or the people, better terms because under the Minister&rsquo;s licensing arrangements, when companies discover gas or oil, it is theirs and this nation, effectively, gets nothing?  The people are profoundly interested in that issue which the Minister could address even at this late stage in the <Col N="1186"/>Government&rsquo;s term in office.  When will Indecon report?</P>
        <P>I understand summer 2007 will be a busy season for exploration on the Atlantic margin despite the Minister&rsquo;s downplaying of it in earlier years.</P>

	<P>I beg to differ with the Deputy.  If Deputy Stagg was not capable of opening a file in two and a half years, I can only take one interpretation from that.</P>
        <P>In recent years, there has been very little drilling off the west coast.  The number of wells over that period has averaged two.  What has changed over the past 12 to 18 months is that the price of oil and gas has increased substantially.  Over a longer period the technical skills and technical equipment used to detect, and perhaps indicate, seismic data, etc., have improved, so we are more optimistic.</P>
        <P>For approximately two and a half years, my Department has been preparing a report on the potential off the west coast.  There is a difference <Col N="1187"/>between potential and gas actually coming in.  Some people must spend a great deal of money before potential income becomes actual income.  Yesterday I read in a newspaper that somebody believes the Corrib gas field is now worth &euro;30 billion.  I hope that person is right.  Like Deputy Broughan, the person who fed the story to the newspaper has his facts wrong.  If that was the case and the gas find in Corrib was worth &euro;30 billion, the people would get a return of approximately &euro;7 billion on that gas field.</P>
        <P>The report has not been finalised, although there is a draft.  As soon as I receive it and it has been considered, I will bring it to Government.  Then it will be made public.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 81 together.</P>
        <P>Digital television is already available in Ireland across a number of platforms.  Both cable-MMDS operators and satellite operators provide subscription digital television services to almost 50% of Irish television households.  Digital radio is cur<Col N="1188"/>rently available via the Internet.  The future roll-out of digital terrestrial television, DTT, and digital radio services in Ireland will ensure that Irish viewers continue to have access to free-to-air Irish public broadcasting.</P>
        <P>New and enhanced channels and services can be made available to Irish citizens on digital platforms.  It is currently estimated that approximately 29% of television licence households use analogue free-to-air terrestrial television only and that up to 90% of households use analogue free-to-air terrestrial television on at least one television set.  The future roll-out of digital terrestrial television will be particularly important for these households, especially given the inevitability of analogue switch-off.  The European Commission has proposed a switch-off date of 2012 for analogue television services.</P>
        <P>With the aim of exploring issues around DTT, I launched a digital terrestrial television pilot in August 2006.  The pilot will encourage both public and stakeholder interest in DTT and bring momentum to the development of DTT in Ireland.  To date, &euro;6 million has been allocated to the establishment of the DTT pilot.  Some &euro;2 million will be allocated to the DTT pilot during each of the years 2007 and 2008, which is referenced under the NDP.  This expenditure is primarily for infrastructure build and not for public information campaigns.  Public information campaigns around analogue switch-off, which are common in many countries planning for switch-off, may be considered in the future.  There are currently no proposals for further expenditure on the pilot.  The pilot project is set to run until 2008.</P>
        <P>The proposed Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill recently initiated in the Seanad seeks to put in place a licensing framework for a national roll-out of DTT into the future.  It is expected that the processes necessary for licensing of a national DTT roll-out under this Act will commence in 2007.  RTE will be obliged to provide public service broadcasting channels on a DTT platform and the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will licence commercial broadcasters to provide services on the same platform.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Bill includes similar proposals for a licensing framework for digital radio.  Digital audio broadcasting, DAB, is one of the most common technical standards currently being considered by broadcasters for digital radio.  While DAB is not as well established in the EU as digital terrestrial television, it has been successfully established in the UK.  RTE is currently running a DAB trial which will allow issues around a full roll-out to be explored.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware of the concern that the delivery of digital broadcasting seems to be taking an extraordinarily long time?  There is a fear among those involved in the industry and some who expected a more rapid turna<Col N="1189"/>bout that there will be a repeat of the broadband debacle.  The degree to which digital transmission is being pushed by the regulator and the Government is not sufficient to register in the area.  The Minister referred to the Broadcasting Bill in relation to which it has been suggested that some of the technology proposed is out of date.  Investment of that nature is only a stepping stone and not what is required to provide the level of service necessary.  Will the pilot schemes currently taking place and the technology now available be utilised to deliver, as soon as possible, a digital service to the 50% of people in the country who do not have it?  Those people live in hope of such a service and have been living in hope for several years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;Living in hope&rdquo; sounds like a good slogan for the Government&rsquo;s billboard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a need to develop high-quality broadcasting services in this country and overseas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s concern about the length of time it is taking to roll out DTT is certainly not echoed by the people involved in the industry.  They are happy with the DTT pilot project we have put in place, the first phase of which, the soft trial phase, is coming to an end.  The next phase involves a closed public trial and is due to start in the coming month.  The results of the trial so far have been positively received.</P>
        <P>The technology being used is right up to date, as will be confirmed by BT, NEC or any other company involved if the Deputy wishes to check.  However, digital technology changes very quickly and even when the platform is operational there will be ongoing renewals and replacements of equipment.</P>
        <P>The pilot is scheduled to finish by August 2008.  Once the Bill, which is in the Seanad at the moment, is passed, it will allow BCI to immediately advertise for multiplexes for RTE 1, RTE 2, TV3, if it is interested, and TG4, in addition to the radio channels.  I hope the Bill receives the co-operation of Members opposite because the quicker it is passed the better.  The Bill also proposes that other commercial enterprises interested in multiplex will also be able to apply to the BCI.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is multiplex not overloaded?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  There will be room on the system for between six and eight multiplexes.  As we switch off analogue there will be room for even more.  The primary reason the EU has asked member states to switch off analogue by 2012 is to free up spectrum in Europe.  We do not have as much clutter as in the rest of Europe but we will have much more room once DTT is operational.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1190"/>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it possible that, in 2009 or 2010, many householders on the east coast and the Border regions will have a Noel Dempsey moment?  Might they flick on a screen, see snowy, wavy lines and say &ldquo;God be with Noel Dempsey&rdquo; or words to that effect?  Has RTE not warned that, owing to the fact the Minister has been so slow &mdash; for example, we are a long way behind the UK &mdash; householders on the east coast and in the Border regions will be seriously disadvantaged in this regard?  It is yet another instance of the outgoing Government falling behind schedule.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister considered the overall costs of the migration to digital?  Has he assessed how valuable the analogue spectrum will be when it is freed up?  He has given RTE a role in this process but has he given ComReg a role?  Has he finally decided on a year when we will switch off?  Will it be 2012?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>We have not decided on the actual date as it would be wise to complete the pilot project first.  ComReg has a role in licensing the spectrum.</P>
        <P>The pilot will cost approximately &euro;10 million over the four years to 2008.  RTE estimates the gross cost at between &euro;150 million and &euro;160 million.</P>
        <P>If people have a Noel Dempsey moment it might be less snowy than a Tommy Broughan moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be in slim screen colour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I forgive the Deputy for not being fully familiar with the technology.  The fact we receive BBC transmissions is an accident, due to overspill.  We are not entitled to it but have benefited from it for a considerable time.  When the BBC switches off analogue, as it intends to do on a rolling basis, we will not receive it unless it is part of the multiplex, except in very limited areas.  In that case it does not matter whether or not we have a DTT or analogue platform.  It will not be my or anybody else&rsquo;s fault but will be because the BBC decided it would not be worth coming onto a multiplex in this country.  However, I do not expect that to happen and would be surprised if the BBC were not part of a number of multiplexes when they are in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>If that is the case the Minister will be remembered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>He will be remembered but not with fondness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister not concerned that, if there is a gap between the BBC switching off analogue and the establishment of multiplex in this country, there will be huge com<Col N="1191"/>petitive advantages for the likes of Sky and other satellite broadcasters which already have significant digital presence?</P>
        <P>Can the Minister provide details of the closed area proposed for the first working trial?  What are the implications for those living within that closed area?</P>
        <P>The Minister said digital services were already available on the Internet.  Increasingly, television services will be available through the Internet.  Has the Minister any proposals regarding the use of devices, such as mobile telephones or laptops, to avail of broadcasting services outside the traditional channels such as analogue or satellite?  Has he any interest in developing a licensing system for such use?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>On the last point, discussion has already taken place on the proposed Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2006.  This will address new methods of broadcasting through the Internet, mobile phones, etc.  There was quite a reaction in the e-consultation process carried out by the Oireachtas committee regarding the possibility that mobile phones might have to be licensed in the future if they were receiving television programmes.  I do not pretend to have all the answers in terms of where we are going in this area.  The concept of convergence and how that will affect communications into the future is something that changes almost on a weekly basis.  There will be implications, as the Deputy is aware, for television licence fees and whether the television licence will be a thing of the past in five or seven years&rsquo; time because of that convergence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should not frighten RTE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the ComReg licence, the pilot which starts in March will be confined to approximately 1,000 people.  The north east generally is the area that will be covered and 1,000 people will be using the system there.</P>
        <P>Regarding the question of the analogue switch off by the BBC, once the Bill is passed, and I am sure I will get the co-operation of all parties in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will get it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to get it passed as quickly as possible &mdash; that has been indicated to me &mdash; BCI can then advertise for multiplexes for companies to put forward.  RTE has indicated to me that it will move very quickly.  It is making arrangements for the first multiplex and I hope we would have an overlap between the period the DTT would be available here and the analogue switch off in the BBC.  Currently, it appears we will have that and therefore there will not be any loss in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1192"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Minister&rsquo;s last point, given that historically it has been almost a geographic accident that we have had availability of analogue services from the BBC and other British channels and that this will be a different contractual arrangement in that whoever is managing the multiplex system would have to contract with the BBC, will that have significant cost implications in terms of channels requiring a payment for access to such services?  What are the likely implications for the Irish customer viewer in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>RTE will have to provide the Irish stations on a free-to-air basis but it is conceivable that it will have to pay for anything it gets subsequently.  It will then have to decide how it, in turn, will get paid for it.  Without going into too much detail, I am aware that RTE is considering a variety of possibilities, one of which might be that some mutual arrangement will be made by the BBC, UTV and RTE regarding multiplexes and services to each other.  It is possible, however, that the BBC, UTV or some of those channels would be on a &ldquo;pay-as-you-view&rdquo; basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>An occasion on which we would be changing to pay-per-view for services that were traditionally free might be an appropriate time to amend the licence fee arrangements, taking into account the technological changes on the web and the introduction of multiplexes.  Then rather than later would be the time to change the licence fee arrangement to recognise this new future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be a subject for debate during the course of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill.  The licence fee was put in place and has been maintained because of the commitment successive Governments of all shades had to the concept of public service broadcasting here and a national broadcaster.  While technologies may converge and change, and circumstances may change as well, I presume there would be a reluctance on all sides of the House to move away from the concept of the licence and pay specifically for the public service element of our national television services.  That is a debate we will have because circumstances will change.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">These amendments relate to a range of interim measures that have been put in place for 2007 and are now being transposed into primary legislation.  In brief, the main changes are that levels of dependency no longer exist.  Persons are now simply deemed to be dependent or not dependent; in other words, the person needs to be maintained in a nursing home or not and one single maximum subvention rate of &euro;300 has replaced the previous three levels of dependency.</P>
        <P>Before Christmas, the Minister for Health and Children announced a new nursing home care support scheme which will be introduced on 1 January next year.  The purpose of the changes being introduced for this year is to pave the way towards the new scheme and render an increased number of people eligible for subvention in the short term.  An additional &euro;85 million was provided to fund these measures for 2007 and it is expected that approximately 2,000 extra people will benefit from the changes.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 are consequential on amendment No. 13 and amendments Nos. 16 <Col N="1195"/>and 18 are technical amendments that are necessary on foot of amendment No. 17.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>We can welcome the fact that the Government has changed the limit to &euro;300 but serious concerns remain about costs in private nursing homes.  There is a big increase in the number of patients having to use private nursing homes as opposed to nursing homes.  The Government has not moved to provide public nursing homes even though a clear commitment was given to provide more high dependency nursing home beds.  The figures being talked about by the Government are inadequate, which means that patients will still require private nursing homes.</P>
        <P>The &euro;300 is an improvement but the three subvention rates that are being abolished had been the same since 2001 and &euro;300 is not much more than the upper level of high dependency subvention offered by the Government.  This is being discussed in the House with the idea of 5% of the house value being taken into consideration, making it even more difficult for the elderly to access the nursing home subvention.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said there will be improvements in January, which are really the proposals being made by the Minister for Health and Children that patients will be assessed before they get nursing home care next year.  There will be a NEPS style system for elderly people getting nursing home care.  I am amazed some of the organisations representing elderly people are so sanguine about the Minister&rsquo;s proposals that they are not looking for more detail on what the Government has in mind.  Many of them are already concerned, however, about the death tax the Government wants to impose on the elderly and the fact they are taking 80% of the income of anyone who is an inpatient.</P>
        <P>We are debating three major health Bills &mdash; this Bill, the Health Bill, which will establish the Health Information and Quality Authority, and the Medical Practitioners Bill.  The cutbacks in time to discuss the legislation are only outdone by the cutbacks the Government has made to the health services.  It is ridiculous.  This debate can finish at 5 p.m. because we are only dealing with these amendments and we already know the Government has no interest in hearing the Opposition&rsquo;s views, but the Health Bill is also being guillotined and that legislation is seriously flawed.  Some Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers know more about the flaws in that Bill than members of the Cabinet.  I have also heard that Second Stage of the Medical Practitioners Bill will be taken between 10 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. on Friday, 23 February.  We waited 30 years for legislation to protect patients from bad doctors.  We have all heard of Harold Shipman and doctors who have been struck off in Britain coming here and prac<Col N="1196"/>tising.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been in power for most of those 30 years and now the Government tells us the full Second Stage debate will take only four and a half hours.  It is ridiculous.</P>
        <P>The Government should have offered the elderly more.  The Minister of State knows damn well that &euro;300 is not enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Twomey.  The Minister and the Department have not worked out a fair position on residential care for elderly people.  There is a perception of action while the reality is that restrictive arrangements are in place on how people are assessed and unfair methods of assessment in terms of the family home.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children is also promoting the idea that somehow all the issues raised by the Leas Cross nursing home have been resolved and a bright new day has arrived.  If we look at the published standards, they are just photocopies of the British standards and there is no clear determination of staffing levels.  I would expect that accommodation in the private nursing home sector will be improved &mdash; there are many excellent nursing homes &mdash; but in certain nursing homes, standards are not high enough and anything that is being done to improve accommodation is, of course, welcome.  The sector, to be fair, has sought standards but when there are no staffing regulations to set baselines, it raises concerns about the protection of elderly people that have not been addressed by the Minister.  In public nursing homes, the level and qualifications of staff are generally higher and probably more expensive than the private sector but the Minister and the HSE are relying to an ever greater degree on the private nursing home sector.  The onus is on the Minister to set certain standards and she has ducked it, as did her predecessors.</P>
        <P>We have already expressed our opposition to the family home being taken into account when assessing eligibility.  This is unprecedented.    The policy pursued by the Government of over-dependence on the private nursing home sector leads to severe anomalies in the acute hospital sector.  Beaumont Hospital has more than 100 people inappropriately in hospital beds because they simply cannot move out of the acute hospital sector into step-down or nursing home care.  That places extraordinary pressure on that hospital and it is not the only one in that situation.  Patients are in hospital when they do not need to be but cannot move on because the nursing home beds do not exist in the local area.  It is extraordinary that Government policy has been so remiss that in a part of the city with an older population there is far less capacity in private or public nursing homes than in other areas.  In Bray there is good private nursing home capacity but our elderly population is not sizeable, it certainly does not compare with the north inner city.</P><Col N="1197"/>
        <P>There is a mismatch and the lack of Government planning to ensure proper provision of step-down and nursing home beds leads to problems in the acute hospital sector.  I was shocked today to find that St. James&rsquo;s Hospital is cancelling operations for cardiac patients.  This is a chronic crisis at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and it demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s failure to provide capacity at acute hospital level and in the community.</P>
        <P>The private nursing home sector has a role to play but that there is an over-reliance and a lack of planning to ensure that provision meets need.  Ultimately that is not the fault of private nursing home owners because they have their own considerations; they are not charities, they are providing a service and people are paying for it.  The HSE and the Minister must bear responsibility.</P>
        <P>Looking at the inspectorate, which relates to the charges being levied by nursing homes, we can see complete inconsistency across the country.  There are nursing homes where residents who have been living there for some time suddenly found the fees had rocketed because the inspectorate from the HSE determined that increased staffing levels are required.  Extra costs must be borne by the owner who passes them on to the residents and their families.  Many people are genuinely shocked by the increases which are as a direct result of the HSE inspectors determining that certain changes must be made in a nursing home.  It may well be that those changes are necessary &mdash; I am not arguing that point.  However, down the road in another county or region a completely different approach may be taken and private nursing homes may be protected from such pressure on costs.  It is a bit of a mess.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I believe the Minister of State promised the interdepartmental review would be published in 2005 and yet we are still waiting for it.  It is hard to have confidence in any proposals of the Minister of State to resolve the issue of care for the elderly.  Most important is to determine the cost of such care in a fair way that does not attack the family home.  We need to ensure that people are cared for in a way that recognises their dignity, with respect, and that recognises that they in their time paid taxes.  Those rights are recognised when patients attend for acute care.  Nobody assesses the value their family home before they access hospital care or if they qualify for a medical card.  It is a unique arrangement that is causing great fear and trepidation.  The Government&rsquo;s record is inadequate and I do not believe this legislation will ease the pain in any way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I intend to press the first amendment to a division, as I believe it changes substantially what we had discussed.  The Minister of State said &ldquo;degree of dependency of the applicant&rdquo; has now been deleted and has been substituted for &ldquo;need for the applicant to be maintained <Col N="1198"/>in a nursing home&rdquo;.  We have no idea who will decide what is meant by &ldquo;the need for the applicant to be maintained in a nursing home&rdquo;, as that will come in a year&rsquo;s time.  Any right-thinking Member of the House would need to oppose the amendment, as we have no idea what it means.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Minister of State saying?  He has just contradicted himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Opposition has a job to do in pointing out areas where difficulties exist.  I am not referring specifically to what the Deputy said in his contribution.  In general, for some time we have heard continual knocking of the health service.  The majority of people who avail of our health service have a pleasant experience.  The difficulties are being addressed.  Perhaps in some cases results are not being achieved as quickly as people would like.  It is not fair on the people working in the health service to see newspaper reports and hear reports on the news or radio shows, in which people continually knock what they do.  Ultimately these people make a contribution and try to do their best to improve the service and provide a level of health service care for their colleagues in the community.  There is no real appreciation of what they do.</P>
        <P>We did not make a number of changes at Christmas and that is why we have tabled some of these amendments.  When the scheme was introduced in 1993, it was not intended that it was to cover the cost of the care.  It was to assist in funding the cost of care.  It is now proposed to eliminate the three rates and have one rate of &euro;300.  We have discussed the subvention scheme and nobody said it was not without its faults, including me.</P>
        <P>Assessing the family home was introduced in the scheme in 1993 and despite many different Ministers occupying the seat in Hawkins House since then, it has not changed.  What we are now introducing will only last until 31 December.  On 1 January 2008 a new scheme will be in operation.  There is no guarantee that the two Deputies who <Col N="1199"/>contributed today will have the responsibility to introduce that legislation.  Regardless of what side we are on, if we are lucky enough to be returned to the House we will have an opportunity to contribute to that and to decide on the scheme to be introduced.  We have studied the funding of long-term care upside down and inside out.  The time has come to introduce a new scheme and we have indicated that we intend to introduce that legislation in the House in the autumn to take effect from 1 January 2008.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s throwaway comments on cutbacks serve no purpose.  I pointed out that an additional &euro;85 million will be provided this year and that we expect an additional 2,000 people to benefit from the changes we will announce for this year alone.  In the new scheme public and private will be treated in the same way.  A number of measures are being taken to address the inappropriate use of beds.  The investment we have made in home care packages will contribute significantly to resolving that issue.  We have a history, which people accept, of people with an income contributing to the cost of the care.  We do not ask them to pay for the total cost and that is what we are doing with the new scheme, a fair deal on nursing home care, to be introduced in the autumn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>This obviously represents the new way for Ministers and Ministers of State to react to criticisms from the Opposition.  The Minister of State has accused us of criticising those who work in the health services.  During a recent private Members debate a similar comment was made by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I made it clear then that we do not criticise those who work in the health services.  For instance, as with the doctors, nurses and everybody else in the health service, when I did my 10,000 or 12,000 consultations each year as a GP, I did not see myself as implementing Government policy.  I looked after patients.  Every nurse, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and cleaner within the hospital system sees himself or herself as doing a job to look after patients.</P>
        <P>When we criticise the Government we do so on its total failure to provide enough acute beds in the hospital system to look after those same patients and to provide enough step-down beds to look after elderly patients within the public system.  We criticise the Government for giving public land to developers and for sending premiums for private patients through the roof.  We are talking about the Government&rsquo;s failure to give direction and leadership in dealing with MRSA.  We do not criticise the people who work in the health service.  If those who work in the health service behaved in the same manner as the Minister and Ministers of State responsible for it, <Col N="1200"/>the health service would collapse in the morning.  Their hard work is keeping it together.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should withdraw the stupid remarks he has made about Members of the Opposition.  We are criticising the Government&rsquo;s performance and not the performance of those who work in the health services.  With 12 or 14 weeks to go to the general election it shows the Government&rsquo;s failure that it is fighting with the consultants, nurses and every allied health professional within the health service who are threatening to go on strike because of the Government&rsquo;s failure.</P>
        <P>I read an article by Professor Drumm which clearly states that senior HSE management needs more training and is probably not up to the job it is doing.  That is some admission two years after the establishment of the HSE.  Those are the criticisms we make.  It is extremely disingenuous of the Minister of State to try to suggest that the Opposition is attacking those who work in the health service.  I know people working in the health services, probably better than the Minister of State does.  They do not read those headlines in the newspapers as criticisms of them <i>per se</i>.  They read those headlines as criticisms of the system and of the poor leadership they are getting not just from the Government but also from the HSE.  This is a sign of that.</P>
        <P>The Government has changed the nature of this legislation.  Nobody trusts the Government.  Everybody is afraid about the interpretation of something like the &ldquo;need for the applicant to be maintained in a nursing home&rdquo;.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, said everybody who needs an urgent colonoscopy, like in the case of Rosie, will be seen within two weeks.  What is an urgent colonoscopy?  The Minister of State does not know and I do not know even though I have been in medicine for 20 years.  There is a need for the Minister of State to stick with what he is supposed to be doing and not throw out wild allegations.</P>
      </Speaker>

Under the new scheme we are bringing in for next year, it is proposed that the maximum period for which one&rsquo;s house can be assessed is three years.  Equally, we are saying that if a person has been in receipt of a subvention for more than three years during which time his or her house was assessed, it will no longer be assessed for the future.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>So amendment No. 9 relates to taking 15% of the value of a house from elderly people going into nursing homes.  The Minister of State is saying that this is just to cover the fact that if they are there beyond three years, they will not have 15% of the value of their houses taken from them.  Are any of these other amendments related to the fact that the Government plans to take 5% of the value of the house for three consecutive years off everybody who goes into long-term nursing home care from 1 January 2008?  Are any of the other amendments related to what <Col N="1204"/>we consider to be a death tax on people who need long-term nursing home care?    </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>When we introduced this legislation, we said we would put this scheme in primary legislation on the advice of the Attorney General.  On foot of a few changes we made before Christmas, we have made amendments which we will bring before this House.  This legislation will cease as and from 31 December 2007 and it is our intention to have a new scheme operating from 1 January 2008.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>So does it relate to the fact that the Government is taking 15% of the value of a house?  I am only trying to get clarity on this matter.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>What we are saying is that if a person who is in receipt of a subvention has been in the same nursing home for  three or more years, as and from now, their house will no longer be assessed.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that after three years?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, where there is a maximum&mdash;&mdash;  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that when the 15% has been applied?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Three years is the maximum time, which is what we propose in the new legislation which we will debate in the House in the autumn.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>So we are debating the 15% in respect of three years.  I am just trying to get clarity about whether this amendment is about this.    </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the same idea in that we will not ask people for any more after the three-year period.  This is the maximum period of time during which their house can be assessed.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is not explaining this in a way we can comprehend.  The whole thing is a bit of a mess.  We had a Bill.  The Minister of State then came out with a new plan.  Is he saying that the 15% scheme is now included in this amendment?  I think this is what Deputy Twomey is trying to find out.  If it is included, I suggest the Minister of State clarifies that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Could we have silence in the Visitors' Gallery?  Deputy McManus to continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The more the Minister of State says, the more unclear is this issue.  It is becoming quite opaque.  The initial legislation was introduced and the Minister subsequently decided the system was unfair and that she would introduce a new scheme.  Are these amendments, which are <Col N="1205"/>being tabled at the 11th hour, related to the 15% proposal or the 5% contribution?  If so, this is not the way to produce legislation.  We are on Report Stage, which should be about tidying up technical matters, but we are trying to tease out this issue.  Perhaps the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials will give him a briefing note so he can outline to the House what he is trying to do in these amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>This is one of the most dreadful Bills to come before the House and this section remains intact, despite the Minister tinkering around its edges.  The principle will be established that the family home should be assessed in the means tests for services.  The family home is not assessed in applications for higher education grants, medical cards or social welfare payments.  It is exempt from any payment.  If I fall ill and enter hospital, there is no question of the value of my family home being taken into account when assessing the cost of my stay but if I am over 65 years and I am too ill to stay at home, the family home will be assessed as means against my costs and I will also be liable for 80% of my income and all my valuables, including jewellery.  These will be taken into account as means against the full cost of availing of a largely privatised service.  The State has decided to privatise services for the elderly which are bought and sold as a commodity, which is immoral.</P>
        <P>This is the first and only time this has occurred and the Minister of State is providing that in certain circumstances he will reduce or write off the liability.  However, that will not address the principle involved.  For the first time in the history of the State, a means test will require the sale of the family home in certain circumstances.  For example, I refer to a brother and sister who live together with the sister having been left the family home by her parents.  He is working for the county council as a road worker and she requires long-term care.  The family home would have to be sold to pay the State the costs it would levy against her when she died.  That is cruel and savage and it is unbelievable that it would be so.  The Labour Party has undertaken that if it is returned to Government following the election, it will repeal and abolish this rotten legislation.  I appeal to the Minister of State, who is in a difficult position, as he must do the bidding of more senior people.  I do not blame him personally for this problem because his inclination would be similar to mine in this regard but I appeal to him to refer the legislation to his principals and not to force it through using the Government majority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Between now and 1 January 2008, the Government is saying 5% of the value of the family home will be considered as income when an individual applies for nursing home subvention.  As of 1 January 2008 the Government will take 5% of the value of the house from elderly people who need long-term nursing home care.  To which of these measures do the amend<Col N="1206"/>ments apply?  The legislation lacks clarity but it will be passed in 25 minutes.  It might be a saviour for the Minister of State but somebody will have to clean up this legislation if the lack of clarity remains.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>When the subvention scheme was introduced in 1993, the family home was assessed as part of the means test and this provision has remained part of the scheme since.  While the scheme is not without its faults, we put forward a new plan for the funding of long-term care last December but that involves separate legislation and the Deputies could be in office next September.  We are proposing that there will be an imputed income equal to 5% of the value of the home but the maximum period for which this can be calculated is three years.  If somebody is in receipt of subvention for four years, for example, only three years can be assessed under the means test.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>That is 15%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, 5% annually for three years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment will apply for three years.  Will the plan announced last December be implemented at all?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>An imputed income of 5% of the value of the family house is provided for in the scheme and, in cases where people are in receipt of subvention for more than three years, the income calculation will cease.  We will no longer impute an income on the basis of the value of the house.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>However, when the Minister announced her plan last December, she stated no assessment would be needed and if a person needed nursing home care, he or she would receive it.  Is the Minister of State saying 5% of the value of the house will be taken regardless under the new plan?  It is as confusing as hell.  I do not know why he is inserting this provision.  It either dies on 1 January 2008 or it does not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We are introducing measures that will cease.  The scheme as we know it will cease on 31 December and it is our intention to introduce the scheme announced last December.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Why was that not inserted in the amendment?  This is a different story altogether.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We have been quite clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has been far from clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We were clear in what we proposed about a fair deal and the amendments we intended to make, including no differentiation <Col N="1207"/>between private and public care and the role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.   The Minister outlined our plans in this regard in detail but that legislation is yet to be debated in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Government was serious that the plan announced last December was its policy, these amendments would fall on 31 December 2007 but that will not happen.  The Minister of State has not explained what is involved.  People are confused because, according to last December&rsquo;s announcement, the State will take 5% of the value of the family home but, according to the amendment, the State will treat 5% of the value of the house as income until the new plan kicks in on 1 January 2008.  I can see how people outside the House might be confused.  The Minister of State is introducing a three-year rule.  The theory underlying the amendment is that the provision will apply for three years.  The aim of the amendment should be for the subvention scheme as we know it to fall on 31 December 2007.  That would indicate the Government is serious about what it announced last December.  This appears to suggest the Government is not sure what it will do on 1 January 2008 and that an opt-out clause is provided for the Government, if it is in power.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>This is very unsatisfactory.  It is not clear what the intention is here.  I would have thought the Minister of State could shed some light on this matter.  When the Minister, Deputy Harney, floated this idea of getting money back from the dead, I understood it was to be a voluntary scheme, and that one had a choice about whether to embark on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>To which scheme does the Deputy refer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The scheme by which money would be paid back to the HSE from people&rsquo;s estates after their death, and that the family house would then be sold to pay for the cost of residential nursing home care.  Is the Minister of State aware of that scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not know whether the Deputy used the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard the Minister, Deputy Harney, state on the radio it would be voluntary, that there would be a choice.  I do not know whether to believe her.  She said there would be public-only consultant contracts and now they are turning out to be public and private consultant contracts.  It is like grabbing mercury.  One does not know what is on offer here.  My understanding is that the scheme was to be voluntary.  Perhaps I am wrong.  Is the Minister of State saying people in nursing homes for three years will be <Col N="1208"/>assessed on the basis of the potential income from their family home, that the person in the bed next to them who is there four years will not be penalised in that way, and that there will be a third person in the future lying in the bed next to them who will be on the scheme that would require the family to pay, by way of selling the family home after the person&rsquo;s death?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I have deep concerns about the overall structure of what the Minister, Deputy Harney, has proposed to become operational from 1 January 2008.  I refer the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, to Article 45.4.1&deg; of the Constitution which states: &ldquo;The State pledges itself to safeguard with especial care the economic interests of the weaker sections of the community, and, where necessary, to contribute to the support of the infirm, the widow, the orphan, and the aged.&rdquo;  That is very clear.  The proposed amendment does not subscribe to the duty of looking after the weaker sections of the community.  In effect, the infirm and the aged have been singled out as a special group and, just because they are ill, it is planned to take 80% of their income and ultimately sequester 50% of their property.  Foreign invaders did not get away with this, let alone an Irish Government.  It is unclear how this can constitute looking after the economic interests of those people who have worked hard over the years.  As far as they are concerned, they have made their contribution and are entitled to nursing home care.</P>
        <P>The reason we have reached this impasse is that the balance between public and private long-stay beds has changed radically.  In the 1960s, four out of five beds were in the public sector, now approximately 52% of beds are in the private sector.  That is the malaise that has set in.  I am not sure the Minister or her colleagues ever looked at the reports that are available.  They should not tell us there is a crisis because, despite significant changes in the population, the percentage of people in need of full-time care is remarkably stable.  In the 1960s and 1970s when we did not have a shilling, when Deputy Stagg&rsquo;s brother and others were sending home money from England and elsewhere to keep us going, about 5% of the population were aged over 65 and required long-term care but today that sector constitutes only 4.6% of the population and money is coming out of our ears.  That argument is fallacious.  It is predicated upon a rush to the ostensible privatisation by stealth of the health care system.</P>
        <P>The Minister and her colleagues should look at Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s report &mdash; it is not ours &mdash; and the National Economic and Social Forum&rsquo;s action plan to reform care of the elderly.  We have a plethora of analysis and information.  This proposal does not relate to 250,000 people or even to 50,000 people, we are talking about 20,000 people.  In 2011 the numbers will rise to 22,000 people.  This is not a case of a genie escaping from a bottle and exploding.  By 2050 both <Col N="1209"/>Mercer and the NESF predicted Ireland will have fewer over 65s as a percentage of population than the European average.  The most recent CSO statistics show our fertility rate is the highest in Europe so we will have more young people coming on-stream to pay taxes and ensure that when I get old I will have a bed.</P>
        <P>Reference to long-term care is a misnomer.  According to the O&rsquo;Shea report, 77% of those requiring such care are only in nursing homes for three months or less.  The Department&rsquo;s statistics show that of those discharged from nursing homes in a given year, 20% die but 63% are discharged back into the community.  Therefore, very few people stay for years in nursing home care.  The average length of stay in a nursing home is three years yet the Government decides to plunder and rob people.  The intention is to make people pay for what is, essentially, the average period spent by elderly people in nursing homes.  One could talk about daylight robbery.  This time it is our own vulnerable people who are being done.  It is an absolute disgrace to perpetrate such an act on anybody.  It is a shame on any Government for coming forward with such a proposal.</P>
        <P>The angst and annoyance out there has to be seen to be believed.  This is a crisis.  The response of the State to the future burden of providing adequate residential care for older people is an example of ageism at its worst.  The Minister of State should read the National Economic and Social Forum&rsquo;s report with great care, especially the section on rooting out ageism in society.  Older people remain quite healthy and independent and are able to enjoy life to the last yet the Government is picking on them.  This is the worst form of ageism.  As Deputy Stagg said, people&rsquo;s homes are not used in calculating means tests for so many entitlements, rightly so, yet people who have given their all and worked hard to build the State into what it is are being penalised.  It is a shame on the Government.  Many people are out there waiting in the grass to give their verdict on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I see from today&rsquo;s newspaper the leader of the Progressive Democrats is advising politicians not to let people into their family homes.  This legislation is letting the State into the family home.  We are taking ageist action against the most vulnerable people in society.  The previous speaker alluded to the Constitution, which appears to have been set aside by the Progressive Democrats in particular.  The Minister of State has listened to the Progressive Democrats.  It appears to be a case of the tail wagging the dog here, unless Fianna F&aacute;il agrees wholeheartedly with this view.  I suspect the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, has reservations about this himself.</P>
        <P>In a week which saw the Progressive Democrats apparently giving to the elderly, the party is in effect, giving with one hand and grabbing the <Col N="1210"/>family home with the other.  That is the reality.  The Minister of State will hear this from people on the doorsteps in the next few weeks.  The statistics are available.  Many of us will be affected by this provision in the future.  So many people have contributed generously to the State in the past through their taxation and now they have been singled out with the intention of taking the family home from them.  The Minister of State is probably aware of how sacrosanct the family home is in our society.  This provision would cause untold difficulty and suffering for many people.  This is an attack on the most vulnerable in society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation has now been before both Houses of the Oireachtas but it has not improved with age.  The major problem is the inclusion of the family home.  It should not be included.  This is an attack on the one thing a senior citizen can offer to a family member.  I find it difficult to link the amendment to the Bill.  How will the amendment be applied to make sense of this matter?  It does not make sense with regard to those excluded and the reasons for the family home being excluded.  Can the Minister of State explain what this means?  If a person is in long-term care for more than three years, who must pay the relevant amount?  This is not clear.</P>
        <P>On the first day of this debate I argued that the family home is precious to all families and should not be taken into account where someone is resident in the home.  Deputy Stagg and I visited Naas General Hospital and met an employee of the HSE whose mother was in hospital.  He was concerned about the family home being under threat.  Before we vote on this amendment I ask the Minister of State to explain the thinking behind it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I beg the Minister of State to back away from one of the most draconian measures since I was elected to this Houses, which is not today or yesterday.  Whatever the reasons behind it, this legislation will split families.  Heretofore house ownership had been sacrosanct.  Many people aspire to owning a house.  When people spend a lifetime working to own a house and arrive at the most vulnerable stage, is it right that someone else will own part of the house if they must enter a nursing home?  I suspect that an increasing number of Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers will have nothing to do with this.  I do not know if the Progressive Democrats are driving this but I can provide a guarantee from the Opposition benches.  This legislation will never be implemented in this country and there is a good reason for that.  It runs against principles held by every party and every group in society.  What one has, one owns.</P>
        <P>In the past, an elderly person would sign the house over to a son or daughter.  Included in the agreement was a room in which the elderly person could live.  There were many rows in rural <Col N="1211"/>Ireland over this.  The elderly people could not be put out of the house but had to endure a living hell within.  Every family is entitled to own the kingdom, which is the family home.  Many elderly people believe this Bill is a <i>fait accompli</i> and that this measure will happen regardless of the Bill being enacted.  Retired groups and everyone who has an understanding of the principles we value oppose this legislation.  Before the year is out I hope the Minister of State will be in Opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be happy to be under this roof on either side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is trying to take the roof from over elderly people.  In the Chamber there is a roof for us all, as long as it lasts.  This is a serious matter and it surprises me that the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party has allowed it to reach this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to restate points made on earlier stages of this Bill that arise now.  One cannot construe the family home as an asset.  If the Government wishes to acquire tax revenue from those who own assets, why not pursue those who have multiple houses here and abroad?  Instead, it pursues the main residence of a person of advanced years.  It is going after the home as if it were simply an asset for disposal.  I reject that.</P>
        <P>It is time to accept the concept of universal provision, that one is entitled to home care as a citizen.  The home is an accumulation of all one has experienced through life but because one is frail and dependent for a period between a few months and less than three years, the State has the right to grab part of the home.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Connaughton states, it will be totally destructive.  If any one of the exempted categories remain in the house they will have mitigated the State&rsquo;s clawback.  What will be the relationship between the elderly people and the beneficiaries of the estate?  One can project the nightmare it will create.  This is misery and it is time it is stopped.  I hope every Deputy &mdash; including those on the Government side &mdash; breaks rank and states that this is a push over the line from the Progressive Democrats, a party that is quickly evaporating, thankfully, from the Irish political scene.  Hasten the day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised at the reaction from my colleagues.  Two issues are being discussed, one of which concerns legislation that has not yet been published.

      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    <Title>Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Single Electricity Market) Bill 2006: Report and Final Stages. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, line 10, after &ldquo;MARKET&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;AND FOR MECHANISMS TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The aim of this amendment is to change the Title of the Bill by inserting the phrase &ldquo;AND FOR MECHANISMS TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS&rdquo;.  I thought it would be appropriate to amend the Title, particularly because in later amendments I am trying to insert some mechanism whereby the rights of consumers will be protected.  On many occasions on the Order of Business in the past year, Deputies Durkan, Eamon Ryan and I have referred to the price levels relating to gas and electricity in particular.  It was partly due to our campaigns in respect of CER that the price of gas was reduced and that the price of electricity was increased to the level originally envisaged.</P>
        <P>A number of the amendments in my name deal with this issue.  When the House debated what became the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, I tried to have it amended to the effect that a consumer panel would be provided within the Commission for Energy Regulation.  This would have reflected the substance of amendment No. 1, namely, that the rights of consumers be taken into consideration.</P>
        <P>A large part of the Bill deals with the regulation of the wholesale electricity market, the new all-island market of approximately 6,500 to 7,000 MW that is being created and the role of the SEM committee &mdash; the Single Market operator &mdash; CER and SONI, the Northern Ireland regulator, in determining prices of electricity.  We have engaged in lengthy debates in the past 12 to 18 months on trying to protect the rights of consumers.  In my view, householders and business consumers should be central to the development of the Single Market.  After all, the basic rationale behind this development is that the electricity <Col N="1216"/>markets of the Republic and Northern Ireland are small and isolated.  The southern market is obviously in transition and I have strong views regarding how it should evolve in the context of the future of the Electricity Supply Board and the development of competition in generation and the development of renewables as a source of electricity.  I also harbour strong views on the development of the Northern Ireland market as an example to the South of a botched privatisation.  Privatisation created the worst of all possible worlds for the Northern Ireland electricity consumer, with no competition and high prices for a decade and a half.  This was due to the isolation of the Northern Ireland market.  I wanted this amendment to be made to the Title so as to put in place a key responsibility for the Commission for Energy Regulation and the single electricity market operator to ensure consumers&rsquo; needs would be paramount.  The Bill must ensure the provision of secure and cheaper electricity supplies as a single all-island market develops.  It is a great historic step and I commend the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, in that regard.</P>
        <P>Consumers&rsquo; needs must be highlighted from the start.  All last autumn on the Order of Business I tried to raise the issue, that consumers&rsquo; interests were not sufficiently addressed, with electricity and gas price rises.  The mechanisms of the Commission for Energy Regulation are too inflexible to respond to changing market conditions and oil and gas price rises.  I know we are a price-taker in the two island markets but a more responsive regulator is needed.</P>
        <P>My other amendments seek to insert similar provisions to those in the United Kingdom, the most deregulated market in Europe, where OFGEM and energywatch encourage consumers to switch if an operator puts up its prices.  There is no choice of supplier in Ireland.  There was briefly with Airtricity but Veridian has not yet entered the domestic supply market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this well placed amendment which recognises the need to provide protection for the consumer.  In the past 12 months Members on this side of the House have repeatedly raised concerns that consumers&rsquo; interests were second to all others.  At one stage an increase was proposed in electricity and gas prices when the gas product was available free on the London market, yet no one took a blind bit of notice.  The question as to why, in the face of downward international price trends, it was impossible to reverse the trend in such a small market was raised with the Commission for Energy Regulation.  One brave Minister even told the House that he agreed with the proposal to raise prices.</P>
        <P>The amendment must be taken on board, particularly when two jurisdictions come together to provide a single service for a small market.  I <Col N="1217"/>had hoped these amendments would be taken on board on Committee Stage.  However, the Minister of State was not in an accommodating mood then and we felt dejected.  Now that the guillotine will be introduced for the Bill, the sharpness of the moment does not impress us.  The guillotine was introduced by a medical doctor in order to ease the pain of those who disagreed with the French revolutionary administration of the time.  I am not so sure it did and it certainly does not on this occasion.</P>
        <P>We have pointed out that the regulatory system, as it stands, does not do this, a problem that must be addressed.  There is a multiplicity of ways by which the interests of the electricity consumer can be protected; for example, through strengthening the integrity and security of the grid.  If the grid&rsquo;s integrity is brought into question, the consumer will either have or not have a supply.  Consumers in both jurisdictions must have ready and reliable access to electricity supplies at all times.</P>
        <P>What is to prevent the same situation that occurred last summer when the prices for the consumer defeated the laws of gravity and went up when internationally they were going down?  It is difficult for Members to explain the rationale of this to the public, particularly when they examine the international markets and come to their own conclusions.  The amendment appropriately addresses the problems I have highlighted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>While I support Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s amendment, I wish to make a broad procedural point.  With no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, he also took Committee Stage.  The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was in the Chamber one hour ago for Question Time.  This significant Bill covers a very technical area and it would benefit and improve the debate if the senior Minister took it.  The House deserves an explanation as to why he is not available.  This is the first legislation of its kind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Long Title is intended to encapsulate the Bill&rsquo;s purpose in general terms.  The mechanisms referred to in the amendment are captured in its drafting.  Section 9 establishes the protection of the interests of consumers of electricity, both North and South, as the principal objective of the Minister, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the SEM committee in the exercise of a single electricity market function.  Specific provisions for mechanisms to protect the interests of electricity consumers are already contained in the Title and the amendment is, therefore, unnecessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept section 9 refers to the importance of consumers&rsquo; interests. When the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 was brought forward, we tried to plug the gap in regard to the role of CER and the needs of consumers.  Representatives of CER attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and offered an explanation for the incredible swingeing increase of 34% in gas prices and a possible <Col N="1219"/>20% hike in  the cost of electricity.  Some of the background papers which I and other Opposition spokespersons have read point to glaring inconsistencies in regard to differences between household and business customers.</P>
        <P>It should be there in headlights at the beginning of the Bill that consumers&rsquo; needs are the key concern.  The electricity generators and networks are there to serve consumers, and their needs should be central.  The SEM committee, CER and SONI must keep them to the forefront of their view into the future.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Some of the provisions of this Bill replace existing provisions of the 1999 Act and some confer additional functions to those provided in the 1999 Act.  It is, therefore, necessary that the provisions of this Bill are read together with the provisions of the 1999 Act and the title of the single electricity market Bill needs to reflect this position.  It is, therefore, appropriate that the word &ldquo;amendment&rdquo; is reflected in the Title of the Bill and, accordingly, this amendment is not accepted.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 3, line 19, after &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;subject to the agreement of all relevant parties&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We discussed this issue for some time on Committee Stage in the hope the Minister might consider introducing a requirement for parliamentary approval for proposals.  There are reasons for and <Col N="1222"/>against that but, in the final analysis, parliamentary approval is the ultimate in democracy in respect of any proposal or legislation.  As we have seen an increase in the number of bodies with quite an amount of autonomy, and apropos the debate on the previous amendment, the recognition by everybody of the supremacy of Parliament should be borne in mind.  That does not, in any way, limit the degree to which the single electricity market operator, or otherwise, could carry out its functions or duties.  It may mean that the respective parliaments, authorities or those who might be affected by decisions made in a positive or negative way would be alerted to the fact.  That is the gist of all the amendments.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="6" />
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 1 is a commencement provision which allows the Minister to bring into force certain provisions in the Bill at the appropriate time, or else to bring the entire Act into force on the same day.  It is a standard feature in Bills and facilitates the appropriate implementation of the legislation.  Consultation is unnecessary so the amendment is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 8 proposes that any change to the definition of the department be subject to approval by relevant authorities.  This provision will only have effect if there is any change to the current constitution of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland and would allow us to reflect the change in our legislation.  The provision does not confer any power in this jurisdiction to effect such a change in Government departments in another <Col N="1223"/>jurisdiction and it would not, therefore, be appropriate for our legislation to require consultation on this matter.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 13 suggests that section 4 of the Bill be amended to provide that the SEM committee comprise such members as stand appointed to it from time to time by the relevant authorities.  The Schedule to the Bill sets out how appointments to the SEM committee are to be made, with specific provision as to the statutory consultation required to be undertaken.  This amendment is, therefore, unnecessary.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 18, proposed by Deputy Durkan, relates to section 5 of the Bill which provides for the drawing up and publication of working arrangements.  These working arrangements will set out the procedures to be adopted by the commission for the making of decisions with regard to SEM matters.  They will also describe how the commission will work together with the Northern Ireland regulatory authority in the exercise of their respective functions relating to the single electricity market.  Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s amendment proposes that relevant parties be consulted prior to any amendment being made to these working arrangements which will be adopted by the SEM.  The Bill provides that any decision as to the exercise of the relevant functions of the commission relating to an SEM matter shall be taken on behalf of the commission by the SEM committee.  Due to the independent nature of the SEM committee it is therefore not appropriate to require it to consult beyond the current provisions of this Bill.  Therefore, the amendment cannot be accepted.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 4, line 7, after &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; where it firstly occurs, to insert &ldquo;as approved by the respective Parliaments&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The same principle applies, but the reference to relevant authorities has been substituted by a reference to Parliaments.  It proposes recognising that issues may arise from time to time which may not be in accord with the policies, vision or plans of the relevant authorities or Parliament, whether in this jurisdiction or in Northern Ireland.  Many amendments have been tabled and we do not have much time so I will conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s amendment.  The Minister and the Taoiseach indicated there would be a new Oireachtas committee.  I presume it will come into being in the next Parliament, the 30th D&aacute;il.  Given the SEM is an all-Ireland body and operates under the implementation bodies established under the Belfast Agreement, can the Minister guarantee that the new Oireachtas committee dealing with the affairs of the implementation body will be estab<Col N="1224"/>lished, so that our successors in the next D&aacute;il, along with the Westminster Parliament and, I presume, our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Assembly, when it is reconstituted after the elections, will have the opportunity of raising issues that may arise, under the operation of the SEM?  Deputy Durkan has tabled many amendments in this regard but his fundamental point, for which I commend him, is that the people should be supreme.  We are their representatives in a parliamentary democracy and there should be a mechanism for D&aacute;il approval so the final say will not rest with bureaucrats.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, explained the role of ministerial directives and civil servants gave us very useful briefings, before the Bill came forward, on the difference in culture between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, arising from the fact the UK has gone down a more competitive market route than we.  Can the Minister of State assure the House that it was not the type of throwaway phrase the Taoiseach has always given but that it will lead to real Oireachtas accountability?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the Taoiseach would make throwaway remarks on Northern Ireland.  The SEM is outside the remit of the Good Friday Agreement.  Deputy Broughan raised this matter previously and I have tried to obtain information on what the Taoiseach said.  As soon as it comes to hand I will pass it on to him. </P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">This is a technical amendment which follows a long debate on Committee Stage.  The issue depends on which expert consultant one engages.  The Minister&rsquo;s expert advice is that the amendments are unnecessary but we have our expertise and it shows that, in a democracy, there can be two opinions.  We must be precise in determining which advice is correct.  Given the technical nature of the amendments, I spoke with my expert again and feel that amendment No. 6 is relevant.  It clearly indicates what is meant by the SEM operator.  In recent times it has become quite common for an abbreviation to be given, as well as the full title, though I do not know why that is the case.  Perhaps the Minister of State has been inspired in the period since Committee Stage, so that he will now embrace the amendments and save us all the consequent debate.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always inspired after listening to Deputy Durkan.  The term &ldquo;single electricity market operator&rdquo; is the title ascribed to the EirGrid-SONI contractual joint venture which will carry out this function.  The title is reflected in both this Bill and the corresponding Northern Ireland legislation and must be uniform in both.  I consulted with the Parliamentary Counsel following Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s raising of it on the previous occasion.  I am advised that the counsel intentionally refrained from abbreviating the term &ldquo;single electricity market&rdquo; in all but certain references to it in the Bill in the interests of ensuring the legislation is more reader friendly, particularly with regard to the clarity necessary when referring to the licence functions of the market operator.  I am also advised there is no legal requirement to have uniform abbreviations throughout the legislation and that it is editorially undesirable to do so.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>That appears somewhat inconsistent.  I am mindful of other legislation that could be used.  Why can we not continue using SEM?  It appears somewhat inconsistent that both terms would be used.  Perhaps the Minister of State&rsquo;s reading of it is correct.  SEM is referred to throughout from section 4.  In other legislation we stuck with whatever abbreviation we used.  I presume a legal problem will not arise in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Title of the Bill is set out in such a way as to make it clear that the function being referred to is that of the market operator.  That is what I am advised.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Chair will appreciate the purpose of this amendment, which is to amend the title by inserting &ldquo;Coiste Margadh Leictreachais Aonair or in the English language&rdquo;.

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Following reflection and consultation on the matter raised in amendment No. 10, I am of the view that such a translation may cause difficulties with the corresponding Northern Ireland legislation in that the title of the SEM committee must be uniform in both pieces of legislation to avoid any confusion.  Additionally, the SEM committee will be a sub-committee of the Commission for Energy Regulation and not an independent statutory body in its own right.  Accordingly, there is no legal requirement to translate the title of the committee in the legislation.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, line 12, after &ldquo;time&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;and the Commission may include representatives of the relevant trade unions on both sides of the border and a representative of electricity consumers&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of the amendment is to ensure union recognition and contribution as well as consumer contribution.  That would be in the interests of the consumer and promote the harmonisation of work within the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments suggest that specific provision be made for representatives from industry, consumer groups and trade unions to be included on the SEM committee and consulted in the appointment of members of the SEM committee under section 1(<i>a</i>) of Schedule 1 and the independent members under section 2.</P>
        <P>Having reflected on the points raised by the Deputies I would like to offer the following clarification.  The principal objective of the Minister, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the SEM committee in the exercise of their functions is to protect the interests of the consumers of electricity both North and South.  The SEM committee, which will be the independent decision making arbiter of the new market, will take decisions on all matters relating to the wholesale electricity market.  The Commission for Energy Regulation is not currently structured to reflect specific consumer representation and as a sub-committee of the commission it is necessary that the SEM committee mirror that parent structure.</P>
        <P>One of the key requirements of the role of the independent member to the SEM committee is the ability to act independently of interests in either jurisdiction.  I am of the view that the independent member to the SEM committee should be appointed on the basis of objective assessment of the independence of interests in each jurisdiction, their experience and expertise in regulation and energy as appropriate and their ability to fulfil a complex role.  The number of candidates who will be able to fulfil this role is likely to be limited but there is nothing to prevent members of the mentioned groups being appointed to the role should they fulfil such objectives.</P>
        <P>The introduction of an approval system involving consumer groups and-or trade union groups, both North and South, while also providing for the foregoing qualifications, is likely to be unwieldy to say the least.  It would impose a major administration difficulty in the operation of the SEM committee and the likelihood of agreement <Col N="1228"/>on the appointment of the independent member would be remote.</P>
        <P>I am also of the view that specific legislation provision for consultation with the various interest groups mentioned is neither necessary nor appropriate.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister consulting with such groups as he deems necessary as part of the appointment process.</P>
        <P>Consultation with the regulatory authorities regarding appointment by the Minister to the SEM committee applies due to their technical expertise in the sector and is key to ensuring the proper functioning of the SEM committee.  However, the Bill is the first legislative step towards the establishment of an all-island energy market where such consumer representations may feature and will be considered in the context of future legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not aware that my amendments Nos. 17 and 19 were in this group.  I support the principle of Deputy Ferris&rsquo;s amendment No. 12.  These two amendments are the reason I sought in the earlier vote to amend the Title of the Bill.  Amendment No. 17 proposes to insert a new subsection (7) which states: &ldquo;The SEM Committee shall always take full cognisance of the impact of Committee decisions on household and business electricity consumers and shall refer in this matter to the relevant statutory consumer protection agencies within the Commission and the Authority&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>There is grave dissatisfaction with the workings of the SER.  I referred to SONI in that regard earlier but I should have referred to the Northern Ireland regulator.  In this Bill, the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill we passed recently and the amendment to the 1999 Act there should be a forthright system to protect the rights of consumers. That is still not in place, making these amendments central to the Bill.</P>
        <P>The 1999 Act, which established the Commission for Energy Regulation and set out its functions, refers to the interests of consumers but it does not ensure that consumers are at the heart of the process.  I tried in amendment No. 19 to insert in section 9(3) of the 1999 Act that it shall be the duty of the Minister and the commission to establish a representative consumer panel of not less than 15 persons within the Commission for Energy Regulation which will be continuously consulted on energy market pricing policy.  The more competitive British market has such a mechanism.  Deputy Ferris&rsquo;s amendment calling for consultation with relevant trade unions on both sides of the Border and representatives of electricity consumers could also be a mechanism for ensuring this will be the case.</P>
        <P>Consumers feel far removed from consideration, as the Minister of State saw when he attended meetings of the Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources when Mr. Tom Reeves and his colleagues were present.  Often the anger consumers have felt <Col N="1229"/>throughout the lifetime of this Government was a result of the lack of control arising from the refusal of the Minister to answer to the D&aacute;il and the CER&rsquo;s lack of a mechanism to listen to consumers.  On the CER website and documentation on the increases for the ESB before Christmas, there were generation portfolios, costs over the previous two years and elaborate mathematical schedules to demonstrate the need for a 20% increase, which subsequently became 13%, but there was no mechanism whereby consumers were represented.</P>
        <P>Consumers should be at the heart of the process.  The SEM committee must resolve many technical issues but I called a vote earlier on amendment No. 1 because I want these provisions to be inserted into the Bill.  The next Government will have to re-examine the CER.  If there is an all-island market, the SEM may develop into an all-island regulator or act for both the regulator in Northern Ireland and the CER in the Republic in an all-island regulatory body.  We will move in that direction after 1 November and something more forthright than the 1999 Act will be necessary.  I called a vote on this during the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill a few months ago because electricity generation and distribution and energy security should be for business and household consumers and no one else.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support these amendments.  We discussed this at length on Committee Stage and the Minister did not agree with us.  We are creating a new market and new procedures and it is important to recognise in such circumstances we can over-legislate but that can be changed.  It is better to be safe than sorry.  We would be acting in the interests of people in both jurisdictions if we accept the amendments.</P><Col N="1230"/>
        <P>Amendment No. 46 calls for the insertion of &ldquo;or consumer needs&rdquo;.  We must incorporate these needs more graphically than has been the case so far.  It is of importance to consumers in both jurisdictions.  It would not weaken the legislation to ensure the needs of the consumer are recognised.  All other needs are recognised, those of market forces and regulators.  This system is supposed to generate competition and openness and open markets in favour of the consumer so why are we so sensitive about excluding him?  He is the person who expects us, as legislators, to provide for him.  That applies equally to the consumer in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>If in future there are rises in gas and electricity prices against international trends, how will it be explained to the consumer?  No one is willing to explain it anymore.  The Minister will not explain it in the House and the regulator will state it was his considered opinion that prices should rise.  We welcome the opinion of the regulator, the SEM and the relevant Ministers in both jurisdictions, but the consumer interests, along with trade unions and other relevant bodies, are of vital importance so we must insert this condition now.</P>

	<P>The SEM Bill is the first legislative step in the establishment of an all-island energy market.  It puts in place a single wholesale market for the island of Ireland.  As a result of issues raised on Committee Stage, we gave this serious consideration because there is merit in the issues raised by Deputies in the context of the long-term establishment of an all-island energy market.  The appropriate time to debate these issues, however, is when legislation is being introduced to deal with that all-island market.  The SEM committee has a purely technical regulatory role in the operation of the wholesale electricity market and in that context the types of representations being proposed would not be appropriate.</P>

	<P>The amendment proposes amending section 9BA(2)(<i>b</i>)(ii) to establish a minimum and maximum threshold for the purpose of <Col N="1235"/>licences under subparagraph (iii) which provides for licensees who produce below a minimum level of 10 megawatts.  Such licensees can produce up to a threshold and have a choice with regard to whether they participate in the SEM.  It is clear from the current drafting of subparagraphs (i) and (iii) that this is what is meant.  The proposal which would set a reference to a minimum or maximum is not appropriate and would only lead to confusion, particularly as there has never been any intention to provide for a maximum threshold.  The proposed amendment is, therefore, unacceptable.  </P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">We had quite a discussion on this amendment on Committee Stage.  It seeks to introduce precision to the description.  The term &ldquo;The State&rdquo; is used in the Bill.  The amendment would substitute the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; for &ldquo;this&rdquo;.  When talking about another jurisdiction, it is appropriate to use the words &ldquo;this State&rdquo; which is in no way derogatory.  It merely recognises that there are references to two states.  I do not propose to delay the business of the House but there are two jurisdictions, which is why we should have a joint approach.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I do not wish to delay the proceedings of the House other than to mention that this amendment is similar to another introduced by the Minister on Committee Stage.  It concerns the introduction of a comma or apostrophe at the appropriate location.  The Ceann Comhairle will be happy to learn that we had an enlightened debate on this precise issue on Committee Stage.  As the result was inconclusive, I do not propose to delay the proceedings of the House other than to ask the Minister of State if, in the interim, he has appreciated the wisdom of what took place on Committee Stage and will now embrace it in the fashion in which it was intended?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>As we know, the Chairman of the Select Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn, suggested that I consider some of the drafting amendments tabled by Oppositions Deputies before Report Stage.  I have consulted the Parliamentary Counsel on a number of such amendments and I am satisfied that the drafting <Col N="1237"/>of the Bill is appropriate, relevant and consistent with standard drafting practice.  Amendment No. 27 proposes the insertion of an additional comma.  The advice of the Parliamentary Counsel is that the insertion of a comma as suggested by Deputy Durkan in the amendment would change the intended meaning of the provision as drafted.  Therefore, the amendment cannot be accepted.  Amendments Nos. 60 to 62, inclusive, also proposed by the Deputy, which concern the insertion of additional commas in section 18, cannot be accepted for the same reason.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The wording in section 9 of the Bill reflects the need to ensure all reasonable demands for electricity are met.  This is meant to exclude demands that may in some way be unreasonable and, therefore, impossible for the State to meet.  Accordingly, acceptance of the amendment could expose the State to the risk of being sued for not discharging a requirement beyond its control.  It should be noted that the current provisions of the Bill are consistent with the wording of the relevant Internal Market directive.  Therefore, I do not accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>At the height of the winter season, Christmas, for example, could somebody say these were unreasonable demands?  If one of the Minister of State&rsquo;s successors had to explain why there had been a blackout, this could get him or her off the hook in respect of security of supply.    </P>

	<P>While this Fine Gael Bill is well intentioned, as the Minister outlined, the Bill as currently drafted would not stand up to European scrutiny and would contravene the European fuel quality directive.  In his contribution to the debate last night the Minister confirmed the thrust of both sides of the House is in the same direction.  On Monday last, he announced the Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce a bio-fuels obligation which would ensure bio-fuels would represent 5.75% of Ireland&rsquo;s transport fuel market by 2009 and 10% by 2020.</P>
        <P>In recent years in particular we have seen a greater urgency in the approach of all political parties and the public to fuel consumption.  In 1970 we had approximately 500,000 vehicles on the road.  In reply to a recent D&aacute;il question I tabled, it was revealed the number of vehicles on our roads has increased to approximately 2.25 million.  The knock-on effect of that is a five-fold increase in the amount of fuel used by vehicles here.  This phenomenon is not unique to Ireland.  We have seen a significant increase in the number of vehicles in the developed world.  This increases the urgency to find fossil fuel, which is a finite resource.  We will not see the implications of the exhaustion of fossil fuels but our children must face up to that fact.  It would be irresponsible if we did not ensure a move from fossil fuel to a bio-fuel culture.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Minister for Agriculture and Food has become involved in this debate.  The Minister has introduced a new bio-enegy scheme providing for establishment grants of up to 50% of the costs of miscanthus and willow on set-aside land, which has been in receipt of European aid of &euro;45 per hectare.  In Carlow, farmers have had to cease growing sugar beet and the number of crop options is reducing every year.  The Teagasc research station at Oak Park has done much in the area of bio-fuels, including miscanthus and willow.  Initial capital costs are prohibitive but the introduction of the scheme will alleviate some of the costs of growing these crops.  Farmers can receive up to &euro;1,450 per hectare in establishment costs, with the balance to be invested by farmers.  The scheme provides opportunities for farm diversification and encourages farmers to consider these crops as an alternative.  The closing date for receipt of applications is 28 February 2007.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food will also introduce a top up payment of &euro;80 per hectare in 2007 to support energy crops.  The payment is in addition to the EU energy crops premium of &euro;45 per hectare, bringing the total payment to &euro;125 per hectare.  This Government has doubled the renewable electricity capacity in the past two years.  We will exceed the 2010 targets and these have been revised from 13.2% to 15%.  The Government is conscious of its obligations.</P>
        <P>The Government has also established a ministerial bio-energy taskforce, comprising Ministers from seven Departments.  It has met on a regular <Col N="1242"/>basis with the goal of drawing up a national biomass action plan, to be published in the near future.  The Government has also published five major studies on renewable energy, bio-energy and ocean energy to inform public policy.  The public is interested in this matter, which should be the subject of further debate.</P>
        <P>The Government has published an energy policy Green Paper, setting out the framework for a national energy policy in the medium to long term and proposing new targets for renewable energy.  A White Paper on energy is being finalised and will provide a roadmap for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s energy sector until 2020.  Studies and consultations over the past five years are informing policy development and leading to several innovative programmes for renewable energy.</P>
        <P>Much work is being carried out on wind turbines.  Questions remain over the proliferation of wind turbines but this is an area that deserves more investment.  We have a long way to go to meet the standards of Britain, France and Scandinavian countries.  The 2005 pilot bio-fuels excise relief programme resulted in eight projects.  A number of the successful companies are anxious that they commence as soon as possible.  It is important the Government focuses on bio-energy and substitutes for fossil fuels.  As a Parliament we cannot sidestep our responsibilities.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Opposition&rsquo;s well-intentioned Bill but it cannot be accepted for the reasons explained last night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the publication of this Bill but I feel compelled to vote against it for the reasons outlined by the Minister last night.  The means by which energy is produced and used has become important because of the impact of global warming.  All Members have a common position on this matter.  For years the impact of global warming was discussed, with many denying that it was occurring.  Even the most sceptical must admit that the world is warming.  The consequences are astounding and the root cause, the increased emissions of carbon dioxide, must be addressed.  It is vital that we play our part in reducing the amount of carbon dioxide produced, helping to lessen the harmful effects of global warming.</P>
        <P>The Government introduced two bio-fuel mineral oil tax relief schemes in 2005 and 2006.  As a result, a significant volume of bio-fuel is coming on the market in Ireland.  The use of bio-fuel in vehicles reduces the amount of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and I congratulate the Government for introducing a 50% reduction in VRT for cars that use bio-fuels.  I commend the commitment of the Minister for Finance to the green energy programme.  While the number of cars that can use bio-fuel is not high, the 50% reduction should ensure more energy saving cars, lorries and vans will be used.  Oil, petrol or diesel, is a finite resource and we must conserve it.  The use of such fuels in cars, <Col N="1243"/>resulting in high CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions, is doing untold damage to our environment.  Steps that reduce CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions are steps in the right direction.  I am pleased the Government will link VRT with CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  	Bio-fuels are renewable and offer important opportunities to the agricultural sector at a time when many of its traditional sources of income are under threat.  It is important farmers be given every encouragement to grow crops from which bio-fuel can be produced.  The incentives put in place by the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Food are welcome.</P>
        <P>If somebody had suggested a few years ago that cars, vans, tractors and lorries would be run on a fuel grown by our farmers he or she would have been laughed at but that is occurring.  While more research is needed to find the most efficient and cost-effective way of producing bio-fuel, it is important that every incentive be given to producers and farmers to make us reach fuel sufficiency from our natural resources.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the Minister for Agriculture and Food announced that REPS farmers are not excluded from the bioenergy scheme despite some scaremongering by some members of the Opposition.  Over recent months there has been a noticeable increase in the number of constituents in Sligo-Leitrim inquiring as to what grants are available for those interested in renewable energy.  These greener home grants are available for householders who want to install renewable heating sources, such as wood biomass boilers and stoves, solar panel and heat pumps.  Individual grants of up to &euro;6,500 are available and I encourage as many people as possible to apply for them.  Not only will the grant help to offset the cost of installation but these heating methods help to cut CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and thereby lessen the effects of global warming.  I congratulate the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources who has secured an extra &euro;20 million in the recent budget to finance the demand for these grants.  Many people in Sligo-Leitrim avail of them.  We have a target of generating 15% of electricity from renewable sources by 2010.  Wind, and to a lesser extent, wave, generated energy are two abundant sources which it is important to support to the maximum.  The Government&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;119 million to help develop wind and wave electricity is evidence of the commitment to developing alternative renewable sources of energy and is firm proof of the green credentials of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that Fine Gael has taken an interest in energy.  For the reasons outlined by the Minister, however, I am unfortunately unable to support the Bill.  Energy conservation is important and this Government is committed to developing alternative energy sources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OllieWilkinsonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilkinson</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have a chance to speak on this important subject.  The increase <Col N="1244"/>in oil prices a year or more ago focused our minds on the importance of considering alternative sources of energy.  When I was growing up I never heard anything about global warming or the ozone layer.  Modern communications make it possible to see at first hand what global warming is doing to our planet.  While we are only a speck on that planet it is important that we pull our weight.  Although I welcome Fine Gael&rsquo;s belated interest in alternative energy I commend the Government and the relevant Ministers on their actions and the incentives they have given to provide bio-fuel.</P>
        <P>Following the loss of the sugar beet crop it is important that farmers have other crops to work their land.  Sugar beet was a major loss.  It paid so much better than other crops that it is not easy to find a replacement.  The various crops suggested here and the incentives provided by the Government will go a long way to achieving that.  The provision of feed from some of the crops grown is important and the cost of, and price for, grain are rising rapidly.  Grain too can be used as a bio-fuel.  When sugar beet was removed we were told that crude oil would have to reach $100 a barrel to make fuel from beet a viable option.  Since then the cost of crude oil has dropped and there may be times when our focus slips.  This, however, is a long-term issue and we must focus seriously on providing bio-fuel.</P>
        <P>In 1970 or so there were little more than 500,000 cars on our roads, today there are 2.2 million and their emissions contribute to what is happening, although we are only a speck on the planet.  The interest in bio-fuels provides the opportunity to explore alternative land use possibilities following the recent CAP reform and changes to the sugar regime.  Excise duty relief for bio-fuels will be extended from &euro;20 million in 2006 to &euro;35 million in 2007 and &euro;50 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010.  This relief when fully operational is expected to support the use and production of some 160 million litres of bio-fuel per annum, some 20 times the current level of excise relief.  These are fabulous figures which show the total long-term commitment of this Government to the provision and production of bio-fuel.</P>
        <P>There are many other energy sources to be considered, especially wind energy.  While wind farms are controversial in some areas, An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s lack of consistency in some cases is to be deplored.  It is vitally important that planning regulations for the provision of wind energy be reconsidered.  Wind farms are widely visible in some parts of the country whereas in others permission for them has been refused because they would be in scenic areas.  That has happened in County Waterford.  It is difficult to understand how when the Government is pushing alternative energy, as it needs to do, an inspector from An Bord Plean&aacute;la can consent to a planning application but when it goes back to the board it is refused.  There should be some consistency in this process.</P><Col N="1245"/>
        <P>I am delighted the Government has progressed bio-fuel development.  I look forward to seeing farmers and everybody else benefit from that development.</P>

	<P>It must come as a crushing blow to Fine Gael to discover that its proposal is highly illegal.  It is unfortunate that the party did not carry out the requisite research before introducing the Bill.  Nonetheless, the legislation provides us with the opportunity to discuss this important issue and for that we should be grateful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raised this matter on the Adjournment in October 2004.  When reading back over the Official Report, I realised how out of date what I said at that time &mdash; which was then all brand new &mdash; has become.  I also came to realise the level of unanimity that exists in respect of this matter.  The Oireachtas committee of which I am a member tried to pull together everyone&rsquo;s thinking on climate change and the development of a biofuels industry, but the one group that offered resistance was that comprising the Fine Gael Members.  That is unfortunate because we are all interested in the same thing, namely, the development of an indigenous bio-fuels industry.</P>
        <P>We have a golden opportunity to work together for the good of the country and arrive at a political response to climate change, developing a biofuels industry and changing the way we use fuel, particularly in the area of transport.  We could take this opportunity to demonstrate how politicians of different hues can work together, seek to implement the best of each of our parties&rsquo; proposals and, for the good for the country, move forward.</P>
        <P>We must re-examine this matter because, ignoring the illegality involved, the sentiment behind Fine Gael&rsquo;s Bill is highly laudable.  The one difficulty I have with the proposal outlined in the Bill &mdash; the Minister alluded to this &mdash; is that it does nothing to encourage the development of an indigenous industry.</P>

However, there is nothing to state that this must be done in Ireland and there is no encouragement for farmers to grow the relevant crops to develop an indigenous bio-fuels industry.  I have no doubt that the Brazilians, who have been spearheading developments in this area for many years, would see this as a major opportunity.  I would not begrudge them such an opportunity but I would <Col N="1246"/>prefer to see an entrepreneurial spirit being fostered among Irish farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and an indigenous industry being developed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Earlier this week, the Minister made a commitment to ensure that bio-fuels will represent 5.75% of Ireland&rsquo;s transport fuel market by 2009.  This, however, should not be the limit of our ambition; it should be only the start of it.  When I read my Adjournment debate contribution from 2004, I discovered how far we have come.  I have no doubt that the targets laid down by the Minister are only the beginning and that they do not represent the limit of our ambitions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister paid tribute to the ministerial bio-energy task force.  This has been highly successful and it is extremely necessary.  The Departments that have a role to play in the development of an indigenous bio-fuel industry are finally working together.  People who have been producing and providing different type bio-fuels heretofore encountered difficulties because one Department would know exactly what they were doing, while another would not.  People had nothing but trouble from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners in particular.</P>
        <P>It is necessary that we develop an industry in this area, not just because it is the right thing to do but also to ensure that the production of fuels within Ireland would reduce to some degree our 100% dependence on imported fuels.  Such a development is also necessary in the context of our CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> footprint and waste generation.  If we are to encourage the development of an industry, we must do so wholeheartedly and on an ambitious scale.</P>
        <P>In 2004 I was seeking the removal of excise relief in its entirety and that the only limit applying should relate to time.  This would have allowed the market to develop.  Prudence has been the hallmark of this Government, which is understandable to an extent, but we need to display a certain flair and determination.  Like the Brazilians, we must develop, in a wholehearted and encouraging way, opportunities for farmers, particularly at a time when farming and traditional agricultural practices are in decline.  Farmers need as many opportunities as they can possibly get.  Developments in this area would allow farmers to change and diversify and this would ensure that people would be retained on the land.</P>
        <P>Developments such as those to which I refer have not yet come about, but I will continue to encourage their introduction because we must take action in regard to transport fuel in use.  The <Col N="1247"/>transport sector makes, for example, the greatest contribution to our CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> footprint.</P>
        <P>We must take cognisance of the notion of the entrepreneurial farmer.  For too long, farmers have had a reputation for constantly seeking protective practices.  Development of a biofuels industry would provide farmers with new opportunities.  I would give 100% support to any measure that would help to develop our indigenous biofuel industry.  Leaving aside its illegality, I cannot support the Bill because it would deny the opportunity for such to develop.</P>

	<P>I am sorry that I missed Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s contribution.

In such circumstances, I must unfortunately state that I cannot support Fine Gael&rsquo;s Bill.</P>

	<P>Another U-turn by the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies McHugh, James Breen, Connolly, Healy and Eamon Ryan.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill as an intelligent proposal to promote the use of biofuels.  The Government has set ambitious targets for the use of such fuels as a component of vehicle fuels.  However, there is little evidence that the work which needs to be done to achieve those targets is being carried out.  Even the increase in energy grants announced last week is insufficient and it excludes farmers who are part of REPS.  The reality is, therefore, that there is little likelihood that sufficient numbers of farmers will be attracted to working in an area in which many have expressed an interest or that the large amount of lands required for growing the relevant crops will come on stream.</P>
        <P>I am aware of one estimate which indicates that it would require 400,000 hectares of rape seed to produce sufficient fuel to meet less than 2% of vehicle fuel demand.  That is more than the current area under crops in this State and it represents just under 10% of the country&rsquo;s overall agricultural area.  This is an indication of the scale of production that would be required.</P>
        <P>Traditional crops are not the only option.  There would, however, be scope to greatly expand the area devoted to them, particularly if farmers were permitted to do so while retaining their single farm payments.</P>
        <P>Forestry is another potential area for the production of biomass and Teagasc forecasts it will double by 2025.  There is also great potential in the significant amount of set-aside land which could be used to grow particular types of plant. <Col N="1248"/> Given the large area of land that is unused or underused, much more attention should be given to encouraging farmers to grow energy crops such as willow.  Where necessary, we should be arguing for changes to EU regulations that present an impediment to the use of such land, with due regard to the SSEs.  The US, where energy crop production has greatly expanded, is considering allowing 36 million acres of set-aside land to be made available for this purpose.  Similar changes need to be introduced in Ireland.</P>
        <P>While the potential exists to expand energy crop production, there is also the issue of processing.  I visited one such production facility in Wexford last year and I was greatly impressed.  Its operators were keen to impress on me that such plants could only meet a small proportion of the demand that will exist if targets are to be achieved.  More alarming was the fact that they would have to import bio-fuel crops in order to maintain production because of the lack of domestic cultivation.</P>
        <P>It is disappointing that more was not done to encourage the transformation of the former sugar factories at Mallow and Carlow for the production of fuels from sugar beet.  I understand from those familiar with the area that this could have been feasible.  Had it been done, not only would beet growers have been provided with an alternative outlet for their crops, even an expanded one, but new jobs could have been created to replace those lost through the EU enforced closure of Irish sugar plants.  Unfortunately, Greencore had more to gain from moving into property development than retaining the plants as a viable operation.  The Government chose not to exercise its golden share to influence the decisions, despite Greencore presiding over the loss of hundreds of jobs and the destruction of the most successful public enterprise in the State&rsquo;s history.</P>
        <P>If we do not take the necessary measures to encourage greatly increased crop production and the establishment of processing facilities, Ireland will be merely substituting its dependence on imported fossil fuels for imported bio-fuels.  While it would be better for the environment, it would not benefit the economy.  It would be a shame if the potential were to be missed as it could provide a much needed alternative income source for farmers and many jobs in the processing sector.</P>
        <P>While I support the Bill to encourage the use of blended fuels, we must not lose sight of the fact that bio-fuels need to be domestically produced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Fine Gael Party on introducing this Bill.  With the current climate of rising oil prices, it is timely that the House should debate this important issue.  The transport sector is dependent on oil to enable it to function.  With volatility in the oil markets and its effects on the environment, the promotion of a low carbon economy is vital.  In that context the <Col N="1249"/>encouragement of the bio-fuel sector is critical.  Owing to the similarity of bio-fuels to fuel produced from fossil fuels, the mechanism of adopting the supply system that exists is simple.  No obstacles exist in that regard.</P>
        <P>When looking for an alternative to oil, what better place to look than to our agricultural sector?  Recently a golden opportunity was lost when the Mallow and Carlow sugar factories closed.  The Government had a ready-made opportunity to convert the two factories into bio-fuel processing plants.  Although the opportunity was lost, we should ensure that future opportunities for the farming sector and the environment are not lost.  The transition to bio-fuels will be a major leap and incentives are needed.  Studies have suggested that one incentive would be to exempt bio-fuels from excise duties.  The UK and Germany have followed this suggestion.</P>
        <P>Farmers are experiencing difficulties in making a living from the land with the result that many of them have to work off the farm.  Alternative farm enterprises must be explored, for which the Bill presents opportunities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of bio-fuels has been debated in the House several times in the past three years.  Despite this, little positive action has been taken.  Any measure that helps Ireland to come remotely close to its Kyoto commitments is welcome.  However, despite agreeing with the motives behind this Bill, I fear it is technically flawed.</P>
        <P>Section 2, dealing with definitions, states bio-fuel means any mineral oil which is produced from biomass and includes products manufactured or produced from seeds or plant materials.  However, the definition of a mineral oil is oil derived from petroleum or petrochemicals.  It would have been more correct to use the term hydrocarbon oil, not mineral oil, in this definition.  In a later section, fuel oil is defined as heavy oil, the colour of which is darker than 8 on the colour index.  That definition is outdated as the colour depends on the processing method that gives rise to the fuel oil.</P>
        <P>The pace at which the Government has addressed the subject is alarming.  In the past six months Ministers have found a greener conscience.  This is merely to appease the electorate as we face into a general election with nothing concrete having been done.  Last week the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, announced grants for the growing of miscanthus crops.  While welcome, there is a need to expand on this and develop the link between agriculture and industry.  Bio-fuel refineries should be built near hub towns and cities in areas where the growing of alternative crops can be maximised.</P>
        <P>The past few months have seen many industries relocate abroad.  Our soils and climate are ideal for the growing of alternative crops.  In the long term this would reduce fuel costs and encourage manufacturers to remain.  The weakness of the <Col N="1250"/>grant scheme announced by the Minister is that it ultimately benefits tillage farmers who have the best land.  It is of little benefit to farmers in disadvantaged areas, like many of those on the western seaboard.  Schemes that would encourage farmers to reclaim land for specific crop growth should be introduced immediately.</P>
        <P>The speed at which the grant scheme was announced by the Minister is exemplified in the uncertainty regarding how those in receipt of REPS payments will be affected.  Even the Minister is not clear on the effect as she stated she is reviewing the overall position in the context of preparations for the introduction of REPS 4.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Much has been made of trying to meet our EU requirements.  The bio-fuels progress report shows that the bio-fuels share of our fuel consumption in 2005 had risen to 0.05%, not far short of the target of 0.06%.  Why was the target set for Ireland, the lowest of  those set for all EU member states?  The reason we have failed so miserably in advancing alternative fuel crops is the lack of imagination, foresight and responsibility shown by the Government.  Unfortunately, those characteristics are to be found across all the Departments of this Administration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Bill, designed to reduce the incidence of ozone layer depletion, one of the greatest threats to humanity.  The protection of the Earth&rsquo;s ozone layer has been one of the major challenges over the past 40 years.  It spans the fields of environment, international co-operation and sustainable development.</P>
        <P>In 1893 Rudolf Diesel was conscious of the dangers posed by the unfettered burning of fossil fuels.  He built the first prototype diesel engine that ran on coal dust, but he wanted to design an engine that would run on vegetable oil.  His dream still lives and bio-diesel is a simple chemical reaction involving alcohol, grease, fats and oils.  All diesel engines built since 1992 can use bio-diesel without any need for modification.</P>
        <P>Our dependence on petrol threatens our energy supply security, affects our environment and weakens our economy.  Developing the technology to produce bio-fuels will create additional fuel supply options.  This can impact positively on these issues and establish safe, clean and sustainable alternatives to petrol.</P>
        <P>Nobody knows how long worldwide petroleum resources will last.  We can be sure, however, that crude oil is a finite resource.  With virtually 100% dependence on imported oil, our economy is particularly vulnerable to price hikes and severe energy disruptions.  Producing and using fuels from renewable domestic biomass resources will help ease our dependence on foreign oil and reduce our vulnerability to these disruptions.</P>
        <P>Only small numbers of hybrid cars powered by more energy efficient alternative fuels are in use.  I welcome the recent introduction of an incentive to encourage motorists to change over to these vehicles.  Fuels like ethanol and biodiesel burn <Col N="1251"/>with 80% less hydrocarbons and toxic metals than regular petrol.  We should follow the lead of Austria and certain parts of the United States where public transport systems run on vegetable oils.  This is the approach we should take.  Instead of stories about the level of emissions from ministerial cars, we should begin to lead by example in this area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Bill not as a major contribution to the issues of climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, bio-fuels and other alternative energies, but as a small start in this area.  The background to today&rsquo;s debate was set only last week in the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC.  There is no dispute regarding this report&rsquo;s conclusion that the global environment is in serious danger.</P>
        <P>The distillation of the scientific knowledge and logic of the world&rsquo;s leading researchers on climate change makes truly shocking reading.  They predict, for example, temperature increases of between 1.1&deg; Celsius and 4&deg; Celsius by the end of the century and corresponding increases in sea levels from 28 cm to 43 cm.  The report forecasts the disappearance of the Arctic Sea ice during summer and increasing numbers of heat waves and more intense tropical storms.  It states that the effect of all these changes will be poverty, starvation, pollution and death.  Most worrying of all, the report states it is not possible to stop or prevent this development; we can only seek to stem the scale of it.</P>
        <P>This problem must be tackled strongly and urgently.  A great opportunity was missed for farmers to use the closures of the Mallow and Carlow sugar plants for the growing of bio-fuels.  I support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Green Party, I am pleased to support this Bill.  I commend Fine Gael on its introduction, which allows us to debate this important issue.  I support the development of bio-fuels for several reasons.  In the first instance, I support the principle of having our own secure energy supply which, in the event of a shock in global oil supply production, would ensure we have a baseline fuel supply source to provide for public transport, essential machinery and other elements of society&rsquo;s fuel necessities.  Within the objective of promoting bio-fuels, I also support endeavours to place a requirement on all oil suppliers to provide a certain blended mix.  This is preferable to us trying, by tax reductions alone, to promote the introduction of separate fuels away from the ordinary mix.</P>
        <P>Having expressed my support for the Bill, I wish to impart some words of caution.  We must be clear, concise and scientific as to what are the likely future outcomes and directions in this area.  One future direction of which we must take cognisance and be concerned about is the likeli<Col N="1252"/>hood that in any support system we devise for the development of bio-fuels, the latter may well come from imported sources.  We must recognise that under existing World Trade Organisation, WTO, rules, it is difficult, if not impossible, for any country to devise support mechanisms or set market conditions that require the use of domestic supplies only.  Such practice is precluded under WTO rules.  Within the EU framework, countries such as Germany and Holland are attempting, if not to set specific national regulations in terms of which fuels can be supported, but at least to tie into support mechanisms the requirement that certain environmental or other standards are met in terms of new fuels.  In this way, there is at least an attempt to ensure products come from a sustainable source.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My second caveat is that as well as the possibility that such fuels will be imported rather than grown by Irish farmers, the likelihood is that they will come from countries such as Brazil, which have a significant competitive advantage in this area by dint of their warmer climate, economies of scale and their experience of working in this industry for several years.  I have seen figures for crops grown in Brazil, whether bioethanol or palm oil crops, which show they can be produced for a fraction of the costs of similar crops grown in the United States, for example, such as wheat-based bioethanol.  One can only assume the same would apply to similar bioethanol or other bio-fuel crops grown here.</P>
        <P>We must be aware of the possibility that any supplier who avails of legislation or Government support systems in this area may by right and with the protection of international trade rules order those fuels from a distant country.  The reason I support the German and Dutch attempted restrictions in this regard is that there is also an environmental concern regarding such imports in that they may involve the generation in countries such as Brazil of crops in a manner that has a detrimental effect on their environment and, therefore, on the global environment, particularly in respect of the decimation of rain forests.</P>
        <P>The second area of caution relates to the amount of carbon reduction that cones with the production of any particular bio-fuel or biodiesel crop.  Where we are using a waste oil and converting it, a 100% reduction can be gained because otherwise it is a waste product.  Various international reports show, however, that for some biodiesel and bio-fuel crops, the level of reduction is relatively low as a consequence of the inputs required for growing the crop.</P>
        <P>There are two actions we must take.  We must take a scientific approach in terms of the reductions that will be achieved, and we must develop our support mechanisms in a way that supports Irish farmers within the existing WTO framework.  Notwithstanding these caveats, I support efforts to generate a secure bio-fuel supply, separate to the general oil supply which will peak <Col N="1253"/>and be subject to dramatic variations in coming years.  I support the Bill&rsquo;s intentions in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The refusal of the Government to accept this Bill, which is environmentally conscious and economically sensible, is a disgrace.  Nobody, including Members on the Government side, doubt the scale of the economic and environmental difficulties that lie ahead if we do not address the energy crisis that awaits us.</P>
        <P>To neutralise the effect of global warming on the earth&rsquo;s population, it is generally agreed that the level of global greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by 70% by 2100.  As a first step towards this objective, the Kyoto Agreement was drawn up with the aim of reducing global emissions by 5.2% by 2012, based on 1990 levels.  Under this agreement, to which Ireland is a signatory, we undertook to limit the increase in these emissions to 13% based on our 1990 emissions.  Without any action, it is now estimated that our emissions will rise by 37%, almost three times the permissible level.  I understand the report leaked last week by the Environmental Protection Agency to <i>The Irish Times</i>, which may be published tomorrow, shows that our emissions are out of control, particularly in the area of transport.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In putting forward this Bill, Fine Gael makes the point clearly and practically that we must take the first step to address this crisis.  Bio-fuels have the potential to provide significant benefits to our farmers, our environment and our economy.  Most European states have begun the process of kick starting the bio-fuel industry by using set aside land for the growing of bio-fuel crops.  Ireland must act now if we are to reach these standards.  It is clear Irish agricultural land offers significant potential to develop alternative energy crops.  We must be practical in what we can achieve &mdash; at least in the initial stages of developing a viable bio-fuel industry.  However, it makes sense to follow the examples of other EU states which are much more advanced in such technologies than Ireland.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The greatest potential for Irish farmers and industry lies in the development of bio-diesel and bio-ethanol.  We must focus on developing this area as a priority.  The immediate focus must be on developing the process of fuel blending.  Essentially, this would involve blending standard motoring diesel with rape seed oil to produce bio-diesel and petrol with bio-ethanol.  That is why Fine Gael has developed a comprehensive policy in this area.</P>
        <P>Excise duty on bio-fuels produced from all renewable energy crops should be removed.  This would drive down costs and entice more players into the market.  We urgently need establishment grants for producer groups that would consist of up to 50% of the cost of setting up the group &mdash; subject to a maximum of &euro;300,000 per group.  A public competition for the establishment and <Col N="1254"/>operation of a number of bio-fuel processing plants strategically located in a selected number of locations should be put in place.  Capital start-up grants for these processing plants should be given to enable these plants to become established and begin viable processing operations.</P>
        <P>It is vital that we establish greater links with international bio-fuel processors and fuel suppliers and the relevant Departments, especially the Department of Transport and the Department of Agriculture and Food, to facilitate the promotion of the bio-fuels industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, production cannot flourish if there is no market for what is produced.  At present, the growth of bio-fuels is hampered by the absence of any serious outlet in which to sell them.  That is why this Bill proposes to legislate for all motor fuels to include a blend of fuel from renewable sources.  All petrol sold at filling stations would include a 5% bio-ethanol mix and all diesels would contain a 2% bio-diesel mix.  This would not necessitate the conversion of standard motor engines and would represent a good start in reducing emissions from cars.  It would also provide an immediate market for farmers to sell energy crops.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As well as what we put in our cars, we need to do all we can to promote the purchase of energy efficient and economical cars.  That is why we must look at VRT.  To do this, Fine Gael, in government, would establish a system of energy efficiency labelling for vehicles and reward those that are awarded a higher rating with a reduced rate of VRT.  Similarly, vehicles with a lower rate of efficiency would be penalised with a higher rate of VRT.</P>
        <P>Since becoming Fine Gael spokesperson on the environment, I have seen first hand the problems with the planning system.  If we are to have any hope of developing an alternative energy infrastructure in the future, it is vital we reform our current system of planning.  There is an urgent need for a proper alternative energy structure as there is for a proper road network.  It is vital we put in place a planning process that can cope with that need.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Dutch system of planning can offer Ireland a very important lesson.  In the Netherlands, the Government decides, on a national basis, the infrastructure projects needed and the best area in which to locate them.  It then consults Parliament, local authorities and<b> </b>the people.  It amends its plans accordingly and publishes binding guidelines on infrastructure construction in the period of years immediately ahead.</P>
        <P>We must make it easier to reduce carbon emissions, encourage the use of bio-fuels and change the way we live and drive.  Most of all, we need this Bill to change the way we operate and transport goods and ourselves.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1255"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Deputy Naughten on introducing this Bill.  The issue of global warming is threatening to become the most pressing one internationally in this century but, sadly, the Government has failed to come to grips with it.  There is a tendency for the Government to wash its hands of the problem, to leave it to others and to wait on the sidelines until it is embarrassed into doing something about it.  All it can see is a growing problem for which there is no solution and it is sticking its head in the sand.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Government&rsquo;s latest announcement that bio-fuels will comprise 5.75% of Ireland&rsquo;s transport fuel market by 2009.  It has been careful not to make any commitments on reducing overall carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, I have noted with embarrassment in recent months the gap that has grown between Northern Ireland and the Republic in the provision of grants for tackling global warming through the reduction of carbon emissions.  Like charity, reducing carbon emissions should begin at home.  In Northern Ireland, there is a grant for householders to install wind turbines but there is none here.  There is a grant for householders to install small hydro schemes but there is no such grant here.  There is a scheme in Northern Ireland for excess power generated by householders to be sold back into the grid but there is none here.  Such schemes would be suitable for many homes in my constituency of Clare where, I assure the Minister, the wind blows a fair number of days in the year.</P>
        <P>Even the Government agency charged with administering the few grants that exist admits that only a fraction of green energy resources have been tapped so far.  This also applies to bio-fuels.  The Government has sat on the bio-fuels issue until it was embarrassed by this Private Members&rsquo; Bill to take action.  Bio-fuel is a win-win issue.  There is an opportunity for hard-pressed farmers to grow sugar beet or oil rape seed as crops from which such bio-fuels could be manufactured.  With the devastation which occurred following the collapse of the sugar industry, this has been pointed out again and again to the Government yet it has avoided the subject.</P>
        <P>When one sees a country such as Brazil, which has made bio-fuels an important home industry, one realises the potential that exists.  Bio-fuel blends are also being used in the United States, Canada, China, India, Australia and in many European countries.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that the detail of the Government&rsquo;s initiative will not be worked out.  Fine Gael believes that such a target can, and will, be exceeded by the car manufacturers adapting their engines so they can take a higher percentage of bio-fuels.  In Brazil, for example, more bio-fuel adapted cars were sold last year than petrol-only cars.  The Government&rsquo;s initiative is a start but it is important it is done right and is not subject <Col N="1256"/>to the sloppiness which is the mark of so much Government policy.</P>
        <P>For farmers to switch over to a new cash crop is a daunting project and there is still very little profit in growing such crops.  I understand the growing of sugar beet and oil rape seed for bio-fuels is not included in REPS.  This needs to be examined carefully.  For many Irish farmers, the production of such crops in a properly constructed scheme could prove a turning point for the profitability of farms.  In short, just as the Government has adopted the essence of this Fine Gael Bill, I urge it to learn from the energy plan we unveiled last year that we would see Ireland generate one third of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>This Government has been in power for almost ten years and has not yet realised the serious problem we face as a nation in regard to security of energy supply.  Apart from the obvious environmental benefits, the one thing this Government is continually blowing about is its success with the economy.  If anything proves that this Administration had very little to do with the success of the economy over the past number of years, the lack of planning and vision in the areas of security of supply and sustainable energy is one of its great failures.  It inherited an economy with a budget surplus which was creating 1,000 jobs per month, yet it failed to advance this economy and ensure we have security of supply in the future.</P>
        <P>Over the past number of years, this Government has failed to recognise the value of wind energy.  The ESB has still not provided the network necessary to maximise our advantage in this area.  Ten times more planning permissions are granted by local authorities than the national grid is capable of taking because of the lack of basic infrastructure.</P>
        <P>In the last of ten budgets, this Government provided &euro;300 million plus for environmental projects, yet most of this money will be spent purchasing carbon credits because of its inaction in the area of renewable energy.  Any Government with any vision should have seen years ago that our agriculture industry was facing an unprecedented crisis.  Of all the groups of consultants this Government appointed, surely one of those groups or a Fianna F&aacute;il or Progressive Democrats Minister would have connected the decline in agriculture with the need for renewable energy supplies.  As has been said, it was a no brainer.  Agricultural resources were available to grow bio-fuel crops and agriculture could have been maintained as a viable industry.</P>
        <P>For years this Government knew carbon taxes were on the way.  Instead of continually wrangling at EU level about when and to what extent they would be introduced, it could have got its act together and turned the decline in agriculture <Col N="1257"/>into an advantage for both the farmer and the nation.  Equally, this Government should have seen the writing on the wall for the sugar beet industry.  Instead of seizing the opportunity it completely sold out our sugar beet industry.  A facility which existed in Mallow in my constituency was capable of producing bio-fuel.  Farmers were willing to continue to grow beet at &euro;40 per tonne to produce the fuel because of the value of sugar beet as a rotation crop.  Many other crops could have been grown and processed at the plant but sheer lack of vision and planning let the opportunity go.  Having closed the factory, the Government has so far failed to ensure its workers, who worked diligently for up to 40 years, are paid their rightful redundancy.  Now, in the run-up to an election, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats tell us they are committed to green issues.  This Government has been committed to many issues but has delivered very few.</P>
        <P>It is not credible for a Government which has been in power for ten years to start adopting policies it might introduce if it is returned after the next election.  The Government has had ten years and unprecedented amounts of money and its tax surpluses could have been used to make bio-fuel viable commercially, at the same time revitalising rural Ireland with a vibrant agricultural industry.  The Fine Gael proposal is a modest and sensible start, requiring a 5% bio-fuel mix in petrol and diesel.  There would be no cost to the motorist as no modification would be necessary and there would be tremendous benefit to farming and the economy.  Even at this late stage I urge the Government to accept this very modest but worthwhile Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of this Bill is very timely and I compliment our spokesperson, Deputy Naughten, on its introduction.  The supply of oil, once thought everlasting, is fast disappearing and our dependence on it cannot continue at the current rate.  We should develop clear alternatives to meet our energy needs.</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will represent Ireland at the EU Environment Council next Tuesday in Brussels.  I hope he will not be embarrassed at Ireland&rsquo;s failure to meet its commitments under the Kyoto Agreement.  Ireland signed up to that agreement to limit increases in emissions between 2008 and 2012 to 13% above emissions in 1990.  A recent leaked report showed that, though our emissions were low in world terms, Ireland had the second highest level of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions per head of population in the world, which illustrates how serious is our situation.</P>
        <P>This Government must take responsibility for failing to take any steps in the past ten years to treat the situation seriously.  When oil prices reached a peak last year, petrol and diesel at the <Col N="1258"/>pumps shot up in price to approximately &euro;1.14 and even &euro;1.20 per litre.  Now, with the price of crude oil greatly reduced, there has not been a corresponding reduction in the price of oil at outlets.  There is also a great discrepancy in prices at various stations.  I was at a meeting in Clifden last Monday and filled my car at 99.9c per litre.  In Galway City it cost 104.9c per litre, in Ballinasloe 97.9c and in Moate 102.9c.  In Tyrrellspass, the last station before the motorway, it cost 102.9c and in the first filling station in Dublin it cost 103.9c.  I do not know how it can be cheaper to bring petrol or diesel to Clifden than to Galway, Dublin or anywhere else.  Even in Carraroe, in the heart of the Connemara Gaeltacht, the prices were 98.9c for petrol and 99.9c for diesel.  Some places are certainly ripping off customers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our spokesperson, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, made a novel proposal this morning at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government to show that we in this House are serious about playing our part in reducing emissions.  He suggested cars be banned from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Why not travel by train or bus?  It is very easy and I come on the train except when I have to carry literature from the D&aacute;il.  It is a great service and there is a train to Dublin from every part of Ireland.  On arrival, the DART service takes passengers from the train stations into the city centre.  I do not know whether it is practical and am sure Ministers would want to be driven to the D&aacute;il but this House should show an example rather than just preach about sustainable policies.</P>
        <P>This Bill proposes a mandatory bio-fuel component in all motor fuels and to force fuel distributors to include a 5% bio-fuel mix in all petrol and diesel.  That will become very important in the years ahead.  It will not cost motorists as current engines are suitable for that purpose and would not require modification.  It would be mandatory for both petrol and diesel users as the fuel would be blended with rape and seed oil respectively.  The transport sector has been identified as one of the largest offenders in terms of greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland.</P>
        <P>There is no point in encouraging farmers to grow renewable energy or bio-fuel crops, to which the Government pretends to be committed, when there is no market for them.  The policy vacuum at the heart of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government is exposed by its failures in this area.  It is quite obvious that, in the past ten years, this Government has failed to do anything about the serious problem of emissions.</P>
        <P>There is significant support for bio-fuels throughout Europe.  Commercial fuel is subject to mandatory blending with bio-fuels in Austria and Germany.  Germany produces one third of bio-fuels in the EU but Ireland has stuck its head in the sand and has done nothing.  I ask the Minister of State why that is the case.  Yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister for Communi<Col N="1259"/>cations, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, showed a belated attempt to recognise that the proposals in this Fine Gael Bill represent the way forward.</P>
        <P>The structure of the proposed scheme also gives an opportunity to farmers in poorer parts of the country to diversify from producing their current crops.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Government&rsquo;s bio-fuels policy and on our renewable energy policy generally.  I reiterate our disappointment with the Bill as presented by the Opposition, which puts forward a policy which cannot be legally implemented.  As my Government colleagues have already pointed out, the proposal as put contravenes the EU fuel quality directive.  The European Commission made this clear in its bio-fuels directive consultation document published last April.</P>
        <P>The preferred policy options for member states have been excise relief programmes and bio-fuels obligations.  Ten member states have now signalled their intention to move to a bio-fuels obligation.  Ireland is among those ten and is one of the first to signal a long-term 2020 target for bio-fuels.  The targets of 5.75% by 2009 and 10% by 2020 are ahead of the EU directive timelines and are fully in line with current EU thinking on bio-fuels.  The decision to move to a bio-fuels obligation is timely and follows the roll-out of two excise relief programmes valued at almost &euro;220 million.  As a result of these programmes, a range of bio-fuels are now coming on stream in the Irish market and a number of innovative bio-fuel projects are already up and running.</P>
        <P>Studies commissioned on behalf of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources have assessed the impact of various policy measures and concluded that excise relief measures provide the necessary short-term market stimulation but that bio-fuels obligations provide longer-term certainty for market players.</P>
        <P>Having kick-started an indigenous bio-fuels sector in Ireland through the two bio-fuels excise relief programmes, the decision to move to a longer-term bio-fuels obligation reflects a sensible and strategic policy approach to developing Ireland&rsquo;s bio-fuels market.</P>
        <P>It is also part of a &ldquo;whole of Government&rdquo; approach to renewable energy policy which is exemplified in the establishment of the ministerial bio-energy task force.  The report of the task force will be published shortly, but integrated Government thinking on bio-energy policy is already very much in evidence.</P>
        <P>In 2006, following the roll-out of the pilot projects under the first bio-fuels mineral oil tax relief <Col N="1260"/>scheme, the Minister for Finance introduced a 50% reduction of VRT on flexible fuel vehicles which are capable of running on blends of up to 85% ethanol.  Since the VRT rate was reduced, 200 flexi-fuel vehicles have been bought in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have launched simultaneous reviews of vehicle registration tax and motor tax to link those tax rates with CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.</P>
        <P>In addition to measures to stimulate demand for bio-fuels, the Government has introduced a range of initiatives to encourage farmers to diversify into the growing of energy crops.</P>
        <P>Last week, the Minister for Agriculture and Food announced the introduction of a top-up of &euro;80 per hectare on the current energy crop payment, bringing the total payment to &euro;125 per hectare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Except in REPS and disadvantaged areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>This will assist farmers in meeting the emerging demand for bio-fuel feedstocks. Establishment grants of 50% are also being provided to farmers for the planting of new energy crops such as willow and miscanthus, and funding is being made available for the purchase of specialised biomass harvesting machinery.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food bio-energy programmes are linked directly to the measures being introduced by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>In addition to the bio-fuels policy development programme, a series of new schemes has been introduced to develop the renewable heat market.  These include the hugely successful &euro;47 million greener homes domestic grants scheme and the &euro;26 million bio-heat programme, which is providing grants for commercial, voluntary and community groups for the installation of wood chip and wood pellet boilers, as well as solar and other renewable technologies.  The &euro;11 million combined heat and power, CHP, programme is also a valuable funding source for business and commercial entities.</P>
        <P>The introduction of these measures will ensure that renewable heat will comprise 5% of Ireland&rsquo;s renewable heat market by 2010.  While the EU has not yet proposed any targets for the heat sector, Ireland is positioning itself to contribute to the wider EU debate on targets from a measured and informed perspective.</P>
        <P>Similarly on renewable electricity, while the renewable electricity directive only requires us to achieve a 13.2% target by 2010, we have made sufficient progress to be in a position to increase this target to 15%.  The renewable electricity feed-in tariff is providing the mechanism through which this new target will be achieved.  We are <Col N="1261"/>also forging ahead with applied research into ocean energy technologies, with a view to placing Ireland at the forefront of worldwide ocean energy research.</P>
        <P>The Government is to be commended on its strategic and integrated approach to developing our renewable resources, and I am pleased to note that the bio-fuels obligation will be introduced following detailed consultations with industry players.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the need for consultation, which is necessary to allow industry the lead-in time to deliver the target, it is not possible for the Government to accept the Bill as proposed by the Opposition today because the measures in question cannot be introduced without contravening EU law.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and look forward to hearing concrete proposals from the opposite side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Deputy Durkan, without interruption.  Deputy Durkan, if you address your remarks through the Chair we might reduce the number of interruptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is much easier to address the Chair because the Members opposite are a distraction, and the Chair knows that, although he is not a man who is easily distracted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Address the Chair and we will not allow any interruptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot understand the reason nobody came up with that idea.  They would not have been allowed do that in any other country without somebody shouting &ldquo;Halt&rdquo;.  The notion that they are EU statute-barred is rubbish.  They are Ministers representing this country on the Ministerial Council.  What have they been doing there?  I presume the Minister travelled to Brussels today to negotiate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>He will do a good job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know what he is doing there because if we do not stand up and be counted, nobody else will concede to us.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made a very good point earlier.  I am aware the proposals are to import cheap bio-fuels from other countries by flying them 8,000 or 9,000 miles, just as the Government is doing currently with the food industry.  Soon we will be importing all of our food from the CAIRNS group of countries, which was negotiated by the Ministers in Brussels in the past few years.  That is strange.</P>
        <P>This Bill is the litmus test of the Government&rsquo;s intentions regarding the development of bio-fuels.  This is a golden opportunity for those in Government to show they are genuinely concerned about the need to deal with the issues that affect us now on two levels.  First, there is the question of dealing with the carbon footprint.  We cannot solve the world problems caused by global warming but we can make our own contribution to addressing the global warming issue.  That is what we must do, and we must do it urgently.</P>
        <P>We can deal also with the question of importation of fuels from other countries.  We can introduce import substitution on the one hand and security of supply on the other.  Both are environmentally friendly and economically beneficial and both are in the hands of whatever Administration is involved in the negotiations.  I cannot understand why nobody on the Government side thought about the way they might do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I outlined what we will do.  Deputy Durkan was not listening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Instead of developing the concept of bio-fuels and encouraging replacement indus<Col N="1263"/>try for the agricultural sector which was displaced in terms of the sugar beet industry, the Government made a grand sweep &mdash; another &euro;250 million for carbon trading.  That is not a contribution.  That does nothing for the environment or the economy.  It merely postpones the day of reckoning, and that is what is happening on the Opposite side of the House.  The Government Members buried their heads in the sand and exposed their rear ends to the air.  That is a dangerous posture for which they and, unfortunately, the country and the environment will pay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have any proposals?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Durkan, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy Roche, is on public record saying how well the Government has catered for environmental issues by virtue of what it has done regarding agriculture.  The biggest contribution this Government has made to agriculture is that it has run it down.  I assume this country will not have a food processing sector.</P>
        <P>I want to outline the details of what happened.  When Fine Gael first published its policy on energy 18 months ago, the Government looked at it, read it and copied it, but that was all it did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be a poor day when we had to copy Fine Gael policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister for Finance introduced proposals to reduce excise duty on a certain amount of bio-fuels but the quota is now oversubscribed and pure plant oil producers in this country who wish to be included are not included.  Sadly, the Government has gone outside the country to supply the market, an appalling gaffe that I cannot understand.</P>
        <P>I do not know if the Government fully appreciates the potential damage but when it copied the Fine Gael proposals it did not realise they require a full plan, research and development and a number of inputs.  No single element of alternative energy will solve the energy problem.  It requires a co-ordinated approach by Departments.  That was suggested and the Government agreed in theory but in practice, like all imitations, it was short of what was required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not have to imitate anything from Fine Gael.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government woke up one morning to discover it had done nothing on the issue ten years after Kyoto except pay lip-service.  The people of the country will pay as a result, not the Minister of State.</P><Col N="1264"/>
        <P>More has not been done to remove more excise duty from alternative fuel sources because the Government wants to hold on to it.  It makes huge amounts from VAT and excise duty on fuel and energy, as we know.  However, it is not too late; there is time for a Pauline conversion.  The Government can restore public confidence to some extent in its ability by recognising that we are moving on and that changes must be made.  The Government has a responsibility to meet today&rsquo;s requirements and to stop spending time looking backwards over the things it failed to do in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Deputy not listen to the policies when I outlined them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fact of life that the Government copied Fine Gael policy, which we published six to eight months before it published a word.  The Fine Gael policy was published before the European Commission policy.  We went on our own, with the support of other Opposition parties, and decided what to do and that policy has stood the test of time.  The only weakness in the scenario is the lack of Government will to take action.  It merely made references to policy and, with the exception of the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s gesture on limited excise relief, little has been done.</P>
        <P>The result is simple &mdash; no one believes the Government.  Ministers gave a sigh of relief when people asked what would happen next, deciding that carbon trading was the answer.  Why not grow the alternative fuels and use what we have?  We have a good record in agriculture so there is no reason that we would not succeed in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is confused.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a notion that somehow the needs of the economy of this country will be met by importing alternative fuels from other countries.  We are already dependent on the major oil companies.  All they must do is create a scare in the morning or reduce production and there is an oil price increase in the evening.  For 12 months scares were created on a weekly basis to increase the price of oil in the world market.  In this instance, the Government is sitting on top of a gold mine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not heard Fine Gael put forward a single policy. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should have because he read the Fine Gael policy.  The only problem is that he did not put it into operation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Ah Jesus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is still time and he should do it before it is too late.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1265"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am 25 years in politics and I never had to depend on Fine Gael for policy.  I do not intend to start now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources said last night that our proposals would contravene European law.  The Minister of State made the same response tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister of State then explain why the Netherlands, in November 2006, introduced legislation which requires the compulsory blending of bio-fuels with diesel and petrol from 1 January 2007?  Can I also ask why the State advisory service, Teagasc, differs from the Minister of State and the Minister on the feasibility of mandatory blending?  In a report published on 3 February, Barry Casslin, the Teagasc energy systems specialist, stated that Germany has gone down the route of mandatory blending of a percentage of bio-fuel with conventional fossil fuel oil.  This means that oil companies are not allowed to sell diesel unless it contains the required and certified percentage of biodiesel.  A number of other European countries will also adopt this requirement.</P>
        <P>France and Austria&rsquo;s obligations came into force in 2005, Slovenia&rsquo;s in 2006 while the Czech Republic and the Netherlands have announced the introduction of obligations in 2007.  The British intend to introduce it in 2008.  The Government comes out with this claptrap that we cannot do it because Brussels does not allow us but a long list of European countries have already started.  The Government and its Ministers have been acting like a lapdog for Brussels, unprepared to put forward a positive position on behalf of the public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>No guts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Other European countries can do it and we could do it too if the political will existed.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and the Minister are playing with words.  We are prepared to amend the legislation to facilitate any nuances the Government might want but it is not prepared to do it.  It is on a sticky wicket because it has come under pressure as a result of this legislation.  That is why the Minister was forced on Monday to announce that the Government will introduce a bio-fuels obligation of 5.75% from 2009.  Why not do it now?  Other EU states have been blending for years but we cannot do it here.</P>
        <P>The Minister said he will embark on extensive consultations but consultations have been ongoing for years.  Farmers and processors <Col N="1266"/>involved in the sector are frustrated by the lethargic approach being taken by the Government, providing excise relief to only 16 companies, over half of which will import the bio-fuel while processors that were grant aided or secured excise relief in the first round that are producing bio-fuel have had that relief withdrawn.  The largest processor in the country has never been given any support on excise relief by the Government.  Why has that happened while we allow a situation where the majority of the bio-fuel will be imported?</P>
        <P>For ten years the Government has kicked around the idea of an energy policy.  Only when Fine Gael introduced its comprehensive energy policy did the Government respond.  Only when Fine Gael introduced this Bill to allow the blending of bio-fuels with motor fuels did the Minister respond.  We will not see the Minister&rsquo;s White Paper any time soon.</P>
        <P>Fortunately for the public and the environment, the next policy proposal for the future development of sustainable energy in Ireland will be the responsibility of those on this side of the House.  The public are sick and tired of this Government, which is constantly a step away from action and knee deep in consultants and reports.  The Government is paralysed and the country and environment is suffering as a result.  The proposals in the Bill are practical, feasible and will work as they have worked in other EU countries.  On this side of the House, we are determined to implement these proposals after the next election.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to re-examine the bio-fuel programme being operated in the Department.   When Fine Gael announced it would introduce this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I was contacted by several large processors who were denied the opportunity to produce bio-fuel made from indigenous sources, while we are supporting fuels being processed and developed in other countries.  The Government claims it cares about cleaning our environment, meeting our international commitments and supporting alternative enterprises for farmers.  However, time and time again when it comes to a tough decision it has been found wanting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must give way.  It is time to put the question.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I refer to section 31 which provides for the Minister to appoint a person as the inspector of prisons to provide regular inspections of prisons.  In my contribution I draw from the Irish section of Amnesty International&rsquo;s action briefing document for mental health policy published in November of last year.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Amnesty International on its work in raising concern and the need for a policy to establish a proper psychiatric service.  Amnesty International recommended that the inspectorate of prisons which should be established on a statutory basis must be adequately empowered and resourced to fulfil its role.  Provision should urgently be made for an independent and effective statutory complaints mechanism, either through empowering the statutory inspectorate or by constituting a separate statutory complaints authority such as a prison ombudsman.  To a large extent the Bill responds to that recommendation from Amnesty International and I welcome that.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Although comprising only a tiny minority of people with mental health problems, some can needlessly end up in Garda custody, before the courts, and even in prison.  A recent study by a team led by the clinical director of the Central Mental Hospital revealed that 60% of female prisoners and 35% of male prisoners have experienced a mental illness at some stage in their lives, and criticised the use of prisons as &ldquo;psychiatric waiting rooms&rdquo;.  Nearly one quarter of sentenced prisoners had a mental illness of some classification at that time.  Based on the six-month prevalence of severe and enduring mental illness, 2.7% was found in male sentenced prisoners, and the team estimated there were approximately 79 with a severe mental illness who would require treatment in hospital additional to current provision.  In the male remand population, it found that the six-month prevalence of psychosis was 7.6%, and 31.2% had a lifetime history of any mental illness, excluding substance misuse, adjustment disorder and personality disorder.  The authors concluded that the high findings indicated a substantial unmet need for mental health services in Irish prisons.  That prisoners have a high rate of mental health problems was also a finding of a 2000 report commissioned by the Government.</P><Col N="1270"/>
    
        <P>There also exists for some people a cycle of mental health problems, imprisonment and homelessness.  A study published in 2005 by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Probation and Welfare Service found that &ldquo;homeless people come into contact with the criminal justice system on a frequent basis, accumulating multiple offences and convictions for relatively minor offences&rdquo;.  It found that a quarter of the prison sample was homeless on committal to prison and over half, 54%, had at least one previous experience of homelessness.   Just over one third of those homeless on committal had a previous diagnosis of having a mental illness, two thirds of whom had been hospitalised in a mental health facility.  Ireland does not have a formal system to divert people with mental health difficulties from the criminal justice system to mental health services and does not have adequate forensic mental health services and safe acute observation areas in inpatient units to treat these people.  The report last year on the future of the mental health services, A Vision for Change, which was launched in January 2006, pointed out that court diversion schemes are available in a number of overseas jurisdictions but not in Ireland.  These schemes aim to promote diversion as a means of ensuring that people with mental health problems who commit minor crimes do not get involved needlessly in the criminal justice system.</P><?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The 1978 Henchy report recommended that courts have powers to divert people accused of crimes to outpatient and community mental health services.  Yet today as we introduce this Bill before the House, Irish courts lack the powers to formally organise mental health assessment of and appropriate services for accused or convicted persons who they believe have mental health problems, other than committing people who are unfit to plead or raise the defence of &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; to a &ldquo;designated centre&rdquo; under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act.  This involves committal to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.</P>
        <P>In circumstances where &ldquo;fitness to plead&rdquo; under this Act is not in question or insanity defences do not arise but the defendant appears to have a &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; during the course of the hearing or trial or before sentencing, there is no formal provision for ensuring that mental health assessment or treatment takes place.  The Mental Health Commission had proposed that this Act &ldquo;allow the judiciary a wider range of options and to ensure that the most appropriate intervention is offered to the Person&rdquo;.  Proposals for diverting offenders with mental illness from the criminal justice to more appropriate services were put forward for consultation in the Government&rsquo;s Green Paper and White Paper on mental health legislation in 1992 and 1995 but never progressed in the Mental Health Act 2001, the details of which were introduced in November 2006.  Legislation to facilitate the diversion of persons <Col N="1271"/>with mental illness from the criminal justice system, including the courts and the prisons, to alternative treatment, supervision and care was also advocated in the report of the group to review the structure and organisation of prison health care services.  The report to which I previously referred, A Vision for Change, recommends that legislation be designed to facilitate the process of court diversion.</P>
        <P>Ministers have told us repeatedly that they have accepted the recommendations of A Vision for Change.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, is very loud in his statements that this is Government policy so it should be Government policy to facilitate the process of court diversion for those who suffer mental health problems.</P>
        <P>A Vision for Change also recommends that forensic mental health services be expanded to incorporate diversion schemes and build strong links with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is the agency most likely to come into contact through domestic disturbance, minor offences or homelessness with people whose needs would be more appropriately served by being diverted from the criminal justice system to the mental health services.  Garda&iacute; still have no formal module on mental health in their training or in-service curricula.  I believe and the report states that training in mental health is essential for garda&iacute;.  The report says this training should be put in place without delay.  In addition, it advises that each major Garda division should have a senior garda specially trained to act as mental health resource and liaison officer for the purposes of advising and educating garda&iacute; on the management of routine mental health issues and working closely with local mental health and specialised forensic mental health services personnel.</P>
        <P>In respect of the report to which I referred earlier, Amnesty International voiced its concern at the inadequate provision of mental health services for prisoners in Ireland.  While the chief purpose of prison is punishment and rehabilitation and the provision of primary health care in such a secure environment places difficulties and constraints on prison officers and health care staff, prisoners have the right to be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the person.  Prisoners have the right to mental health care and at least an equivalence of mental health care with the rest of the population.  Rule 22(2) of the UN standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners provides that &ldquo;prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialised institutions or to civil hospitals&rdquo;.  The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which had just completed its fourth periodic visit to Ireland&rsquo;s places of detention at the time the report was published <Col N="1272"/>last November, has repeatedly identified the absence of an independent statutory authority with powers to receive, investigate and take action on prisoners&rsquo; complaints as one of the critical deficiencies in Ireland&rsquo;s safeguarding of the human rights of persons in detention.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that the Bill before the House goes some way towards providing a statutory basis for the inspection of prisons.  The Bill expressly provides that it is not a function of the inspector to investigate or adjudicate on a complaint from an individual prisoner so the need for an independent complaints authority, as is introduced in this Bill, is important.  An independent, effective and well-resourced inspectorate is essential if actual or potential breaches of prisoners&rsquo; basic human rights, including the right to adequate mental health services, are to be uncovered and addressed.</P>
        <P>Amnesty International clearly recommends that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na adopt procedures and policies for dealing with people with mental health problems and appropriate regimes on mental health.  It recommended that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appoint mental health resource and liaison officers and ensure they are adequately trained and supported.  Amnesty International also recommends that legislation be published to facilitate the process of diverting people with mental health problems from the criminal justice system and that courts be provided with a range of non-custodial options.</P>
        <P>If a person has a serious physical illness such as cancer, breaks his or her hand or has a heart attack, he or she is rightly transferred to a general hospital.  If the person has a breakdown or mental health problem or suffers serious depression, he or she is not transferred to the appropriate treatment.  If a person in prison is suicidal and in danger of taking his or her life because of his or her crisis, he or she is often stripped naked, put in solitary confinement and inspected every 15 minutes to see if he or she is still alive.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Normally, I like to feel I have done a considerable amount of research before I speak on a Bill.  However, this evening, I could not lay my hands on either of the two experts in the Independent group who have first-hand knowledge of the system, Deputy Gregory, who spent four weeks in prison, and Deputy Joe Higgins, who spent two weeks in prison.  I would have expected them to have insider knowledge.  They would have felt they were prisoners of conscience who had committed no crime.  At times, I feel that neither of them has adequately recovered from their experience.</P>
        <P>Deputy Neville referred extensively to the link between people with psychiatric histories and prisons but the same link will not be established between Mahon and prisons.  Deputy Neville correctly referred to the number of people with <Col N="1273"/>psychiatric problems who are improperly placed in prisons.  I am concerned about the over representation of such prisoners in our prisons.  While they may have committed a crime, their illness was probably a factor but the difficulty is they cannot afford fancy lawyers.  They must take what they get and they may not even be fit to present their case to a lawyer so that he can work on it, which is a major difficulty.  It would be more suitable if such prisoners were placed in a regional secure unit in a psychiatric setting where the focus would be on treating their illnesses and they would be closer to home and have the support of their families.  They should also be looked after by staff with experience in the provision of psychiatric services.  People with mild mental handicaps should not be held in prisons, as they are the subject of regular abuse.  Prison is not the appropriate place for them.</P>
        <P>The legislation proposes a radical rejigging of the Prison Service, encompassing the closure of Mountjoy Prison and the construction of new prisons and extensions.  Mountjoy Prison is past its sell by date.  The legislation also provides for the contracting out or privatising of prisoner escort services, which is a radical departure for the Prison Service.  It is not clear whether private security firms, more commonly used in the provision of security for the transport of large sums of cash, will readily adapt to the transfer of prisoners.  We have had numerous examples of security vans being intercepted and robbed and it is likely that dangerous, high profile prisoners could be sprung.  If criminals can take millions in cash, I am sure they take a high profile prisoner.  However, it is doubtful if the farming out of such services will result in a saving for the Department.  I often wonder why a courtroom cannot be built adjacent to or within a prison, as that would be eminently sensible.  It would also be safer, cost effective and more convenient for everyone involved.  In the natural progression of things, the Prison Service must change with the times and I hope this will result in a modern, humane and forward-looking service.</P>
        <P>Prison rehabilitative strategies are specifically designed to reform the defendant&rsquo;s character and they would bear most fruit among the younger element of the prison population.  Prisoners in their later teens and early twenties are at an important formative and developmental stage in their lives.  The VEC provides a valuable and crucial educational service, as does St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, which is very much educationally focused.  The closures of Shanganagh Castle and Fort Mitchel detention centres do not reflect a significant commitment to the rehabilitation of young offenders on the part of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  A total of 200 prisoners in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution are aged between 18 and 20 while one third of the prison population is under 18.  These prisoners are at an <Col N="1274"/>impressionable age where professionals could work with them to reform their behaviour, particularly if they have fallen foul of the law only once.  Such initiatives should be examined to stop criminality in its tracks.</P>
        <P>Criminal offenders largely spring from social structures, reflecting individual family circumstances or psychiatric or psychological influences.  Different rehabilitative programmes related to individual counselling, education and training and family intervention are used and such a humane approach should be adopted.</P>
        <P>I refer to the imprisonment of people for the non-payment of petty fines, which is a waste of prison resources.  A number of people have an attitude problem in that they would rather do time than pay their car tax or whatever.  However, community service should be used as an alternative to prison for fines offences.  Prison spaces are valuable and these people who are not hardened criminals should not be imprisoned.  Recently, people deliberately committed crimes so that they would be imprisoned.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  My contribution will deal more with the importance of politicians discussing prisons in general rather than the detail of the Bill.  It is important that Members be very careful about the current debate on prisoners and crime.  It is possible, for example, to be fair to the rights of victims and to do a great deal more than has been done so far in providing consideration for what they suffer but, at the same time, to sustain, reform and extend the rights of prisoners.  It is not an either/or choice and it is cheap populism to suggest that one set of rights can only be advanced at the expense of the other.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the reasons I am interested in the legislation is that I taught the first courses on the island on sociology of deviant behaviour and sociology of law and crime in the 1960s having returned from Manchester University.  In addition, I was one of a group that made early attempts to establish an institute of criminology but we were unable to do so because the then Department of Justice refused to permit its employees to attend our meetings and join an institute over which it would not have control.  I also served as a member of the MacBride Commission, which heard evidence from people who had been imprisoned for different periods.  One of the great tragedies of our hearings in the period between 1977 and 1998 was that people did not want to us to make an official formal complaint about their suffering.  This is covered in the Irish Penal Commission report, Crime and Punishment, edited and published by Sean MacBride in 1982.</P>
        <P>One of the findings we made during those hearings, which were held over a number of weekends, remains with me.  We heard evidence from <Col N="1275"/>a chief school attendance officer in Dublin who, with tears in his eyes, said that, having retired, he realised the tragic price that had been paid because of the lack of communication between the Department of Education&rsquo;s school attendance system and the Department of Justice.  He referred to the number of young people who were in difficulty regarding school attendance.  They came from areas where they had little hope and from families who had experienced multi-generational poverty.  He could identify the people who would come before the Children&rsquo;s Court and during his retirement, he often attended the court as a character witness for the children he knew.</P>
        <P>We also heard evidence from people who had been detained in Daingean, Letterfrack and other institutions, which later entered to the public realm by way of inquiry.  I asked a number of them at different times whether they wished us to hand over their evidence to the police authorities but they were unwilling at that stage.  Our report, which was published in 1980, was succeeded by the Whitaker report, which made substantial proposals on the reform of prisons.  I regret that it is difficult for one to speak about improving conditions and the rights of prisoners because it will be presented that one is soft on crime or insensitive to the rights of victims in some way or another, which is a travesty.  However, it is important for us to realise that we are tested regarding our human rights internationally by the manner in which we speak of prisons.</P>
        <P>The history of prisons is interesting and the great 19th century reports were summarised, for example, in Michael Ignatieff&rsquo;s study, <i>A Just Measure of Pain</i>.</P>
        <P>In the new State after 1922 we did not study prisons again until the 1930s when the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Labour Party appointed a commission, the secretary of which was a young Jim Larkin, which reported on the state of the prisons.  The next report on prisons was the MacBride commission, of which I was a member in the 1970s, and then we had the Whittaker report leading up to the present time.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the fact that progress is under way on consideration of the elimination of slopping out.  I have visited prisons in Ireland and abroad and I have studied the reform movements in some of the Scandinavian countries.  Slopping out is the last thing to be changed in any prison reform system I have examined.  The reason for that is it is such a symbolic act of loss of discretion.  One can reduce the argument to very simple principles.  Prison is about the absence of discretion &mdash; over time, space and one&rsquo;s own body.  It is interesting in the history of reform that even in the many states which have been willing to reform in regard to discretion over time, for example, in allowing people out of prison, or discretion in regard to space by having <Col N="1276"/>more open regimes, the last thing they have relinquished is slopping out.  It is barbarism, it is outrageous and it is in contravention of international law.  It is a point that has been made against Ireland at the human rights hearings in Geneva.  It is not good enough to say one has its elimination under consideration.</P>
        <P>I do not have time to go into what I feel and it is something I find difficult to speak about, namely, the beating to death of a prisoner in the basement of Mountjoy &mdash; Gary Douche.  I do not understand how an individual can be asked to share a room with six other people, be beaten to death and be found in the morning with excrement on his head.  Irrespective of whoever is in charge of justice in a state, this is an appalling indictment of prison systems.</P>
        <P>Under what circumstances should one send people to prison?  I spoke about many reports, including the Whittaker report, which was published in 1982.  If there is one finding that screams from the pages of this and other reports, it is that one should use all the non-custodial options that are available.  If, for example, Whittaker could notice an increase in crime against property, but also, in addition, that a large number of people were going to prison for the non-payment of fines, logic would dictate the benefits of getting people off the conveyor belt that was prison rather than putting people into a culture where they would learn about criminality.</P>
        <P>The way the system works is rather like this &mdash; I say this as a sociologist.  One begins with the base of a pyramid of deviant behaviour, for example, some of which is never detected, and one moves up to near the top of one pyramid, where it is turned into criminal actions against which there is a sanction.  Then one moves over to the other pyramid and one has a process by which one has detection, confrontation, bringing a suspect before the courts and so forth.  At each of these stages there is a self-defining activity going on in regard to how the person views himself or herself.  Evidence is available from abroad in every jurisdiction that the more people one enables to escape from each stage of the labelling process, the better chance people have of rehabilitating themselves, becoming part of the community and participating in it.</P>
        <P>We must question ourselves about the way we run prisons.  We run them appallingly.  The visiting committees have been a joke.  I remember, for example, going to Limerick Prison at one stage and gathering some information from there in regard to the women&rsquo;s prison.  Our proposals at that time were very much focused on trying to secure that the prison rules would be on display in the prisons themselves.  There were other informal rules that were not contained in the prison rules on display.  Examples in the women&rsquo;s prison related to the number of times one could change one&rsquo;s underwear, the kind of hairstyle one was <Col N="1277"/>allowed and whether one was allowed to wear make-up or jewellery.  They were cruel and terrible impositions outside the law.</P>
        <P>I speak about this because I feel we are in a vacuum where no one will be free in the present atmosphere that is being whipped up both in regard to the volume of crime and the response to it.  I understand just as much as anybody in this House the effect of attacks on the elderly, the appalling trauma one suffers after the invasion of one&rsquo;s space in one&rsquo;s home or body, but one can do everything for the victims of crime without interfering or taking from the minimum we allow in regard to rights of prisoners.  It is so clear to us that we are running the prisons in a primitive way.</P>
        <P>I have another interesting point in regard to the conveyor belt that is pushing people into prisons.  There is a huge distinction between those factors which affect the rates of crime in the different categories and the incidence of crime.  Usually, for example, socio-economic factors will explain fluctuations in the crime rate but one needs to do case studies to know what it is that delivers a person through incidences to becoming a person who commits a crime.  It is a very subtle notion also in regard to excitation and excitement, particularly in regard to crimes involving motor car abuse at present.  A volume of work requires to be done in this regard.</P>
        <P>Currently, eight people are in Mountjoy waiting to go to the Central Mental Hospital.  If one is on methadone when one goes into Mountjoy, one can continue with methadone treatment, but if one wants, for example, to get off drugs and go on methadone while in Mountjoy, one cannot do so.  One cannot begin treatment there.  Is it reasonable for one to get a megaphone and start blasting messages to the public about what one is going to do about the number of prison places when at the same time one is not providing a psychiatric service for those who need it who happen to be in prison?  In every place where there has been good prison reform, the health service is looking after the health of prisoners.  That is not a prison function.  It should be separated from prison administration and be handled by the health authorities because one is dealing with a citizen&rsquo;s psychological and health welfare.</P>
        <P>In 1982, when Whittaker was reporting, the cost of a prison place was &pound;29,000 per year.  The annual cost is now over &euro;90,000 and it is over &euro;100,000 in the case of Mountjoy.  It is a destructive way of dealing with individuals who happen to have broken the law.  We have been unable to examine the implications of this approach.  If we were to go back to first principles, one would ask the question and look at the process which is made certain.  The struggle of the 18th century was making incarceration certain.  The origin of prison is of putting people into cells.  Very often prisons were in monasteries.  People did not know <Col N="1278"/>of what they were accused, how long they would be there or in what condition they would get out of prison.  Therefore, the great movement of the 18th century, which was described by people like Sir Leon Radzinowicz, was towards establishing certainty of the offence, the process and the treatment.</P>
        <P>In the 19th century, the industrialists and those who wanted prisons shared a great moment when they were influenced by Bentham.  They thought they could try to control everything from a single point &mdash; the image of the panopticon &mdash; and thus it is at Pentonville we see the people throwing their silk hats in the air as the Prince of Wales opened the prison.  From that time on, we in Ireland were interested in the history of prison reform and sometimes in political prisoners, but very often they were anxious to separate themselves from the general condition of prisoners.</P>
        <P>I have visited prisons.  I have read poems in the secure section of Mountjoy and, built as it was in those circumstances for different purposes, it is outrageous that prison staff have to work there.  I made reference to the Gary Douche case.  On the day of that crime, the prison was over capacity.  That is a fact.  It is quite scandalous that the forensics of that case are not available.  Perhaps they are but I have not seen them and I cannot recover them.</P>
        <P>We are really talking about the alternatives to prison.  Other speakers have raised the issue of why the Minister has chosen in this legislation to establish himself as a unique planning authority in regard to prisons, taking powers to himself that should normally be within the planning process.  People have made representations to us on that and they appear to be reasonable.  When I served on the body that examines prisons, we came to the conclusion that there were hardly any cases where the incarceration of women in prison were justified.  At that time two women required to be in a secure environment.  One was a very famous case.  The rest were cases relating to repeated shoplifting, stealing etc.  It makes no sense to ignore the statistics.  If 80% of those in prison for non-payment of fines re-offend and are back in prison within four years, why does the Minister of State not address this fact?  There is a notion that people do not want to visit prisons.  I was very well aware that a judge who sentences someone to prison is entitled to visit a prison, day or night, to observe the conditions to which he has sent someone.  A few very notable people did because they were interested.  That is why I take very seriously what the current prison inspector has said and the comments made about the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>Deputy Neville referred to clothing being removed from prisoners considered to be suicidal and their being left in solitary confinement.  A definitive study from Harvard Medical School <Col N="1279"/>shows the destructive effects of solitary confinement to one&rsquo;s mental health.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to consider the history of the Quakers.  They examined the whole history of prison.  They examined the notion whether one should expunge one&rsquo;s guilt through hard work or hard labour.  Before that in the American experience they tried putting people into solitary confinement and leaving them with the Bible so that it would lead the person to find Jesus and through that they would recover.  When they studied this, the unfortunate man who wrote about this found that most of the people in the American system had gone mad.  The Harvard study, carried out by Professor Grassian in the past 12 months shows that it is a most destructive thing to put a person into solitary confinement.  I am certain that we are breaching human rights as I speak in relation to the conditions in prison.  I welcome that the Irish Penal Reform Trust has been able to establish, at least in the High Court &mdash; although it is on appeal to the Supreme Court &mdash; a <i>locus standi</i> in relation to the right to take cases in defence of having decent and dignified conditions in our prisons.</P>
        <P>Those who have visited prisons are aware of the level of illiteracy in prisons.  Prisoners exchange cigarettes and chocolates and give each other presents in return for writing letters.  Today is St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day and a literate prisoner may be given presents to write letters to members of another prisoner&rsquo;s family.  These are the conditions in prison and it is not a matter of saying that we need more places.  We need better conditions.</P>
        <P>The D&oacute;chas facility is a good facility that should not be closed down.  It will be closed in the move to the new prison but it should be used as a model.  We should not state that conditions in it are too soft.  We are tested every time we speak about prisons as to whether we refer to revenge, retribution or rehabilitation.  We should first of all remove as many people as possible from the conveyor belt to prison.  Those in prison who need medical treatment should receive it and those who must stay in prison should have an assurance of respect for their dignity.  We are not forced to choose between appropriate recognition of the rights of victims and expanding and establishing the rights of prisoners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Higgins referred to literacy in prisons.  On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; prisoners were asked what it meant to them to have the right to vote.  One of those interviewed said that while a notice to that effect had been displayed for weeks, most of the prisoners could not read and did not know what it said.  That proves Deputy Higgins&rsquo;s point.  We are giving the prisoners the vote but we have not taught them how to read and write.  There is a duty on the State to <Col N="1280"/>give prisoners the tools needed to fit into society when they leave prison and thereby reduce the chance of re-offending.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with the idea of prisoner escort services referred to in section 2.  Is this included to strengthen the hand of the Minister in negotiations with prison officers?  Two weeks ago he was at pains to tell us he did not expect the provisions to be used.  I question his motive on this point.</P>
        <P>I have a problem with the certification of custody officers.  Who will certify them?  Will it be an accredited training body with expertise and experience in this area?  What are the criteria for assessment?  Who is to be certified &mdash; the person who gets the contract who can then employ other officers or is it every officer or employee of that business?  It is important to have that clarified.  Section 9(1) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">A prisoner custody officer shall not disclose information relating to a prisoner which is obtained by him or her in the course of his or her employment as a prisoner custody officer unless he or she&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) is authorised by the Minister to so do, or</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) does so for the purposes of performing his or her functions as a prisoner custody officer.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It does not mention that the person cannot pass on information about transport arrangements.  We know what could happen if information about transport of certain prisoners gets out.  We must be very careful how we deal with this, and it must be clarified.  Who will do the certification?</P>
        <P>The same section refers to private contractors detaining prisoners.  Where do we envisage this detention?  Will it be in an office or a backyard?  I ask this because we have been through traumatic times in recent months with regard to tiger raids involving large sums of money.  The same trauma could happen with dangerous criminals who could plan for their escape to occur while they are being transported.  It is much easier to plan when there is information on the inside which can get out.  The Bill is not clear on the matter of who will detain prisoners and where they will be detained.</P>
        <P>Have these measures been costed or are they for another purpose?  This has not been made very clear.  I am concerned when I hear a Minister explaining how a measure will not be used.  Why bother with it?  I would like to know what is behind it.</P>
        <P>If someone is refused certification he or she has the right to appeal to the Circuit Court.  Can the Minister of State explain this?  It does not seem to be normal human resources procedure in any Department?  Why would one want to do so?</P><Col N="1281"/>
        <P>The contractors will file an annual report, in effect, evaluating themselves.  There should be independent evaluation of the private contractor services.  Will a licence be granted for three years?  Many other programmes funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform must seek funding on an annual basis and must produce evaluation reports and so on.  This sector seems to be allowed to send in its report with no proper evaluation.  I seriously question that.</P>
        <P>Section 3 refers to prison discipline, another area that must be clarified.  Some sanctions may damage mental health, notably the provision for 60 days without visits, workshops or letters.  The disciplinary measures must be clarified.  I favour a charter explaining what category of punishment is attached to each breach of discipline. There must be a clear system for the prisoner to know what is happening.</P>
        <P>I can accept the withdrawal of extra recreational activities but we should not prevent somebody attending a workshop.  That would be counter-productive because that person might not get certification.  There is a reference to taking away television rights but the televisions were brought in to help prevent suicide.  Has this measure been thought through?  I want to see proper information on this before the Bill is passed.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that the person hearing a prisoner&rsquo;s appeal must be a barrister or solicitor with seven years practice experience.  Does the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform think he is going to lose his job here?  Is he lining up a job for himself afterwards or why must the person be one who may not be best trained or have the expertise to judge this appeal?  There are many people with expertise and training in dealing with prisoners who might give a better judgment on appeals.</P>
        <P>We have had the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo;, now we will have the &ldquo;McDowell Bowl&rdquo;.  The Minister wants to give himself permission to build prisons where and how he wants.  This would breach planning laws.  The Bill provides that there is no need to go through the full planning process on the existing site of a prison.  The decision rests with the Minister on a new site because it is a matter of national importance.  Under the legislation, a rapporteur will hear submissions and this House will have the final say.  We all know that if a Minister wants to shove something through here he or she has the power to do so.  It is democracy on paper, not real democracy.  I am not happy that this gives us a chance to make sure the planning process is correct.  That is not good planning law.</P>
        <P>If the T&aacute;naiste is enabled to knock down a premises and rebuild it does that mean that if he were to apply the same planning allowances to the stadium at Lansdowne Road he could knock it down and build a new one, without planning permission?  He would not accept that and should <Col N="1282"/>not accept it in respect of prisons.  That is not fair to the neighbourhood or the local people.</P>
        <P>Why, when it comes to purchasing a prison site, does the Government pay over the odds?  In the case of Thornton the T&aacute;naiste paid almost eight times the price at which it could have been bought.  If the matter is of such national importance surely he can compulsorily purchase the land at a fair price and not waste taxpayers&rsquo; money paying a ridiculous sum for it.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposal to put an independent inspector of prisons on a statutory basis.  That is important.  Could that person&rsquo;s remit be extended to cover the evaluations of the people who pick up the escort service contracts?</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste stated: &ldquo;We are changing how prisons are run, work practices in prisons, where prisons are located and, very importantly, we hope to change what is achieved by sending people to prison.&rdquo;  What exactly is achieved by sending people to prison?  We do not seem to achieve anything.  A recent report from UCD states that 25% of people who leave prison return within a year and up to 85% are back within four years.  We must not be achieving much in our prison system.  The Minister must explain that comment to the House and offer some proper initiatives.  Prison does not solve the problem for everybody, as this proves.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s announcement that new prisons are to be built and that he is going to stamp out crime may sound good to voters but prison does not solve the problem.  Many studies have proved that prison is not the answer for everybody.  It may work for dangerous criminals and people who should be off the streets.  If results show that people are reoffending we are failing and the T&aacute;naiste needs to address that failure.  He needs to stop being cool in front of the voters and get down to what actually works.</P>
        <P>A high percentage of people imprisoned for non-payment of fines go back into prison for reoffending.  This week I dealt with a young single mother who is in dire financial straits.  She got a parking fine for &euro;40 but because she missed the payment deadline that has risen to &euro;80 and now she is being brought to court which will cost at least &euro;120.  She will not be able to pay that sum and has no family members to help her.  She will probably end up in Mountjoy or some other prison, taking up another place and meeting other criminals and learning about crime.  This will happen because we could not pass a Bill introduced by my colleague, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, which would attach orders to recover the fine rather than put people in prison.  It might sound hard and tough for a Government to announce that it is increasing prison space but that is not always the answer.  The Prisons Bill offers an opportunity to discuss these issues.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputies who have contributed to the debate on this Bill which contains significant measures in the programme of reform of the prison service.  I acknowledge the points raised by the Deputies tonight and will bring them to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s attention.  He has stated his determination to ensure that our prisons are modern and humane and can take their place as models of how a 21st century prison service should operate.  The Bill deals with several major issues in this regard and the level of support it has received from Deputies is pleasing.</P>
        <P>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe mentioned recidivism and noted that 75% of offenders reoffend.  The results of a recent study by the Institute of Criminology in UCD do not support this figure.  That study found that approximately 27% of released prisoners serve a new prison sentence within one year, this rises to 45% after three years and 49% after four years.  While these figures are high, they are not of the magnitude suggested by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputies Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe and O&rsquo;Connor that every encouragement should be given to keep people out of prison.  Towards that end a working group to review the potential of restorative justice is being established.  The group will take account of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights which was published last month.</P>
        <P>Deputies Fleming, Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe and &Oacute; Snodaigh were concerned about the possible privatisation of prisons.  There are no plans in the offing to privatise our prisons.  There are, of course, circumstances in which individual functions now being carried out by the State could be carried out by private companies &mdash; the escorting of prisoners is one such service provided for in the Bill.  The Minister has stated, however, that it is not his intention to commence this part.  The prison service escort corps is running very successfully and operates on average over 33% more efficiently than the previous overtime-based system.  As long as these efficiencies continue, there is no reason to contract out the prison escort service.</P>
        <P>Deputies Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, Howlin and &Oacute; Snodaigh raised the matter of the appeals tribunals and why only lawyers should be appointed as members.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been advised by the Office of the Attorney General that such tribunals are necessary in order to meet the requirements laid down in recent decisions in the European Court of Human Rights and will in effect be quasi-judicial bodies.  As such, it is important that members who will be expected to take on quasi-judicial functions have legal training.</P>

	<P>In respect of the points made on the planning provisions in the Bill, the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 dealt with planning permission for developments of strategic importance.  </P>
        <P>At the time, the T&aacute;naiste took the view, however, that largescale prison developments were in a unique position, not just because of the security aspects but also because of the public interest and level of concern that surrounds the development of new prisons and that it would, therefore, be more appropriate that special provisions relating to the construction of prisons should be brought forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputies Cuffe and Burton seem to be labouring under a misapprehension in this regard.  Under section 86 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, prisons are already exempt from normal planning procedures.  Rather than circumventing planning procedures, the T&aacute;naiste is introducing them and providing in this Bill for a specific planning regime for largescale prison developments that will include a public consultation process and approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>As regards Deputy Burton&rsquo;s queries on the role of the rapporteur and the action to be taken on foot of the receipt of that report, as the T&aacute;naiste stated, section 23 provides for the appointment of a rapporteur to receive submissions relating to the proposed development and the rapporteur shall prepare a report that shall summarise the submissions received and identify the main issues raised.  This report shall be published.  It is not intended that the rapporteur would evaluate the submissions or make recommendations to the Minister.  To ensure this is clear, it is intended to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to replace the word &ldquo;consider&rdquo; in section 23(2) with the phrase &ldquo;take account of&rdquo;.  This is being done because it appears the word &ldquo;consider&rdquo; might be open to misinterpretation in this regard.  In accordance with section 25, the Minister may make alterations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It has already been stated on several occasions that the Thornton Hall site was the least expensive suitable site offered, from over 30 that were put forward.  I am not going to rehearse those arguments.  With regard to Deputies Howlin&rsquo;s and Burton&rsquo;s queries as to a timescale for the development of Thornton Hall, the closing date for the receipt of tenders for development was 31 January 2007.  The tenders are being assessed and the intention is to select a preferred tenderer by April 2007 and sign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>As already stated, the tenders are being assessed and the intention is to select a preferred tenderer by April 2007 and sign a contract, with construction to be completed within three years.  I assure Deputy Howlin that he will have ample opportunity to change the entire process if he can identify a cheaper site.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is going to be tight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not be difficult to identify a cheaper site.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>On the point of access to the site, which was raised by Deputy Burton, the existing road has been deemed adequate following a traffic survey by professional consultants.  However, following an approach by local residents, the Irish Prison Service is examining the purchase of a small portion of land to provide an alternative route.  Nothing has been finalised at this point.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cuffe raised the issue of an ombudsman for prisons.  It is not considered that an ombudsman is necessary.  A range of options is available to prisoners if they wish to make com<Col N="1286"/>plaints.  A prisoner may complain of ill treatment to the governor, to a member of a visiting committee, to the Director General of the Prison Service or to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is also open to a prisoner to report a matter to the Garda, pursue a civil action for damages in the courts or make a complaint to any third party.  In these circumstances, it is not clear what value the addition of an extra layer of bureaucracy in the shape of a prison ombudsman would have.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cuffe suggested that the Inspector of Prisons should be in a position to publish reports independently.  The purpose of the post of inspector is to provide an independent monitoring function.  However, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has overall responsibility for the proper running of the prison service and reports should be submitted to him or her in the first instance.  In any event, it is the norm in such cases to submit reports to the Minister and I would point to precedent in this regard in the Children Act 2001 in respect of the Inspector of Children Detention Schools submitting a report to the Minister for Education and Science.  Similar provisions are contained in the Consumer Credit Act 1995 and the Railway Safety Act 2005.</P>
        <P>Deputies Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, Howlin, Burton and Andrews referred to the Fines Bill, which the T&aacute;naiste recently presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and referred to the fact that attachment of earnings is not addressed.  While there will be an opportunity to debate the merits of this Bill at another time, I will say that it is the first in a two-part strategy to update and rationalise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government announced the contents of the first Bill as if they were also included in the second Bill.  It was a total fraud.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;the fines system in our courts.  The operation of the first part of the strategy will determine how the other issues will be approached in a second Bill.  There are a wide range of issues to be resolved with the courts and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Nevertheless, it is clear that the provisions in the Fines Bill should reduce the number of persons imprisoned for default because they did not have the resources to pay a fine imposed by the courts.  It should be noted, however, that the numbers in custody for non-payment of fines generally represent less than 0.1% of the available accommodation at any one time.  For example, of 3,130 persons in custody on 3 January, six were in custody for non-payment of fines.  However, I take on board the points made by Deputy English.  In such cases, there must be a better way to proceed than that offered under the existing system.</P>
        <P>With regard to the cost of prisons, I wish to point out that the introduction of video link facilities in the Bill for certain court hearings will <Col N="1287"/>increase the cost-effectiveness of the Prison Service and result in substantial savings.  While it is not possible to accurately estimate the possible savings at this point &mdash; the figure depends on issues such as the scope of the hearings that can be dealt with by video link and on the lead-in period for full acceptance of the facility by members of the Judiciary, as well as on other factors &mdash; I am in a position to state that the committee on video conferencing, which reported in January 2005, was advised at the time that the cost in one year of transporting prisoners from Cork Prison to High Court sittings at Cloverhill Prison and to Cork District Court was just under &euro;300,000.  That is just one example relating to one <Col N="1288"/>prison but it gives a good idea of the extent of the savings we might expect.</P>
        <P>No one would disagree with the points raised by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  While some of them are not directly related to the Bill, he has again raised issues that are extremely pertinent and in respect of which I fully concur with him.</P>
        <P>It is good that the Bill has in general been supported by Deputies.  While it is not possible on Second Stage to go into significant detail about all of the measures in a Bill or the issues raised, these can be discussed further on Committee Stage.  I again thank Deputies for their contributions and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue.  I am pleased that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, will respond because it is he who has responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  I understand he is busy with his election campaign but I hope he will visit south Mayo in coming weeks to meet the people affected by the serious flooding there.</P>
        <P>Before Christmas, I and the local Fine Gael councillor Patsy O&rsquo;Brien visited the home of Jimmy Connolly and his wife Eileen.  While everybody else was preparing for Christmas, this family&rsquo;s home was flooded and they could not get in or out of it.  Mr. Connolly found himself in a dire situation because his home was not insured against flooding.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that the Government did not declare Mayo a disaster area.  When flooding occurred in Clonmel, the Shannon region and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency in Dublin, all the State agencies were on the scene within 24 hours and those locations were declared disaster areas.</P>
        <P>Several reports issued by Mayo County Council indicate that there are 50 places in south Mayo where the roads need to be raised and drainage work is required.  This will cost money but it is essential in the long term.  A regional road in the area which is used by 7,900 vehicles every day was closed for three weeks.  This caused great inconvenience to families in places such as <Col N="1290"/>Neale, Cross, Kilmaine and Cong, where parents could not bring their children to school or get into or out of their homes.</P>
        <P>The Government must take action to improve drainage in this area.  Moreover, an agency must be set up to deal specifically with drainage.  Neither Mayo County Council nor the OPW took responsibility for the situation in south Mayo.  A dedicated agency should be able to decree that buildings should not be constructed in certain locations.  What happened in south Mayo in recent months cannot be allowed to recur.  This is not the first time the region has been affected by flooding and the problem will not go away.</P>
        <P>Something must be done.  In the first instance, families whose homes were damaged must receive some assistance.  The most important action is the raising of regional roads.  The 50 vulnerable spots identified by Mayo County Council must be dealt with immediately.  A situation such as that at Christmas, where people were unable to access their homes, cannot be allowed to recur.  People had to use boats and many had to be rescued by the Civil Defence and emergency services.  I compliment the agencies who assisted these residents at Christmas, including even the county council when it was called upon.  The problem is that nobody would take responsibility.  I spoke to the county council&rsquo;s engineer, who blamed the OPW.  The OPW, on the other hand, blamed the council.</P>
        <P>What are the Minister of State&rsquo;s proposals to rectify this problem?  What can be done for the families who endured serious flooding problems, some of whom lost their homes?  There was also serious flooding in Crossmolina in November.  I previously raised with the Minister of State and the OPW the problem of people interfering with the flow of the river there.  Will the OPW take these people to court?  Those responsible submitted an application for retention approval in respect of which the council sought further information.  This information was not provided within the six-month timeframe.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State come to Mayo and meet Jimmy Connolly and his wife Eileen and hear what they have suffered?  He should see for himself the damage done.  I know his officials visited the region and identified the serious problems there.  Resources will be necessary to rectify the matter and that funding must be found once and for all.  I hope the Minister of State will show <Col N="1291"/>some compassion by dealing first with those affected.  After that, the roads and arterial drainage must be upgraded.</P>
        <P>We are told that climate change will bring heavier rainfall in the winter.  The problem will not go away and I ask the Minister of State to do something about it.  Like every politician in this House, he has a seat to hold.  However, I ask him to visit the area even at this late stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to express once again my concern and that of the Government regarding those affected by the flooding that occurred in various areas in recent months as a result of exceptional and continued rainfall.  This is a singularly traumatic and unpleasant experience for those affected and I am conscious that the flooding was particularly severe in Deputy Ring&rsquo;s own area in Mayo.  I have seen first-hand how severe it can be.  It is devastating when a family home is damaged.</P>
        <P>With this in mind I announced in mid-January that the Commissioners of Public Works will work with local authorities to identify solutions to the various flooding incidents that have occurred.  The local authorities are the front-line responders where State sector assistance is required in the event of serious flooding.  They are therefore likely to have information which, allied to the local knowledge of their staff, will be invaluable in determining the most likely immediate cause of the flooding.  This information, in conjunction with the expertise of the OPW in dealing with river engineering, will assist in devising potential solutions to the individual problems.  Where additional surveys or other information is needed, this will be arranged.  Where it is not possible to find flood relief measures that are viable, other flood protection measures may be considered.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that where solutions are identified that offer an acceptable level of social and financial benefit, and which are environmentally acceptable, these will be implemented as quickly as possible.  Such works will be financed from existing resources available to the OPW for drainage and flood relief.   OPW&rsquo;s role in this initiative will be to provide support and assistance to local authorities in dealing with problems in their areas and to bring co-ordination where more than one authority is involved.  The initiative cannot succeed without the full co-operation of local communities and, in particular, landowners who may be requested to permit access to their properties to facilitate relief measures.  Over recent weeks, OPW officials have been involved in urgent and ongoing consultations with the various local authorities concerned and the national parks and wildlife service with a view to identifying measures which are both feasible and environmentally acceptable.</P><Col N="1292"/>
        <P>In regard to south Mayo, OPW officials are in ongoing consultation with Mayo County Council in respect of the flooding there and I understand they are making good progress towards identifying possible flood relief works for Crossmolina, Clyard and Kilmaine and are continuing to seek solutions to the flooding problems in the other areas affected.  Various relevant reports and in-house studies are expected to be available this week and further meetings have been scheduled over the next few days.</P>
        <P>The provision of any form of humanitarian assistance for those affected by the flooding is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  In a reply to recent parliamentary questions regarding possible humanitarian aid for persons affected by the recent flooding, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, which is administered by the Community Welfare Division of the Health Service Executive (HSE), is designed to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.  Under the legislation governing the scheme, the Health Service Executive may make an exceptional needs payment to people on social welfare or health board payments.  This is a once-off payment to meet an unforeseen or special need that cannot be met from a person&rsquo;s basic income.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Assistance in the form of an Urgent Needs Payment (UNP) can be also made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA, to assist, for example in cases of flood damage, with immediate needs, such as food, clothing, fuel, household goods and perhaps shelter.  Assistance can be provided in cash or in kind.  My Department&rsquo;s role in supporting the response to the recent flooding will primarily involve supporting the community welfare service in the provision of ENP and UNP funding in the short term and other supports where applicable to cater for the long-term effects of the flooding.  Any support given will relate to damage to a person&rsquo;s home or loss of essential items.  It will not extend to business or commercial losses.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">My Department, working through the HSE, has a role in providing immediate humanitarian aid in response to serious flooding incidents.  It has no role in providing compensation for losses arising from such incidents.  Local community welfare officers are available to provide assistance on an individual basis where that is warranted.  If any person is experiencing hardship as a result of the recent flooding, they should contact their local Community Welfare Officer in the first instance.</P><Col N="1293"/>
        <P FLI="0">I again offer my sympathy to those affected by the recent flooding.  I appreciate the disruption, frustration and fear which accompany such flood events.  I assure them that every effort is being made by my officials in OPW, in conjunction with the local authorities, to identify flood relief measures that will help to counteract recurrence of flooding in similar situations.  Timescale will vary depending on circumstances, including complexity of finding solutions, weather and ground conditions, environmental considerations, etc.  Measures will be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Next week I hope to visit sites in Galway, Offaly and Clare where we have found solutions on which we are working.  Funding is not an issue.  The OPW has funding and has provided local authorities with funds to carry out works.  The situation in Mayo is slightly more complicated and the Deputy is very familiar with some of the issues there.  As soon as we have a solution, I assure the Deputy I will visit Mayo.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, although I would have preferred the Minister for Health and Children to have been here so that she could hear first hand what is going on in the nursing homes for which she has responsibility.  The next of kin of two of my constituents recently received curt letters from St. Margaret&rsquo;s nursing home telling them that two elderly people would have to leave the home.  The letter states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Dear X</P>
        <P LI="1">It is with regret that I am giving you notice to find alternative accommodation for <i>Mary</i>.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The Health Service Executive have been informed of this decision and will help you find alternative accommodation for <i>Mary</i>.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">If I can be of any assistance please contact me on (01) 8322212.</P>
        <P LI="1">Your Sincerely</P>
        <P FLI="0">The signatory of the letter did not identify his or her role or position in the nursing home.  It was a simple, typed circular letter with blank spaces in which the Christian names of the addressee and the patient could be hand written.  It was not even a decent mail merge.  There was no explanation as to why the elderly patient had to leave so abruptly.  There was no reference to Mary&rsquo;s husband who has multiple medical problems and who has been living in the same nursing home for the past seven years.  There was no expression of appreciation for those who had been resident in the nursing home for years and who had handed <Col N="1294"/>over their savings and pensions or for their families who visited them there regularly.</P>
        <P>Landlord and tenant relationships are regulated by law.  The landlord is obliged to specify a period of time as statutory notice before he or she can ask the paying tenant to leave.  Apparently, no such rights are available to patients in nursing homes.</P>
        <P>My constituents are husband and wife.  It appears that one may be allowed to stay and one may have to leave.  That gives rise to problems.  If it is the case that the HSE has instructed the nursing home to take a particular course of action &mdash; we have seen reports in the media on this nursing home and on others in respect of which the HSE is suspending their activities &mdash; then it should explain that to the patients and the next of kin and ensure a patient-friendly approach is taken when dealing with the problems.  In any set of circumstances, the HSE should supervise and ensure the actions of a nursing home are carried out within proper agreed parameters.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister for Health and Children spell out the particular circumstances surrounding the removal of these and other patients from St. Margaret&rsquo;s nursing home which has a total of 26 patients?  So far, we have been told ten public patients will be moved but there is no sign of private patients being moved.  What exactly is the situation?  What steps will be taken by the Minister&rsquo;s Department to facilitate these patients, who have been asked to move and whose next of kin have been informed, in new accommodation?  Will she indicate what steps she proposes to take to ensure this does not happen again?  It causes enormous distress to patients and family members who do not know what is going on in that particular nursing home.  They do not know why their next of kin is being moved out at short notice.</P>
        <P>The nature of the letter written is an absolute disgrace.  We need a decent dignified service and the Minister of Health and Children is responsible for ensuring that.  I hope the Minister will take that on board and that we will get a comprehensive answer on these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank the Deputy for raising the question as it provides me with an opportunity to outline the background to the current situation in regard to St. Margaret&rsquo;s nursing home and the action taken by the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Government policy is to develop and improve health services in all regions of the country and to ensure quality and patient safety.  The safety and well-being of older people living in nursing homes is of critical concern.  Quality care and patient safety come first and all patients should receive the same high standard of quality assured <Col N="1295"/>care.  The present standards for nursing homes are set out in the 1993 Care and Welfare Regulations.  Under section 9 of the regulations, regarding the discharge of patients from a nursing home, the legislation states: &ldquo;Where the registered proprietor or the person in charge intends discharging a dependent person, they shall inform the person and the person nominated to act on the person&rsquo;s behalf, the date of the proposed discharge, the reasons for the discharge and give fourteen days notice to make alternative arrangements.&rdquo;</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 22 November 2006, the HSE suspended new public admissions to St. Margaret&rsquo;s nursing home near Rivermede in north County Dublin.  This followed a series of inspections by HSE.  The home was found to be in breach of the 1993 Care and Welfare Regulations.  The imposition of such suspensions is in line with recent public assurances by the HSE that, where concerns are raised by inspectors about a private nursing home, no beds will then be contracted by the HSE with that home until the issues are rectified.  Furthermore, the home has been advised not to take in privately referred admissions during this period.</P>
        <P>On 8 February 2007, ten residents were asked by the owners of the nursing home to find alternative accommodation.  It is important to note that it was the home and not the HSE which made this decision.  The HSE set up a multidisciplinary committee, which met on 12 February, to work with patients and relatives to find alternative accommodation.  It will continue to work with patients and relatives and is due to carry out further inspections on the home in the near future.</P>
        <P>It is also important to note that the HSE inspection team carried out a risk assessment in this nursing home and the current assessment is that there is no immediate risk to any resident in this home.</P>
        <P>An expert working group chaired by this Department developed and published, in January 2007, draft standards which will apply to all residential care settings -<b> </b>public, private and voluntary.  The draft standards have been formally referred to the interim health information and quality authority, iHIQA, which will initiate a short, focused consultation process and then finalise the standards for use in the inspection process to be carried out by the social services inspectorate.  The interim health information and quality authority has already established a group to finalise the draft standards and it held its first meeting on 30 January 2007.</P>
        <P>As I have already mentioned, the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993 outline the standards that currently govern private nursing homes and inspections are carried out based on these standards.  These regulations apply to private nursing homes only and do not apply <Col N="1296"/>to public nursing homes at present.  However, as I outlined previously, when finalised the new standards will apply to all residential care settings.</P>
        <P>In addition to the work undertaken on the draft standards by the Department of Health and Children, the HSE has also taken steps to improve nursing home inspections.  A working group was established in July 2005 by the HSE to examine the issues of inspections and registrations of private nursing homes and to standardise the inspections process nationwide.  A HSE working group produced a report in July 2006 on nursing home inspections and registrations which currently underpins the inspection process.  Since July, the inspection reports have been made available on the HSE&rsquo;s website.  In addition, all inspections are now unannounced and nursing homes are now inspected at least twice a year.</P>
        <P>It is clear that this Government is committed to ensuring that residential care for older people is safe and of the highest quality.  As I have outlined to the House, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE continue to work on a number of fronts to advance this critical objective.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would have preferred the Minister for Health and Children to have been present but I appreciate the attendance of the Minister of State.  The issue I wish to raise concerns a facility in Cork which is due to open on 24 March 2007.  Cork has been well served by four maternity units and three in particular, the Bon Secours Hospital, St. Finbarr's Hospital and Erinville Hospital, which are very highly regarded and have provided a service second to none for expectant mothers in Cork for longer than anybody in the House would care to remember.  It was decided that, to provide a safer service for pregnant mothers, all the maternity services were to be combined, on the grounds that all practitioners in the area would be gathered under the one roof.</P>
        <P>We have a magnificent new building with 144 beds.  It is estimated that it will deliver 7,500 babies per year and experts tell me this will quickly rise to 8,000 and more.  It has been described by the local HSE as more of a hotel than a hospital, with birthing suites and other facilities we would expect in the modern world.  However, there is one fly in the ointment, namely, the staffing levels which experts consider to be adequate to ensure safe practice are not being put in place.  The HSE southern area commissioned a study by an expert in midwifery from England, Marie Washbrook, who considered the type of delivery to be expected in Cork, the numbers involved and the population base.  She concluded that to deliver a safe service in Cork, there was a need for 383 midwives.  At present 317 are on offer and they <Col N="1297"/>are not all fully trained, some of them being student midwives.</P>
        <P>Midwives in Cork are very good and decent women and any woman who has been attended to by one will say that they are exceptional people and very professional.  They are prepared to carry a number of trainee midwives to bring up the staffing levels.  A midwife service course was supposed to be offered last year but was cancelled and it now appears it will not just be student midwives who make up the numbers but care assistants and general nurses.  This is simply not good enough.  A director of midwifery was appointed and left because she was expected to report to a general nursing director, but everyone knows midwifery is a separate profession and has a different agenda.</P>
        <P>It is hoped the director of midwifery who was appointed to run the facility will take delivery of midwifery services in Cork in many new directions, including providing a service for people who want home births or to have consultations at home but deliver their babies in hospital.  It was never intended, however, for the midwifery service to be dependent on the general nursing service.  On 24 March, the Minister for Health and Children will cut the ribbon on a beautifully decorated facility in Cork where no service is available because staffing levels will not be of a standard that midwives in Cork feel will ensure a safe service.  As a result, they are refusing to transfer.</P>
        <P>Even at this late stage I call on the Minister to delay her visit to Cork to open the hospital and on the Government to engage with the Irish Nurses Organisation to ensure the service delivered to pregnant mothers is safe and one of which we can all be proud.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I welcome the opportunity to set out the position on the issue raised by Deputy Lynch.</P>
        <P>The Minister is committed to safe maternity care for women and their babies.  The opening of Cork University Maternity Hospital represents the single largest investment in obstetric care since the foundation of the State.  To date, &euro;75 million<b> </b>has been invested in developing the new infrastructure which provides a state-of-the-art environment with a full range of birthing options and choices for mothers and their families.</P>
        <P>Funding has also been provided for a new national perinatal and epidemiology centre in CUMH.  This will allow unusual trends in childbirth to be quickly observed and, most importantly, acted on to ensure that services for mothers and babies born in Ireland are based on best possible research.</P>
        <P>The new hospital is designed to cater for the current birth rate of 7,200 births per annum as well as gynaecology services currently provided <Col N="1298"/>over three sites &mdash; Bon Secours Hospital, St. Finbarr&rsquo;s Hospital and Erinville Hospital.</P>
        <P>The transfer of maternity services to the new Cork University Maternity Hospital will facilitate the provision of a 24-hour, on-site, on-call consultant-provided maternity service.  This will lead to better patient care and perinatal outcomes, improved risk management and clinical governance, and fulfil the Government objective of medical services being consultant-provided rather than consultant-led.  Another key efficiency in the amalgamation of services will be seen in the development of a single citywide service with an out-of-hours on-call roster, rationalising the service to a single 24-hour cover rota.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Act 2004, which provided for the establishment of the Health Service Executive on 1 January 2005, the HSE is responsible for managing and delivering, or arranging to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.  The HSE, therefore, is responsible for the midwifery-nursing staffing at the new Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH.  Of all the disciplines involved in the delivery of health care, nurses and midwives have the most contact with the patient.  As a group, nurses and midwives are fundamental to improving the care environments for patients.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the concerns raised by the Irish Nurses Organisation about midwifery-nursing staffing levels at Cork University Maternity Hospital.  I have been informed that HSE management has been involved in detailed negotiations with the INO on behalf of the midwifery and nursing staff who will transfer to the CUMH on 24 March next.  The HSE has created 264 new additional posts, of which 146 are midwifery-nursing posts for the new Cork University Maternity Hospital, to cater for the same number of births currently provided for in the three existing locations.  When the new Cork maternity unit opens it will have a midwifery-nursing complement of 375.5 full-time positions &mdash; 304 midwives, 7.5 nursery nurse positions and 64 student midwives.  Twenty student midwives commenced the new undergraduate programme in 2006 in University College Cork, and as university students, they are not counted in the staffing numbers.  The full midwifery staff complement will be 383 by the time all services are introduced on a phased basis by next December.</P>
        <P>The HSE has internationally benchmarked staffing levels for the new CUMH.  Recommendations from the British Paediatric Intensive Care Society as well as those of international midwifery expert, Marie Washbrook, from Birthrate Plus, have been taken on board.</P>
        <P>I have also been informed that the HSE remains willing, as previously confirmed to the INO, to have a prospective review of midwifery-nursing staffing levels carried out once the new facility opened.  It is in line with global best prac<Col N="1299"/>tice to conduct such studies once the new &ldquo;patient pathways&rdquo; and midwifery workload can be identified in the new environment.</P>
        <P>Senior management has been engaged since January 2005 with a comprehensive industrial relations agenda covering all unions and representing all grades of staff.  The HSE has informed me it is only in the past few days that the INO has agreed to refer any of its concerns to the Labour Relations Commission despite management&rsquo;s persistent requests to do so at an earlier stage.  I understand a conciliation conference has been arranged by the LRC for 21 February.</P>
        <P>I am confident the extensive range of measures taken by the Government and the HSE will con<Col N="1300"/>tinue to address effectively the midwifery-nursing workforce needs of the new CUMH.  The HSE has reassured me that at all times management has been open and transparent regarding the transfer of service and every effort has been made to integrate staff from all three locations &mdash; Bons Secours Hospital, Erinville Hospital and St. Finbarr&rsquo;s Hospital &mdash; before they transfer to the new Cork University Maternity Hospital.</P>
        <P>I am confident the new CUMH will provide a much enhanced maternity service to mothers and their families in the southern region.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services and the development and roll-out of telecommunications technology is primarily a matter for the industry itself. The telecoms market is fully liberalised and regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions.  As Minister with responsibility for policy in this sector, of course I welcome and encourage all new technology developments and progress. I welcome the introduction of more innovation and competition in the sector, the entry of new players and new product offerings from existing and new suppliers, which mean greater choice and lower prices for consumers. </P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The licensing terms for petroleum exploration and development need to achieve a balance between ensuring a fair return to the State while encouraging exploration. The licensing terms were last adjusted in 1992 and I am currently reviewing the terms. In reviewing the licensing terms, I am conscious that in the period since the terms were last adjusted fifteen years ago, that the level of exploration offshore Ireland has been relatively low and there has only been one commercial find &mdash; the Corrib Field in 1996.</P>
        <P>The cost of exploration is borne by the industry on the basis that the terms on offer by the licensing country reflect in a realistic way the likely prospect of making a commercial find. Investment by the exploration industry is very mobile. The industry will give priority to areas with good prospectivity, where the risk/reward ratio is attractive. My Department has now received the report of the consultants who were engaged to assist with the review. I will consider the report and its recommendations before bringing my proposals to Government for the future of the licensing regime.</P>
        <P>With regard to non-petroleum minerals, it is Government policy to stimulate discovery of economic mineral deposits and to maximise the contribution of the mining sector to the national economy, with due regard to its social and environmental impact. Exploration and development is undertaken by private enterprise and regulated under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999. All extraction of minerals under the Acts is subject to payment of royalties to the State. While it is my intention to consolidate and update the Minerals Development Acts in a new <Col N="1303"/>Minerals Development Bill, currently being drafted, I do not propose any change of policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Issues in relation to both postmasters and post office closures are, in the first instance, matters for the board and management of An Post and ones in which I have no statutory function.  Despite this I have met with the IPU on a number of occasions as have some of my cabinet colleagues in recent times. I also addressed the IPU Annual Conference in 2005 and 2006.  The Government has been, and continues to be, committed to the objective of securing and maintaining the largest economically sustainable post office network possible. This extends to the postmasters whose financial security and strong relationship with customers are vital to the continued viability of the network.</P>
        <P>Last September, Government approval was secured for An Post to enter a joint venture agreement with Belgian Bank, Fortis, to set up a retail banking business. Key to the Government approval of this joint venture was that it not only offers a real opportunity for the growth and development of An Post and the post office network but that it will, in time, greatly benefit the income streams of postmasters. I would therefore urge the IPU to reconsider the position it has taken in this regard as the successful roll-out of the joint venture is of great importance to the future viability of the post office network and improving the welfare of the postmasters by providing an alternative source of income.</P>
        <P>In order to facilitate discussions between postmasters and An Post, I appointed Eamonn Ryan to examine issues of mutual concern and to propose a plan for their resolution. I would therefore urge all parties to engage in negotiations in a positive manner with a view to reaching a mutually agreeable outcome.</P>

        <Quest> if he has received a further update or report from the CER regarding the November blackout as per <Col N="1304"/>reply to Parliamentary Question No. 89 of 21 November 2006; if Ireland can learn from its findings; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[5443/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) received the report of the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) on 6th February 2007 concerning the electricity blackout which occurred across central Europe on Saturday 4 November 2006. I am advised by the CER that the reasons for the blackout have been identified in the report as being the failure for some of the transmission system operators concerned to fulfil the security standards in place on their networks; and to co-ordinate their planning, actions and response to system difficulties and have in place appropriate controls.</P>
        <P>As I pointed out in my response to the previous question in this matter, the key lesson which can be learned from this blackout occurrence is that no electricity power system can be fully protected from such events and that fast, effective and specific emergency measures must be in place to deal with such incidents. In light of the report&rsquo;s findings, a particular lesson to be learned is the need for the co-ordination of planning and response measures by TSOs of interconnected systems.</P>
        <P>The CER is of the view that a similar situation is unlikely to occur in Ireland as we operate a closed Island Grid system at this point. The Irish and Northern Irish systems are interconnected, albeit with security measures in place over that connection to ensure that the systems can be separated to prevent severe difficulties in one system spreading to the other system.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the two TSOs, EirGrid and SONI, work closely together to ensure support for each other&rsquo;s system and co-ordinate measures to enhance the security of both systems. This will be enhanced from November 2007 with the commencement of the Single Electricity Market (SEM) for the entire island of Ireland and will result in further co-operation and co-ordination in the operation of the two transmission systems between the Republic and Northern Ireland.</P>

        <Quest> the reason the Postal (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill has been dropped from his Department&rsquo;s list of legislative proposals; if the proposed legislation has been shelved due to a particular development or lack thereof; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[5449/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Postal (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that was published in 2001 provided for the issue, sale and dis<Col N="1305"/>posal of shares in An Post in the context of an Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) and possible strategic alliance. The Bill also contained ancillary provisions arising out of a possible change of ownership.</P>
        <P>The financial and industrial relations environment in An Post has changed substantially since 2001. The company experienced significant losses that led to the adoption of a recovery strategy by the board. Implementation of the recovery strategy, which included negotiation of a new industrial relations agreement in order to return the company to sustained profitably became the key focus in relation to An Post.  As a result, the Postal Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, the objective of which was to give statutory effect to the ESOP, was withdrawn from the D&aacute;il Order paper on the basis of the uncertain IR and financial situation prevailing in An Post.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, the Government and I remain fully committed to an ESOP in An Post if it can be demonstrated that real business transformation can occur in the context of the recovery strategy. If and when this is achieved, the legislative agenda can be revisited.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 96, 104, 121, 164 and 176 together.</P>
        <P>The development of an Irish biofuels market and the increased development and deployment of bio-energy resources in Ireland is a key priority for the Government.  A range of initiatives are in place to support the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland. On Monday 12th February I signalled my intention to introduce a Biofuels Obligation by 2009, which will require all fuel suppliers ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales. In announcing the obligation, I have also committed to achieving 5.75% market penetration of biofuels by 2009, in advance of the date proposed for such a target in the EU Biofuels Directive. I have also committed to achieving 10% market penetration of biofuels in Ireland by 2010.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the Biofuels Obligation will build on the success of the two biofuels excise relief schemes which were rolled out in 2005 and 2006. The 2005 pilot scheme has resulted in eight projects being awarded excise relief for a two year period including four pure plant oil, three biodiesel or other biofuel and one bioethanol proposal.</P>
        <P>Under the pilot scheme in the biodiesel category there were 881,450 litres produced in 2005 and 41,685 litres produced in 2006. In the bioethanol category there were 12,336 litres produced in 2005 and 1,192,557 litres produced in 2006.  Overall under the pilot scheme excise relief to the value of &euro;1.562m has been given to the end of 2006 under the pure plant oil, biodiesel and bioethanol categories, all of which were produced in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The second Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme, valued at over &euro;200m, was launched in July last year and will enable us to reach the initial target of 2% market penetration of biofuels by 2008. There were sixteen successful projects under the second scheme including three pure plant oil, four biodiesel, four bioethanol and five in the captive fleets category. The majority of the sixteen successful applicants in the scheme <Col N="1307"/>either have existing production facilities in Ireland or are planning to develop production facilities in Ireland. The scheme will underpin the production and use of some 163 million litres of biofuels each year and will reduce CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions by 250,000 per annum when fully operational.</P>
        <P>In the three months since the results of the scheme were launched, over 300,000 litres of biofuels have been placed on the market. This is in addition to the biofuels placed on the market under the pilot scheme. Scheme II will be followed by the introduction of the biofuels obligation, which will achieve market penetration of 5.75% per annum. I have no reason to believe that these targets will not be met.</P>
        <P>The Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes were rolled out as competitive calls for proposals. They involved an open and transparent process in which the scoring mechanism was published as part of the application form and accompanying documentation. The schemes were the subject of State Aids applications which were approved by DG Competition. Under State Aids Rules the process must be open and fair and subject to single market rules.</P>
        <P>The EU transport fuel market is fully liberalised and EU rules do not allow for positive discrimination. Neither could preference be given to any participants within the competition by virtue of the origin of biofuels or biofuel feedstocks, or by the size or nature of the company applying for excise relief. While my Department has not received any specific written requests to increase the quota of excise relief available, officials have discussed the range of future policy options with a number of disappointed applicants, including the option of a biofuels obligation.</P>
        <P>The Obligation requirement which I announced on Monday sets out the long term demand strategy for the biofuels sector and this will allow all market players, including those who applied under Scheme II to make appropriate investment decisions. The specific details of the biofuel obligation scheme will be the subject of public and industry consultation later this year and will be followed by the appropriate legislation. In addition to measures to increase  the penetration of biofuels, farmers are also being incentivised by a new &euro;6 million bioenergy scheme to top-up the EU energy crop premium, announced last week by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food. Under this scheme, farmers will receive an additional &euro;80 per hectare on top of the existing &euro;45 premium.</P>
        <P>Ireland currently has 400,000 hectares of land under tillage and 75,000 hectares of land would be required if all of the 2% target were to be met from indigenous crops. By establishing targets of 5.75% and 10% market penetration by 2010 and 2020, we are clearly creating a market framework in which Irish farmers have significant opportunities to participate. The forthcoming National BioEnergy Action Plan will set the agenda for <Col N="1308"/>collective delivery over the next five years and beyond of the bioenergy potential across the agriculture, forestry, enterprise, transport and energy sectors.</P>

	<P>A Celtic Sea Herring Management Advisory Committee, comprising representatives of all the major players in the fishery, both the catching and processing sectors, is in place and makes recommendations in relation to the management of that fishery. The organisations represented on the Committee are the Killybegs Fishermens&rsquo; Organisation, the Irish Fish Producers Organisation, the Irish South and West Fishermens&rsquo; Organisation and the Irish South and East Fishermens&rsquo; Organisation.</P>
        <P>In relation to the North West Herring Fishery, the Department sought views on management arrangements for the fishery from the catching and processing sectors. Again all the representative organisations were involved.  The proposals for the two herring fisheries were discussed at a meeting between the industry and officials on 12 December 2006 and general support was secured for management proposals for the Spring fishery. I have endeavoured to seek the full involvement of industry in drawing up arrangement s for the management of fisheries. In relation to the North West Herring Fishery and the Celtic Sea Herring Fishery, the current arrangements were recommended by industry.</P>
        <P>The primary role of industry in the management of fisheries is recognised and supported in the Strategic Review of the Seafood Sector &ldquo;Steering a New Course, Strategy for a Restructured, Sustainable and Profitable Irish Seafood Industry 2007&ndash;2013&rdquo;, which was launched on 28 January. The need for stakeholder supported, commercially aware fisheries management policies and procedures, based on strict compliance with quotas and other National and EU regulations, is a key recommendation of the report. I have appointed Dr. Noel Cawley as Chairman of the Implementation group for the Report and I look forward to the early implementation of this and other recommendations.</P>

        <P>The strategic energy infrastructure projects will deliver interconnection, market integration, extension of the networks and storage for greater security of supply. Non-public sources of funding will be pursued, where suitable and appropriate, having regard to the overall energy policy goals. Consideration will be given to the possibility of an Exchequer contribution because of the scale, strategic importance and immediacy of Ireland&rsquo;s energy needs. The Sustainable Energy Sub-Programme encompasses measures covering renewable energy, energy efficiency, integration and innovation. Some measures may have a fuel poverty impact.

	<P>The key objectives of the draft general scheme of the Broadcasting Bill are as follows: </P>
        <P LI="1">To establish a single content regulator for commercial, community and public service broadcasters to be known as the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) and encompassing the existing regulatory functions of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the RT&Eacute; Authority.</P>
        <P LI="1">To provide a developed right of reply to persons whose reputation and good name have been damaged by an assertion of incorrect facts in a television or radio programme.</P>
      <P LI="1">To amend the existing public service remit of RT&Eacute; and Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge to incorporate the use of new web-based technologies in delivering on their mandates.</P>
        <P LI="1">Provide a statutory mechanism for the oversight of public funding to RT&Eacute; and Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge.</P>
        <P LI="1">To establish RT&Eacute; and Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge as separate companies under the Companies Acts 1963 to 2005.</P>
        <P FLI="0">With regard to the last objective, the draft general scheme proposes that both RT&Eacute; and Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge would be established as companies limited by guarantee with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources acting as the sole guarantor.  The draft general scheme proposes to introduce a number of new statutory provisions intended to ensure the future independence of RT&Eacute; and Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge.</P>
        <P>Head 78 provides that both RT&Eacute; and Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge shall be independent in all matters concerning the content of their programmes and the times at which they are broadcast or transmitted.  Head 89 imposes a strict duty on the directors of both RT&Eacute; and Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge to ensure the independence of the company regarding the conception, content and production of programmes, the editing and presentation of news and current affairs programmes and the definition of programme schedules from State, political and commercial influences. In addition, the provisions in the draft general scheme relating to the allocation of public funding, and alteration of the remit or activities undertaken by RT&Eacute; and Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge, subject such processes to increased public scrutiny.</P>
        <P>Head 81 of the draft general scheme also proposes to continue the principle that removal from office by the Government of the board of RT&Eacute; and Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge would require resolutions to be passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  The draft general scheme has been submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for the purposes of public consultation under the eCon<Col N="1311"/>sultation initiative. I  propose to introduce this Bill into the Houses of the Oireachtas in 2007 in the light of the outcome of the consultation process.</P>

	<P>My function in relation to the Corrib is a regulatory one. I have, however, done everything possible within that role to create the conditions that would allow the difficulties associated with this project to be resolved. Arising from concerns about the safety of the onshore pipeline I had a comprehensive safety review of the pipeline carried out by Advantica consultants. I also appointed Mr. Peter Cassells as mediator in the dispute. It has been a priority for me that people with concerns regarding safety should have an opportunity to have these considered. For that reason I very much welcomed the focus on local dialogue throughout the safety review and mediation process.</P>
        <P>I published the reports and recommendations of both Advantica and the mediator. The developer, Shell, has accepted the various recommendations. The mediator recommended that, in order to address local concerns about the proximity of the pipeline route to houses, the developers should modify the route in the vicinity of Rossport. The developer has committed itself to implementing this recommendation and I understand that public consultation with the local community is now underway to help choose the optimum route. I also understand that the developer has commenced contacts with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to new pipeline routing options, in the context of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.</P>
        <P>My Department, meanwhile, has ongoing contact with the developer as part of its role in monitoring the project. I remain hopeful that the safety studies, together with the work of the mediator, have paved the way for progress in this matter.</P>

	<P>The electronic communications market is of key importance to the national economy and is a significant factor in determining national economic competitiveness. The regulation of this industry is the responsibility of the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in accordance with the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 and the Regulations transposing the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications. ComReg&rsquo;s objectives include the promotion of competition and the promotion of the interests of users. </P>
        <P>As Minister for Communications, I have responsibility for overall telecoms policy. My objective has been to facilitate an open and competitive market, with the range and quality of services available to consumers that befits a modern economy like ours. The electronic communications market is dynamic and ever evolving, and while the market has been liberalised for some time, there is always room for improvement.</P>
        <P>The primary tool available to me to do this is legislation. The current EU regulatory framework is being reviewed by the European Commission and my officials and I are fully engaging in this process. In addition, the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill, which was published this month, is primarily designed to strengthen the regulatory framework for the electronic communications sector. The Bill will enable ComReg to better achieve one of its primary functions, which is the promotion of competition, thereby leading to better and more competitively priced telecommunications services for consumers. This Bill is on the priority list of legislation for enactment by the Government, during the current term of the D&aacute;il. I expect to bring it before this House shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 2000, the State has invested close to EUR &euro;93.75 million in the Digital Hub project. That sum comprises of an initial investment in property purchase of &euro;73.64 million for circa 9 acres in the Thomas Street/Liberties area of Dublin. State of the art telecommunications infrastructure investment came to &euro;2.29 million. The remainder of the amount is made up of operational expenditure. To date, the Agency has received exchequer assistance of EUR &euro;15.3 million in order to meet its performance targets.</P><Col N="1313"/>
        <P>Total private sector investment in the Agency has amounted to EUR &euro;3.4 million. Additional investment has been, and continues to be, undertaken by firms who choose to locate in the Hub. Exact details of those investments are not available.  In terms of growth, the Agency has grown the cluster to 75 companies now employing over 500 employees in the Hub. These enterprises are involved in a range of activities including gaming, software development, mobile technology, animation and TV production. A target of 200 companies, employing over 2,000 people, has been set for 2012. Estimates suggest that the Global Digital Media industry will be worth at least EUR &euro;1.1 trillion by 2009, representing growth of more than 53% in the period.</P>
        <P>Currently in Ireland there are between 400-500 companies in this space, employing almost 3,500 people. In 2003 there were few foreign owned digital media companies in Ireland. Today 20% of the Digital Hub companies are foreign owned. In order to support the development of the Hub and expand the number of high value added jobs in the Digital Media industry, I announced in November 2005, the acceptance of tenders for two separate sites in the Digital Hub area. In return for 6 acres of land, the State will receive a combination of &euro;72.4 million in cash and &euro;45.7 million in high quality offices, which will accommodate digital enterprises as the Digital Hub grows.</P>
        <P>This land is to be developed as a mixture of residential, commercial and retail properties, in addition to public spaces. The private developers who tendered, competed on the basis of bids of cash plus office space. The breakdown of the tenders means that the Digital Hub will receive over 150,000 square foot of office space by 2012.</P>

	<P>MediaLab Europe (MLE) was established as a company in May 2000. The subsequent downturn in the technology market in the latter half of 2000, as well as the tragic events of September 11 2001, had a direct and negative effect on the technology companies whose sponsorship was expected to underpin MLE. Responsibility was transferred to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in June 2002. In late 2003, the Department became concerned about the underperformance of MLE and examined the sustainability of the project. Concerns regarding its research and financial strategy were raised.</P><Col N="1314"/>
        <P>Following a close review of two Independent reports, one by KPMG the other from a private consultant, I initiated talks with MLE and MIT in an effort to resolve these concerns. The outcome of those talks was not satisfactory with the result that I decided it would not be appropriate to continue funding the project. Consequently, in early 2005 MLE went into liquidation.</P>
        <P>In general, I welcome the report of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) with regard to MediaLab Europe (MLE) and the findings and recommendations contained therein. I am heartened by the fact that the PAC recognised the role MLE played in attracting major ICT companies to this country. As part of its overall assessment the Committee also made reference to the positive impact the Lab had on the local community, presenting an invaluable opportunity to experience and learn using digital technology.</P>
        <P>I am also heartened by the fact the Committee&rsquo;s overall assessment made reference to the growing importance of Research and Ireland&rsquo;s attempts to establish itself as a global leader in the area of digital creativity should be encouraged. The intervening time since the close of MediaLab, has seen a shift from an emphasis on aspirational or &lsquo;non-directional&rsquo; research, the type MLE was predominantly engaged in, to more commercially focused activity.</P>
        <P>In relation to my own Department, the valuable lessons amplified by the committee&rsquo;s findings, have been factored into the contractual agreement surrounding the newly established National Digital Research Centre (NDRC). The Centre will focus specifically on translational research and commercialisation in the digital media domain and represents a global shift toward industry partnered research.</P>
        <P>With reference to the key recommendations of the report, the Government has absorbed the lessons highlighted by the Committee. In establishing the NDRC, best practice in terms of corporate governance, risk assessment as well as ensuring adequate information access and flow have all been carefully incorporated.  Similarly appropriate measures of control have been factored into legal agreements surrounding the NDRC in order to enable the State to strategically adjust the project if needed and ultimately cease financing in the event of underperformance. Payments to the NDRC will be dependent on satisfactory performance in line with pre-defined targets and deliverables.</P>

	<P>The service providers have advised my Department that just over 7,200 subscribers out of a possible 90,000 subscribers actually availed of a group broadband service. The population covered by the projects is estimated to be around 400,000 people. Grant aid amounting to &euro;5.9 million was offered to the service providers approved under the scheme. To date the service providers have claimed almost &euro;1.4 million in grant aid and this has been paid to them. My Department is constantly encouraging service providers who have not yet lodged their claims to submit them for payment. The onus of responsibility rests with the service providers in this instance. </P>
        <P>The facilitation of broadband coverage across the entire county continues to be a key priority. I am aware that, despite Government and private investment in broadband, there are areas of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  Accordingly, I recently announced a new National Broadband Scheme which will aim to provide a broadband service to these areas. This scheme, which will supersede the group broadband scheme, will, when it is fully rolled out, ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met.</P>
        <P>A Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently considering all elements of the proposed National Broadband Scheme and work on the design of an appropriate tender will commence in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 145 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s statutory mandate, as defined in Section 28(1) of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, provides that RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s radio and television services shall be made available, in so far as is reasonably practicable, to the whole community on the Island of Ireland. As such RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s statutory mandate does not extend to the provision of radio or television services to Irish communities living in Britain or elsewhere. As a consequence RT&Eacute; may not use the proceeds of the television licence fee to provide such services.</P>
        <P>However, many people living outside of the island of Ireland do enjoy access to a considerable quantity of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s television programming by way of the Internet, and to RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s radio services by way of satellite, LW and MW and the Internet. In the light of the recommendations of the Report of the Task Force on Policy regarding Emigrants to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the draft general scheme of the Broadcasting Bill as published in September 2006 proposes to amend the public service remits of RT&Eacute; and TG4 to allow for the provision and public funding of broadcasting services to Irish communities in Britain.</P>
        <P>Given the scale and scope of the draft general scheme of the Broadcasting Bill, and ongoing work under the eConsultation initiative, the Government decided to extract and progress this small element by means of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2006. The Bill as drafted entrusts RT&Eacute; with the task of considering the most appropriate technological means of addressing the needs of Irish communities abroad.</P>
        <P>In addition the Government, having finalised its legislative proposals in relation to the development of digital terrestrial broadcasting services in Ireland, decided that such proposals should also be incorporated into the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2006 which was published in December 2006 and is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I propose to introduce <Col N="1317"/>the Broadcasting Bill into the Houses of the Oireachtas in 2007 in the light of the outcome of the eConsultation process.</P>

        <P>The energy sector will make its main contribution to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the Kyoto Protocol through participation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The Government has already decided, in the context of the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s second National Allocation Plan under the scheme, that the emissions trading sector will be responsible for making approximately 3 million tonnes annual reductions in greenhouse gases out of the approximately 7 million tonnes per annum reductions needed to enable Ireland to meet its Kyoto target over the period 2008 to 2012, after existing abatement measures have been taken into account. The primary energy intensity of the economy has fallen by 35% between 1990 and 2005 reflecting the continuing improvement in the overall energy efficiency of the economy.</P>
        <P>The energy sector will continue to make a substantial contribution in reducing CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions through further energy efficiency improvements, changes in the fuel mix and significantly increased use of renewable energy delivered through Government policy measures including the recently announced Biofuels Obligation, Renewable Heat programmes and Renewable Electricity Feed-in-Tariff.</P>

        <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has lead responsibility for Government policy on meeting Ireland&rsquo;s target under the Kyoto Protocol. The energy sector will make its main contribution to meeting our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol through participation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The Government has already decided, in the context of the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s second National Allocation Plan under the scheme, that the emissions trading sector will be responsible for making approximately 3 million tonnes annual reductions in greenhouse gases out of the approximately 7 million tonnes per annum reductions needed to enable Ireland to meet its Kyoto target over the period 2008 to 2012, after existing abatement measures have been taken into account.</P>
        <P>The Government has also introduced supports designed to encourage the use of renewable energy and Combined Heat and Power at the domestic and commercial level, and we are making good progress with the development of biofuels for transport, aiming to meet our target of 5.75% by 2010.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 115 together.</P>
        <P>The telecoms market is fully liberalised and regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), which is independent in the exercise of its functions. ComReg&rsquo;s objectives include the promotion of competition and the promotion of the interests of users. In an open market, decisions about investment, the provision of telecommunications services and the development and roll-out of telecommunications technology are primarily a matter for the industry itself.</P>
        <P>As Minister with responsibility for policy in this sector, of course I welcome progress in the sector, particularly investment, innovation and competition.  However, where there has been clear market failure to provide necessary telecommunications services, the Government has acted. The Government&rsquo;s current broadband policy is to address market failure through investment in the construction of the open-access Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), part-funding rural broadband access networks under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) and laying the ground work for a National Broadband Scheme, (NBS). The NBS will supersede the GBS. When it is fully rolled out, it will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met.</P>

        <Quest> his views on whether there is a case for the licensing of small boats owned and used by fishing crewmen doing line fishing therefrom during the periods of the year when they are not employed on fishing trawlers; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[5177/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The licensing of sea-fishing boats is governed by Part 3 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003. The position is that all Irish fishing vessels engaged in commercial fishing activities are required to be licensed under the Act and entered on the Irish and EU Fishing Boat Register. Accordingly, any fishing vessel, including those using lines and operating on a seasonal basis, must be licensed and registered.</P>
        <P>It is a basic requirement of fishing boat licensing policy, reflecting mandatory EU fleet capacity policy, that a licence may only be granted for the introduction of a boat into the fishing fleet where the applicant will remove capacity (tonnage and engine power) from the Sea Fishing Boat Register which is at least equal to the capacity of the boat to be introduced. This is designed to ensure that the capacity of the fleet does not increase above current levels. Indeed these capacity levels have been identified as a serious source of concern in the recently published Cawley Report &mdash; Steering a New Course, wherein it is noted that &ldquo;a significant imbalance currently exists between the available fish resources, which can be sustainably harvested and the catching capacity of the national fleet&rdquo;. To address this imbalance the Government is providing funds of up to &euro;66 million to undertake vessel decommissioning. This reduction in the size of the Irish fleet is in addition to the decommissioning of fishing vessels undertaken in 2005 and 2006 when over &euro;16 million was spent permanently removing 36 fishing vessels from the fleet.</P>
        <P>In summary, small boats owned and used by fishing crewmen can be licensed provided they remove capacity from the Sea Fishing Boat Register equal to the capacity of the boat to be introduced. To license these vessels without removing equivalent capacity from the Sea Fishing Boat Register would be contrary to the provisions of EU Regulations. In the current reality where there is too much fishing capacity targeting too few fish, requiring the introduction of a substantial decommissioning of vessels programme, consideration of any scheme that involves increasing the size of the fishing fleet would appear to be difficult, if not impossible, to justify at national level and would appear to be totally contrary to EU policy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103, 138, 174 and 190 together.</P>
        <P>The final report of the consultants engaged to assist my Department with its review of the licensing regime governing exploration for and production of oil and gas in Ireland, was recently received by my Department. When I have considered its findings and recommendations I will bring my proposals to Government for the future of the licensing regime.</P>
        <P>As regards the Porcupine Basin Licensing Round, I announced in January that applications for the unlicensed part of the Basin will be invited in May of this year with a closing date for applications of end October. It is only at that stage that applications for specific blocks or part blocks can be assessed, leading to decisions on the award of licences in late 2007.  I also announced that in advance of that round my Department is commissioning a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) of the Porcupine Basin. The process will be similar to that used last year for the SEA of the Slyne/Erris/Donegal Basins, with the SEA being undertaken by independent expert consultants whose work will be managed by a broadly based steering group. Both the steering group and the consultants will be appointed shortly. The findings of the SEA will inform the conditions <Col N="1323"/>attaching to licences awarded under the Porcupine Round.</P>
        <P>Turning to the question of what exploration licences might be awarded in 2007 I would point out that the Celtic Sea is an open area for licensing. Accordingly, it is open to the industry to make applications for authorisations at any time. This area is treated differently because the Atlantic Margin is a frontier area with a more challenging environment and operating conditions. In response to applications received I have made two offers of authorisations recently for two new standard exploration licences in the Celtic Sea and a small number of other applications are currently under consideration. Any licence offered since the beginning of this year is being offered on the condition that the licence will be subject to any adjustment of the licensing terms that results from the current review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 110 together.</P>
        <P>The latest Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) quarterly report states there are 436,700 broadband subscribers as of the end of Quarter 3 2006, which represents a year-on-year increase of 106%. This report estimates that at the end of Quarter 3 of 2006 71% of these broadband subscribers were residential with 29% being classified as business subscribers. When, in late 2004, I set my target of 400,000 broadband subscribers by end-2006, the number of them stood at 63,600. These latest ComReg figures show that the 400,000 target was exceeded in August/September 2006. Furthermore, estimates provided to me by ComReg confirm that my challenge to industry to have 500,000 broadband subscribers by mid-2007 has been reached.</P><Col N="1324"/>
        <P>Considerable advances have been made since 2004 in the availability of Broadband. There has been a large increase in the number of companies providing broadband over a variety of technologies, including DSL, fibre, cable, leased lines, mobile broadband and satellite technology. Wireless and mobile broadband technology are continuing to improve rapidly, and the lowering of equipment prices has made this technology much more attractive of late. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain DSL connectivity and the development of Wi-Max, offers considerable potential in the future.</P>
        <P>The Broadband for Schools program, jointly funded by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of Education and Science, and the Telecommunications and Internet Federation (TIF), saw an &euro;18 million fund established to resource the provision of high-speed broadband connectivity to every primary and post primary school in the country. 96.8% of schools now have broadband access. The overwhelming majority of schools will now be able to utilise broadband as part of the education process.</P>
        <P>The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high-speed, open access, carrier neutral Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase One of this Programme has so far delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country. This Programme has been extended to more than 90 additional towns nationwide and these MANs are due for completion during 2007 and 2008. These Metropolitan Area Networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.  Complementary to the MAN networks, the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) has funded over 120 projects specifically aimed at smaller communities.</P>
        <P>However, despite Government and private investment in broadband there are parts of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. It is planned to address the question of availability of broadband to the remaining 10-15 per cent via a new scheme which, when it is fully rolled out, will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met. A Steering Group comprising representatives of my Department and ComReg are currently finalising the outline of the scheme.</P>

I expect details will be published in the revised estimates volume.</P>
        <P>While river counters have been installed on many rivers in recent years, and more will be provided, it is clear that their efficacy is far from proven in larger rivers. This is being tested at one location. That said, counters represent only one of the methods by which stocking levels are assessed. Reliance is also placed on expert analysis of catch data, surveys by fisheries officers and research officers of spawning beds, fish populations and habitats. The question of monitoring and counting is kept under constant review by the Fisheries Boards and the Marine Institute.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that last December I published regulations relating to the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme and appropriate salmon conservation bylaws governing the management of the wild salmon fishery in 2007.

        <P>I am aware of the recent decision made by a company in relation to advertising aimed at children under 12 years of age. This is of course an important issue which highlights the need for protecting the most vulnerable sector of our society from exploitation.  Section 19(1)(c) of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, provides that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland shall, upon being directed by the Minister to do so, prepare a code specifying standards to be complied with, and rules and practices to be observed, in respect of advertising, tele-shopping material, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion employed in any broadcasting service or sound broadcasting service which relate to matters likely to be of direct or indirect interest to children.</P>
        <P>The Children&rsquo;s Advertising Code drawn up by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland on foot of this legislative provision sets down measures to be complied with in such areas as endorsement of products by children, protection of children from scenes which will cause distress to them and standards in the area of advertising relating to diet and nutrition.  The Children&rsquo;s Advertising Code became fully operational on 1 January 2005. It applies to all Irish broadcasting services licensed in Ireland.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 128 and 144 together.</P>
        <P>The National Bio-Energy Action Plan, overseen by the Ministerial Bio Energy Task Force, is being finalised and will be published shortly. The Plan will set out a cohesive strategy for the development and deployment of indigenous bioenergy resources, in the electricity, heating and transport sectors. The Plan will be underpinned by existing support programmes as well as additional support necessary to realise ambitious targets up to 2020 and will fully reflect EU developments. The forthcoming White Paper on Energy Policy will support the targets and strategic approach in the Bio Energy Action Plan with the objective of delivering a fully integrated approach to the sustainable use of bioenergy resources.</P>

        <Quest> if his Department has held further meetings with its UK counterparts on the development of an east west interconnector; if a decision has been taken on the way new interconnector will be funded; if there is planning for a second interconnector; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Meetings between my Department and their UK counterparts to discuss energy matters including interconnection occur on a regular basis. The Department of Trade and Industry has been briefed on developments related to the interconnector. Both Departments are in agreement on the merits of enhanced interconnection and have undertaken to liaise closely, as necessary, as the project goes forward. I met with my Welsh colleague Minister Andrew Davies earlier this month and briefed him on progress to date in relation to the project. My Department has also briefed the European Commission on the proposal and I am pleased to note that the response of the Commission was very positive and supportive. </P>
        <P>As regards funding, the mechanism will be determined by the CER to deliver the most cost effective and efficient solution. The CER is working closely with EirGrid in its capacity as licensed transmission system operator to develop the competition to select a developer. When completed, the interconnector will be owned by EirGrid to <Col N="1328"/>ensure this strategic asset remains in public ownership.</P>
        <P>To underpin the development process, new arrangements have been put in place in respect of the construction and operation of future interconnectors in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. The Act provides that the CER may, with Ministerial consent, secure the construction of an interconnector by one or more means, including by competitive tender. Such consent will be contingent on final Government approval.</P>
        <P>In addition, the NDP includes a new Strategic Energy Infrastructure Sub-Programme which lists a number of large-scale public good energy infrastructure projects such as interconnection. While the cost of strategic energy infrastructure has traditionally been borne by the utilities, consideration will be given to the possibility of an Exchequer contribution to the cost of such investment.  Planning for decisions in relation to further interconnection with Britain or potentially with the European mainland will begin in 2010.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The strategy Steering a New Course, Strategy for a Restructured, Sustainable and Profitable Irish Seafood Industry 2007-2013, sets out a visionary road map towards achieving an Irish seafood sector that is sustainable, profitable, and most of all, truly competitive and market-focused. </P>
        <P>The strategy is based on a comprehensive report carried out by a review group made up of three eminent experts, Dr. Noel Cawley, Mr. Ruan O&rsquo;Bric and Mr. Joey Murrin, appointed in June 2006. Their report was independently drawn up following very extensive consultation with all stakeholders and analysis of the wide ranges issues and challenges facing the Seafood Industry.  Seafood Development will benefit from an investment of &euro;216 million under the new National Development Plan (NDP). A further &euro;118 million may be made available over the life of the plan depending on the willingness of the sector to undertake and cooperate with, in a verified manner, changes in the industry.</P>
        <P>The Irish seafood industry is critical for the sustainable economic and social development of coastal communities, right around the coast and further development of these marine industries is critical to the future prosperity of these areas. There is buoyant demand for seafood both domestically and in key export markets and, as <Col N="1329"/>the report strongly recommends, capturing this clear and growing economic and market opportunity is the key for all development activity within the Industry.</P>
        <P>An Implementation Group chaired by Dr. Noel Cawley and made up of representatives from each of the catching, aquaculture and processing/marketing sectors, as well as the Department&rsquo;s Seafood Policy Divisions and relevant State Agencies will be confirmed shortly.</P>

	<P>The Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2007 is primarily designed to strengthen the regulatory framework for the electronic communications sector. This is a dynamic and important sector and there were a number of complex legal issues that needed careful consideration. </P>
        <P>In addition a thorough consultation process, including both a public consultation on the draft legislative proposals and a Regulatory Impact Analysis, was undertaken.  This Bill is on the priority list of legislation for enactment by the Government, during the current term of the D&aacute;il. I expect to bring it before the House shortly.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a requirement of EU law that 4 hours notice of intention to enter port be given by any Community vessel landing herring, mackerel, horse mackerel and certain other species subject to a recovery plan and this is reflected in the authorisations issued by the Department. A similar requirement under National law applies to certain others stocks where there are particular control demands. We are obliged under EU law to put in place adequate sea-fisheries control measures to prevent over-fishing and other illegal fishing activities and in this context, I believe that 4 hours notice of entering port is not unreasonable. </P><Col N="1330"/>
        <P>I would like to re-state what I have said in response to other recent Parliamentary Questions. It is a matter ultimately for the master of each individual vessel to determine the type of fishing operation that is appropriate having regard to the capability of the vessel and the operational and navigational conditions it will have to contend with in order to participate in any given fishery. At the same time, I am satisfied that, regardless of the legal framework governing the landings of fish, whether demersal or pelagic, there are no circumstances where the control authorities would give precedence to their regulatory responsibilities over consideration for the safety of a fishing vessel or its crew.</P>

	<P>The latest Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) quarterly report states there are 436,700 broadband subscribers at end of Quarter 3 2006, which represents a year-on-year increase of 106%. Seventy-one per cent of total broadband subscribers were classified as residential subscriptions and 29 per cent were businesses. (Source: ComReg Irish Communications Market: Key Data Report &mdash; December 2006).  It is estimated that as of end of December 2006, there are well over 450,000 broadband subscribers.  ComReg commissions Teligen to produce independent price benchmarking of broadband prices in the residential market across a number of EU Member States. </P>
        <P>Ireland is ranked fifth best priced DSL package in Lowest Monthly Rental ADSL Basket &mdash; November 2006, which is currently five places less expensive than the EU average in this analysis. (Source: ComReg Irish Communications Market: Key Data Report &mdash; December 2006 p. 24.)  Ireland is ranked in ninth place in the ranking for Lowest Monthly Rental Cable and DSL Basket &mdash; November 2006, which is one place less expensive than the EU average price for this basket.

        <Quest> if he will conduct a review of the sale and resolution of all outstanding issues relating to the sale of the Whitegate refinery; the sums of money Irish National Petroleum Company received after the Whitegate sale (details supplied); the amount transferred to the Exchequer; the amounts spent by the company each year from 2001; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The business and commercial assets of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation (INPC) were sold on 16th July, 2001. The INPC received payment in full for <Col N="1332"/>these assets from the purchaser at the time of sale.  A legal undertaking, by the purchaser, and its successors, to operate the Whitegate facilities on a fully commercial basis for at least 15 years, was a critical element of the sale from the State&rsquo;s perspective. </P>
        <P>The headline payment figure was $100 million equivalent to &euro;17 million for the 2001 transaction. The net cash return arising from the transaction was considerably less than this as the INPC was obliged to utilise most of the proceeds to discharge the company&rsquo;s significant debt of &euro;88 million.  After meeting all the company&rsquo;s matured liabilities the balance of funds remaining with the INPC was in the region of &euro;30 million.</P>
        <P>The INPC paid &euro;20 million to the Exchequer in 2002. Under Company Law, the INPC must retain sufficient assets to meet potential liabilities, and therefore the payment of the remaining <Col N="1333"/>balance to the Exchequer does not arise.  The INPC retains rights and obligations under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement relating to the 2001 transaction. It is the INPC&rsquo;s responsibility to enforce any INPC rights and to defend or negotiate any claims made as and when they arise.</P>
        <P>With regard to Company expenditure I would refer the Deputy to the Annual Reports and Accounts of the INPC, laid before the Oireachtas, for the years 2001 to 2005 inclusive.  I do not propose to conduct a review of the 2001 transaction. I am satisfied that the transaction represented a favourable outcome for the State.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118, 136, 155 and 165 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  The facilitation of <Col N="1334"/>broadband coverage across the entire country continues to be a key priority. I am aware that, despite Government and private investment in broadband, there are areas of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. Accordingly, I recently announced a new scheme which will aim to provide a broadband service to these areas.</P>
        <P>This scheme will supersede the Group Broadband Scheme and will, when it is fully rolled out, ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met. A Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently considering all elements of the proposed scheme and work on the design of an appropriate tender will commence in the coming weeks. This scheme will be confined to areas of the country that are not yet served by any broadband service provider, currently thought to be 10-15% of the population.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Since coming into office I have highlighted the issue of roaming charges.  Following pressure from myself, my Northern Ireland counterpart and the regulators, all the Irish mobile phone operators introduced special tariffs to address the cost of roaming on this island.  I have strongly supported the European Commission in bringing forward proposals for a regulation on roaming. High charges for roaming within the EU represent a very clear example of a barrier to the single market.</P>
        <P>The German presidency compromise proposal is currently the subject of negotiation at EU level. My officials are playing an active role in these negotiations.  One element of the proposal is the concept of a consumer protection tariff. This would be a tariff that operators would have to make available to all customers. A ceiling would be set for the level of this consumer protection tariff. Operators would be free to charge customers below this ceiling.  While acknowledging that these issues are still under negotiation, we can support the concept of a consumer protection tariff that would provide protection to customers.</P>
        <P>My officials, through their participation in the negotiations, have been in regular contact with the commission. The relevant Commissioner who brought forward the original Commission pro<Col N="1335"/>posal is Commissioner Viviane Reding. The Commission as a whole approved the original Commission proposals.</P>

        <P>The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board has reviewed the available scientific data and has recommended that a relaxation on the bag limit could be introduced on the River Feale. I am considering the recommendation of the regional board along with advice obtained independent of the board and in the context of the clarity of the regulation if this measure was applied. I will make a decision on this matter before the angling season commences on the River Feale on 1 March.</P>

	<P>The size and scale of the post office network is a matter for the management and board of the company. The closure of individual post offices is, in the first instance, a matter for the board and management of the company and one in which I have no function.  I have, though, asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of <Col N="1337"/>the company should ensure the long-term viability of the post office network.</P>
        <P>It was to this end that the Government recently gave its approval for An Post to enter into a joint venture agreement with Belgian Bank, Fortis, to set up a retail banking business. This will entail the provision of a range of financial services operated through the post office branch network, using the An Post brand and other An Post assets. Key to the Government approval of this joint venture was that it not only offers a real opportunity for the growth and development of An Post and the post office network but that it will, in time, greatly benefit the income streams of postmasters.</P>

	<P>The telecoms market is fully liberalised and regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions.  In an open market, decisions about investment, the provision of telecommunications services and the development and roll-out of telecommunications technology are primarily a matter for the industry itself.</P>
        <P>As Minister with responsibility for policy in this sector, of course I welcome progress in the sector, particularly investment, innovation and competition.  To address identified gaps in the provision of communications infrastructure, my Department has intervened in the regions by part funding private sector infrastructure, by constructing State-owned, open access Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in cities and towns nationwide in association with the local and regional authorities and by supporting the County and Group Broadband Schemes (C&amp;GBS).</P>
        <P>Total public expenditure on telecoms infrastructure under the NDP 2000-2006 will be approximately &euro;180 million.  Phase One of the MANs programme, which involved the construction of networks in 27 towns, is now complete at a cost of approximately &euro;85 million. Phase 2 of the MANs programme involves the construction of MANs in over 90 additional towns nationwide. Construction commenced in 2006 in 23 towns in the following counties; Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Meath, Galway, Longford and Donegal. The remaining MANs under Phase II of the programme are currently on schedule to have commenced construction by the end of 2007. It is currently anticipated that all the MANs in Phase 2 will have been constructed in 2007-2008. The estimated cost for Phase 2, at present, is &euro;130 million.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, grant aid amounting to &euro;5.9 million was offered to the service providers approved under the Group Broadband Scheme. To date the service providers have claimed almost &euro;1.4 million in grant aid and this has been paid to them.  This investment in advanced communications and e-commerce infrastructure will promote the development of the Information Society through increasing the rate of broadband uptake through the availability of high-speed internet access to both enterprise and home users.</P>

We have also committed to achieving 10% market penetration of biofuels in Ireland by 2010, in line with current EU thinking in relation to 2020 targets.</P>
        <P>We have also signalled a target of 5% of Ireland&rsquo;s heating needs to be met from renewable energy sources (i.e. biomass) by 2010. The forthcoming BioEnergy Action Plan and White Paper on Energy Policy will set out our targets and strategies including development and deployment of the relevant technologies. Our initiative precedes any establishment of targets for the heating sector at EU level.</P>
        <P>A number of innovative alternative energy programmes are already in place which provide funding for the domestic, commercial, services and industrial sectors as follows: The &ldquo;Greener Homes&rdquo; domestic renewable heat grants programme is providing grants for householders for the purpose of installing renewable heating including wood biomass boilers and stoves, solar panels and heat pumps. The overall funding available for this scheme over the five year period to 2010 is now &euro;47m which includes an additional &euro;20m which I secured in Budget 2007.</P>
        <P>The Bioheat grants programme provides grants for commercial scale wood biomass boilers aimed at the business and services sectors. A sum of &euro;22 million was originally made available for this scheme to 2010 and in Budget 2007 a further &euro;4 million was added to the programme, which is now being expanded to include solar and other <Col N="1342"/>renewable technologies, and to allow community and voluntary groups to avail of the grants.</P>
        <P>The &euro;11 million Combined Heat and Power grants programme is providing funding for the commercial sector to switch to more efficient electricity and heat generation. In addition to these funding measures, a number of other financial initiatives have been introduced: In November 2006 I announced sixteen successful biofuels projects under a five-year excise relief programme for biofuels, valued at over &euro;200m. The programme builds on a pilot initiative rolled out in 2005, in which eight biofuels projects were granted excise relief over a two-year period. In June 2006, I launched the Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff which is providing a fixed feed-in-tariff for renewable electricity over a fifteen year period.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 171 together.</P>
        <P>The take up of broadcasting services in Ireland is as follows: an estimated 29% of Irish TV households receive free to air analogue services only; 31% of Irish TV households subscribe to satellite services; 22% of Irish TV households subscribe to analogue cable/MMDS services; and 18% of Irish TV households subscribe to digital cable/MMDS services.  Almost 50% of Irish television households receive television in a digital format from either Sky Digital or from cable/MMDS companies such as ntl and Chorus.</P>
        <P>In addition to the estimated 29% of TV households which receive free-to-air analogue only, up to 90% of households use analogue free-to-air terrestrial television on at least one television set. The future roll-out of Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) will be particularly important for these households, given that the European Commission has proposed a switch-off date of 2012 for <Col N="1343"/>analogue television services across Europe. DTT roll-out will impact positively on these households, resulting in a greater choice of channels and services available free-to air, in addition to improved picture quality.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently running a DTT Pilot project, which is expected to encourage stakeholder and public interest in DTT and to provide insight into the issues associated with the roll-out of a national DTT system and the potential impact on the analogue television network.</P>
        <P>In tandem with the DTT Pilot, the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill recently published by my Department seeks to put in place a flexible framework for the licensing of DTT into the future. The Bill provides for the use of multiplexes by both public service and commercial broadcasters and for the transmission of both digital television services and digital sound broadcasting services.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Bill provides a mechanism by which a date for future analogue switch-off can be considered, in light of the extent of DTT roll-out already achieved. In any digital switch-over, viewers need to receive appropriate information. Government as well as broadcasters will have a key role in informing all households of the changes required, including replacement of reception equipment, for successful switch-over from analogue to digital services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The economy and society overall, require that energy supply meets the demands of Irish consumers, and industry at all times. In this regard, the Government recognises the views being expressed by industry and representative bodies generally, and not just recently by the IDA and ESB, concerning the adequacy of electricity generation and a number of proposed measures, including greater interconnection, aimed at enhancing security of supply for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>Security of supply in relation to electricity in Ireland is the statutory responsibility of the independent Regulator, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). The independent Transmission System Operator (TSO), EirGrid, monitors the adequacy of generation capacity over time and reports to the CER accordingly.  The <Col N="1344"/>relatively small size of the Irish electricity market underlines the need for greater interconnection as a means of enhancing security of supply, promoting competition and integrating the Irish electricity market into the wider European market.</P>
        <P>The recently published Energy Policy Green Paper &ldquo;Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland&rdquo; underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to deliver enhanced interconnection on the island of Ireland as well as with Britain as a key strategic priority. The delivery of this further interconnection will be central to improving access to new supply sources and is fully in line with the EU emphasis on physical interconnection.</P>
        <P>To facilitate the development process, the Government has provided new arrangements in respect of the construction and operation of future interconnectors in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006.  On foot of a Government decision, the CER is arranging the design of a competition to secure the construction of a single 500MW interconnector between Ireland and Wales at the earliest possible date before 2012. The interconnector will be owned by EirGrid. While work is progressing on final route selection and technical specification of the interconnector, the CER is also finalising the competition structure, working on the associated competition documentation and related contractual arrangements and going to market as soon as possible within 2007.</P>
        <P>In addition to this East West interconnector, the Government, working together with the Northern Ireland authorities, will continue to progress electricity interconnection initiatives in the context of the All-Island Energy Market. In this regard, the two transmission system operators, Northern Ireland Electricity and EirGrid, are planning a second North-South electricity interconnector which will more than double the existing cross-border electricity transfer capacity to over 600MW with an expected completion date of 2012 at the latest.</P>
        <P>While it is too early to say precisely when these projects will be completed, the CER and EirGrid are committed to providing the new interconnections by the timeline the Government has set. In this regard, the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure Act) 2006, which provides for a streamlined planning process for strategic infrastructure developments, includes special provisions designed to expedite the planning process for electricity interconnector projects.</P>
        <P>With regard to existing generation capacity, and with particular reference to the winter of 2008 to 2009, the most recent advice to me from CER and EirGrid is that there is sufficient generating capacity, both installed and planned, on the system to meet the predicted demand.  The CER advises me that this is particularly so in light of the addition of almost 550MW of new generation <Col N="1345"/>capacity in 2006, (the independent plants at Tynagh and Aughinish), the expected commissioning of a new 400MW plant in Autumn of this year (Huntstown 2) and the further development of almost 900MW of new plant in the South West by the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this assessment, the expected balance between demand and supply is being kept under consistent collective review by my Department in consultation with the CER and EirGrid. Should there be any indication that the situation regarding generation adequacy may change, the CER is charged with the responsibility of taking action to ensure that supplies of electricity are protected. I am assured by the CER that the monitoring in place will ensure that any risk to security of supply will be identified at an early stage in order to provide any precautionary actions to be taken early. The Government has indicated to CER that it believes some further capacity should be put in place over the next few years.</P>
        <P>System alerts are indicators issued by the EirGrid, as the independent TSO, to power station operators so as to encourage conservative operational practices at times of lower than usual spare generating capacity. The CER advises that the occurrence of any alerts on the system is contingent on both the level of demand, particularly over the winter, which will be determined, in part, by the weather, and the availability of plant to meet that demand. Similar to recent years, during times of peak demand, the CER anticipates that there may be times when alerts will be initiated in order to signal the appropriate actions for generators.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the CER and EirGrid that within the past calendar year (2006), there were 28 amber alerts, which represents a drop of almost 50% over the average of the previous four years. There have been two amber alerts in 2007 to date, which compares to four over the same period in 2006. There have been no red alerts experienced since August 2005.</P>
        <P>While I have been assured by the CER and EirGrid that there has been no occasion in recent years when electricity supply to customers was affected by a capacity shortfall, I am advised that they are considering additional measures that can be put in place to minimise the occurrence of instances where alerts are called for.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy knows the Government has recently appointed Dr. Noel Cawley to act as Chairman of the Seafood Strategy Implementation Group which is being put in place to oversee the implementation of the strategic report, on the seafood industry, &lsquo;Steering A New Course&rsquo;.  The report, which took on board the views of fishermen, fish farmers, processors, marketers and other stakeholders, focuses on ten core themes and outlines specific actions to be taken in order to achieve a sustainable seafood industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Implementation Group, under the guidance of Dr. Cawley, will develop a detailed implementation plan, oversee its delivery and monitor and report on the progress of its implementation over the course of the lifetime of the new National Development Plan 2007-2013.  The proposed extra &euro;118 million is an intrinsic and central part of the overall strategy. In time the allocation of these funds will be very much dependent and contingent on the ongoing and successful implementation of the different facets of the Strategic Report throughout this period towards 2013.</P>
        <P>To deliver this programme of investment, it is most important that all sectors of the fishing industry work together in a concerted and focused way. The strategic report identifies the importance of the industry in achieving success and the need for a substantial programme of change.  A restructuring of the fishing fleet through further decommissioning schemes is envisaged in tandem with a new approach to the management of quotas.</P>
        <P>Industry&rsquo;s current approach to the market and its performance within the marketplace is also highlighted as being well below that which exists in other sectors of the Irish food industry. However, the Report sees this gap in performance as an &ldquo;opportunity gap&rdquo; and urges all sectors of the fishing industry to grasp the opportunity and to fully play an active and willing part to fully maximise the development potential of the industry.</P>
        <P>The report identifies a need for serious changes in the seafood processing sector. It describes this sector currently as being fragmented, operating at significant over-capacity and generating very little profit.  The aquaculture sector is another sector seen as not yet delivering on its full potential but through changes in approach and serious engagement between the various parties its true potential can be achieved.  Enhancements in competitiveness and participation in education and training and the provision of environmental safeguards are all seen as vitally important.</P>
        <P>I am confident that there is the necessary commitment to change within the seafood industry. <Col N="1347"/>With this approach I firmly believe that the recommendations set down in the Strategic Report can and will be delivered.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 182 together.</P>
        <P>Under the NDP 2000-2006 the Government addressed the broadband infrastructure deficit in the regions by part funding private sector infrastructure, by constructing State-owned, open access Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in cities and towns nationwide in association with the local and regional authorities and by supporting the County and Group Broadband Schemes. I intend to use some of the funding secured under the current NDP 2007-2013 to complete phase two of the MANs programme.</P>
        <P>The 27 Phase One networks are complete and open for business. They have been handed over to the Management Services Entity, eNet, who manage, market and maintain the networks on behalf of the State. My Department is currently undertaking a Value for Money and policy review on this phase. This review will help to inform my decisions on future investment in the Government&rsquo;s broadband infrastructure programme and on other initiatives of benefit to the communications sector.</P>
        <P>I have also recently announced a new scheme which will aim to provide a broadband service to areas of the country that are not yet served by any broadband service provider, currently estimated to be 10-15% of the population. The scheme, when fully rolled out, will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met. Indicative <Col N="1348"/>maps are being prepared to help inform the tendering process. It would not be appropriate to estimate the cost of this scheme as the services will be procured under a tendering process.</P>

        <P>The generally accepted definition of a postcode is a unique, universal identifier that unambiguously identifies the addressee&rsquo;s locality and assists in the transmission and sorting of mail items.  The introduction of a postcode system in Ireland would assist with improving efficiencies in the sorting and delivery processes for postal items and would also help facilitate new entrants to the market, should the EU postal market be liberalised in the future. Ireland is one of the few developed countries that does not have a postcode. The introduction of postcodes would also deliver many benefits outside the postal sector.</P>

	<P>I have strongly pushed for the use of new technologies that would strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s capabilities to monitor and control fishing activity, including giving the Naval Service access to catch levels of vessels in advance of boardings. In this regard, Ireland has been at the forefront in pushing for the introduction of electronic logbooks and I have worked closely with the EU Commission on the early adoption of their proposal. Council Regulation 1966/2006 on the electronic recording and reporting of fishing activities, and as a means of remote sensing, was adopted late last year.</P>
        <P>The two main provisions of the Regulation are: to oblige fishing vessels to record and submit their logbooks, transhipment declaration or their landing declarations electronically, at least once a day, with the first sales notes also being electronically recorded; and to require Member States to be able to monitor and locate their vessels and match this with their VMS system in order to assess the presence of fishing vessels in a particular area.</P>
        <P>This Regulation is particularly important for Ireland because of our disproportionately large European Economic Zone (EEZ) and the high level of activity by other EU vessels in our waters. The use of electronic fishing logbooks will also facilitate earlier and more accurate transmission of data, direct from the fishing vessel, rather than after the vessel returns to port as in the current manual system.</P>
        <P>Council Regulation 1966/2006 which lays down an overall framework for the introduction of electronic recording and reporting of fisheries activities. The Commission is working on the detailed implementing rules which will be discussed with the Member States shortly. The date of implementation is dependant on these detailed rules being adopted. Ireland is pressing for as early a date as possible in order to give ourselves access to this useful control tool.  Electronic logbooks will be mandatory for: vessels over 24 metres in overall length 24 months after the implementing rules come into force; and vessels between 15 and 24 metres 42 months after the implementing rules come into force.</P>
        <P>The introduction of these new provisions are, I am convinced a major step forward in giving the control authorities tools to effectively address <Col N="1350"/>illegal fishing and the non-recording and misreporting of landings.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The role of Government is to implement regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of affordable, high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</P>
        <P>The Government has recognised, however, that a lack of investment by the private sector in the necessary telecommunications infrastructure has acted as an impediment to the speedy rollout of competitive, affordable broadband services in Ireland, principally in the regions.</P>

	<P>I have no function in this matter. Matters relating to post office closures are for the board and management of An Post. However, I have asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long-term viability of the post office network.</P>
        <P>It was to this end that the Government recently gave its approval for An Post to enter into a joint venture agreement with Belgian Bank, Fortis to set up a retail banking business.

        <P>In order to broaden the discussion on the future of the network, I appointed Mr. Eamonn Ryan to act as facilitator between the Irish Postmasters&rsquo; Union and An Post to identify issues of mutual concern, including the possibility of an exit package, and plot a roadmap for their resolution.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and Quotas for 2007 were agreed by the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers on 21 December, 2006 following two days of tough negotiations. They were in my view very positive from an Irish viewpoint and were generally welcomed by the Irish Fishing Industry. The primary aim entering the negotiations was to ensure that <Col N="1353"/>all Irish fishermen will have the maximum possible quantity and range of fishing possibilities that can be justified on a sustainable basis, available to them in 2007.</P>
        <P>A total package of almost 200,000 tonnes of fish was secured for the Irish fishing industry for 2007. I would emphasise in particular the important increases in quota secured in key high value species such as monkfish (+7%), hake (+20%), haddock (+23%) and prawns (+17%). Irish fish landings deliver approximately &euro;230 million directly to fishermen in our coastal communities each year. The increased quotas delivered at the December, 2006 Council will add some &euro;20 million to this figure, resulting in a total projected value of &euro;1/4 billion in seafish being landed around the coast in 2007.</P>
        <P>Each year a balance must be struck between the necessity to protect and preserve the fish stocks in our waters for future generations and the socioeconomic need to support the 12,000 people in our vulnerable coastal communities, who are dependent on the seafood sector to provide them and their families with a livelihood. I believe that this was successfully achieved on this occasion.</P>
        <P>In relation to the suggestion for a review of Member States shares of stocks, the situation is that during the full review of the Common Fisheries Policy, which was completed in December 2002, there was no support for any change or review of allocation shares. Almost all, if not all, of the key commercial stocks in EU waters have been allocated between Member States. The percentage shares held by each Member State have generally remained the same for over 20 years under the principle of relative stability. The practical reality is that to achieve an increase in Ireland&rsquo;s share of TACs, other Member States would have to take a cut in their share. This is all the more difficult to achieve when TACs of all the main commercial species are falling and the reality is that achieving a qualified majority for such an outcome at the Fisheries Council is not deliverable. I therefore see little value in the proposal from the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Illegal fishing practices by all fishing fleets in Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone are and have been a matter of ongoing and substantial concern to me. Illegal practices militate against the protection of our fisheries resources, and their exploitation in a sustainable way into the future. At last November&rsquo;s Fisheries Council agreement was reached on an EU Regulation on Electronic Recording and Reporting of fishing activity and on a means of remote sensing of fishing vessels. The new measures oblige fishing vessels to record and submit their logbook by electronic means at least once a day to the control authorities.</P>
        <P>I secured a commitment from the Commission that it will work to ensure that the information will be available to coastal Member States without delay in order to strengthen controls at sea. <Col N="1354"/>The Regulation also allows remote sensing to be used to detect and track fishing vessels. The Commission is bringing forward detailed rules setting out the means of recording and reporting the information.</P>
        <P>I believe that the new control measures will substantially strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s ability to monitor and control all fishing activity within its Exclusive Fisheries Zone. This measure is particularly important to Ireland because it will give the Naval service access to catch data of all vessels operating within our Zone and strengthen their ability to target fishing vessels whose catch records would not appear to correspond to the profile of their fishing activity as determined by the vessel monitoring system. In addition, the introduction of remote sensing will help address fishing vessels eluding monitoring by switching off their VMS system.</P>
        <P>Since my appointment I have worked at EU level to deliver a level playing field on control. These measures are vitally important if we are serious about control and ensuring that all fishing vessels fully record and report on their catch levels. I have consistently raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns on the need for a level playing field across the EU with Commissioner Borg and I will continue to do so.</P>
        <P>The recently established EU Community Fisheries Control Agency will help to improve co-operation and co-ordination between the control authorities of member states. Our Control Authorities and our Naval Service are enhancing their monitoring and inspection systems, with upgraded communications systems, greater co-ordination between agencies and the appointment of additional inspection staff at our ports. The new Sea Fisheries Protection Authority which came into being on 1 January, 2007 will further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to monitor and control illegal fishing activities in Irish waters.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 151 and 179 together.</P>
        <P>On 6 February 2007, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) issued an authorisation to the ESB to construct a new generating unit at Aghada, setting out the conditions applying to ESB&rsquo;s establishment and operation of the unit. This was preceded by a Memorandum of Understanding on 29th November 2006, between the CER and the Company. Details of the authorisation are available on the CER&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The fulfilment of measures agreed between ESB and the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) in relation to the licensing of a new power station at Aghada is principally a matter between the regulator and the company and not one in which I have a function.  However, I should point out that, as required under the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act, 1982, ESB submitted details of the capital expenditure proposals for the building of the new unit for my approval. I issued my approval in a letter to the Chairman on 28 December, stipulating that it was strictly contingent on compliance with all the terms and con<Col N="1356"/>ditions accompanying the authorisation by the CER.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Government Decision to ring-fence the output, the precise methodology as to how this is to be implemented is to be the subject of detailed discussion between my Department and the CER in the very near future, in the context of regulatory arrangements for the Single Energy Market.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My decision to supersede the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) with the new National Broadband Scheme (NBS) was based on the following factors.</P>
        <P>Firstly, rollout of a GBS project depended on the local community taking the initiative. Without local initiative, a project could not proceed. Under the NBS, the selected Service Provider(s) <Col N="1357"/>will be required to meet all reasonable requests for broadband by a specified date.  Additionally, the NBS will deliver a service in all areas that are currently unserved, provided the cost of meeting the request is reasonable. It would not be appropriate to implement competing schemes targeting unserved areas.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the uptake of the GBS was less than anticipated. Just over 7,200 subscribers out of a possible 90,000 subscribers actually availed of a GBS broadband service. The population covered by the GBS schemes is estimated to be around 400,000 people. While most of the GBS projects that were rolled out were very effective the relatively low number of subscribers did not meet expectations and a more effective scheme is now required.</P>
        <P>Finally, if both schemes were allowed to run simultaneously each could undermine the effectiveness of the other. Simultaneous running of both schemes could also give rise to double subsidisation.</P>
        <P>For these reasons, I decided to proceed with the NBS. Accordingly, there will not be any new call for proposals under the GBS. Grant aid amounting to &euro;5.9 million was offered to the service providers approved under the group broadband scheme. To date the service providers have claimed almost &euro;1.4 million in grant aid and this has been paid to them. The onus of responsibility rests with the service providers to lodge their claims for payment.</P>
        <P>The broadband projects established with grant aid assistance under the group broadband scheme are commercial projects. The continued delivery of broadband is a day-to-day operational matter for the broadband service providers who operate in a fully liberalised telecommunications market regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</P>
        <P>The group broadband scheme was essentially a demand-led scheme. I must record the great work done by local communities and the Regional Coordinators in raising the awareness of broadband and helping service providers target those areas of demand.  The facilitation of broadband coverage across the entire country continues to be a key priority. I am aware that, despite Government and private investment in broadband, there are areas of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. Accordingly, the new National Broadband Scheme will aim to provide a broadband service to these areas. This Scheme will, when it is fully rolled out, ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met.</P>
        <P>A Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently considering all elements of the proposed scheme and work on the design of an appropriate tender will commence in the coming weeks. This scheme will be confined to areas of the country that are not yet <Col N="1358"/>served by any broadband service provider, currently thought to be 10-15% of the population.</P>

	<P>A National Consultation on the EU Maritime Green Paper was launched on 31 January by my colleague, Deputy John Browne. In addition to the usual press release and newspaper advertisements in national and local and press, Minister of State Browne has written to over 250 individuals and organisations inviting them to participate in the consultation process. A dedicated website has also been set up to facilitate responses.</P>
        <P>Interested parties have been asked to submit their views by 2 March.

Commissioner Borg will be in attendance at the conference and will deliver the keynote speech.</P>
        <P>In tandem with this process an inter-departmental committee has been established to oversee the national consultation and to prepare a Government position on the Green Paper once the views of interested parties have been received. It is intended to draft this Government position during the month of March to facilitate a timely response to the European Commission in April.</P><Col N="1360"/>
        <P>The Green Paper cuts across a range of sectors and issues including maritime transport, industry, coastal regions, energy, fisheries, aquaculture, the marine environment and socioeconomic cohesion. It represents a significant challenge but also an important opportunity for Ireland and the EU to apply new strategies and innovative thinking for the wider marine sector. Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the formulation of the Green Paper has been referred to, on a number of occasions, by Commissioner Borg and is referenced in the Green Paper itself. Specifically the EUROCEAN Conference held in 2004 during the Irish Presidency, which culminated in the &ldquo;Galway Declaration&rdquo;, is cited as influencing the Green Paper&rsquo;s message of the imperative of sustainable development of the oceans and seas.</P>
        <P>As an island nation with over 220 million acres of maritime territory I think it is vitally important that Ireland continue to play a key role in development of maritime policy in the EU. As part of this process Minister John Browne and I are committed to overseeing a well-run public consultation and the formulation of well thought out position paper for submission to the European Commission.</P>

	<P>My primary Ministerial responsibility in relation to biofuels is in the energy context and consequently in the production of biofuels to increase penetration in the transport sector. While I have no specific responsibility for the production of petrochemicals for industrial processes, I am aware that second-generation biomass conversion technologies could, over time, provide a suitable fuel and product for both sectors.</P>
        <P>I am giving major priority to the accelerated development of Energy Research, Technology Development and Innovation to underpin energy policy goals including bioenergy development and deployment. The development this year of a comprehensive Energy Research Strategy 2008-2013 overseen by the Irish Energy Research Council will set out the overall priorities.</P><Col N="1362"/>
        <P>The recently announced Charles Parsons awards included funding for biomass-related research at four Universities on the island. Under this programme funding of almost &euro;12 million is being provided to four Universities on the island of Ireland for the purposes of accelerating research in a number of energy related areas including biomass. This research will give us valuable information under Irish climatic conditions which will inform policy in relation to the optimisation of land use for biomass purposes.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) is also supporting research work in second generation technologies through, for example, grant aid to an Irish University which is involved in an EU FP6 project investigating Biomass-to-Liquid (BTL). In BTL, biomass is converted to synthesis gas through gasification and the synthesis gas can be subsequently transformed to liquid fuel.</P>
        <P>The emphasis on the production of ethanol in the Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme II supports the building of expertise in ethanol production in Ireland. This could have long term benefits for the production and blending of second generation biofuels which use similar but more complex technologies and processes. There were eleven applications received under the bioethanol category in the second MOT relief scheme and four of these were successful in being awarded excise relief up to 2010. This will allow for the production of 306m litres of bioethanol up to 2010.</P>
        <P>As a contracting party to the International Energy Agency (IEA) Bioenergy Implementing Agreement, Ireland has signed up to participate in Task 39 which deals with developments in Liquid Biofuels, and particularly second-generation technology.  Ireland has also signed up as an observer to the new IEA Bioenergy Implementing Agreement Task 42 which deals specifically with biorefineries. These international linkages position us well to monitor and benefit from international developments in this field and to identify appropriate applications for the Irish context.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 and 189 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications infrastructure, including backhaul connectivity is primarily a matter for the industry itself.  However, my Department is currently reviewing the availability of competitively priced backhaul to existing and future Metropolitan Area Networks (MANS).  All construction on the 27 towns under Phase I of the MANs was completed by the end of 2005. The total cost for Phase 1 is &euro;85 million.</P>
        <P>Phase 2 of the MANs programme involves the construction of MANs in over 90 additional towns nationwide. Construction commenced in 2006 in 23 towns in the following counties; Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Meath, Galway, Longford and Donegal. The remaining MANs under Phase II of the programme are currently on schedule to have commenced construction by the end of 2007. It is currently anticipated that all the MANs in Phase 2 will have been constructed in 2007-2008. The estimated cost for Phase 2, at present, is &euro;130 million.</P>
        <P>The intention of the MANs is to provide high speed fibre optic network infrastructure. Large numbers of drop connections to potential customers were built into the designs of the various MANs. All 27 MANs under Phase I of the programme have been handed over to the Management Service Entity (MSE), E-Net, which secured the concession agreement to manage, maintain, market and operate the MANs on behalf of the State. The issue of connections to the MAN is primarily an operational issue for the MSE.</P>

        <QRef>[5423/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 2000, the State has invested close to &euro;93.75 million in developing the Digital Hub. That sum comprises of an initial investment in property purchase of &euro;73.64 million for circa 9 acres in the Thomas Street/Liberties area of Dublin. State of the art telecommunications infrastructure investment came to &euro;2.29 million. </P>
        <P>The remainder of the amount is made up of operational expenditure. The Agency received Exchequer assistance in order to meet its performance targets. Since 2000 the Agency has received &euro;15.3 million from the State to cover operational costs.  Total private sector investment in the Agency has amounted to EUR &euro;3.4 million. Additional investment has been, and continues to be, undertaken by firms who choose to locate in the Hub. Exact details of those investments are not available.  Estimates suggest that the Global Digital Media industry will be worth at least EUR &euro;1.1 trillion by 2009, representing growth of more than 53% in the period.</P>
        <P>Currently in Ireland there are between 400-500 companies operating in the digital media space, employing almost 3,500 people. In 2003 there were few foreign owned digital media companies in Ireland. Today 20% of the Digital Hub cluster of digital media companies are foreign owned.  In terms of a return from an economic perspective, these figures are testament to the fact that the Digital Media industry offers huge potential for contributing to enterprise development and creating high value employment in Ireland.</P>
        <P>With respect to a monetary return, &euro;118 million was received for the acceptance of tenders for two separate sites in the Digital Hub area. In return for the land, the State will receive a combination of &euro;72.4 million in cash and &euro;45.7 million in high quality offices, which will accommodate digital enterprises as the Digital Hub grows.  This represents a positive return to the State for its initial investment.  This land is to be developed as a mixture of residential, commercial and retail properties, in addition to public spaces. The private developers competed on the basis of bids of cash plus office space. The break down of the tenders means that the Digital Hub will receive over 150,000 square foot of office space by 2012.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that in order to accommodate the scaling of its learning, research and incubation activities, the Hub will require up to 250,000 square feet. The additional space will be derived from the development of the Agency&rsquo;s owned and retained properties.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Europe presented by the Commission last October sets out a comprehensive range of proposed policies and measures aimed at realising at least 20% savings in EU energy consumption by 2020. The overall thrust of the Plan was endorsed by EU Energy Ministers in November last. </P>
        <P>The objective is to deliver for Europe energy efficient infrastructure, buildings, appliances, processes, transport and energy systems. Energy efficiency has the potential to be the most effective and economical means of delivering on the challenge of reducing Europe&rsquo;s dependence on energy imports, reducing energy demand and reducing CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  The Plan sets out 10 priority actions for transport, built environment power generation, economic sectors and individual consumers. The actions are underpinned by a programme of 57 measures which the Commission will progressively propose to Council and Parliament up to 2012.</P>
        <P>It is essential that we have effective synergies between National Energy Efficiency Action Plans and action at European level. I have made clear that Ireland&rsquo;s ambitious approach to energy efficiency will fully reflect and underpin the comprehensive European Action Plan. An Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Ireland is being finalised by my Department working with SEI and other relevant Government Departments. I intend to publish the Plan for consultation in April.</P>
        <P>I launched the national energy efficiency awareness campaign, the Power of One, in September 2006. The campaign involves: Building awareness of the types and sources of energy we use; raising awareness of the impact of inefficient use of energy in terms of increased costs to the user, the economy and the environment; informing and empowering the general public on best practices in terms of saving energy at home and at work; targeting individual sectors (e.g. industry, SMEs, schools, the public sector, the transport sector) with specific energy saving strategies; and building on existing programmes and initiatives on the island of Ireland and taking full account of EU developments.</P>
        <P>To date &euro;3 million has been spent on the campaign which includes the development of 8 television commercials last autumn which are airing up to June of this year, 7 radio advertisements running over the same period, an extensive press campaign to complement TV and radio, an on-<Col N="1368"/>line presence through www.powerofone.ie, media space and consultancy fees, as well as regional and sectoral modules. The campaign has also benefited from the involvement of EirGrid as well as ESB, BGE and other energy suppliers.</P>
        <P>The reach of the Power of One campaign has been very significant with follow up research showing the television advertisements airing a total of 3,298 times with 84% of all individuals having seen the ads at least 5 times and the average frequency being almost 20 times. Similarly, follow up research shows the radio message has been heard at least 5 times by 81% of all individuals, average frequency being up to 23 times. Tailored energy efficiency messages in the national press have reached almost 2.5 million people with a further 1.5 million in the consumer press. The outdoor campaign has been seen by 948,000 individuals with advertisements featuring in 190 sites across the country. The Power of One message has also been seen by over 2 million people in cinemas nationwide. The dedicated website www.powerofone.ie has been visited by over 35,000 people and over 25,000 information packs have been despatched from our mailing centre. The majority of the population has been exposed to sustained energy efficiency messages and advice over the past 5 months.</P>
        <P>I will shortly be launching Power of One Street which will track the energy usage of 8 families from all over the country. Each month the participants will be set a challenge to improve their energy efficiency and their progress will be monitored and reported on over the next 6 months. This initiative will drive home to everyone the simple changes that can be made to improve their energy efficiency and save on energy costs. Progress of the Power of One Street will be featured in media nationwide throughout the coming months.</P>
        <P>As a key benchmark for the impact of the campaign, a quantitative questionnaire was developed at the inception of the initiative. This is designed to track attitudes and awareness to energy efficiency. This questionnaire was included in a nation wide study of 1,095 adults conducted across 60 sampling points around the country. Quotas are set on gender, age, social class and region to ensure it correctly reflects the demographics of the population. The next phase of this survey begins in the coming weeks and will be run again in July and October this year and in February and June 2008. The objective is to benchmark the overall awareness of the Power of One campaign and of energy efficiency and to generally measure the impact the campaign is having on individuals across society. Work is also underway to develop and enhance metrics for energy usage by consumers, large industry and SMEs.</P>
        <P>Ongoing monitoring and measurements of energy demand undertaken by EirGrid and data collected by SEI will inform ongoing quantifi<Col N="1369"/>cation of energy demand reduction.  One useful immediate indicator of the effectiveness of an awareness campaign was the RTE radio programme, Mooney Show in association with the Power of One and EirGrid on Friday 19th January last. This programme featured intensive, practical and informative coverage on energy conservation, the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and demand management issues including avoiding the electricity rush hour (5-7pm) and more efficient lighting. EirGrid has advised that there was a noticeable flattening of demand, during the programme, amounting to approximately 3 megawatts which is the equivalent of 30,000 people all switching off one average 100-watt light bulb.</P>
        <P>Energy Efficiency and energy saving strategies are a key priority for the Government and this will be reflected in the forthcoming White Paper on Energy Policy which will be underpinned by the National Action Plan on Energy Efficiency.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that developments to date in the energy sector are insufficient to meet required targets in terms of energy self-sufficiency here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware that Ireland is subject to any targets for energy self-sufficiency. According to figures published by Sustainable Energy Ireland, in 2005 Ireland was dependent on imports for 90% of its energy needs. This reflects the fact that while it is estimated that there are significant hydrocarbon reserves offshore Ireland that there have only been four commercial discoveries to date. </P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this situation, the Government is pursuing a range of policies which will maximise our energy self-sufficiency to the greatest practical extent. We will reach our target of 15% of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 and have proposed a 30% target for 2020. The recent construction of two new peat fired power stations will ensure continued use of peat in our fuel mix until 2020 at least.  When Corrib gas comes to market it will meet a large proportion of our needs for some time, but in the longer run we are likely to remain reliant on gas imports in the absence of further significant discoveries of gas offshore.</P>
        <P>Oil accounted for 57% of our energy needs in 2005, primarily for the transport and heat sectors. In this context the Government has introduced supports designed to encourage the use of renewable energy and Combined Heat and Power at the domestic and commercial level, and we are <Col N="1370"/>making good progress with the development of biofuels for transport, aiming to meet our target of 5.75% by 2010.</P>
        <P>While the Government will continue to develop policies and actions aimed at increasing our security of supply, it would not be realistic to expect that Ireland would become totally energy self-sufficient in the foreseeable future. However, the actions described here will lead to increased fuel diversity using domestically available fuel and energy sources.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Following difficult and intensive negotiations with the EU Commission, the EU Management Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture supported a proposal from the European Commission for partial paybacks by Ireland over a six year period for mackerel illegally landed by large Irish trawlers into Scotland in the years 2001-2004. </P>
        <P>The pay back arrangements finally secured achieved my objectives. These objectives were to: minimise the impact of the quota deductions on the majority of fishermen who had little or nothing to do with the illegal fishing; set the reductions at reasonable levels (A reduction of almost 9,000 tonnes was secured on the amount outstanding); and spread the reductions over 6 years.</P>
        <P>The deal secured will result in a manageable 6.7% reduction in the national mackerel quota this year.</P>
        <P>The discussions dealt with how the 34,802 tonnes of mackerel reported as landed illegally into Scotland by Irish vessels in the 2001-2004 period, equivalent to 64% of Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota for 2007, should be paid back. I worked hard to secure a deal that would avoid irreparable damage to the fleet and the fish processing factories in Ireland dependent on this important fishery. I explained to the Commission that it was national policy that those involved in the reported illegal landings should bear the responsibility for the situation and that if deductions were imposed to the national quota at too high a level or over too short a period this would have a devastating effect on vessels which were not implicated in the illegal landings and on factories in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The opening of the mackerel fishery for the large Refrigerated Seawater Tanks (RSW) Pelagic vessels was delayed until the negotiations with the EU Commission were completed and the details of the arrangements were agreed. The opening of the fishery for this fleet at the beginning of the year in advance of the negotiations being finalised could have compromised the implementation of the policy that the vessel owners reported as having landed the undeclared mackerel are held responsible for their actions. In these circumstances I considered that it was in the interests of those not implicated in the undeclared landings to delay opening the fishery until the terms of the pay back arrangements were agreed.</P>
        <P>I would also point out that the delay in the opening of the fishery is likely to have substantially benefited processors in Ireland. Mackerel is found in Norwegian waters at the beginning of the year and migrates south towards the waters off Ireland from mid to late January. The late opening has supported higher levels of landings into Ireland, so far this year some 82% of the <Col N="1373"/>mackerel landed has been into Ireland for processing here. Last year when the fishery was opened from the 1st of January, only 64% of the mackerel caught during January and February was landed into Ireland.</P><?oasys _cl11.5- ?>

	<P>The operation of An Post is a matter for the board and management of the company. The precise number of post offices is a matter in the first instance for the board and management of the company and one in which I have no function. </P>
        <P Just="Left">As clearly set out in the Programme for Government, it is the Government&rsquo;s objective to maintain the largest economically sustainable post office network possible. Notwithstanding the commercial remit of An Post, there is a clear Government recognition of the social benefits of maintaining the nationwide post office network. The challenge for all stakeholders in An Post is to generate sufficient profitable business to maintain the network at its current size. Management at An Post are aware of Government policy on this matter.</P>
        <P>I have asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long-term viability of the post office network. It was to this end that the Government recently gave its approval for An Post to enter into a joint venture agreement with Belgian Bank, Fortis, to set up a retail banking business. This will entail the provision of a range of financial services operated through the post office branch network, using the An Post brand and other An Post assets. Key to the Government approval of this joint venture was that it not only offers a real opportunity for the growth and development of An Post and the post office network but that it will, in time, greatly benefit the income streams of postmasters.</P>

	<P>The future provision of postal services will be, in the first instance, a matter for An Post and other service providers. </P>
        <P>With respect to mail services, I believe that there will continue to be a key national role for An Post in delivery of mails and parcels. <Col N="1375"/>However, over the coming years, competition can be expected to increase in these sectors, whether from the privately owned express sector, from the large European public operators now looking for international business or from electronic substitution.</P>
        <P>Liberalisation of the mail market in Ireland has already commenced and the Commission&rsquo;s draft third Postal Directive proposes that the postal sector is to fully liberalise across the EU on 1 January 2009 subject to political agreement. The draft directive is currently being discussed at Council.</P>
        <P>Therefore, in terms of dealing with the challenges facing An Post in the coming years, company management in conjunction with the trade unions, must deliver on restructuring agreements particularly in the mails area.</P>
        <P>The development of the postal market requires the availability of competitive, high quality products. The current level of market opening has introduced new players with offerings that meet consumer needs and further market opening will provide further opportunities for new and existing players. The development of further competition allied with a modernised and customer-focussed An Post will provide the basis for the further development of the postal sector here.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Department received notification from its scientific advisers, the Marine Institute, on October 27th 2006, of a possible positive test for Bonamia ostreae in Lough Swilly. Bonamia osteae is a disease which affects oysters, but consumption of oysters affected by the disease has no human health impacts. Following the Marine Institute notification, as a precautionary measure, it was decided that any applications made to move native oysters and other shellfish susceptible to Bonamia ostreae originating in Lough Swilly for on-growing in areas free of the disease would be refused.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When results of tests on samples forwarded to the Community Reference Laboratory, La Tremblade, France, confirmed the initial suspicion on <Col N="1376"/>15 November 2006, this ban on movements of susceptible species from Lough Swilly to Bonamia free areas was made permanent. Lough Swilly was formally designated as a Non-Approved Zone for the parasite Bonamiaostreae.</P>
        <P>On December 3rd 2006 the Department forwarded, by post, to operators in the Lough, Guidelines for the Management of Shellfish Operations in Lough Swilly. The objectives of these measures were to restrict the transmission and spread of the parasite Bonamia ostreae within the native oyster stocks in Lough Swilly and to prevent the transmission and spread of the parasite from native oyster stocks in Lough Swilly to other bonamia free areas. Incorporated within the Guidelines is the requirement that all fishing boats operating in Lough Swilly must be cleared of all shellfish and decks, holds, dredges and equipment must be cleaned with freshwater prior to their leaving the Lough, for a Bonamia free zone. However, the Guidelines do not affect the harvesting of molluscan shellfish from Lough Swilly for human consumption.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 to 194, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">By its very nature, the internet lends itself to being used for a wide range of criminal activities. This can include illegal pornography, racist or hate materials, financial fraud, intimidation or any other criminal activity carried out via the internet. Combating such illegal, harmful and predatory use of the internet requires a response at national, EU and wider international levels. The internet is an international and world-wide phenomenon with no borders and no single organisation controlling it. Measures to combat illegal materials and activities on the internet are, therefore, hampered by a multiplicity of jurisdictions, differing legal systems, and differing societal norms. Furthermore, new developments in communications technologies allowing for internet access by new means are a regular occurrence. These are largely positive developments but also bring particular challenges for those charged with protecting against the downsides of the internet.</P>
        <P>A combination of responses, and the co-operation of all the stakeholders, at both national and international level &mdash; legislators, law enforcement, schools, child protection practitioners, parents and guardians &mdash; is essential. My Department is fully committed to playing its part in a pro-active way.</P>
        <P>In terms of legislation, in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, Ireland has one of the most robust pieces of legislation anywhere. Under the Act, the possession, distribution, importation and exportation or sale of all forms of child pornography &mdash; films, video or material in written or auditory form including material produced or transmitted via the internet &mdash; are offences with penalties of up to 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment. Mere possession of child pornography can be punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 <Col N="1378"/>years. Using a child or allowing a child to be used for the production of child pornography is also punishable by up to 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</P>
        <P>The EU Council adopted a Framework Decision on Combating the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornography on 22 December 2003. While the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 is a particularly robust legislative measure, this Framework Decision requires some relatively minor amendments to our legislation and these are contained in the Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill which is at present being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
        <P>Among the provisions of the Bill is one that prohibits the sale of children, including through a computer system, for the purpose of the sexual or labour exploitation of a child and other provisions will prohibit the sexual grooming of children, including by means of communication through the Internet.</P>
        <P>This Bill will comply fully with the criminal law requirements of the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons and the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings.  Ireland signed the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons on 13 December 2000.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that they monitor child pornography on the internet and where evidence is available action is taken in accordance with legislation.  Similarly, where evidence becomes available that the internet is used for trafficking of human beings action is also be taken to apprehend those responsible.  Other incidents of child pornography or trafficking in human beings coming to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are fully investigated and where there is evidence to support a prosecution criminal proceedings are commenced, as directed by the Law Officers.</P>
        <P>I am also informed by the Garda Authorities that staff from the Computer Crime Investigation Unit (CCIU) in the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation participate in numerous fora where crime prevention advice is given to companies and members of the public on the safe use of the internet.  The Unit provides support to the many operations by other national and local units in targeting paedophiles and others suspected of downloading child pornography in Ireland.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na attached to the National Bureau of Investigation augment these units as the volume of work requires. Computer forensics are carried out by the members attached to the Domestic and Sexual Assault Unit and also by members attached to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation utilising up-to-date forensic software.</P>
        <P>I understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in conjunction with its EU colleagues, is currently <Col N="1379"/>examining new methods of preventing the production and distribution of child pornography on the internet.</P>
        <P>On the structural side, the Government established a working Group in 1997 to examine and report on the whole question of the illegal and harmful use of the internet with particular reference to child pornography. The Report of the Working Group on the Illegal and Harmful Use of the Internet was published in July 1998. The main recommendation of the Report was for a system of self-regulation by the Internet Service Provider industry and the components of such a system were to include: an Internet Advisory Board (IAB) &mdash; established Feb 2000 &mdash; to promote awareness of Internet downside issues, co-ordinate efforts to combat child pornography on the Internet and monitor the progress of self regulation by the Internet Service Provider industry; a Public Hotline for reporting child pornography (established 1999 and funded by the industry); and an industry Code of Practice and Ethics setting out the duties and responsibilities of each Internet Service Provider (agreed February 2002 and reviewed in 2004)</P>
        <P>The Internet Advisory Board (IAB) as well as overseeing a self-regulatory regime for the Irish Internet Service Providers, encourages best practice procedures, provides advice and facilitates research in Internet-related issues including child safety.  My Department provides secretarial and other supports for the Board&rsquo;s work.  The IAB in its role of encouraging best practice, procedures and formulating advice on Internet downside issues is currently evaluating electronic technology which can be used to block access to websites on the internet and is preparing a report on the matter.</P>
        <P>The Hotline (www.hotline.ie), funded by the Internet Service Providers&rsquo; Association of Ireland with support from the EU Safer Internet Action Plan, was launched in November 1999 and has been operating since that time.  Special protocols operate between the Garda&iacute; and the Hotline that maximise co-operation on law enforcement issues so that offences in the area of child pornography can be detected and prosecuted.</P>
        <P>The Hotline works closely with, and is a founding member of, the international INHOPE Association (www.inhope.org), a network of European hotlines which is expanding to all parts of the world. The INHOPE Association develops procedures and shares information on the best practices for the tracing and tracking of illegal child pornography.</P>
        <P>International co-operation is a vital part of the fight against pornography on the internet, and Ireland is fully committed to playing its part. The Deputy may be aware that the European Union has taken a strong line on combating child pornography and other illegal and harmful uses of <Col N="1380"/>the internet.  Since 1999, under the Safer Internet Action Plan, the EU has provided financial and other supports for measures in the member states to combat illegal and harmful uses of the internet, with particular emphasis on protecting children.  A new EU action plan &mdash; Safer Internet Plus &mdash; covering the period 2005 to 2008, and with a budget of &euro;45m, was agreed under the Irish presidency in June 2004 and is now in operation.  My Department is represented on the management committee for the programme.</P>
        <P>In September 2001, the Council of Europe Ministers&rsquo; Deputies approved the first international Convention on Cybercrime. Ireland signed up to the Convention in June 2002. The main objective of the Convention is to foster international co-operation in protecting society against cybercrime. The Convention deals specifically with the distribution of child pornography on the internet, infringements of copyright, computer related fraud and violations of network security.  On 15 September 2006, I announced that Government approval had been obtained for the drafting of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  This Bill is being used to give effect to a number of international instruments including the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 2001.</P>
        <P>My Department is fully committed to co-operating with and promoting these measures nationally, at EU level and the wider international level.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 206 together.</P>
        <P>I note that the information referred to in the details supplied by the Deputy was originally sent to the Office of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and was subsequently passed on to the Criminal Investigation Department of the Police Service of Northern Ireland for their attention.</P>
        <P>As I previously informed the Deputy, I am informed by the Garda authorities that an investigation was conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the incident referred to which concluded that no crime of forgery had been committed in this jurisdiction.  The matter was reviewed in 1997 and <Col N="1381"/>2003 when the investigation file was submitted to the Law Officers, who directed no prosecution in the matter. Further documentation has been provided to the Garda&iacute; by the person referred to and this is being examined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware I have no role in the investigation or prosecution of cases.  This is a long-standing principle of our system of justice.  The role of the Garda&iacute; is to investigate alleged offences, to gather whatever evidence may be available and to submit a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The question of whether or not a particular person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence is the responsibility of the DPP.  The Director, who is independent in the performance of his functions, makes his decision on the basis of the Garda findings viewed against the background of common and/or statute law.  In the circumstances it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment further on the case.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Property Registration Authority that the information requested by the Deputy is contained in the table, and was calculated on the following basis.</P>
        <P>The total number of dealings on hands in the Property Registration Authority at 31 January, 2007 was 175,790 of which 35,364 were the subject of queries and cannot be proceeded with until a satisfactory reply is received.  The number of &ldquo;live&rdquo; cases was therefore 140,426.</P>
        <P>I can further inform the Deputy that the average waiting time has been calculated by dividing the number of dealings on hand for each county by the average number completed monthly during 2006 for that county.  The length of time taken to complete cases varies depending on a number of factors, including the complexity of the case, investigation of title requirements, the completeness of the documentation presented, mapping requirements, the volume of business being transacted, the level of resources available at any particular time and the time at which the present computerised system was introduced in the Property Registration Authority for each county. <Col N="1383"/> Where a case is urgent and this is brought to the attention of the Property Registration Authority, <Col N="1384"/>in accordance with it&rsquo;s customer service policy, the matter is dealt with expeditiously.</P><Col N="1383"/>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government <Col N="1385"/>approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have been further informed that the personnel strength (all ranks) of the Carlow-Kildare Division on 31 December, 1997 and 2006 was 281 and 367, respectively, representing an increase of 86 (or 31%) in the number of Garda personnel allocated to the Division during that period. The number of Community Garda&iacute; assigned to County Kildare on 12 February, 2007 was 6 (all ranks). Three of these Community Garda&iacute; are assigned to Naas Garda station and three are assigned to Leixlip Garda Station.</P>
        <P>I have also been informed that the Carlow/ Kildare Division&rsquo;s resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units, all of which have had increased resources.</P>
        <P>I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question was received in the Citizenship section of my Department on 6 July 2004.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  One of these conditions is that the applicant has <Col N="1386"/>had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years.</P>
        <P>In the context of determining if an applicant meets the residence requirement for naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State must be excluded. These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State, periods granted for the purposes of study and periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An examination of the file of the person concerned revealed that he did not have one year's continuous reckonable residency immediately prior to lodging his application.  He was informed of this determination on 11 December 2006.</P>
        <P>It is open to the applicant to lodge a new application if and when he is in a position to meet the statutory requirements applicable at the time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 20 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 prohibits the supply of intoxicating liquor at a reduced price during a limited period on any day.  It is intended to discourage practices which may lead to excessive consumption of intoxicating liquor, such as happy hours.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of section 20, reduced price is defined as a price less than that regularly being charged for the intoxicating liquor during an earlier period after 10.30 a.m. (12.30 p.m. on a Sunday) on the day concerned.  It does not, therefore, prohibit commercial practices such as an annual wine sale or a product promotion taking place over one or more days, as long as intoxicating liquor is not sold at a reduced price during a limited period after 10.30 a.m. on any day.  A prohibition on supplying intoxicating liquor free of charge could have unintended effects such as preventing a  wine shop operator from providing samples of wine or preventing a licensee from giving a complimentary drink to a customer at Christmas.</P>
        <P>I should say that section 22 of the 2003 Act provides for the making, should the need arise, of regulations prohibiting or restricting a licensee from doing or permitting, for the purposes of promoting the licensee&rsquo;s business or any event or activity taking place on the licensed premises, anything that is intended or likely to encourage persons on those premises to consume intoxicating liquor to an excessive extent.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are four proceedings recorded as having commenced, for the offence of supplying alcohol at a reduced rate, since 2003 &mdash; three in 2005 and one in 2006.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that with regard to such incidents recorded between 8 February to 12 February, 2007 there is no specific category on the Garda PULSE system used to record an individual offence contrary to the Liquor Licensing Acts. Many liquor licensing offences are recorded in the category and it is not possible, without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources, to provide the information requested.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 and 210 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, following a seizure of heroin in Belgium and the related arrest of three Irish nationals last year, the Revenue Commissioners initiated a review of Customs controls at Licensed Aerodromes (incl. Knock).</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their review has now been completed.  The review examined the controls, the conditions of approval and the risks, from a Customs point of view, attached to the operation of the aerodromes.</P>
        <P>It is important to note by way of context that the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the European Union. Of specific relevance are the abolition of <Col N="1389"/>routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU and the elimination of Customs controls on the baggage of intra-Community passengers other than anti-smuggling checks.  This is particularly relevant in the case of Knock Airport where passenger traffic is predominantly intra-Community.  In this context, Revenue&rsquo;s approach has of necessity been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling and enforce prohibitions and restrictions.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also informed me that Customs controls at Knock Airport are risk based and are carried out by mobile Special Compliance/Enforcement staff. Attendance by staff is selective and targeted.  It is based on analysis and evaluation of general seizure trends, traffic frequency, route and similar risk indicators. These attendances cover the full range of flights times and are kept under constant review in particular to take account of emerging smuggling trends and any traffic increase at the airport.</P>
        <P>As regards the use of detection dogs at Knock Airport, such dogs have in fact been used at this location for a number of years. The deployment of these dogs is also risk based and is kept under constant review.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners assure me that having regard to the context set out above, they are satisfied that their risk based approach remains valid and that, with the implementation of the review recommendations, their operations will be on a par with, and may even exceed, those of many other EU Member States.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I assume the Deputy is referring to the educational criteria of the stamp duty relief and the enhanced regime of stock relief for young trained farmers.  These reliefs are available to farmers who are aged under 35 and have specific agricultural training.  However, where young farmers possess certain non-agricultural third level qualifications or where they have qualified to enter the third year of a full-time third-level course of at least 3 years' duration, they can qualify under the education conditions of the relief provided they undertake Teagasc approved FETAC training in agriculture/horticulture and farm management (known as the green certificate.)</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recent Budget, however, amended the conditions of the educational qualifications of the <Col N="1390"/>young trained farmer relief, in line with changes in agricultural education being implemented by Teagasc.  From 31 March 2008, the FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate in Agriculture will become the new minimum education requirement of the relief.  This course is of 2 years' duration, however, in recognition of prior learning, young farmers who possess non-agricultural third-level qualifications will be facilitated to complete the programme in 18 months.  In this respect, the requirement to undertake 80 hours' training in farm management and 100 hours' agricultural training will be replaced by the requirement to undertake the Advanced Certificate in Agriculture.</P>

	<P>The Clonmel flood alleviation project is broken into three separate schemes.  The first scheme for implementation is the Clonmel West Scheme.  Provision has been made for the implementation of the Clonmel West flood relief scheme within the Office of Public Works budget for flood relief activities.  The documents relating to the Confirmation of the River Suir (Clonmel West) Drainage Scheme have recently been forwarded to the Department of Finance and are currently being considered.  The scheme is estimated to cost approximately &euro;16 million and is expected to be completed within 18 months of commencement.  Once the scheme is confirmed, OPW hope to commence the embankment works within a few weeks with the main contract expected to commence in the third quarter of 2007.  When construction on the Clonmel West Scheme is underway, detailed design will commence on the Clonmel North Scheme.  It is anticipated that construction of that scheme would commence on completion of the West Scheme.  Similarly, detailed design of the Clonmel East Scheme is intended to commence once construction of the North Scheme is underway.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that where vehicles are seized for failure to comply with the VRT Regulations on the use of foreign-registered vehicles in the State, the option is offered to the owner of release of the vehicle on payment of the VRT due, along with an additional penalty (normally amounting to 10% of the value of the vehicle concerned) and immediate registration of the vehicle. The vast majority of persons whose vehicles are seized for this offence opt to settle the matter in this way.  As most of the cases detected are first time offences and are non-commercial it is considered that this approach is, in general, more proportionate than prosecution.</P>
        <P>In cases where it is not possible to agree the release of the vehicle on these terms, or where there are aggravated circumstances, e.g. repeat offences, commercial transactions, obstruction or <Col N="1392"/>false plates, the owner may be prosecuted in accordance with section 139(3) of the Finance Act 1992 for unauthorised use of an unregistered vehicle.

	<P>The aim of the National Cancer Control Strategy, which was published in June 2006,  is to reduce our cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality rates relative to other Member States of the European Union.  This Government is committed to investing significantly in the implementation of the Strategy.  I have made available an additional &euro;20.5m this year for cancer control.  This is an increase of 74% on the comparable 2006 investment and includes &euro;3.5m to support the initial implementation of the HSE National Cancer Control Programme.  The Programme will manage, organise and deliver cancer control on a whole population basis.  It will have a strong emphasis on prevention and early detection, integrated across primary, hospital, supportive and palliative care.  The Service Plan of the HSE for this year sets out the detailed deliverables of the Programme.  This includes the establishment of the leadership team to implement the Programme, including the Director of the Programme and key medical leaders at network level.</P>
        <P>Evidence based population based screening programmes are an essential element of the Strategy.  I established a National Cancer Screening Service Board on 1 January this year.  It takes over responsibility for BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme.  The total allocation to the new Service is &euro;33m, a 71% increase on the funding available in 2006.  This includes &euro;8m for the roll out of the national breast screening programme to the West and South which will commence this Spring and &euro;5m to commence the roll out of a national cervical screening programme later this year.  The Service will also advise on the implementation of a national colorectal screening programme, specifically on the population to be screened, at what intervals screening should take place, and the requirements for a quality assured and well organised cost effective symptomatic service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, entitled &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, was launched in January 2006.  It recommends, inter alia, that child and adolescent mental health services should provide mental health services to all aged 0-18 years.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the individual recommendations of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; is a matter primarily for the HSE.  The HSE established an implementation group in July 2006 to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; a reality.  The HSE plan to publish a progress report and outline their proposed implementation programme for &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; in the near future.</P>
        <P>In 2006, a sum of &euro;26.2 million was provided for the development of our mental health services in line with &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;.  A further sum of &euro;25 million has been allocated for 2007 to continue this development.  A significant amount of this year&rsquo;s funding, &euro;7.95 million, is for the development of child and adolescent psychiatric services.</P>
        <P>Transitional arrangements to facilitate the expansion of current service provision were con<Col N="1395"/>sidered by a HSE forum on Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Inpatient Capacity.  The forum&rsquo;s report was published in September 2006 and accepted by the board of the HSE.  It recommended, as an interim measure pending the development of child and adolescent in-patient units, the provision of an additional 24-32 dedicated adolescent psychiatric beds, primarily for the 16 and 17 year age group, in adult facilities across the four HSE administrative areas.  Dedicated child and adolescent multidisciplinary teams will be provided for these additional beds and training will be provided for staff in the identified units.  In addition, a further 12 beds will be provided at existing child psychiatric units (6 in St Anne&rsquo;s, Galway and 6 in Warrenstown House, Dublin) for the under 16 age group.</P>
        <P>The Mental Health Commission acknowledges that the admission of children to adult units is undesirable, however, in situations where there is no available alternative, such admissions may be necessary.  The Commission has issued a code of practice relating to the admission of children under the Mental Health Act 2001.  Meanwhile, planning for four 20-bed child and adolescent inpatient units in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick is underway.</P>
        <P>The majority of children who experience mental illness do not require inpatient treatment.  Current waiting lists for child and adolescent mental health services are being validated by the HSE.  All urgent cases are prioritised for immediate assessment. Additional child and adolescent multidisciplinary teams are being provided, in line with the recommendations of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, to ensure that children have improved access to community-based mental health services.</P>

	<P>In general, local pharmacies will accept reasonable quantities of waste medicines from members of the public and will arrange to include them with out of date stock for which the pharmacist has an existing arrangement in regard to disposal.  The former Health Boards, from time to time, organised publicity campaigns urging people to return medicinal products to their local pharmacy for safe disposal and it is assumed that the Health Service Executive will continue this practice.</P>
        <P>I am aware that there are a number of issues of concern with regard to the prescription of medicines, including the issue of antibiotic use <Col N="1398"/>and the use of antidepressants in the treatment of persons with psychiatric illness.  There are a number of processes in place which are designed to ensure that medicines are prescribed and used as effectively and efficiently as possible.  Since the mid to late 1990&rsquo;s most of the major teaching hospitals operate a clinical pharmacy service and post graduate diploma and MSc courses in Clinical Pharmacy.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services.  In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.  The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs.  In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <P>The Group submitted an application for staffing grant assistance for three years under the EOCP and &euro;19,046 was approved in December 2001, towards the staffing costs for one year.  Consideration of further funding of the Group was subject to a review of progress after one year.</P><Col N="1401"/>
        <P>Drawdown of the initial grant was completed in February 2006.  The Group&rsquo;s application towards second and third year staffing grant assistance was considered by the Programme Appraisal Committee (PAC) in July 2006.  The PAC did not recommend to the Secretary-General that he further fund the project as the service had not met the original conditions of funding, the targets set or reporting requirements.  Furthermore it was not demonstrated that the service was facilitating parents to access employment, education or training.</P>
        <P>The Group subsequently requested a review of this decision.  The PAC recently reviewed the decision and having considered all information available, recommended to the Secretary-General to uphold the original decision.  The Secretary-General concurred with the recommendation of the PAC not to approve additional funding in this instance.

	<P>The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, entitled &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, was launched in January 2006.  It provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over the next 7 to 10 years.  &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; acknowledges gaps in the current provision of services for people with eating disorders and makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services.</P>
        <P>Recommendations include support for health promotion initiatives that encourage greater community and family awareness of eating disorders, the further development of primary and community care services and  the provision of a full multidisciplinary team in a National Centre for Eating Disorders for complex cases that cannot be managed by local child and adolescent community mental health teams.  Responsibility for the implementation of these recommendations rests with the HSE.</P>
        <P>In 2006, &euro;26.2 million was allocated for the development of mental health services in line with &ldquo;A Vision for change&rdquo;.  An additional &euro;25 million has been provided in 2007 to continue this development. &euro;0.75 million of this additional funding in 2007 is for the initial development of a dedicated eating disorder service in each area through a combination of reconfiguring existing services and commissioning services from agencies.</P>

	<P>Nursing home subventions are paid in accordance with the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993-2006. Sub<Col N="1403"/>ventions are paid on the basis of a means test which takes account of an individual&rsquo;s income and assets. The means test disregards the first &euro;11,000 of a person&rsquo;s assets, including assets such as savings.</P>
        <P>From the 1st January 2007, the basic rate of subvention increased to a maximum of &euro;300 per week.  In addition to this, the HSE has now finalised National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme. These were circulated to all Local Health Office subvention officers on Monday, 29th January, 2007.</P>
        <P>Under the guidelines, the assessment of means will now be carried out using a national standard financial assessment method. Furthermore, while the regulations allow the HSE to refuse a subvention where the value of a person&rsquo;s assets (excluding the home) exceed &euro;36,000, the HSE Guidelines instruct that no-one should be automatically excluded from undertaking the means assessment on this basis.</P>

	<P>The granting of permission for the construction of Offshore Windfarms is governed by the Foreshore Act 1933.  Offshore Windfarms are subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment under the Foreshore (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1990 SI 220 of 1990. These regulations transpose EU Directive 85/337/EEC (the Environmental Impact Assessment or, &ldquo;EIA&rdquo; Directive). All Offshore Windfarms are subject to this Directive.</P>
        <P>The EU Directive 2003/35/EC on Public Participation/Access to Justice, commonly known as the Public Participation Directive (Aarhus Convention) was enacted on 26 May 2003.

The PPD amends the public participation and access to justice provisions of the EIA Directive 85/337/EEC.</P>
        <P>Article 3 (7) of the Public Participation Directive places an onus on member states to provide review procedures for projects subject to Environmental Impact Assessments.

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The future of the post office network and the upgrading of post offices are a matter in the first instance for the board and management of An Post and one in which I have no statutory function.</P>
        <P>As set out clearly in the Programme for Government, this Government and the board of An Post, are committed to the objective of ensuring the continuation of a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network. It was in this context that I asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long-term viability of the post office network.</P>
        <P>The Government recently gave its approval for An Post to enter into a joint venture agreement with Belgian Bank, Fortis, to set up a retail banking business. Key to the Government approval of this joint venture was that it not only offers a real opportunity for the growth and development of An Post and the post office network but that it will, in time, greatly benefit the income streams of postmasters.</P>
        <P>With regard to the automation of post offices, the company has recently completed a pilot project in which ten smaller post offices were fully automated.  With respect to the liberalisation of postal services, I believe that there will continue to be a key national role for An Post in delivery of mails and parcels. However, over the coming years, competition can be expected to increase in these sectors, whether from the privately owned express sector, from the large European public operators now looking for international business or from electronic substitution.</P>
        <P>Liberalisation of the mail market in Ireland has already commenced and the Commission&rsquo;s draft third Postal Directive proposes that the postal sector is to fully liberalise across the EU on 1 January 2009 subject to political agreement. The <Col N="1405"/>draft directive is currently being discussed at Council.</P>
        <P>The development of the postal market requires the availability of competitive, high quality products. The current level of market opening has introduced new players with offerings that meet consumer needs and further market opening will provide further opportunities for new and existing players. The development of further competition allied with a modernised and customer-focussed An Post will provide the basis for the further development of the postal sector here.</P>

	<P>The electronic communications market is of key importance to the national economy and is a significant factor in determining national economic competitiveness. The regulation of this industry is the responsibility of the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg in accordance with the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 and the Regulations transposing the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications. ComReg&rsquo;s objectives include the promotion of competition and the promotion of the interests of users.</P><Col N="1408"/>
        <P>As Minister for Communications, I have responsibility for overall telecoms policy. My objective has been to facilitate an open and competitive market, with the range and quality of services available to consumers that befits a modern economy like ours.  The electronic communications market is dynamic and ever evolving, and while the market has been liberalised for some time, there is always room for improvement.</P>
        <P>The primary tool available to me to do this is legislation. The current EU regulatory framework is being reviewed by the European Commission and my officials and I are fully engaging in this process. In addition, the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill, which was published this month, is primarily designed to strengthen the regulatory framework for the electronic communications sector. The Bill will enable ComReg to better achieve one of its primary functions, which is the promotion of competition, thereby leading to better and more competitively priced telecommunications services for consumers.</P>
        <P>This Bill is on the priority list of legislation for enactment by the Government, during the current term of the D&aacute;il. I expect to bring it before this House shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 and 283 together.</P>
        <P>The telecommunications market is fully liberalised and regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions. ComReg&rsquo;s objectives include the promotion of competition and the promotion of the interests of users.  In an open market, decisions about investment, the provision of telecommunications services and the development and roll-out of telecommunications technology are primarily a matter for the industry itself.</P><Col N="1416"/>
        <P>As Minister with responsibility for policy in this sector, of course I welcome progress in the sector, particularly investment, innovation and competition.</P>
        <P>However, where there has been clear market failure to provide necessary telecommunications services, the Government has acted. The Government&rsquo;s current broadband policy is to address market failure through investment in the construction of the open-access Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), part-funding rural broadband access networks under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) and laying the ground work for a National Broadband Scheme, (NBS). The NBS will supersede the GBS. When it is fully rolled out, it will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met.</P>

	<P>There were two Calls for proposals under the group broadband scheme, one in 2004 and one in 2005. Full details of the scheme and the evaluation criteria are published on my Department&rsquo;s website www.dcmnr.gov.ie.  Grant aid amounting to &euro;5.9 million was offered to the service providers approved under the group broadband scheme. To date the service providers have claimed almost &euro;1.4 million in grant aid and this has been paid to them.</P>
        <P>The facilitation of broad band coverage across the entire county continues to be a key priority. I am aware that, despite Government and private investment in broadband, there are areas of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  Accordingly, I recently announced a new National Broadband Scheme which will aim to provide a broadband service to these areas. This Scheme, which will supersede the group broadband scheme, will, when it is fully rolled out, ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met.</P>

	<P>Under the NDP 2000-2006 the Government targeted the broadband infrastructure deficit in the regions by part funding private sector infrastructure, by constructing State-owned, open access MANs in cities and towns nationwide in association with the local and regional authorities.</P>
        <P>Phase One of the MANs programme, which involved the construction of networks in 27 towns, is now complete at a cost of approximately &euro;85 million. Phase 2 of the MANs programme involves the construction of MANs in over 90 additional towns nationwide. Construction commenced in 2006 in 23 towns in the following counties; Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Meath, Galway, Longford and Donegal. The remaining MANs under Phase II of the programme are currently on schedule to have commenced construction by the end of 2007. It is currently anticipated that all the MANs in Phase 2 will have been constructed in 2007-2008. The estimated cost for Phase 2, at present, is &euro;130 million.</P>
        <P>Grant aid amounting to &euro;5.9 million was offered to the service providers approved under the Group Broadband Scheme. To date the service providers have claimed and been paid almost &euro;1.4 million in grant aid.  The MANs programme utilised competitive tendering and fixed price contracts to ensure that the projects were completed on time and within budget.</P>
        <P>Over the 2007-2013 period phase 2 of the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) programme will be completed. Consideration will be given to a further phase of MANs once the effectiveness of spending under phase 1 has been addressed. Project selection under this Programme will be directly targeted to assist the implementation of the National Spatial Strategy.</P>
        <P>A scheme to deliver broadband to areas of the country that would not be reached by the MANs programme or by the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) is also being developed for implementation over the period of the new Plan. The objective of the scheme will be to deliver a broadband service to the limited number of areas where it is currently uneconomic for the private sector to do so.</P>
        <P>Apart from the completion of the DTT Pilot, there are no proposals for Broadcasting in the NDP.  The provision of telecommunications services and the development and roll-out of telecommunications technology is primarily a matter for the industry itself. The telecommunications market is fully liberalised and regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of the full range of postal, counter and delivery services in the future is a matter, in the first instance, for An Post and the other postal operators in the market.  The universal service obligation, enshrined in European and Irish law, provides that each Member State is obliged to provide a postal service whereby the minimum level of service that must be provided is a clearance and delivery every working day to the home or premises of every person. Under Irish regulations, An Post is designated as the Universal Service provider. To assist the company in meeting its statutory obligations, it has a legal monopoly on all mail items weighing 50g or less until January 2009. Furthermore, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) is the independent regulatory body which, in accordance with the provisions of S.I. 616 of 2002 European Communities (Postal Services) Regulations, has responsibility for the monitoring, measurement and regulation of the postal sector including measuring the levels of service to be achieved by An Post and ensuring that the company abides by its statutory universal service obligations.</P>
        <P>I believe that there will continue to be a key national role for An Post in the delivery of mails and parcels. However, over the coming years, competition can be expected to increase in these sectors, whether from the privately owned express sector, from the large European public operators now looking for international business or from electronic substitution.</P>
        <P>Liberalisation of the mail market in Ireland has already commenced and the second Postal Directive proposes that the postal sector is to fully liberalise across the EU on 1 January 2009 subject to political agreement, which, if achieved, would open up the letter post area to full competition.  Issues that will be important for Ireland in the context of a fully liberalised market will include the protection of the universal service, ensuring that Irish citizens continue to receive a broad suite of postal services and the continued viability of An Post in the face of open competition.</P>
        <P>The development of the postal market requires the availability of competitive, high quality prod<Col N="1424"/>ucts. The current level of market opening has introduced new players with offerings that meet consumer needs and further market opening will provide further opportunities for new and existing players. The development of further competition allied with a modernised and customer-focussed An Post will provide the basis for the further development of the postal sector here.</P>
        <P>As regards the post office network, this Government and the board of An Post, are committed to the objective of securing and maintaining the largest, most economically sustainable nationwide post office network possible.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</P>
        <P>The role of Government is to implement regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of affordable, high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers. While I do not have direct control over the number of people taking up broadband subscriptions my Department continues to promote the use of broadband through initiatives such as the Broadband Awareness television adverts.</P>
        <P>The Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill, which was published this month, is primarily designed to strengthen the regulatory framework for the electronic communications sector. The Bill will enable ComReg to better achieve one of its primary functions, which is the promotion of competition, thereby leading to better and more competitively priced telecommunications services for consumers.  This Bill is on the priority list of legislation for enactment by the Government, during <Col N="1425"/>the current term of the D&aacute;il. I expect to bring it before this House shortly.</P>
        <P>It has also been clear for some time that the private sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband. Direct funding has already been provided under the NDP 2000-2006 for the provision of backbone infrastructure and to upgrade local access infrastructure.  The Government has also taken the initiative to address market failure through investment in the construction of the high speed, open-access Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), while also grant aiding rural broadband projects under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS).</P>
        <P>However, despite Government and private investment in broadband there are parts of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. It is planned to address the question of availability of broadband to the remaining 10-15 per cent via a new scheme which, when it is fully rolled out, will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met. A Steering Group comprising representatives of my Department and ComReg are currently finalising the outline of the scheme. The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) will supersede the GBS.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>While this is an operational matter for Enterprise Ireland, I understand that <Col N="1426"/>the primary benefit of locating Dublin based staff in a single location will be to significantly increase the level of collaboration within the agency which will facilitate the delivery of a more effective service to client companies. Occupying four separate premises in Dublin is sub-optimal for the agency. Crucially, having all Dublin based Agency staff in one location will enable Enterprise Ireland to further deliver the creation of integrated teams of staff with complementary expertise to service client companies. This, plus the fact that the leaseholds on two of these buildings will expire in 2008, meant that EI had to decide on an appropriate office solution that would accommodate all of EI&rsquo;s 600 or so currently Dublin based staff.</P>
        <P>I also understand that, having engaged professional advisers and exhaustively explored a number of possible single site solutions, the Board of Enterprise Ireland decided that the single site office solution offered in the East Point Business Park is the most appropriate from a number of perspectives, including increasing internal efficiency, value for money and greater accommodation flexibility.</P>
        <P>Finally, it is worth noting that there are likely to be considerable financial benefits to the Exchequer following the move to East Point, the final cost of which will need to be considered in terms of the overall financial benefit accruable to the exchequer, in addition to the business reasons outlined above, such as the sale of the majority of the Enterprise Ireland Glasnevin site.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme which was introduced from 1994. The scheme allows up to 20 years (from 1994) spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker.</P>
        <P>The scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the appropriate rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions from <Col N="1427"/>the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age must also be satisfied.</P>
        <P>In August 2000, my Department published a review of the qualifying conditions for old age (contributory) and retirement pensions. This review also included a general examination of the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme and the report suggested a number of reforms for further consideration including replacing the disregard system with one based on actual credited contributions.</P>
        <P>A review of the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme and other issues relating to social welfare pensions is taking place in the context of the forthcoming Green Paper on pensions, to which the Government is committed as part of the new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016. It is expected that the Green Paper will be finalised by the end of March 2007 and published thereafter.

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> his views on abolishing the means test for the carer&rsquo;s allowance; the funding being allocated to support carers in 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Supporting and recognising carers in our society is and has been a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</P><Col N="1428"/>
        <P>In line with other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to the carer&rsquo;s allowance so as to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. This means test has been eased significantly over the years most notably with the introduction of spouse&rsquo;s earnings disregard.  Following Budget 2006, since April, the earnings disregard for a couple has been set at &euro;580 per week which is equivalent to gross average industrial earnings.  As a result of further improvements which I announced in the Budget 2007 this disregard will increase to &euro;640 per week for a couple from April 2007.</P>
        <P>When this increase is in place a couple with two children will be able to earn up to &euro;36,240 and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.  This measure surpasses the commitment in &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; to ensure that those on average industrial earnings can continue <Col N="1429"/>to qualify for a full carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Complete abolition of the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance would cost in the region of over &euro;140 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, I extended the annual respite care grant to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care regardless of their income. Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding jobseeker&rsquo;s assistance and benefit, are entitled to this payment subject to meeting the full time care condition.  In Budget 2007 I provided for the level of the grant to increase by &euro;300 to &euro;1,500 from June 2007.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and as a general rule only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual.  Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.  I am aware that this has been a cause of particular concern to people in receipt of a social welfare payment when they become carers.</P>
        <P>For that reason I was very pleased to introduce fundamental structural reforms in this area in Budget 2007.  From September 2007 people in receipt of another social welfare payment who are also providing full time care and attention to a person will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment depending on their means, the maximum of which will be equivalent of a half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance.   It is estimated that approximately 18,000 carers will benefit from this measure at cost of &euro;56.72 million in a full year.  The precise details regarding how this new arrangement will operate are being examined and will be set out in legislation shortly.</P>
        <P>The improvements for carers which I announced in Budget 2007 will cost over &euro;107 million for a full year.  As a result of these improvements expenditure on weekly payments to carers will be in the region of &euro;357 million in 2007.  A further &euro;64.5 million will be provided to carers in the form of respite care grants.   In addition, as a consequence of the new arrangements in relation to receipt of another welfare payment while caring, 18,000 carers will also benefit from expenditure from other non-caring schemes of approximately &euro;57 million in a full year and nearly &euro;14 million in 2007.</P>
        <P>I am committed to working for, and with, carers to deliver increased benefits, supports, and services for them and their families.  The improvements for carers which I announced in Budget 2007 are further evidence of this commitment.</P>

	<P>The Personal Public Service Number (PPS No.) is an individual&rsquo;s unique reference number for dealings with Government Departments and public bodies. Once issued, it is intended to have validity over a person&rsquo;s lifetime.  A person generally retains the number whether or not it is used to access services on an ongoing basis. Records are noted on death or where there are concerns about identity in particular cases. However, there is no provision for systematic reissue of numbers which are not currently being used to access services and, bearing in mind the range of services which could be involved, any such arrangement would not be appropriate.</P>

	<P>The pilot phase of the Rural Transport Initiative (RTI) concluded at the end of 2006 and, in line with Government decisions in the matter, work is now underway to mainstream the scheme. This work is based on the experience with the pilot RTI and the outcome of a public consultation process.</P>
        <P>Thirty-four community transport groups throughout the country are currently being funded under this scheme to address the particular transport needs of their rural areas.  Pobal administers the RTI on behalf of my Department and together with the RTI groups concerned is solely responsible for all the operational aspects of the initiative including the specific services to be provided and their method of provision. Neither I, nor my Department, have any role in these matters.</P>
        <P>In line with commitments in Towards 2016 and in parallel with the implementation of Transport 21, Euro 9 million is being provided for the RTI in 2007. This funding will facilitate the transition of the RTI from the end of its pilot phase into the beginning of the mainstreaming process. A local community group that is considering becoming involved in a local transport scheme should make contact with Pobal in the first instance. However, in making specific allocations to the individual RTI project groups from the increased funding, I expect Pobal to work closely with the existing groups to maximise the impact of the funding through, among other things, increased service provision and wider area coverage as well as ensuring continued value for money.</P>
        <P>I will announce details of the mainstreaming process at a launch in Donegal on Monday 19 February.</P>

	<P>The compensation package negotiated in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime is worth in excess of &euro;310m to Ireland.  It comprises three elements.</P>
        <P>The first element is the sugar beet compensation, which has been incorporated into the Single Payment Scheme with effect from 2006.  It will be worth approximately &euro;123 million to Irish beet growers over seven years.</P>
        <P>The second element is the EU restructuring aid for the sugar industry, which in Ireland&rsquo;s case is worth approximately &euro;145m.  In accordance with the EU Regulations, the Government made certain decisions last July regarding the implementation of the restructuring aid, in particular the percentage to be reserved for beet growers and contractors.  These decisions are now the subject of judicial review proceedings instituted by Greencore in the High Court.  Under the EU Regulations, the first instalment of aid would fall to be paid in June 2007.  In view of the legal proceedings, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</P>
        <P>The third element of the compensation package is the diversification aid, also provided for in Council Regulation (EC) 320/2006, worth almost &euro;44m in Ireland&rsquo;s case.  A national restructuring programme has been prepared and submitted to the EU Commission, in accordance with the EU Regulations, with a view to drawing down the diversification aid.  The Regulations provide that payment of this aid could commence in September 2007.</P>

	<P>Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools.  The census for the current school year (2006/2007) is currently being worked on.</P>
        <P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.  Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
        <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy knows all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 280 such posts were <Col N="1438"/>sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers.  About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

        <Quest> the number of children in classes of 27 pupils or more at primary level; the average class size at primary level; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools.  The census for the current school year (2006/2007) is currently being worked on.</P>
        <P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.  As the Deputy knows all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the <Col N="1440"/>school.  Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers.  About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

Such teachers are eligible for appointment to posts in certain categories of special schools, to posts in categories of special classes in mainstream schools where Irish is not a curricular requirement and to posts as full-time <Col N="1441"/>resource teachers for children with special educational needs (low incidence disabilities only) in mainstream schools.  They may also take up positions in children detention schools, youth encounter projects and special education projects.  In addition, they may also take up positions as substitute teachers.</P>
        <P>Teachers with recognised post-primary qualifications may be granted restricted recognition to enable them to teach in a special school where a proportion of pupils attending the special school are of post-primary age and where second level programmes are being provided by the school.</P>

        <P>The school referred to by the Deputy has submitted an application to my Department for a building project.  The long-term staffing figure on which accommodation needs will be based has been determined and notified to the school authority.

        <P Just="Left">During the consideration of the project the school confirmed to my Department that it was their wish to have their application treated as a new school project rather than an extension to the existing school.  Before progressing the project further and to ensure that any capital funding allocated to the provision of a new school building represents optimal use of resources and is appropriate to meet the school&rsquo;s long-term accommodation needs it will be necessary to give consideration to the possibility of utilising the existing building <Col N="1442"/>and/or site before pursuing a greenfield site for a new build project.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme.  DEIS will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification and review process, 873 schools have been included under the DEIS action plan.  These comprise 670 primary schools and 203 second-level schools.  In relation to schools that did not qualify for the new programme, it is important to note that an independent review process was available to them.  Additional schools were added to the programme as a result of making successful review applications.  I am satisfied that all schools have been assessed on the basis of the best information available, have been ranked in terms of the right criteria and have been given a fair opportunity to appeal.</P>
        <P>Unsuccessful schools were advised at an early stage that they would be allowed to keep the sup<Col N="1444"/>ports that they have under pre-existing schemes for the current school year.  My Department is now in the process of informing these schools that they will retain additional teaching resources for the duration of the DEIS Action Plan.  The effectiveness of these posts will be reviewed in line with the ongoing review process in place for DEIS schools.  It will be a condition of the retention of such posts that schools comply with any reasonable requirements of the review process.</P>
        <P>Schools which presently participate in the Home School Community Liaison Scheme will not be excluded from the scheme and will, from the commencement of the 2007/2008 school year continue to avail of HSCL Services for the duration of the DEIS Action Plan.  The level of service will be commensurate with both the size of the school as well as its relative level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Many schools at present retain additional capitation from previous schemes which have now been subsumed into DEIS.  From the beginning of the 2007/2008 school year this capitation will be offset against increases in the rate of general capitation.  This process will take four years and will ensure that no school will experience a reduction in annual capitation as a result of this measure.  Changes may of course arise from other factors such as enrolments.</P>

	<P>In order to meet the language needs of students in our schools whose first language is not English additional support is given to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of posts.  The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled.  The additional language support to an individual pupil is generally given for a period of two years.</P>
        <P>Schools with between 3 and 13 eligible pupils receive grant assistance towards the cost of employing part-time teachers.  Schools with 3 to 8 such pupils receive a grant of over &euro;6,300, while schools with between 10 and 13 such pupils receive over &euro;9,500.  Over &euro;4 million is being provided for such grants in 2007.</P>
        <P>Schools with 14 or more such pupils are entitled to one or more language support teachers, the number of which has increased dramatically in recent years.  There are now approximately 1,250 language support teachers in our schools.  More than 400 of these teachers have been allocated in the current school year alone.  As I announced last November, 200 extra posts were approved by the Government for 2007, bringing to 1,450 the number of language teachers that will be working in our schools this year.  This compares with just 262 posts in the 2001/02 school year.</P>
        <P>In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitments under the &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo; partnership agreement, a further 350 language support teachers will be provided between 2008 and 2009.  In allocating additional teachers, I will be addressing in particular the position of those schools catering for significant numbers of such children.</P>
        <P>Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive strategy is currently being finalised which will ensure that the extra investment in this area is being used to the best effect, and that it is underpinned by the right support and training for teachers.</P>

	<P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  There are now no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002 and approximately 7,000 more than there were in 1997.

Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment).  In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers.  About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the Department&rsquo;s maintenance grants schemes, and in accordance with the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act 1968 to 1992, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on the 1st January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course. </P>
        <P>Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents or guardians.  An independent mature student is defined as meaning a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents or guardians from the October preceding their entry to an approved course.  Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents&rsquo; or guardians&rsquo; income and address.</P>
        <P>Officials in my Department contacted Cork City Council, the assessing authority in this case.  The <Col N="1448"/>candidate referred to by the Deputy submitted a grant application form to Cork City Council seeking to be assessed under the 2006 Scheme as an independent mature candidate.  I understand the candidate was initially assessed under the Higher Education Grant Scheme in 2003 with reference to her parents&rsquo; address and income and has remained in higher education since that time.   As the candidate is not re-entering, as defined in the grants schemes, she will continue to be assessed with reference to the year of initial entry to the schemes.</P>
        <P>The Schemes define re-entering as &ldquo;entering as a mature candidate following a break of at least one year and having previously attended a course approved for the purposes of either the Higher Education Grants Scheme or the VEC Scholarship Scheme.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The candidate referred to by the Deputy may apply to the Local Authority in Waterford appropriate to the candidates&rsquo; parents to have eligibility for grant aid assessed.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule.  This staffing schedule for the 2006/07 school year is outlined in Primary Circular 0023/2006 which was issued to all primary schools.</P>
        <P>In the current school year (2006/07) the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy comprises of a Principal and twelve mainstream class teaching posts, based on an enrolment of 325 pupils at 30th September, 2005 as submitted by the Board of Management of the school.  The school also has 3 Learning Support/Resource teacher posts.</P>
        <P>The Board of Management has submitted a report indicating that there were 305 pupils enrolled in the school on the 30th September 2006.  The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2007/08 school year will be determined on that figure and in accordance with the staffing schedule for the 2007/2008 school year which will be finalised as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 348 and 349 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department is engaged in the roll-out of broadband internet connectivity to all recognised primary and post-primary schools.  This project is being undertaken in partnership with industry in the context of a Government &mdash; IBEC/TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) Agreement to provide local broadband connectivity to schools.  The broadband connectivity is being provided via a Schools National Broadband Network supported by HEAnet, which will provide managed Internet access, email, security controls, content filtering and other services designed to enhance the educational process.  A Broadband Support Service Desk has also been established to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network.  The total cost of the project for the three year period will be in the region of &euro;30m.</P>
        <P>Following a competitive public procurement process, contracts were finalised with a number of service providers for the provision of local broadband access to 3,925 schools, of which 87 are in County Louth.  The broadband connectivity of a further 75 schools, including 3 in County Louth, was advanced separately under two pilot projects. <Col N="1450"/> Roll out of the local connectivity and router installation commenced in June 2005.  The installation process has two stages starting with the local broadband connectivity installation (involving DSL, satellite or wireless technology) followed by the installation of a high-speed router and circuit and acceptance testing.  A school then must confirm that it has an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) in place and it must indicate which content filtering option it requires prior to the activation of the school&rsquo;s connectivity via the Schools National Broadband Network.</P>
        <P>In relation to County Louth, as of 12 February 2007, 68 primary schools (96%) and 16 post-primary schools (100%) have had their local connectivity installed and have had their router capability installed and tested.  Of these, 66 primary schools and 15 post-primary schools have confirmed their AUP status and selected their content filtering option and the Broadband Support Service Desk is pursuing the 3 schools that have yet to complete the process.  As mentioned earlier, a further 3 schools have had the broadband connectivity provided under the Advanced Deployment Programme.  The details of the individual schools involved are set out in the table.</P>
        <P>Of the three schools in County Louth yet to be installed, one schools installation was deferred pending the completion of building works at the school.  On completion of these works, the selected service provider has handed back the schools having failed to achieve line of sight and this school will be re-awarded to an alternative provider.  The initial technology option selected in the case of the other two schools failed and these schools have been re-awarded to alternative providers for installation.</P><Col N="1449"/>

        <Quest> the circumstances surrounding the refusal by his Department to sell Clancy Barracks to Dublin City Council at a reasonable price and the subsequent sale of the barracks to a private developer in 2004 at a basement bargain price; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset I would like to say that Dublin City Council was given ample opportunity to acquire Clancy Barracks.  The Government, on the 15th July, 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks, including Clancy Barracks, Islandbridge, Dublin.  Following on the Government decision Dublin City Council expressed an interest in having the property made available for affordable and social housing.  Meetings were held between my Department, the City Council and the then Department of the Environment and Local Government.  The view of the City Council and the Department of the Environment and Local Government was that the optimal solution would be to sell the land on the open market rather than have it purchased by the Local Authority for housing purposes.</P>
        <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin was offered for sale by public tender in June, 2001.  Two bids were received, one of which was from Dublin City Council.  Both tenders were considered too low to permit acceptance and the property remained on the market.  Subsequently discussions took place with officials of the then Department of the Environment and Local Government and Dublin City Council.  In the event, Dublin City Council did not proceed to acquire the property on the basis that it was considered that the public interest would be best served from a housing and planning perspective by selling the property on the open market rather than have it purchased by the Local Authority.</P>
        <P>The Department accepted an offer from Florence Properties Ltd, in June 2002, for the purchase <Col N="1456"/>of Clancy Barracks in the sum of &euro;25.4 million which price was significantly higher than either of the tender bids received.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Personnel on being discharged from the Permanent Defence Force are obliged to vacate married quarters within a short period of the dates of their discharge.  In the case of the individual in question, I am advised that he was discharged on the 29 October 2006 after five years service.  He should have vacated married quarters on the 19 November 2006 but did not do so.  The provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities and married personnel have an equal claim on such housing as other members of the community in the same income category.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Article 9.1 of the EU Water Framework Directive requires Member States to take account of the principle of water services cost recovery, including environmental and resource costs, in accordance with the polluter pays principle.  In Ireland this requirement is implemented in relation to the non-domestic sector on the basis of recovery of all non-domestic water services costs, from non-domestic users of the services through water charges.</P>
        <P>In relation to the domestic sector, the full costs of providing water and waste water services for domestic users continues to be met by the exchequer and funded in a transparent way through the capital budget of my Department and, in the case of operational costs through the Local Government Fund.  A prohibition on domestic water charges is provided for in Irish legislation.</P>
        <P>As a consequence, there is no requirement on local authorities to meter domestic water supplies, other than in a situation of a water services consumer using water for both domestic and non-domestic purposes.</P>

        <Quest> the <Col N="1458"/>guidelines his Department has given to local authorities on the way the payments to people on community employment schemes are to be considered in the calculation of local authority rents; if there are specific guidelines in relation to over 55s who have been allowed to stay on CE schemes for a fourth year; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Each local authority calculates the local authority housing rents payable in its area in accordance with a differential rents scheme adopted by the elected members and taking account of guidance issued by my Department.  My Department&rsquo;s circular letter HRT 12/94 requests local authorities in circumstances where tenants&rsquo; income is increased as a result of participation in the Community Employment Programme to arrange that their differential rent is not increased as a result.</P>
        <P>All aspects of the differential rent schemes are currently under examination in my Department in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment in the Housing Policy Framework Building Sustainable Communities to implement a fair rents policy across all social housing tenures.  In this context, it is proposed that local authority rent systems will be developed within a national framework that outlines parameters, but provides operational flexibility to reflect local conditions.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision and improvement of non-national roads is a matter for local authorities to be funded from their own resources supplemented by State grants provided by my Department.  There have been significant increases in recent years in the level of State funding provided to local authorities for the provision, improvement and maintenance of non-national roads.  State funding in 2007 for non-national roads, at over &euro;607.5 million, is at its highest ever level, and represents a very substantial increase of 9% on last year&rsquo;s record allocation, or an increase of almost &euro;50 million.</P>
        <P>The first Pavement Condition Study of the non-national road network, which was commissioned by my Department, was carried out in 1996.  The second Pavement Condition Study on non-national <Col N="1459"/>roads, which was also commissioned by my Department and carried out by consultants, was completed in 2005.  Surveys of the network, under the recent study, were carried out by the consultants in 2004.  The results show that there has been a very large growth in traffic volumes, including numbers of heavy goods vehicles, on our roads over the last 10 years and that the combination of growth in traffic volumes and damaging power has dramatically increased the structural loading on the non-national roads network.  The study concluded that the economic boom, since the first study was carried out in 1996, has fundamentally changed the loading regime on the non-national roads network, with much higher and more frequent loading by heavier vehicles now being the norm.</P>
        <P>The rate of occurrence of potholes and road disintegration has effectively halved since 1996 as a result of the &euro;1.5 billion investment in Restoration Improvement and Maintenance works over the 1997 to 2004 period.  However, the instance of other defects, such as rutting and edge cracking, has increased since 1996 as a result of growth in traffic on the network, particularly that of heavier and wider commercial vehicles.</P>
        <P>On foot of the findings of the study, I have increased the grants available to County Councils for Restoration Improvement works to almost &euro;225 million in 2007, which is an increase of almost &euro;20 million, or 9.6%, on the 2006 allocation.  This very substantial increase means that significant progress can be made in allocating funds to address the deficiencies identified by the Pavement Condition Study.  I have also allocated grants totalling &euro;81 million for Restoration Maintenance works this year.  This represents an increase of &euro;6 million, or 8%, on the 2006 allocation.  In view of the fact that the last study was carried out recently, I do <Col N="1460"/>not propose to have another one carried out in the near future.</P>
        <P>In determining the annual non-national road grant allocations, the overall objective is to resource each local authority appropriately in relation to their ongoing and special needs. Non-national road grants are allocated under a number of grant categories including:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Discretionary Maintenance, Discretionary Improvement and Restoration Maintenance Grants to county councils, which are determined predominantly on a pro-rata non-national road length basis;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Restoration Improvement Grants to county councils, which are based on Multi-Annual Restoration Programmes submitted by local authorities to my Department, taking account of previous allocations and the results of the recent Pavement Condition Study;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Block Grants and Special Block Grants for Carriageway Repairs to City, Borough and Town Councils, which are based on the population of each urban area and its environs;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Other grant categories which are project specific such as the Specific Improvements Grant Scheme and the Strategic Non-National Roads Grants Scheme, under which projects are submitted by local authorities for consideration and allocations are determined following an assessment of their individual merits, compliance with eligibility criteria, the needs of all areas and the total funds available.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Details of the length of non-national roads, per road category, in each County Council area are set out in the table.</P><Col N="1459"/>

        <P>In September 2006 I announced a comprehensive Action Programme to promote improvement in standards of private rented accommodation and work on this is progressing.  A key objective of the Action Programme is to achieve more effective enforcement of the regulations.  Local authorities have been asked to prioritise action to improve enforcement through a planned and strategic approach and increased funding is being provided <Col N="1462"/>to them for this purpose which will, in future, be related to enforcement activity.</P>
        <P>As part of the Action Programme, the Centre for Housing Research is also carrying out a study of measures to promote improvement in private rented accommodation standards, including good practice guidelines to assist local authorities in their functions relating to the private rented sector.</P>

	<P>The Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (EIA Directive), 85/337/EEC as amended, requires that consent for projects should be granted only after prior assessment of the likely significant environmental effects have been assessed and that this assessment must be conducted on the basis of the appropriate information supplied by the developer.</P>
        <P>The transposition of the Directive is consolidated in Part X of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006 and Part 10 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 to 2006.  The Regulations specify the information that must be contained in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  In addition, the Regulations provide that a developer may request, from the consent authority, an opinion as to the information to be contained in the EIS.  On receiving such a request, the consent authority informs the relevant prescribed bodies who are then given an opportunity to comment on the information to be contained in the EIS.</P><Col N="1463"/>
        <P>The EIS is then independently assessed by the consent authority.  It is a matter for the relevant consent authority to satisfy itself as to the adequacy of the EIS.  The consent authority has the discretion to grant or refuse consent for the development or grant it subject to conditions.</P>

	<P>In accordance with section 13 (2) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and other prescribed bodies are consulted on proposed variations to city or county development plans.  The submission from my Department referred to in the Question was in response to a consultation from D&uacute;n Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council in relation to a proposed draft variation to their County Development Plan 2004-2010.</P>
        <P>In this response, my Department commended the Council for seeking to promote more sustainable development in relation to energy performance of the built environment and reduction of dependence of fossil fuels.</P>
        <P>The draft variation communicated to my Department proposed a reduction of at least 60% in respect of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and a target of 30% of space and water heating from renewable energy sources.  I am sure the Deputy would agree, that in line with good practice, and indeed with the principles of Regulatory Impact Assessment, that it is important when decisions of this nature are being made that all relevant factors are considered, including potential knock on construction costs which could effect house purchasers.  In this regard, I note that the actual variation, as adopted by D&uacute;n Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council on 12 February 2007, has adopted reduction of targets 40% and 20% respectively.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 361 and 362 together.</P>
        <P>Article 5.2 of Council Directive 1999/31/EC provided that the quantity of biodegradable municipal waste going to landfill must be reduced to:</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />75% of biodegradable waste arising by 16 July 2006,</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />50% of biodegradable waste arising by 16 July 2009, and</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />35% of biodegradable waste arising by 16 July 2016.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The above Directive on the landfill of waste also provided that member states who landfilled more than 80% of their collected municipal waste in the baseline year of 1995 may postpone these targets by a period not exceeding four years.  Member states intending to make use of this provision were required to inform the Commission in advance of their decision; Directive 1999/31/EC did not provide a specific deadline for such notifications.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of Article 5.2 of Council Directive 1999/31/EC, Ireland informed the Commission on 22 December 2005 of its decision to extend the targets for 2006 and 2009 by four years to 2010 and 2013 respectively.  Ireland is strongly committed to achieving the targets at the earliest possible date and the priority now is to achieve the necessary biodegradable municipal waste diversion from landfill in advance of the revised target dates.  Ireland will review the position in relation to the available four-year derogation from 2016 to 2020 and will come to an informed decision on the prospects for achievement of the third phase diversion targets as soon as practicable.</P>
        <P>A copy of the notification sent to the Commission is being sent to the Deputy.  A copy of the Commission&rsquo;s notification of Ireland&rsquo;s position to other Member States was not forwarded to my Department.</P>
        <P>The Questions appear to imply that the deadlines in the provisions of Article 5.2 of Council Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste are pursuant to Article 17(4) of Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment <Col N="1465"/>(WEEE), and that the date of 13 August 2004 (which, is the deadline for the transposition of the WEEE Directive) is relevant for this purpose.  Neither implication is the case.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 363 to 365, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for enforcement of the building regulations is a matter for the 37 local building control authorities.  Half-yearly statistics on enforcement of the regulations, furnished by local building control authorities to my Department, do not give a breakdown of the prosecutions initiated for non-compliance with the 12 Parts (A to M) of the Regulations.  However, the statistical returns for the period January-June 2006, show that 15 Enforcement Notices were served by building control authorities under the Building Control Act 1990 for non-compliance with the building regulations.  In addition, 6 summary prosecutions were taken by the authorities.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s circular letter BC 14/2006 has requested local building control authorities to include, in future statistical returns, starting with returns for the revised July&ndash;December 2006, a breakdown as to what specific Part or Parts of the building regulations is/are the subject of enforcement notice or legal proceedings initiated by the authorities for non-compliance with the building regulations.</P>

        <Quest> if he has received a draft or final version of a report on the energy performance of Irish housing funded by <Col N="1466"/>Sustainable Energy Ireland and carried out by the City of Dublin Energy Management Agency suggesting that only 2% of new housing units comply with Part L of the building regulations; his views on the veracity of this figure; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>My Department has not received a copy of the draft or final version of the Report referred to in the Question, although it has already had access to an extract from the executive summary to the Report.  I understand that Sustainable Energy Ireland intend to publish the Report in the next eight weeks.</P>
        <P>My Department will not be commenting on the contents of the Report until the full version of it is received and examined.  I would expect that the Report&rsquo;s analysis will be valuable in guiding future policy and enforcement arrangements in relation to Part L requirements.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the delay in the implementation of a producer responsibility scheme for the newspaper and magazine sector, given that it was the view of his Department, as far back as 2001, that systems were available for such an implementation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>Discussions are ongoing with the newsprint industry with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative (PRI) for the recovery and recycling of newspapers and magazines.  Discussions have focussed on waste prevention and minimisation issues in the newsprint industry specifically the practice of &ldquo;Boxing Out&rdquo; i.e. oversupply of magazines; recovery and recycling of unsold newspapers and magazines and post-consumer newsprint waste.</P>
        <P>A Joint Industry Taskforce, comprising the Regional Newspapers Association of Ireland (RNAI), Irish Retail Newsagents Association (IRNA), Newspread and Eason Wholesale Ltd, and co-ordinated by National Newspapers of Ireland (NNI) is leading the negotiations with my Department.</P>
        <P>Since the establishment of the Taskforce progress has been made by the industry in increasing the use of recycled paper in newsprint.  My Department has asked the Taskforce to develop an industry code of practice with a view to preventing and minimising waste in this sector.  At the suggestion of the Department the National Newspapers of Ireland (NNI) representing the newsprint publishers have now appointed an Environment Officer who is examining the issues referred to above.  I understand that when this review is com<Col N="1467"/>plete following consultations with the other stakeholders in the industry, new proposals will be submitted to the Department.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to engage with the Joint Taskforce on developing a stable and sustainable industry initiative for the management of this important waste stream.</P>
