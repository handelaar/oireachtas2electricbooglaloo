    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the extraordinary and totally unacceptable delays encountered by people with serious illnesses, such as a 70 year old man in Monaghan General Hospital who has been waiting since last December for a life saving heart operation in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and an 80 year old person who has been waiting for a surgical plate to be replaced since it broke approximately four months ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent public and national concern, namely, the proposed sale by Coillte to commercial interests of 73 acres of Killykeen Forest Park in County Cavan at an asking guide price of &euro;4.5 million; the need for the renewal and refurbishment of the existing 60 chalets, equestrian centre, shop and restaurant facilities at the park; the potential development of a marina at the park so that boats and cruisers can access the Shannon-Erne waterway; and the urgent requirement that a relatively small amount of money be invested so that this major amenity for visitors and tourists can be revitalised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I request the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of urgent national and local importance, namely, the difficulty in finding private or public nursing home beds in Dublin and surrounding counties, which will be exacerbated by the announcement by private nursing home providers that the cost of nursing home accommodation is set to rise substantially from its current level of almost &euro;900 per week in the eastern region.  I ask the Government to set aside time to deal with this <Col N="362"/>real crisis, which will get worse if immediate action is not taken.  Its inevitable consequence will be to put even greater pressure on beds in acute hospitals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a specific matter that requires urgent attention, namely, the need for the Minister for Finance to approve funding for the Clonmel flood alleviation scheme immediately.  The town urgently needs the scheme, for which it has been waiting for 12 years.  I ask the Minister to make a statement on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised, I have found that they are not in order under Standing Order 31.</P>
      </Speaker>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business"> 
    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 16<i>a</i>, motion re membership of committees; No. 1, European Communities Bill 2006 <i>[Seanad]</i> &mdash; Second Stage; and No. 24, Health Bill 2006 &mdash; Second Stage, resumed.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 16<i>a</i> shall be decided without debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one proposal to be put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 16<i>a</i> without debate agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Government agree to a debate on the annual report of the National Competitiveness Council, which was published yesterday?  I understand that Pfizer, one of the flagship companies in Ireland&rsquo;s pharmaceutical sector, which has never seen any job losses, is about to announce significant job losses in Cork.  There have been similar job losses in Motorola, Vodafone and Xerox.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow the Deputy&rsquo;s question, but we cannot have a debate on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to make the point that this is not an isolated incident.  There is a trend of job losses in our traded sectors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate at this stage.  The Deputy asked whether a debate will be allowed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Such a question should apply only to promised debates, but I will allow the Deputy to ask a brief question now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>As the announcement is being made as we speak, it is appropriate, timely and urgent to raise the matter now.  I hope the Chair will indulge me if I stray slightly beyond the boundaries of Standing Orders.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="363"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No, Deputy, I could not set a precedent like that.  Your colleagues might expect the same facility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am definitely inside those boundaries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair is grumpy this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like to raise a second matter.  We have spent the week trying to clarify what will be done about the gaping hole in the regulatory structure that the Government put together for health insurance.  Will emergency legislation be introduced to deal with that lacuna?  Will it be handled in a leisurely fashion over the coming weeks and months?  There seems to be an extraordinary lack of clarity in respect of these serious issues.  The Government seems to have been caught flat-footed.  We need clarity.  I read in today&rsquo;s newspapers that the Government intends to establish a forum to deal with pay issues.  Is this being done within the terms of social partnership?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question would be more appropriate to the responsible line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems that the forum will deal with all aspects of public sector pay policy, which is the collective responsibility of the entire Government</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter should be raised with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am entitled to ask whether a legislative measure will be introduced so that the new forum we have heard about will be put in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the T&aacute;naiste consulted about the appointment of Mr. Tom Mulcahy to the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It just arose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow the first two questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is relevant to ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>May I just ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course it is relevant to ask, but there are other ways in which the Deputy can raise the matter</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="364"/>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Chair will let me complete my sentence before he rules it out of order.  Is it appropriate that the same person should chair two bodies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>He will act as a supervisor&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter can be raised in other ways.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste wants to answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a legislative initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It has nothing to do with legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not seem appropriate to merge the chairmanship of two boards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste will be allowed to answer the first two questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The possibility of having a debate on the National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s annual report can be considered by the Whips.  If it is thought proper that there should be a debate on the matter, I am sure it can be arranged.  As I said last week, the Government will consider two reports on health insurance &mdash; the Competition Authority&rsquo;s report on the market and the expected report from the Barrington group on risk equalisation and community rating &mdash; when they are to hand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that irrevocable decisions which will have a bearing on this legislation will have to be made in the next few days?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>What emergency legislation, if any, is planned to deal with the steady deterioration in the health service?  There is a real danger that all the key workers in the service &mdash; nurses, administrative staff and even hospital consultants &mdash; will be in dispute with the Government in the next couple of months.  What will the Government do to ensure that patients can access the care they need?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.  The Deputy must use another means to raise it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to promised legislation, the dismal record of the Government is only matched by our dismal performance in the football match yesterday.  A series of legislative measures was promised by the Government and it is the Government who sets the timetable for legislation.  There are less than 20 days left until <Col N="365"/>the D&aacute;il rises for Easter.  According to the legislative programme published in 2003, the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill was to be published in late 2003, the Animal Health Bill in early 2004 and the Minerals Development Bill in 2004.  The Pharmacy Bill, to protect patients, was due to be published in 2004, the National Monuments Bill in late 2003, the Charities Regulation Bill in 2005, the Nurses and Midwives Bill, which should have been considered an urgent priority, was due to be introduced in 2004 and the esteemed Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, promised that the Dublin Transport Authority would be put on a statutory footing by way of legislation before last Christmas.  Will the T&aacute;naiste explain why the Government cannot even score within its own timetable?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not comment on the football match because I did not see it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the Government&rsquo;s fault.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but I can guarantee that nobody is suggesting that Steve Staunton should step aside for the Deputy to take over.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is like the Government &mdash; the promises are better than the delivery.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>She might do a better job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a political football.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Bray was never renowned for its soccer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Charities Bill, the Dublin Transport Authority Bill and the Pharmacy (No. 1) Bill will be published this session.  The Nurses and Midwives Bill will be published this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the T&aacute;naiste represents the San Marino of Irish politics, he is not in any position to judge anybody&rsquo;s performance.  On today&rsquo;s Order Paper there is a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council amending a directive on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use.  Will the Government provide time, under a new Order of Business, to use that proposal to discuss the situation at Pfizer in Cork?  It has just been announced that the Ringaskiddy plant is to close and the Little Island and Loughbeg plants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot debate the matter now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This relates to the meaning of this House.  This is an issue of concern to the Cork region&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="366"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is absolutely right&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and time must be provided in the House to discuss it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the House has provided facilities for Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an urgent issue and I ask the T&aacute;naiste to respond to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue can be raised in other ways.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate there are other ways through the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office but I am asking the T&aacute;naiste to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will facilitate the Deputy if he wishes to raise it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is aware that the House agreed the Order of Business a few minutes ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The announcement has just been made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to Pfizer, I understand that 65 people are to be made redundant and the two plants are to be sold as going concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>If they are not sold, the jobs will be gone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but IDA Ireland has a tremendous record and the Minister, Deputy Martin, has a great record in Cork for delivering jobs.  I was in Amgen&rsquo;s headquarters in Thousand Oaks in California recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>That could have caused the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and there is a US$1.1 billion investment in Carrigtwohill in Cork, of which the Deputy is well aware.  I do not wish to talk down the Cork region or its economy.  IDA Ireland has such a good record with regard to pharmaceutical capacity, which is always sought after, that I believe there will be alternative purchasers for those plants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have inquired a number of times about the current whereabouts of promised legislation, that is, the Postal Services Bill, which the Taoiseach admitted fell off the wagon.  It was deemed to be important legislation two years ago but for some mysterious reason it disappeared.  Is it intended to restore that proposal to the Order Paper or does disagreement exist within the <Col N="367"/>Government as to whether it should have been there in the first place?  Is that the reason it fell off the wagon?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Two years ago it was taken off the list of proposed legislation but that fact does not appear to have impinged on the Deputy, who regularly asks about its whereabouts.  It is gone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why was it removed?  Is it because the T&aacute;naiste disagreed with it?  Were there internal policy differences?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two issues.  In the interests of clarity, given that many organisations are anxious to know the Government&rsquo;s intentions with regard to the proposed referendum on children, has a wording been agreed and, if so, when will it be circulated to Members of the Opposition so we can analyse it?  Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to hold the referendum before Easter?  The second issue relates to legislation for which the T&aacute;naiste is responsible, that is, the Judicial Council Bill.  This has been promised since 2004.  Has the retirement request from Judge Brian Curtin been agreed by the Government?  When will the legislative framework be provided that will enable such contentious issues in the future to be dealt with in a structured manner?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach clearly stated to the House this week the position regarding the referendum, and it has not changed since then.  We are in a process of study and consultation and the Deputy has been consulted about the matter.  The situation has not changed dramatically since the Taoiseach spoke on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>When are we likely to have agreed wording?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the Judicial Council Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>When are we likely to have the wording and is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to bring a referendum Bill before the D&aacute;il before Easter?  It is a legitimate question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach answered the question clearly the other day.  The answer does not change from Member to Member.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the answer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer is the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>What is it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach made it clear the other day and it will not become clearer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not make anything clear.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="368"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;by me repeating what he said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste not know?  Is he that much out of the loop?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the T&aacute;naiste to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The second matter is the Judicial Council Bill.  It is now three years since I consulted the Judiciary about this matter and I am still awaiting a response about certain points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Three years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste mentioned in one of his replies that the House had agreed the Order of Business today.  However, we had no opportunity to reflect on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot go back on that now.  Has the Deputy a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is appropriate.  There was no proposition before the House as to whether the European Communities Bill 2006 was something this House should address today.  The elements in that and the powers the T&aacute;naiste would like to see vested in his office as a result are obnoxious.</P>

	<P>I wish to ask about legislation.  Thousands of people are waiting to buy what were commonly known as local authority flats and legislation was promised to deal with this issue.  The social housing miscellaneous Bill is to be introduced.  Will it be introduced before the election to ensure the value which these people have added to their homes will not be further eroded by inflation?</P>

	<P>During the week the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte, raised with the Taoiseach the issue of the threatened or promised &mdash; depending on which way one looks at it &mdash; increase of 30% in fees for auctioneers because they have not enough work to make themselves rich without working.  In any event, the Taoiseach indicated the property services regulatory authority Bill would give powers to the Minister to control the prices paid.  He indicated the Bill was a matter of urgency and was likely to be before the D&aacute;il before Easter.</P>
        <P>It states in the list of Bills that publication is expected in 2007.  I am used to reading these lists and I know this means there is not a snowball&rsquo;s chance in hell of this legislation coming before the House before the general election.  Does this mean nothing will be done about this 30% increase?</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Shortall, indicated to the Ceann Comhairle yesterday that she wished to <Col N="370"/>raise an issue.  She cannot be here this morning and I ask to be permitted to raise the matter on her behalf.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, promised some time before Christmas that he would introduce a short Bill to deal with a number of miscellaneous issues in the transport area, including the right of local authorities to have resident-only parking in various parts of towns and cities.  This is a particular issue around Croke Park.  I do not see that Bill on the list.  I understand significant work has been completed on this short Bill and if it were to be brought to the House I imagine the Opposition would co-operate in passing it.</P>

	<P>Is the Minister considering raising the derisory &euro;2 fine applying to public urination?  When will he impose on-the-spot fines as requested by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for some time?  As it is not an arrestable offence, does the Minister propose to make it an arrestable offence and impose on-the-spot fines?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the level of fines the Deputy will be aware that the recently published Fines Bill will increase the general level of fines across a range of offences.</P>
        <P>Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na use the Public Order Act to deal with offensive behaviour, such as that described by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice Act provides, not for on-the-spot fines, but for a letter to issue to people who have been arrested for those offences.  In <Col N="371"/>those circumstances they are given the option of paying a fixed penalty or facing prosecution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am pleased to bring the European Communities Bill 2006 before the D&aacute;il.  It is a short and technical Bill in one sense, but it has an important national purpose.  It will ensure the arrangements which we use to transpose EC law are effective and fit for the purpose in a changing Europe.  I am sure all Members will agree it is vital we meet our EC treaty obligations.  That is the only way we can continue to deliver to the Irish people the full benefits that derive from EU membership of the European Union.  The Bill passed all Stages in the Seanad before the Christmas recess.  I thank Senators for their contributions and co-operation in those important debates and look forward to discussing the Bill with my colleagues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
     
        <P>The Bill arises from the serious implications of two Supreme Court judgments, Browne <i>v.</i> Attorney General and Kennedy <i>v.</i> Attorney General.  In both these cases the Supreme Court found that a statutory instrument to give effect to European Community law can only be validly <Col N="373"/>made where the Oireachtas has specifically provided for this in the relevant primary legislation.</P>
        <P>The Attorney General has since advised that new legislation is needed to change the manner in which we have been transposing European Community law using secondary legislation.  The Supreme Court judgments mean that some of this body of legislation built up since 1973 is susceptible to legal challenge.  This means that hundreds of statutory instruments made in the best faith over three decades by dozens of Ministers from the Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Labour and Progressive Democrats parties under powers given to them by Acts of the Oireachtas may be in doubt.  The Attorney General has advised the Government that there is a need to address the circumstances in which we find ourselves arising from the two Supreme Court judgments.</P>
        <P>Since 1973, the European Community treaty has obliged Irish Governments to transpose Community regulations, directives and decisions to translate Community law into Irish law.  Where major policy changes have been required by Community membership, we have used primary legislation which has been debated and passed by the Oireachtas.  However, the bulk of the routine transposition work has been implemented by Ministers and their Departments using powers to make statutory instruments which are set out in domestic legislation.  The Supreme Court has ruled that if the domestic legislation did not contain specific powers to make these European Community related statutory instruments, the relevant instruments are open to challenge.</P>
        <P>In light of the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice to the Government, we need to remove any doubt surrounding the manner in which the Government gives effect to EC law via secondary legislation.  The Government needs to validate, as necessary, those statutory instruments, introduced by all Governments to transpose Community law since 1973, which are affected by the two judgments to which I have referred.  We need to act with the support of the Oireachtas to ensure we can transpose EC measures via secondary legislation in a manner that is consistent with the court&rsquo;s judgments.  It is only fair to citizens that we get this important process right and have a transparent and effective procedure in place to meet our Community obligations.</P>
        <P>Before discussing further the reasons for the Bill, I will set out its six key provisions in order that Deputies can see precisely what we are dealing with.  Section 1 sets out the relevant definitions.  I will table a minor clarifying amendment to this section on Committee Stage.  The amendment is necessary to clarify that the definition of the words &ldquo;European Act&rdquo; includes not only entire directives and regulations but also individual provisions of such directives or regulations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 2 will give Ministers of the Government the power to create indictable offences in regulations made pursuant to the 1972 European Communities Act, where the Minister deems such <Col N="374"/>a sanction to be necessary to fully implement the Community instruments being transposed.  The Bill provides for a maximum fine of &euro;500,000 and maximum term of imprisonment of three years.  I underline that these maximum penalties will be imposed only after due process has taken its course in the prosecution of an offence.</P>
        <P>Section 3, the core of the Bill, is in four Parts.  Section 3(1) will permit statutory instrument-making powers contained in existing primary legislation to be used to give effect to a European Community law in this jurisdiction.  Specifically, the provision will allow the regulation making power in any Act of the Oireachtas to be used for the purpose of implementing Community law provided the domestic Act deals with the policy area covered by the Community obligation in question.  I am sure the House will agree that it is entirely sensible that legislation passed for domestic purposes can also be used for the additional purpose of giving effect to Community law in the same policy area governed by the Act.</P>
        <P>Section 3(2) takes account of the primacy of European Community law which the people of Ireland endorsed when we decided to join the European Economic Community in 1972.  The section repeats the existing provision in the 1972 Act, which allows regulations made for the purpose of giving effect to Community law to amend primary legislation where this is necessary to give full effect to the Community measure.  The Attorney General has advised that this provision must be replicated to allow statutory instruments made under the new dual purpose power, which I have outlined, to amend primary legislation, where this is required by the EC instrument being implemented.</P>
        <P>Section 3(3) will enhance the transparency of the implementation of Community legislation into Irish law by requiring a statutory instrument which gives effect to a Community law to refer specifically to the Community law in question.  In other words, the statutory instrument being used to give effect to a particular Community measure must refer specifically to the measure in question.  We hear a great deal about better regulation and transparency.  This approach is a sensible way of clarifying the purpose of the legislation and the manner in which the Irish law relates to the European Community legislation.</P>
        <P>Section 3(4) confines the regulation-making powers contained in the Bill to Ministers of the Government.  This is a further important safeguard to ensure these powers will only be used, where necessary, by members of the Cabinet and not by officials without Government oversight.</P>
        <P>Section 4 will confirm the validity of the many regulations giving effect to Community law, which have been already made under a domestic regulations-making power.  The section protects the body of Community law introduced through secondary legislation upon which doubt has been cast by the two Supreme Court judgments to which I have referred.  I assure the House that <Col N="375"/>this confirmation shall not affect the constitutional rights of any individual.</P>
        <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, I will comment on the benefits of the Bill which will significantly modernise our method of transposing our Community obligations into Irish law.  Following the historic decision of the people of Ireland in the referendum of 10 May 1972, the Houses passed the European Communities Act of 1972, the principal legal instrument for implementing Community law.  In a fundamental change to our legal system the Act provides that the treaties governing the European Communities and existing and future Acts adopted by the institutions of the Community shall be binding on the State and part of domestic law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The European Union of 27 member states is radically different from the Common Market of six countries which Ireland, the United Kingdom and Denmark joined on 1 January 1973.  At the time of the passage of the 1972 Act the scope of EC law was relatively limited.  Let us recall that this was a time before the Internal Market when key sectors of the modern European economy, such as information technology and financial services barely existed.  In the intervening years the European Union has evolved into a unique political organisation governed by European law, which brings significant economic and social benefits to people in the newly united Europe.</P>
        <P>We are all aware of the positive impact of European Union membership on Ireland.  The country has changed for the better during the past 34 years.  We can all agree that Europe has been a key factor in our tremendous development as an economy and a modern nation.  However, the European Union can only work if member states implement Community law and decisions in a reliable and consistent manner.  The rules must be the same for everyone.</P>
        <P>Last week, Commissioner Charlie McCreevy made an interesting point on this very issue when he stated the Single Market is a joint venture between the European Union and its member states and it is the job of the latter to translate Single Market rules into national law.  The Commissioner pointed out that member states do not legislate in response to some arbitrary deadline or target set by the European Commission but agree Single Market laws among themselves alongside timetables for putting laws into practice domestically.  These comments accurately summarise the equal responsibilities on all member states to make Community law work on a daily basis in national jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>The European Union is a rules based organisation acting for the common good.  Small countries such as Ireland have much to gain from such an environment, which provides protection for our interests over and above what we could ever have achieved acting alone.  The treaties require us to uphold the rules at national level and to <Col N="376"/>provide sanctions against breaches of those rules here in Ireland.  The Browne and Kennedy judgments, however, create a significant gap in our current procedures for doing so.  As it now stands, we do not have adequate provisions for the creation of sufficiently strong penalties for breaches of EC law in secondary legislation.  We could use primary legislation in each case but this would tie up the resources of the House on routine EC issues, leading to unimaginable delays and increasing the risk of exposing the State to significant fines.</P>
        <P>We need to be able to continue to use statutory instruments to transpose EC law, as we have done since 1973.  However, we must do so in line with the Supreme Court judgments and in an effective and transparent manner.  Therefore, the Bill before the House provides for the creation of indictable offences through secondary legislation where necessary.  There will be people of good faith who will question the need for this move.  They may ask the reasons indictable offences were not provided for in the European Communities Act 1972 and whether it is now really necessary to give Ministers powers to create such offences in 2007.  The answer is crystal clear.  The Supreme Court judgments mean that the current arrangements can no longer continue.  Specifically, we can no longer use domestic legislation, which creates indictable offences for breach of regulations to give effect to EC laws, unless that domestic legislation permits us to do so.  Therefore, the gap in the 1972 Act needs to be addressed so that Ministers can create appropriate penalties, where necessary, without recourse to primary legislation on every occasion.</P>
        <P>Regarding the penalties provided for in this legislation, a Minister will only have a limited power, in regulations made under the 1972 Act, to make provision for indictable offences, where necessary, to meet our treaty obligations.  Only where this is necessary, the Minister must operate within the parameters set down in section 2 of the Bill, which provides for a maximum fine of &euro;500,000 and a maximum term of imprisonment of three years.  These are by no means the most severe penalties the Houses of the Oireachtas have created by way of statutory instrument.  They are reasonable and proportionate.</P>
        <P>These penalties are the maximum ones which apply on conviction in the Circuit Court.  Anyone indicted on foot of secondary legislation arising out of this Bill will be entitled to due process under the Constitution, with all the normal legal safeguards.  Secondary legislation adopted under the Bill will be carefully calibrated, in the same way as all of our legislation.  That is to say, the level of penalty in regulations passed to transpose EC measures will have to be proportionate and commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, clearly fulfilling the principle of subsidiarity.  Serious penalties would only be provided for where these are necessary.  In practice, most <Col N="377"/>breaches of EC law would continue to be covered by summary offences.</P>
        <P>The Bill relates to the implementation of routine Community directives and day-to-day regulations into Irish law through secondary legislation.  It is worth noting that Ireland has implemented over 2,700 Internal Market directives during our membership of the European Union.  There are likely to be thousands of such routine pieces of legislation as the Internal Market develops further.  I assure the House, however, that any major and fundamental changes in Irish law arising from our EU obligations will continue to be effected through primary legislation passed by the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  This is the way we have always done business since joining the European Union and there is no intention to change that situation now.</P>
        <P>In some cases, EC law deals with important areas of policy, such as agriculture, customs and excise, financial services and banking, which have a direct impact on the common good.  The treaties require proportionate, effective and dissuasive penalties for serious breaches of European law in such areas.  It is only right that we safeguard the common good and provide deterrents against breaking laws from which Irish people benefit so significantly.  Were we, however, to use primary legislation in all cases, this House would have to sit 365 days a year and debate nothing else but EC laws to implement the wide range of our EU obligations.</P>
        <P>Since the Seanad debate, some public comments seem to suggest that EC law is imposed on us from the outside.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>

	<P>Bureaucratic erosion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland takes a full and active part in the elaboration of EC laws which go through a rigorous preparation process.  Irish Ministers and officials are constantly involved in the EU legislative process on a daily basis, shaping the rules and policies of the European Union.  Suggestions that there is a lack of democratic input at EU level are also wide of the mark.  They ignore the key role of the European Parliament in decision making and the increasingly important role of the Oireachtas itself in EU affairs.  It also overlooks the fact that the governments of member states have a democratic and, in Ireland&rsquo;s case, a constitutional mandate, to contribute to law making at European level.</P>
        <P>As a Member of this House for almost 25 years, I would not stand over any sidelining of the Oireachtas or lessening of our democratic role as the elected representatives of the Irish people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what this means though.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Since day one of our EU membership, the Houses of the Oireachtas have been to the forefront of the legislative effort to align our <Col N="378"/>national laws with EC requirements.  Almost every Minister of every Government since then has brought forward some measures to give effect to European law.  Before it ever comes to that, Irish officials and Ministers are completely involved on a daily basis in the complex negotiations process which gives rise to EC law.</P>
        <P>In recent years, we have made great strides in the modernisation of arrangements for scrutiny of EU business here in Leinster House.  In 2002, the Government, with the agreement of both Houses, brought forward the Oireachtas Scrutiny Act which established the Sub-committee on European Scrutiny.  I applaud the work of that sub-committee which has been in operation for almost five years under the able and dedicated chairmanship of Deputy Allen.  The sub-committee scrutinises draft legislative proposals across the full range of EU activities.  This scrutiny almost invariably occurs before decisions are taken by the Council of Ministers in Brussels.</P>
        <P>Officials in all Government Departments brief the sub-committee in writing on draft legislative proposals within four weeks of their formal circulation.  This is a hands-on and practical approach to monitoring European legislation.  Ministers and officials are also required to be available to provide additional material and to brief committees of the Houses.  Government Departments are required to produce reports every six months on developments in the European Union within their policy areas.</P>
        <P>As Deputies are aware, I and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, are available to brief the Joint Committee on European Affairs in advance of almost every General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting.  I enjoy the robust and frank exchanges with members of that committee.  This practice often serves to help myself and the Minister to reflect the concerns of members in finalising our policy positions at the various Councils.</P>
        <P>One of my responsibilities as Minister of State involves chairing the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on European affairs.  At our regular meetings, I and senior officials from all Government Departments review how Ireland is doing in transposing EC law and meeting our membership obligations.  Thanks to the efforts of all Departments, we are making satisfactory progress and the latest figures, released last week, reflect this fact.  The Bill will help significantly to speed up further the rate of Ireland&rsquo;s transposition of EU directives.</P>
        <P>EU affairs are very much a part of the day-to-day work of the Oireachtas and effective procedures are in place for facilitating full Oireachtas involvement.  When the draft constitutional treaty is implemented, as we hope it will be, it will provide for a further enhancement of the role of national parliaments in EU business.</P>
        <P>We are putting in place revised arrangements to implement EC measures fairly and transparently via secondary legislation.  Secondary <Col N="379"/>legislation has been used for this purpose by all Governments since 1973.  The Supreme Court has found that we need to change the way we do this, but the Bill does not mean any reduction in Oireachtas scrutiny arrangements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill will not change the practice whereby major legislative changes required by EC law are introduced by primary legislation after a full debate in these Houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>It ensures that the implications of the Supreme Court judgments are dealt with in a proper and legally sound way.  Looking ahead, I believe the Bill modernises the arrangements for transposing EC laws speedily and effectively.  This will ensure that the benefits of the Single Market continue to flow to Irish citizens and consumers alike.</P>
        <P>As I have already said, following the Supreme Court judgments, the Attorney General&rsquo;s clear advice to the Government was that this Bill is essential.  Our officials and I have consulted widely with Government Departments and, in particular, with the Office of the Attorney General in the preparation of the Bill.  This is a short, technical but much-needed Bill.  There is no intention to increase Executive power at the expense of these Houses.  There is no question of Ministers fining or imprisoning anyone.  The Bill is simply a response to the serious implications of the Supreme Court judgments, which require us to update the way we use secondary legislation to give effect to our EC obligations in Irish law.  It is that straightforward.</P>
        <P>I look forward to a positive discussion today and later on Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House for its approval.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister sets out what he believes are the positive reasons for the support he expects to come from the House.  We in Fine Gael have always supported the concept of European integration and we have supported all European legislative proposals.  We have taken a leading role in the promotion of the European project and continue to do so in a manner which is responsible and which has due regard for the need for legislation to be brought into line with European legislation, but more particularly with a view to ensuring that the primacy of the Parliament of the land should at all times have a central role to play.</P>
        <P>It is in that regard that on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Allen, and my party I express my serious reservations at the sweeping and retrospective powers the Bill proposes to hand over to Ministers while the elected Houses of the Oireachtas are bypassed.  The Bill enhances the <Col N="380"/>growth of the powers of autocrats, technocrats, plutocrats and bureaucrats.  It is a haven for them.  In many cases these people have not been elected or are unelectable, but they are all provided for.  Yet, the Government proposes by way of statutory instrument or regulation to bypass the D&aacute;il and Seanad and to put into operation, in some cases retrospectively, legislation to comply with EU law.</P>
        <P>The concept of retrospective legislation is a dangerous one.  Moreover, I am surprised the Minister has not learned from the recent fisheries debacle that to proceed without due deference to the Oireachtas is dangerous.  When this Bill was before the Seanad, Fine Gael put down a number of amendments, none of which was accepted by the Government, which had a total disregard for the suggestions of the Opposition.  That being the case and there being no indication so far that the Government intends in any way to address the fears expressed in the Seanad, we will oppose the Bill because we believe in democracy, as should everyone in this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Democracy means that the Government should respect the principle of subsidiarity, which means that in all such cases the elected Parliament of the member state has a direct role to play.  It is the Minister who will have a central role to play if this Bill is passed, which is a movement towards something which is far from democratic in principle.  I am amazed the Bill has got this far when the Minister must have personal reservations about some parts of it.  We must ensure the democratic principle of subsidiarity is observed and that the parliaments in the member states have an ongoing role to play, as envisaged in any democracy.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the European Communities Act 1972 which allows for the transposition of certain EU law into Irish law by way of statutory instrument.  However, the Bill will allow the Minister to transpose into Irish law EU law which carries the penalty of imprisonment for our citizens.  A point that comes to mind concerns the environment, for which we must implement rigorous protection proposals, and rightly so.  However, will the Minister be imprisoned if it was found that the various sewage treatment plants throughout the country were polluting the waterways?  The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, might be signing an order for himself.  That is not what is intended.  What is intended is to have other citizens&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Or the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Or both.  There are serious implications, which the Minister and the Government have not fully studied.  For example, the degree to which public utilities, institutions or services, such as sewage treatment systems, impact negatively on the environment will mean inevitably that someone will have to be imprisoned if the <Col N="381"/>Minister proceeds as he proposes.  As the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is most likely to be the Minister responsible, we will have to wait to see whether that Minister will be imprisoned or whether another scapegoat will be found.  We will bypass the national Parliament if we proceed down that road.</P>
        <P>It is a significant provision.  We should not take that route.  We should at all times recognise that to get authority within the State for a measure of this nature, we should first discuss the issue in the Parliament.  We should put it before the House for 21 days and allow Members of the House to raise questions and debate it if that is deemed necessary.</P>
        <P>This is a form of legislation by stealth.  For many years, at least as long as the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has been in the House, I have repeatedly seen the erosion of the rights of Parliament to the benefit of Ministers.  It is a European trend.  However, this country has a direct election system &mdash; we elect directly to Parliament &mdash; which does not necessarily apply to all European countries.  There are those who will extoll the benefits and merits of list systems and other systems &mdash; they may even extoll the merits of electronic voting, about which we know, and other expensive systems &mdash; but the fact remains that we have an entitlement to follow our procedures and to make sure that the supremacy of the Houses of the Oireachtas is not handed over to the bailiwick of a Minister, who can make statutory instruments, directives or regulations, which in turn have sweeping effect and have a major impact on the people.</P>
        <P>The Bill, as well as granting Ministers too much unscrutinised authority, will validate legislation retrospectively.  It will validate all statutory instruments made since 1973 to transpose EU legislation into Irish law, including those that comprise a criminal sanction.  The problem with this is the retrospection.  The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has no way of knowing what impact this will have.  He may have some indication as to the likely impact in the event of A, B or C in a particular sequence.  We in the Opposition do not have at our disposal the resources to ascertain the full extent to which the Minister of State has received any such communication but I can think of numerous cases where the Minister of State, or a colleague from the House in a future Government, would be faced with a serious problem that arises directly as a result of the way this Bill is proposed.</P>
        <P>We need European law and the EU to be closer to the people.  This has already been demonstrated in the referenda held to approve the European constitution.  I do not know who advised on the timing of the Bill or on its necessity, but it is an insensitive time to bring it before Parliament in any EU member state.  After all, the necessary procedures to approve the European constitution have failed so far in any country <Col N="382"/>that required a referendum, although a number of countries require only parliamentary sanction.  Unless something has happened of which I am not aware, we have not yet arranged a referendum, although I do not know why that is the case.  We were so enthused about the constitution&rsquo;s integrity, I am surprised we did not have the referendum before the Bill.  In a democracy, the referendum should have come first.</P>
        <P>I do not think France has approved it yet, but perhaps the Minister of State has some insight in that regard.  The Netherlands has not approved it either and as far as I know neither it nor France have recanted yet.  I resent receiving lectures from any other country as to what we should do, how we should comply and the procedures we should follow in order to comply.  Our system of democracy is as good, as true and as tested as any other and, for that reason, this proposal is ill-judged.</P>
        <P>If we want to bring Ireland closer to the European Union and the European institutions closer to the people, the more we enhance the democratic role of the Oireachtas, the greater the chance of our approval of any future legislation relating to the European constitution.  It is all very well to say we will deal with the issue another time and get it through then or that everyone knows our membership of the European Union has been hugely beneficial.  It has, but let the Minister of State not forget that a number of people throughout the country are not so enthusiastic about the result of some of the recent negotiations, for example, on CAP reform and various other matters over the past 12 months.  The cessation of the sugar industry here is not remembered with fondness as far as the people are concerned.  When bureaucrats and Ministers sit down and congratulate each other on their successes, the loss of the sugar industry is not likely to be considered one.</P>
        <P>In that regard, an extraordinary situation has developed with regard to the plethora of proposals that came from the WTO agreements.  It is now deemed to be eco-friendly to import food from Latin America, Australia and New Zealand at a time when the environment and global warming is a major issue.  I have never heard such extraordinary nonsense.</P>
        <P>Members on the Government side should be aware that we still have a vivid memory of the people directly affected by the closure of the sugar beet industry.  That action was taken without any parliamentary consultation.  The deed was done behind closed doors and we were told this was how it had to be.  Nothing has to be done in that manner.  We have a Parliament and there should always be input from Parliament before a decision is made.  The Minister of State seems to be at sea in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am an inland man.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="383"/>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would move inland at high speed if I was the Minister of State because he will know all about it when they catch up with him.</P>
        <P>The proposed legislation will remove the political input from law-making, thereby usurping the legislative function of the Oireachtas.  Under these proposals, legislation will be able to pass from Brussels to national implementation without the input of the Oireachtas.  Subsidiarity, therefore, is gone down the tubes and no longer exists; we have no function.  I challenge the view of the Minister of State that this improves democratic scrutiny.  How does it do so?</P>
        <P>We know from recent experience that Ministers do not always sign what goes before them.  What will happen if a heavily burdened Minister has a pile of correspondence in front of him, one of which signs into law a statutory instrument?  He will obviously delegate that authority to somebody else.  These important Ministers must travel around the world, run it and keep it going, be accountable to everybody and anybody and be all things to all people.  How in God&rsquo;s name, therefore, will they address the issue of simple democracy that would permit the people to know what was happening and allow the Ministers themselves take responsibility for their actions?</P>
        <P>With regard to legislation passing through this House, I have repeatedly said that every time we see legislation, we see a further indication of the Oireachtas being bypassed and Ministers taking unto themselves more responsibility.  That may be grand when one goes to Brussels or elsewhere to negotiate.  Ministers like to have full authority, but the only authority they will have now is authority that derives from themselves, from looking into their own hearts, like a former founder of Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>The heart of the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The founder of the party claimed he used to look into his own heart for inspiration as to what the people wanted.  The Minister of State will spend much time looking into his heart and those of his colleagues before he finds inspiration that will lead him to believe the people want him to proceed in this fashion.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael will oppose the Bill because the Minister of State and his colleagues have clearly indicated that they have no intention of taking on board any amendments or of having any regard for the Opposition&rsquo;s expressions of concern.  That is unlikely to change.</P>
        <P>I have spent much time as a member of both the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and have had occasion to observe scrutiny procedure at first hand.  I support the Minister of State in complimenting the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny, chaired by my colleague, Deputy Allen.  However, unless the committee sits all day every day, it will soon be impossible for it to handle the full extent of the proposals coming before it. <Col N="384"/> There are thousands of bureaucrats in Brussels working and burrowing away every day, impervious to the needs of individual countries or their citizens.  The Minister of State suggests that we and Members of Parliament throughout Europe should hand over to Ministers full responsibility to protect our rights.  That is not on.</P>
        <P>In the event this legislation is passed, we require that a Minister&rsquo;s proposal should be laid before the House for a period of 21 sitting days to enable Members to challenge the provisions or table amendments.  At least then the public would be aware of what is happening.  Otherwise, we have no way of knowing unless we have a ministerial statement, outburst or announcement.  If it is something positive, Ministers will want to announce it, but if it is negative they will not want to hear about it.</P>
        <P>We will also seek to remove the retrospective effect of the legislation by amendment.  In the event of the proposals as set out being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for a specific period and there being no objection from Members, that will be fine.  We will have had our chance.  Laying the proposals before the House is a stipulation that should be included.  I am amazed the Government and the Minister of State have, so far, poured scorn on the notion that this should be done.</P>
        <P>The day will come, perhaps sooner than he expects, when the Minister of State may be sitting on the Opposition benches.  He may then see the need for a greater degree of parliamentary scrutiny, a greater degree of parliamentary involvement and a greater necessity to ensure, whether related to European legislation or not, Members are informed of and know what is going on and that they can make a reasonable input.</P>
        <P>Let us take as an example the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny.  It met 16 times during 2006 and examined 552 documents.  I remember trying to do the same and although we met every week, we knew there were limitations on what we could achieve.  Incidentally, we discovered that legislation obviously discussed at ministerial level had been going through on the nod until a question was raised by the committee.  Only then, much to the annoyance of the negotiators, the Ministers and those with delegated responsibility, did they return to explain the full implications of the proposals to it.</P>
        <P>We had better get this clear.  It may well be that people on the Government side of the House will see things differently when they find themselves over here.  The degree to which the Government has sought or assisted in the elimination of Opposition scrutiny of its proposals is appalling.  We see examples such as in this legislation daily.  It is now an element of almost every Bill that the Minister is responsible to no one else.</P>
        <P>The bulk of the committee&rsquo;s work in 2006 related to regulations, decisions and directives.  Some 371 documents, or 69% of the total, fell into that category.  Some 56 common foreign and <Col N="385"/>security policy measures were considered, including information on restrictive measures against Burma, Zimbabwe, Sudan, Liberia, C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire and certain categories of people, including persons suspected of involvement in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and certain officials in Belarus.  Great detail and personal attention are required on the part of Ministers and Parliament in an exceedingly demanding area to which we will have to pay greater attention in future.</P>
        <P>Other steps considered included measures to combat terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons, support for actions demanded by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and measures including support for IAEA activities regarding nuclear security and verification.  That very wide area of responsibility will continue to grow.  To hand over absolute authority, retrospective or otherwise, to a Minister is a negative development.</P>
        <P>Of the 552 documents considered in 2006, some 98, or 18%, were deemed to have significant implications for Ireland warranting further scrutiny, therefore being referred to the relevant sectoral committees.  That is the system whereby documents are examined at various levels and deemed to have an impact.  In the past there have been instances where documents not thought to have an impact slipped through the net, with a subsequent review needed.  The existence of the scrutiny system in the Oireachtas is necessary, although I do not know how that will apply regarding these proposals, since there is no provision for it.  It appears the Minister will take that role himself and that causes a problem.</P>
        <P>Half of the proposals considered by the sub-committee were deemed not to warrant additional scrutiny on the part of the sectoral committees of the Oireachtas and were not referred to them.  However, half were thought to need such scrutiny, being sent to the various committees for their approval.  The Minister has not said what will happen under the new proposals.  He will make regulations, but will the sectoral committees have the opportunity to assess them in advance?  Will the Committee on European Affairs have a chance to assess the Minister&rsquo;s proposals?  Will it be possible for anyone to determine the full range and impact of the proposals now before the House?</P>
        <P>Even if, with the best will in the world, the Minister wishes to apprise the House of their implications, that may not be possible.  Someone, perhaps another Minister, will jump up and bite him for introducing this system.  He will not see it coming, although it could be as soon as a year from now, but we will hear about it then.  It would be an extremely strange thing if the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, were imprisoned as a result of a failure on the part of his Department to protect the environment adequately and I suggest that it might happen.  I know that he is a pleasant <Col N="386"/>and affable person with the answer to everything and I am sure that he will have the staunch support of everyone in the country to get out of jail as quickly as possible.  However, unless both he and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Treacy, wake up very quickly and address the issue of the sewage treatment plants that currently pollute the country&rsquo;s atmosphere, rivers and lakes, it might come back on them.</P>
        <P>While we are on the subject, I might mention that the Committee on European Scrutiny and the various others operate on a shoestring budget.  Resources in this House are very limited and one must recognise how much time and energy must be put into this, simply because the research and back-up, although good, are not adequate, given the volume of correspondence.  There should be democratic accountability in the European Communities Bill 2006, a subject on which the Minister has not yet spoken.  He has said that the Minister will have more power, but to whom is he or she accountable?  The answer is no one, since they will be able to tell us that their actions are in line with European legislation.  To whom is the Minister of State accountable?</P>

	<P>Fine Gael has always supported the timely transposition of EU directives into Irish law, but that is not simply a matter of good legislative housekeeping.  EU directives are the method through which European legislation is enacted in each EU member state, the way in which the Union has a positive impact on the lives of European citizens.  That is why the manner in which directives are introduced and imposed on the people should reflect democratic principles of accountability.  If one does not have accountability, one does not have democracy.  There is an increased disregard for any need to account for oneself.  According to everything that we hear from the Government side of the House, it is completely unnecessary.</P><Col N="387"/>
        <P>I have several other points that I lack the time to raise.  Fine Gael has always supported the European project and we continue to do so.  However, we call on the Government and the relevant Ministers to acknowledge the need for accountability and recognise that, to proceed, we need support for the European project in this country and others.  The best way to secure it is to ensure accountability and that the various parliaments throughout Europe have an input into how European law affects them.  It is not good enough to say that we will now accord a Minister sweeping power and authority so that he need no longer appear before the Oireachtas, introducing law through regulations and statutory instruments with primary legislative impact.  This gives EU law a primary role without any regard for the Oireachtas or its institutions.  We believe this is not good for democracy or the European Union.  It is not in the interests of getting approval for the European constitution, for example, which the Minister appears to think will come about magically.  It will not and this legislation, when amended by Government in recognition of the Opposition&rsquo;s input, will immensely improve that and the whole European project&rsquo;s transparency and accountability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann declines to give the Bill a second reading on the following grounds:</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) 50 years after foundation of European Economic Community, the process of closer European co-operation is becalmed by reason of citizens&rsquo; perception across Europe of a lack of democracy in the operation of the EU;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) Such concerns as to the lack of democratic scrutiny were critical in the defeat of the first Nice Treaty referendum and in the response to that result, including in the establishment of the National Forum on Europe;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) The present law, under the European Communities Act 1972, requires approval by the Oireachtas in the form of primary legislation of all proposals to create indictable offences to implement European law;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>d</i>) The Bill would bring about a major transfer of power from the Oireachtas to Ministers by allowing Ministers to create indictable offences by regulations, rather than through the introduction of legislation;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>e</i>) As directives are binding only as to the result to be achieved, and leave to the national authorities the choice of form and <Col N="388"/>methods (under Article 249 of the EC Treaty), the implementation of a directive is not an automatic or rubber-stamp exercise and involves important policy choices as to form and methods, and it is in the interests of democracy that such important choices should, in serious matters, be made directly by the Oireachtas and not by Ministers through the medium of regulations;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>f</i>) The Bill would, if implemented, allow such policy choices as to form and methods to be exercised by Ministers, instead of by the Oireachtas as at present, in cases where it is proposed to create indictable offences;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>g</i>) Oireachtas scrutiny after the event is not an adequate substitute for the power to make the decision in the first instance, which is the power currently held by the Oireachtas in cases where it is proposed to create indictable offences;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>h</i>) The Bill is therefore a significant dilution of democracy at a time when concerns as to lack of democracy have shaken citizens&rsquo; confidence in the EU;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>i</i>) The Bill is primarily motivated by a short-term view of administrative convenience; the State is not obliged to introduce the Bill by EU law and is free to withdraw the Bill without infringing EU law.&rsquo;&rsquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Not only is the Labour Party opposed to the Bill, we are opposed to it being debated at all in what it seeks to do.  There are other ways to deal with the matter, which I will speak of later.</P>
        <P>We are not the only group with this view.  The Labour leader, Deputy Rabbitte, received a letter from the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers&rsquo; Association on the matter, although I am sure very few organisations in the marketplace know what is going on today in the House.  The ICMSA President, Jackie Cahill, wrote the letter, which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The European Communities Bill currently before the D&aacute;il proposing to amend the European Communities Act 1972 is a very important piece of draft legislation.  The ICMSA is concerned that the Bill would, if adopted, give Ministers power to introduce legislation by statutory instrument, impose fines of up to &euro;500,000 and create indictable offences.  Furthermore, as you know, arising from case law, the current Act empowers a Minister to change existing law, including Acts of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">In view of the growing importance of EU law in virtually every aspect of business, economic and social affairs, we are very concerned about this definite erosion of the authority of the Oireachtas and as a result, democratic accountability for law-making.</P><Col N="389"/>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The 1972 Act never intended this to be the case and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann at that time specifically and rightly, in our view, put a ceiling on the penalties.  Based on the above, we believe that the Bill, as passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann, should not be enacted and that the Oireachtas alone should retain the exclusive role of creating indictable offences.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">In addition, legislation imposing severe penalties on individuals should only be enacted after full scrutiny by elected representatives.  Otherwise individuals in their business and personal life could be exposed to unnecessary restriction and unwarranted bureaucracy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is at the heart of the problem.  The ICMSA, a farming organisation, by chance became aware of the provisions of the Bill proposed today and it put forward such robust opposition to it.</P>
        <P>Many other organisations, including those involved in environmental, marine and farming matters, across the length and breadth of the country will be affected by directives coming from the European Union.  They will also be affected by regulations and statutory instruments put forward by Ministers, at their own discretion, without debate in this House.  Penalties will be imposed of up to three years imprisonment, depriving the liberty of a citizen without having to go through to the House.  A statutory instrument can be concocted in some committee room, by some civil servant or by a Minister before being presented to the Oireachtas Library, bypassing the Oireachtas.  It would be a done deal, a <i>fait accompli</i>.</P>

	<P>There would be an uprising.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated in the first page of his speech that hundreds of regulations, directives and legislation have been transposed into Irish law that we are going to deal with retrospectively.  May we have a copy of all these pieces affected by this legislation, specifically those which will be underpinned by statute and which were previously secondary legislation found by the <Col N="390"/>Supreme Court to have no standing?  A list could be placed in the Oireachtas Library so we could see what we are talking about.  The provision of such a list of documentation referred to in section 4 would be a simple matter.  The section states that every statutory instrument made before the passing of this Act shall operate retrospectively.  The least we would expect is to have that here as part of the corpus of information made available to us.</P>
        <P>This is a very serious matter and it is important to address it in the House.  This debate should not go to a vote at the end of the process today and time should be allowed for a proper hearing.  The Bill was passed through at very short notice by the Seanad with a minimum of debate.  Members apparently did not recognise the implications and it has been tabled for discussion in the D&aacute;il on an afternoon when many Deputies must travel home early.  It is very difficult to give it the debate and time it requires.  There should be scope in the D&aacute;il for a proper debate.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There is no question of anybody on this side of the House not supporting the European project.  We are strong supporters of it.  As the Minister of State will be aware because he is present on many occasions, every time I speak in the National Forum on Europe on the project my contributions are positive towards it, the benefits that have accrued from it, its future and how I wish to see it being expanded, democratised and enlarged so that the benefits of the European Union can be extended to other countries which do not avail of them.  We are speaking of an expansion and deepening of the values, principles and structures of the European Union.  That is where we must address this issue.</P>
        <P>Whatever way one looks at it, this legislation is undesirable.  It is almost pointedly undesirable at this juncture because the entire European Union project is in jeopardy.  It is in jeopardy because the citizens the length and breadth of Europe perceive that the European Union has become removed from their daily lives and that decisions are being made in an ivory tower far away from the reality of the life they are experiencing.  As a result, they are suspicious of the bureaucracy and they will certainly be more suspicious of increasing bureaucracy where the element of democracy is being further eroded.</P>
        <P>We are here trying to bolster up the European Union, to get structures in place and to reassure people that the European Union is relevant and is not operating in a high-handed or undemocratic fashion, and the Minister of State is here presenting a Bill which will pass all power on European directives and on all legislation needing transposition into domestic law to the Minister concerned, who will then decide at his discretion how to transpose it.  The Minister concerned will be able to alter, amend and transpose such legislation as he or she thinks fit.  That role, the examination, scrutiny and passage of legislation, <Col N="391"/>is one for the electorate&rsquo;s representatives in the proper forum.</P>
        <P>As I stated, the European project is in considerable jeopardy because of the lack of perceived accountability and transparency in the European Union&rsquo;s structures and law, and the failure to consult when key decisions that affect citizens&rsquo; lives are being made.  There is a waning of confidence and we saw that clearly in Ireland&rsquo;s case, to which the Minister of State referred.  In his speech he did not give the reason we put together in 2002 legislation to provide for Oireachtas scrutiny of EU legislative proposals, directives etc.  That happened, not out of the blue but because Ireland rejected the Nice treaty in that year and because the Labour Party proposed such legislation and the establishment of the National Forum on Europe as a means of informing the public at large and providing a forum for discussing what is happening in Europe.  It was an attempt to deepen the knowledge and awareness of the citizenry of what was happening and to introduce a level of accountability.  That was the reason.  We did it because we were quickly losing the confidence of the Irish people and the electorate, who had perceived the European Union as having become too distant and too uncaring.</P>
        <P>Ireland is not alone in that regard, as the Minister of State will be aware.  Last year France and the Netherlands rejected the constitutional treaty because they had similar concerns about the decision-making process in the European Union and about accountability and transparency.</P>
        <P>In the debate in the House yesterday the view of a considerable number here was that the project had become stagnant and becalmed because in the past 18 months the European Union has been going nowhere.  It is unlikely that it will go far over the forthcoming 18 months as European leaders endeavour to find a way forward from the position of lack of citizenry confidence in the European Union as expressed in the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote by France and the Netherlands.  Will we add to that through this legislation?</P>
        <P>The European Council summit in December was a damp squib for that reason and we discussed that yesterday.  The Council could only tread water on the important matters.  The Finnish Presidency passed on to the incoming German Presidency the task of finding a way out of the present morass, which is really underpinned by lack of confidence.  As a result, all the decisions needed on enlargement were put on the long finger, as were decisions on a common European policy on cross-border activity to deal with justice and security issues, and important issues relating to the trafficking of children and women.  A common immigration policy was also kicked to touch.</P>
        <P>This legislation will significantly further alienate the public and increase the democratic<b> </b>deficit because it will enshrine in domestic legislation an absence of Oireachtas scrutiny of primary legis<Col N="392"/>lation and will hand over to the relevant Minister the authority to make discretionary decisions on critical issues affecting citizens lives.  It is, as I stated, legislation by statutory instrument.  There will be no debate.  There will be no amendment through this House.  There will be no consultation.  There will be no democracy.</P>
        <P>A Bill that provides for a maximum fine of &euro;500,000 and for depriving a citizen of his or her liberty for up to three years for indictable offences is not one which should be legislated for by statutory instrument.  It is not sufficient to simply place such a statutory instrument in the Library and not lay it before this House.  Indeed, it is highly ironic that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who jealously guards Irish jurisprudence against all comers in a European context and who will not tolerate any intrusion in the Council of Ministers&rsquo; meetings by the European Union in matters of security and justice, is now prepared to tolerate an entire corpus of criminal offences and penalties which would be created and transposed into Irish legislation at the drop of a hat.</P>
        <P>It makes a mockery of the principle of national subsidiarity if EU directives are simply rubber-stamped by Ministers and national parliaments are bypassed.  The Minister of State let the cat out of the bag by stating:</P>
        <P LI="1">We could use primary legislation in each case but this would tie up the resources of the House on routine EC issues, leading to unimaginable delays and increasing the risk of exposing the State to significant fines. We need to be able to continue to use statutory instruments . . . Were we, however, to use primary legislation in all cases, this House would have to sit 365 days a year and debate nothing else but EC laws to implement the wide range of our EU obligations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We speak of primary legislation, not in all cases but in important cases.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has a problem.  This problem was created by the two Supreme Court decisions that found we were operating <i>ultra vires</i> which meant we had to address the matter.  Should we address the matter by digging a deeper hole or dealing with the problem we face?  Should we address it in the context of the principle of subsidiarity which allows us to deal with our issues in our own way?</P>
        <P>I think the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Treacy, will have to find another way to deal with the huge corpus of directives coming from the European Union because they are so important.  We put through legislation here and at the same time more important legislation is transposed into Irish law by statutory instrument, and now we are doing the same.</P>
        <P>How should we solve this conundrum?  I do not think anyone here has an adequate answer.  We should have proper accountability and trans<Col N="393"/>parency and there should be a structure in place that involves the Oireachtas.  We should deal with legislative matters from Europe in the same manner we deal with domestic legislative matters that come before this House.</P>
        <P>I believe that the Minister of State should first have provided as much information as was available to give us the full corpus of statutory instruments that have been transposed to date.  We should establish an all-party committee to examine the problem we face.  How do we reconcile the origination of regulations, directives and laws from Europe with our requirement to democratically scrutinise every piece of legislation passed into law?  We are the legislators and were elected as Members of this House to do that.  We are not entitled to pass that duty to the Minister of State, or any other Minister, under any circumstances.  The Minister of State is a member of the Government, not the Legislature, but the Government is now taking over the role of the Legislature.  The line Minister will legislate not only for some of the legislation which the citizens of this country will have to obey but, probably, for a majority of it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The bottom line is that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Treacy, has not delivered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think the Minister of State recognises the magnitude of what he is proposing and the extent to which it undermines normal parliamentary democracy.  The Minister of State is doing this on the basis of expediency, suggesting too much time and too many resources would be taken up if we were to deal with the legislative matters coming through from the European Union in the way we deal with domestic matters.  Do not forget that these matters apply equally to the citizen and the penalties can be very severe.  The Minister of State, and the other Ministers, will be entitled to impose these penalties.</P>
        <P>I would love the Minister of State to find a way out of the dilemma he faces but the manner in which he proposes to do so is not the correct way and the matter must be examined in a clearer fashion.  Section 2 aims to grant ministerial powers to prosecute on indictment, which is incredible.  This applies to indictable offences, not summary offences, and the penalty that can be imposed is up to three years in prison and a fine of &euro;500,000.  These are extraordinary powers to hand a Minister without scrutiny from the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Section 3 is the core of the Bill, as the Minister of State said, and it states: &ldquo;A power to make a statutory instrument conferred on a Minister by a provision of a statute may be exercised for the purpose of giving effect to a European<?oasys _jy ?>act. . .&ldquo;  That confers power on the Minister, to without caveat, introduce a statutory instrument to give effect to a European act.  The power in <Col N="394"/>question is not merely the power to transpose it as it comes from Europe.  Under section 3(2) some heavy-duty powers are given to the Minister of State and the other line Ministers.  It states: &ldquo;A statutory instrument made for a purpose referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i> may contain such incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister of the Government making the statutory instrument to be necessary for the purposes of the statutory instrument&rdquo;.  That includes &ldquo;provisions repealing, amending or applying, with or without modification, other law&rdquo;, so this is a wider power.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will not merely have the power to transpose a directive from the European Union, he will have the power to amend it, change it, add to it or subtract from it.  This is the power held solely by the Oireachtas, and not only is the Government seeking to take this power for itself but this Bill could have the effect of allowing a Minister to repeal, amend or modify other legislation.  That is an extraordinary power for a Minister to have and I feel we should give this topic more time for debate.</P>
        <P>This proposal should be extended and presented on a broader platform and I believe an all-party committee should be established in this regard.  This matter should be debated in a public session of the National Forum on Europe and the Minister of State should make a full presentation there explaining the implications of the legislation with all the relevant information.  That would allow the National Forum on Europe to return with its recommendations on the subject.  If we do not go down that road we will be behaving in a manner totally opposed to our duty as legislators.  The Minister of State may be able to rubber-stamp this into law through this Bill but it is totally at variance with our duties and responsibilities and the core values of what we stand for.</P>
        <P>The people of this country will not thank us, and no one will thank the Minister of State, if in future there is a problem relating to a directive regarding a rubbish dump, sewage disposal, a marine issue or any agricultural statutory instrument that was transposed without coming before the House.  As the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, pointed out among its concerns, penalties of up to three years in prison and a fine of up to &euro;500,000 apply on indictment.  Imagine if the Irish Farmers Association knew about this &mdash; I am sure the Minister of State did not send it a copy of the Bill.</P>

	<P>The fishermen might have a word to say about this Bill if they had a chance to read it.  Nobody, apart from the small number of people here today, knows what the Minister of State is doing on this matter.  There has been no publicity flourish and no press conference was held to tell the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I spoke in the Seanad and it was debated there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State spoke in the Seanad at the end of the last session and got the Bill through very easily because it was introduced in the Seanad in the first instance.  That does not salve us of our responsibilities in this House and we must take a stand on the legislation and advise the Minister of State to rethink the matter.</P>
        <P>It is not too late to postpone this legislation and put in place a mechanism or mechanisms to allow its provisions and implications, particularly the implications for future citizens&rsquo; credibility, to be debated in a proper forum that will allow proper input.  In doing so, the Minister of State should send a copy to the IFA, the fishermen and all the relevant organisations.  Perhaps a copy could also be sent to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government because, on foot of the current focus on climate control, greenhouse gas emissions and the purchasing of carbon credits, it is he who might find himself drawing up and signing many of the relevant directives.  He may find himself with many questions to answer on the manner in which this is done.  I ask the Minister of State to acknowledge the expressions of concern and reservations and hold off on the legislation until it can be debated properly, not just in this forum but also in a wider forum.</P>

        <P>Allowing Ministers to determine criminal offences and sanctions, including imprisonment by regulation, may be acceptable to the elite that is trying to create an EU state, and it may even by acceptable to a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is clearly jealous of the powers available to dictators, but it is not acceptable to Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>
        <P>When I first saw this Bill, I believed it was innocuous and the explanatory memorandum and briefing note suggested it was such.  However, just after I was elected I was advised that when a Bill looks innocuous, it definitely is not.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I sought advice from EU-critical legal experts and others and a number of them responded that the Bill is far from innocuous, setting a dangerous precedent and not the way forward for Irish parliamentary democracy.  One of the experts who gave me considerable advice was Anthony Coughlan from Trinity College, Dublin.  He has been critical of the European Union, the European Community and the European Economic Community in the past and some of the problems he has predicted have arisen.  If we were to continue along the lines intended in this Bill, it would further justify Mr. Coughlan&rsquo;s warnings about the EU project and the attitude of this State thereto.  He stated the Bill amounts to &ldquo;an attempted coup by the Executive arm of the State, i.e. the Government, against the legislative arm, i.e. the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Section 2 of the Bill would allow the Minister to create offences entailing maximum penalties of &euro;500,000, or up to three years&rsquo; imprisonment, without any reference to the Oireachtas.  Criminal sanctions should only ever be determined by primary legislation preceded by a full debate and scrutiny in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  The determination of what we believe are appropriate and suitable sanctions should be based on the deliberations of the elected representatives of the Irish people as a whole.  To hand this power exclusively to a Minister and his or her officials is undemocratic and anti-democratic, to say the least, if not characteristic of a dictatorship in the making.</P>
        <P>Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill give Ministers sweeping powers to alter existing Acts of the Oireachtas by ministerial order without any reference to the Houses of the Oireachtas or its committees and without notifying or obtaining the permission of Deputies and Senators, as long as the Ministers in question claim their orders are necessary to implement EU law.  This is scary and it undermines the democratic basis of this House.  It is exactly what those who opposed the EEC and its various treaties since its establishment said <Col N="397"/>is part of the architecture of a European super-state.  Any Minister of any Government could be forced to change his or her state&rsquo;s laws on foot of European law.  At the drop of a hat, all the laws, sanctions and penalties could be altered.  If we go down this road, it will be a sad day for democracy and the sovereignty of this State.</P>
        <P>This Bill will be opposed by all who believe in democracy, and they should do so for a number of very basic reasons, which were highlighted by the individuals who wrote to me when I sought advice.  According to Mr. Coughlan, the Bill should be opposed for the following reasons:</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) it seeks to give the EU, the Government and individual Ministers the power to decide what are offences, what fines Irish people should pay or how long they should be imprisoned for, without any reference to the Oireachtas &mdash; this is a fundamental assault on the civil liberties of citizens;</P>
        <P LI="1">(b) it opens the door for the EU to lay down a supranational, EU-wide system of criminal sanctions for breaches of EU law and seeks to remove from the Parliaments of Member States the power to decide such matters &mdash; this is a fundamental assault on basic democratic principles;</P>
        <P LI="1">(c) Even if one agrees to permit the EC/EU to lay down supranational criminal sanctions for a particular breach of European law, this Bill would give carte blanche to Ministers and the EU to do this in relation to all and any area of EC law for the indefinite future, without further reference to the Oireachtas.  Instead this should be done in each specific case.  The civil liberties of citizens are too important to give away so radically and arbitrarily as this.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This Bill, which seeks to have sweeping retrospective effect, must be seen as a component of the now snowballing democratic deficit at the heart of the EU project and this Government&rsquo;s relations therewith.  Dr. Roman Hertzog, the former President of Germany, recently questioned whether that country could truly be called a parliamentary democracy, given that the EU is generating 80% of its laws.  He was not too happy.</P>
        <P>In 2005 the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny processed some 329 EU legislative proposals in its usual meaningless fashion.  Whatever effect it has the legislation which comes before it is already beyond recall.  The 329 proposals amounted to nearly 90% of the legislation dealt with by the Oireachtas that year.  Where will all of this end when every legally binding decision impacting on the lives of citizens is taken by Government Ministers acting alone in Brussels?  What will this Bill sneak through, because we will not get to see everything &mdash; the backlog of ultra-regressive and ultra-repressive justice and home affairs measures, for instance?</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to a policy of critical engagement with the EU.  That means we will <Col N="398"/>consider whether to support each initiative on the basis of merit and criteria such as effectiveness and human rights compliance.  This requires basic opportunities for democratic scrutiny and input.  I do not believe this Bill allows for that in the future and on that basis alone this House should not be giving away its opportunities for democratic scrutiny and sanction of legislation in general and Bills such as this in particular.  I welcome the speeches of Deputies Durkan and Costello, which like my own, stress the highly anti-democratic nature of this Bill.  We totally oppose this Bill on Second Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important legislation, the European Communities Bill 2006.  From the introductory statement by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Treacy, it is clear, as he said, this Bill has a national purpose.  In this regard it is important to have an informed debate and to hear all sides of the House.  There is an element in this D&aacute;il and in the European Parliament which holds that those with a critical voice towards the European Union and the constitution, in particular, are anti-EU.  This myth should be buried once and for all.  I should like to present a different voice as regards Europe and the way forward.  I also want to remind all the so-called democrats in the House that when talking about democracy in this country and the EU we must ensure that all voices are heard, in an inclusive manner.  I make no apologies for taking the Tone stand which maintains that the voice of Catholic, Protestant and dissenter should always be represented, whether in Ireland or the EU.  I present a dissenting voice today in this debate on the European Union. </P>
        <P>The vast majority of elected representatives in the House fully support economic and European co-operation and the strategy of working together as neighbours and friends.  Some of us have major reservations, however, about the constitution.  That is not being anti-EU, but rather pro-cooperation and Irish independence.  In 1985, the then President of the European Commission Jacques Delors, father of the euro currency, made a speech in which he said that by 2000, some 70% of all laws made in the EU would come from Brussels, and only 30% from national parliaments.  The German figures quoted show that his prophecy was right.  The Irish Republic, which the men and women of 1916 set out to establish, was to be a State that would embody &ldquo;the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies&rdquo;, to quote the Easter Proclamation.  This is what people stood for at the GPO last Easter, as the Irish Army marched down O&rsquo;Connell Street.  The essential prerequisite of a Republic that would cherish all the children of the nation equally was that it should be one in which the Irish people possessed the ownership of Ireland and were able <Col N="399"/>to exercise unfettered control of Irish destinies.  Deputies in this House say they stand for such a State, namely, an independent, sovereign democracy in which the people make the laws through the representatives they elect to an independent Parliament.  Such a Republic is incompatible with having two thirds or more of its laws being made in Brussels, and this is something that both the Government and Opposition parties should face.</P>
        <P>Having to obey laws made by others means being ruled by others.  It is the opposite of a country being independent, sovereign and democratic.  What role does the Irish State and its people have in making new laws?  We have one member out of 25 on the EU Commission, the body of unelected officials that has the monopoly on proposing all EU law.  That is effectively a 4% influence on the Brussels-based Commission.  We have one member out of 25 on the EU Council of Ministers, which makes EU law on the basis of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals.  This is another 4% influence.  In practice most EU law is adopted by qualified majority of the Council of Ministers.  That is the situation, so let us have a debate about democracy and the European Union.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Two thirds of Ireland&rsquo;s laws now come from Brussels.  On 25 April 2005, the German Federal Ministry of Justice stated that between 1998 and 2004, a six-year period, 23,167 legal Acts were adopted in Germany, of which 18,917, 80%, were of EU origin.  This was stated in a written answer in the Bundestag to a question from the CDU-CSU&rsquo;s Johanna Singhammer, MP.  The same laws, originating in Brussels, will have to be applied in all member states of the EU, but the number of domestic origin will vary from state to state.  As Ireland is a unitary rather than a federal State like Germany, there should be a higher proportion here of domestically generated laws, so that the Irish figure for legal Acts of EU origin should be equivalent to two thirds or thereabouts of our laws.</P>
        <P>Laws are divided between statutory legislation and statutory instruments implementing primary legislation.  The proposed EU constitution would expand the EU&rsquo;s law-making powers in over 60 policy areas.  If it has to be ratified this means the EU would generate an even higher percentage of our legislation.  Yet we have Government and Opposition Leaders in this House supporting the ratifying of the EU constitution.  I repeat that it is important when discussing European Community Bills that we raise these issues.  Let us look at the words &ldquo;European&rdquo; and &ldquo;Community&rdquo;.  We have to build a sense of community, and currently the movement is in another direction.</P>
        <P>Take the issue of the so-called battle groups.  Another hole in the tattered garment of Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality is the Government&rsquo;s decision to volunteer Irish troops for proposed EU battle groups to go into action from 2008.  I believe the Minister of Defence would prefer to call them peace groups.  So would we all, but let us examine the <Col N="400"/>detail.  The Government is changing the Defence Act to permit Irish troops to train outside the country.  Up to now the Act allowed troops to be sent on peacekeeping missions established by the United Nations.  Now the Act is being changed to allow Irish troops to take part in military missions with a regional group such as the EU, as long as there is some EU approval for it.  This signals a shift from the United Nations to the EU military missions, with endless room for fudge and misrepresentation over whether the initiative has a UN mandate.  This is very important because all these little subtle measures are being slipped in through the back door.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the European Communities Act 1972 for the purpose of allowing offences under regulations pursuant to that Act to be prosecuted on indictment and to provide the power to make statutory instruments available to Ministers under any other Act of the Oireachtas.  It may, in certain circumstances, be used to implement EC law, that is provisions of the treaties governing and Acts of institutions of the European Communities.  It is important we understand that this is the purpose of the legislation.  Again, when talking about this legislation, we have to raise very strong, challenging questions.  Take the debate on the European constitution.  The European leaders have met at summits to discuss and revive the European constitution, which the people of France and Holland voted down last year.  Let us be democratic and listen to people.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the pause for reflection will be formally extended after the French presidential elections.  Two strategies are in play here.  One is based on maintaining the constitution without any changes, continuing with national ratifications, and then pressurising the French and the Dutch to accept the whole thing.  This can be done by calling the treaty something other than a constitution, and wrapping it in whatever paper the different electorates might need.  The other strategy is based on the notion that the first strategy will fail.  In this case, the goal is to adopt the constitution in bits and pieces, each part without national referendums.</P>
        <P>The European elite expect the French voters to change their mind after the presidential elections.  However, the last French opinion indicates that 10% of the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; voters have regretted their votes, whereas only 2% of &ldquo;no&rdquo; voters have done the same.  The Dutch polls are even worse from the point of view of the constitution&rsquo;s supporters.  The Dutch Foreign Minister said the people will never ratify the same text again.  We must face up to this fact.</P>
        <P>The existing European treaties require unanimity.  The proposed European constitution should therefore be regarded as legally dead until it may be formally amended.  It is a serious matter that a co-operation based on law is in clear breach of the basic EU treaties.  To continue with the ratification process is outrageously undemo<Col N="401"/>cratic when the French and Dutch Governments have not indicated how they will ratify the treaty.  How can European presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers expect other people to follow European law when they do not respect the treaties themselves?  This just typifies the arrogance and contempt for democracy in sections of the EU elite.  That is a view that is held on the ground that is not heard very often in this House.  When I express this view, it is often presented by most of the political parties as a minority view, but it is held by 30%-40% of the electorate.</P>
        <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to speak on this Bill and I am glad of the opportunity to present a different view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>We could start by acknowledging the logistical problem that exists.  There are several thousand legal instruments emanating from the European Union every year.  The Bill is one approach, but as has been mentioned by other speakers, it is most certainly the wrong approach.  We exist in what is meant to be a democracy and the principles that underline this Bill greatly undermine the central democratic principles of informing people and of involving them in the changing of legislation.  If a Bill can be created by individuals or groups of individuals acting without democratic accountability, a frightening vista arises.</P>
        <P>I would not give the powers in this Bill to any Cabinet, not to mind this particular Cabinet.  The current T&aacute;naiste would be allowed to exercise his &ldquo;<i>l&rsquo;&eacute;tat, c&rsquo;est moi</i>&rdquo; fantasies to the ultimate extreme.  Given the way he uses the powers given to him under our own Constitution, a Bill like this would allow him to run riot.  He could create regulations and criminal offences in which Irish citizens would have no involvement through the proper perusal of any proposal in this legislature.  On those grounds, this is an extremely ill-thought out Bill.  The way in which it is being introduced in this House indicates there is a lack of awareness of this on the Government&rsquo;s part, but it is also contemptuous to suggest we should give away democratic powers of this type.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, this is at the heart of our criticisms of the direction the European Union is taking, rather than the existence of the EU itself.  It is taking this direction because whenever it exercises democratic functions through referenda and consultation with member states, those in the higher echelons of the EU decide the people are wrong.  One cannot have it both ways.  One cannot say the EU is a democratic organisation and then not accept how democracy works, however unpleasant those decisions can be at the best of times.  The power to inspect legislation and to vet it to the best possible degree for the people we represent is not a power this House should ever give away.  For the Government to suggest it in concert with other EU governments says something about the very nature of the European Union itself.  It shows why the constitutional <Col N="402"/>treaty has been in difficulty.  It shows why the negative votes occurred in France and in Holland.  To a certain extent, it shows that this Government has learned nothing from the rejection of the first Nice referendum.  A legislative framework in which the people are cut out from a particular loop is not really a democracy.</P>
        <P>We are entering the last 12 weeks of the 29th D&aacute;il and will engage in an exercise where all of us and others will be looking for the right to represent the people in the 30th D&aacute;il.  Yet we are debating a Bill that undermines what we are supposed to be about as parliamentarians and puts in place a future for this Parliament that has even less power than at present, where 80% of current legislation emanates from Brussels.  I would have preferred the Government to talk about D&aacute;il reform, but I do not expect that, given its own inclinations.  How can anyone suggest that we have logistical problems in processing EU legislation when this House does not meet more than 100 days every year?  The capacity for this House to meet more regularly exists.  The capacity for this House to scrutinise legislation to a greater degree exists.  The Government chooses not to do so.</P>
        <P>Real D&aacute;il reform would not allow the Government to decide when the House is allowed to sit.  Standing Orders should indicate that our breaks at Christmas, Easter or summer must be determined by a two thirds majority of the House, whereby the Government could not determine whether legislation was processed.  If the House had to meet for a special session, a minority of the House should be allowed to call it to account.  However, it is in the Government&rsquo;s interest not to allow the House to sit regularly and to sit less often than any other parliament in Europe.  Nonetheless, the Government has the audacity to ask us to pass a Bill that questions our right to be a Parliament and the right of the D&aacute;il to have any role in legislation coming from the EU.</P>
        <P>The Bill refers to newly created legislation in the justice area, which are just edicts issued by individual Ministers.  It does not take a big leap of faith to see other Bills of this type being created in defence, foreign affairs or other areas that will undermine our rights as an independent nation.  Given the willingness of the Government to roll over in previous debates on national sovereignty, I do not have any faith that such changes will be resisted in the future.  Perhaps the Minister of State can assure the House that this legislation will be revisited in other ways, possibly following a wider public debate on the matter like that suggested by Deputy Costello.  The suggestion that the National Forum on Europe should discuss the legislation is quite good.  Such a discussion will not affect this debate, however, because the Government has decided the Bill should be passed as soon as possible in its current form.</P>
        <P>I would like those who have expressed reservations about this legislation to suggest how it might be revisited.  I think it will cause difficulties <Col N="403"/>if there is a change of Government, for example.  The members of such a new Government would be hamstrung by the passing of this Bill.  It is dangerous of the Government, in the final days of this D&aacute;il, to propose legislation which will compromise the ability of next D&aacute;il and the next Government to operate in a representative way.  I do not have any confidence that the Government will withdraw this legislation in favour of a more considered Bill because it rarely listens to the Opposition.  The Government is well capable of making its own mistakes, but I do not want to be part of any new Government that has to deal with their effects.  The Green Party will oppose this legislation on the grounds I have outlined.  I do not think it would be of benefit to amend the Bill in its current form.  The central principle that underpins the Bill is dangerous and flawed.  If we are genuinely concerned about the quality of our democracy and the importance of this House in protecting that democracy, we should not support this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the European Communities Bill 2006.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, for bringing this legislation before the House because, as a representative of a rural constituency, he is extremely brave to come to the House with a draconian Bill of this nature.  I hope for his sake that the agriculture community in his constituency does not realise what he is proposing until after the forthcoming general election.  If the penny drops with such people that the Minister of State is involved in this legislation, it will be difficult for him to get re-elected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of this Bill is the most reprehensible action ever undertaken&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Naughten has a major contribution to make, it would be very useful for the Minister of State to have a few backbenchers behind him to listen to it.</P>
     </Speaker>
        <P><i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i></P>
 
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of this Bill is the most reprehensible action taken by a Government since the foundation of the State because it is the first time a Government has tried to legislate retrospectively for a criminal matter.  I expect the President will ask the courts to test the Bill&rsquo;s constitutionality because it is likely it is unconstitutional.  This legislation, which will validate legislation retrospectively, will give the Minister too much unscrutinised authority.  It will serve to dis<Col N="404"/>tance the European Union even further from the day-to-day lives of Irish citizens.  The Bill will bring an end to political input into law-making in this area, thereby usurping the legislative function of the Oireachtas.  It will ensure that EU legislation will be implemented at national level directly from Brussels, without being the subject of any input from Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The Government has rushed the introduction of this dangerous legislation to paper over the cracks of the last 33 years.  It is concerned that there may not have been any legal basis to countless EU directives which were introduced by means of statutory instrument and have the potential to prosecute or impose fines.  It seems that thousands of orders which carry a fine or criminal sanction are being called into question.  This Bill will enable the Minister to transpose legislation from EU law into Irish law without it ever appearing on the Order Paper of either House or being the subject of a review process.  In that way, he will be able to put in place a regulation under which a person can be sent to prison, for example.  We are providing in this Bill for such proposals, which I understand to be unconstitutional because the State is not allowed to impose a criminal sanction by means of statutory instrument unless it is empowered by primary legislation to do so.</P>
        <P>If this legislation is approved by the House, it could have drastic implications for people involved in many sectors of Irish society, including the agriculture and fishing industries.  It will put people at the mercy of draconian legislation such as the nitrates directive and the forthcoming soil directive.  The Bill permits the Minister to impose fines of up to &euro;500,000, and-or three years&rsquo; imprisonment, for breaches of EU laws.  That would be a dangerous development for a parliamentary democracy like Ireland.  Section 4 of the Bill will retrospectively validate all statutory instruments, including those which carry a criminal sanction, which have transposed EU legislation into Irish law since 1973.  The Government wants to fill a gaping loophole which has meant that some actions taken by the State since 1972 have not had the full authority of law.</P>
        <P>This problem was brought to light recently when a group of veterinary pharmacists brought a Supreme Court challenge.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The group stated in its legal challenge that the legislative provision under which it was being prosecuted was illegal.  The case concerned some technical aspects of the animal remedies regulations, including the alleged prescription of penicillin by pharmacists and the alleged mixing of worm and fluke treatments, which was done in advance and was therefore deemed to be manufacturing.  As a result of that loophole, these people are being prosecuted.  The potential ramifications of the case include jeopardising the careers of many of those involved with professional qualifications.  We must tread carefully with this matter.  I accept <Col N="405"/>that the Government has to deal with this loophole but it should not require rushed legislation, particularly given the dangerous precedent in section 3 of this Bill.</P>
        <P>The Bill also brings to light the role and function of the special investigations unit, SIU, in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  There have been reported instances of the SIU using a heavy hand in dealing with farmers, veterinarians and pharmacists.  One case was recently brought to my attention, and to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  It happened in Ardara in County Donegal.  The SIU officials, inspecting the potential sale of prescription drugs for animals in a pharmacy, searched the handbags of customers in that pharmacy.  That is a blatant infringement of the right to privacy of individuals who were innocent bystanders in that situation.  There is a need for checks and balances to be put in place with regard to the function and role of the special investigations unit.</P>
        <P>If the unit is to be effective into the future, it is critical that the same checks and balances that apply to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also apply to the special investigations unit.  The Minister, Deputy Treacy, is a former Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food and he is aware that the powers of the SIU in some cases far exceed those of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so it is important that checks and balances are put in place.  The D&aacute;il previously debated the need for legislation to provide for scrutiny of the Garda, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Tribunal and the Garda Ombudsman Commission have been established on a legislative basis.  However, there is no scrutiny of the SIU.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael suggested in the past that an office of agriculture ombudsman be established to deal, independently of the Department, with complaints about the Department or any of its agencies.  It should encompass the role of the agriculture appeals office, which is not independent of the Department of Agriculture and Food but should be.  This would ensure a balance in the legislation that does not currently exist.</P>
        <P>The powers being conferred by this Bill are extremely dangerous as there is no provision for checks and balances in terms of D&aacute;il scrutiny.  The Government can bring forward regulations without consultation.  Rules made up on the whim of the Minister, as a substitute for law, can be passed through the Oireachtas.  Legislation will effectively criminalise individuals or threaten persons or put them out of business.  Surely this should be based on laws passed following discussion in the D&aacute;il and the Upper House.</P>
        <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;Since 1973, the European Community treaty has obliged Irish Governments to transpose Community regulations, directives and decisions to translate Community law into Irish law&rdquo;.  I accept that.  My difficulty is not with EU law but with the word &ldquo;translate&rdquo;.  The Minister knows as well as I do that it is the interpretation of EU directives, rules and regulations that is <Col N="406"/>causing the problems for people, be they farmers, pharmacists, veterinarians or fishermen.  The Minister described the Bill as short and technical, but it is far from that.</P>
        <P>This is a Government of blank cheques.  That applies not only to the Taoiseach but also to the Minister for Transport with regard to e-voting, the HSE with regard to PPARS and the infamous Bertie bowl.  However, this Bill is the mother and father of all blank cheques.  It is a blank cheque for red tape and bureaucracy, which can be introduced on foot of any idle thought or whim of a Minister.  It is extremely dangerous legislation and it will persecute ordinary, law abiding individuals throughout the State.  I implore the Minister to withdraw it.</P>
        <P>It is the interpretation by the Irish Government and its officials of EU law that causes the difficulty.  We have seen the difficulties it has caused with the nitrates directive and the cross-compliance inspections that are taking place.  In that regard, the Minister for Agriculture and Food has said that no notice inspections have been forced on us by the European Commission, yet Commissioner Fischer Boel has been quoted as saying there is no need for no notice inspections.  A delegation from the IFA visited Germany recently and found that there are no such inspections in Germany.  Every farmer there is given adequate notice of inspections.</P>
        <P>There is also the case of the prescription-only medicine rules.  A completely different interpretation of those rules was taken by Ireland than was taken by Northern Ireland.  Across the Border, veterinarians, licensed merchants and pharmacists can write prescriptions for animal medicines; on this side of the Border, only veterinarians can do it.  The Minister says EU regulations are forcing this regime but there is a different interpretation on the other side of the Border.  The difficulty is that this jurisdiction adopts the strictest possible interpretation of EU law and now, under this Bill, it will not be scrutinised or reviewed by the Oireachtas.  That is a dangerous precedent.</P>
        <P>There is huge frustration, especially in the agricultural community, with the layers of red tape and bureaucracy that is choking farmers.  The amount of paperwork, box ticking, form filling, inspections, re-inspections, limits, regulations and directives has ballooned in recent years.  When departmental officials and agricultural advisers openly admit that they are bewildered by the array of bureaucracy that confronts the farming community, what hope is there for the farmers?  We are consistently told in the House that it is not the Government&rsquo;s fault but that it is being forced on us by Brussels, yet when the same law is transposed into national legislation in the other member states it is always the case that the interpretation adopted by Ireland is far more strict and rigid.</P>
        <P>Now a Minister can simply sign a regulation to bring into force his or her interpretation of the legislation and it is not open to scrutiny by either <Col N="407"/>the Houses of the Oireachtas or a committee of the Houses.  That is extremely dangerous.  I have been a Member of the House for ten years and I have never seen such legislation brought before it in that time.  The problem is not even the levels of bureaucracy coming from Europe but the translation that is adopted by Ministers in its transposition in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has had to deal with complaints from farmers about the nitrates directive.  He will have told them that Brussels is forcing it on us, that there have been court cases about it and so forth.  He will also have dealt with farmers on the issue of cross-compliance.  Again, he will have told them that it is being forced on us by Brussels and that we have no choice.  The interpretation used in Ireland is causing the problem in 95% of cases but the Minister of State now informs us that this House will no longer be able to debate or approve it.  This is the reason for the strength of our opposition to the Bill.  Things are bad enough with the nitrates directive but the soil directive is on its way down the line.  I have already expressed my concerns that the Department of Agriculture and Food is not directly involved in the negotiations on the soil directive.  This is not in the interests of Irish agriculture or farmers.  We have witnessed the conflict between the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and between Teagasc and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the implementation of the nitrates directive.  At least on that occasion the legislation had to be laid before the House for debate and discussion.  If this Bill had been in place when the nitrates directive was being introduced, there would have been no debate and no discussion.  As soon as the ink was dry on the Minister&rsquo;s signature, it would have become law and not open to any further discussion.</P>
        <P>The soil directive as currently proposed would impose serious restrictions on how farmers are allowed to farm and use their land in the future.  Despite the major consequences of this directive for farmers, the Minister for Agriculture and Food has failed to take a lead role in ensuring it does not end up placing unworkable restrictions on them.  This will be a repetition of the nitrates fiasco but on this occasion the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will hold all the aces and there will be no discussion or debate on it.</P>
        <P>Farmers are sickened by the amount of bureaucracy which has been introduced in the past five years by the Government.  Speaking in this House on the introduction of the single farm payment, the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Walsh, said that this would give farmers the freedom to farm.  Since then we have had the nitrates directive and the soil directive is coming.  The animal transport regulations were introduced on 1 January 2007 and the prescription-only <Col N="408"/>medicines regulations will kick in from July of this year.  New rules and regulations have been introduced for butchers while new rules and regulations introduced over recent years have closed down more than half of our abattoirs.  Butchers and abattoirs are the only two elements of the beef and lamb industry to provide some form of competition to the stranglehold which the processing industry exerts on those two trades.  Restrictions have been introduced on the live exports trade; we are told they have been forced upon us by Brussels.  Other regulations include those relating to cross-compliance and no-notice inspections.</P>
        <P>Under the current system, there is at least some vehicle by which the House can debate these rules and regulations.  However, the Minister of State now informs us that the opportunity will no longer exist.  Section 3(2) of the Bill states that the Minister can repeal or amend provisions and apply them with or without modification, either by law or by an existing statutory instrument, without the need to lay them before the House.  It is extremely dangerous to allow such a provision to be put in place.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the Bill gives a blank cheque to the validation of statutory instruments introduced up to now.  This has been used over the years by certain officials in various Departments to threaten people.  It is reprehensible to see a question mark over the legal basis for these actions.</P>
        <P>I suggest the Minister of State give serious consideration to this legislation.  Bad and all as the rules and regulations are that have been introduced and forced upon us &mdash; it is alleged &mdash; by Brussels, the interpretation of them in this Bill has caused the greatest difficulty regarding the statutory instruments which have been introduced.  There will be no vehicle for us to debate these regulations or to question departmental officials on their implementation.  The Minister will work solely on the advice he or she receives from his or her officials.  This is a dangerous development.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has spoken at length about the need to bring the European Union closer to us and that we should be opening it up and making it more transparent so that everyone in society becomes part of the whole democratic process.  However, the Minister of State is putting this further away than ever from the citizens of this country.  He is taking it out of this Chamber.  It is unacceptable to remove the political input from such power which is being given to Ministers who can at will introduce layers of bureaucracy and red tape that is putting farmers out of business and even before the effect of the soil directive.  Fishermen are being prosecuted and persecuted and there are problems in many other sectors caused by anomalies.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to think seriously about his proposal and the impact it will have in his own constituency and in my constituency which adjoins it.  Regulations will be introduced <Col N="409"/>and their true potential will be obvious when they impact on the ground.  It will be all well and good until his constituent or my constituent is hauled into the Circuit Court in Ballinasloe or Roscommon and is  jailed for three years or has a fine of &euro;500,000 imposed and loses his single farm payments because of some technical breach of some obscure piece of EU legislation that has had no scrutiny and which has been interpreted in a particular way by officials.  This will be a millstone around the necks of ordinary people.</P>
        <P>It is important that this House has proper supervision of and proper debate on proposals, yet this scrutiny is being taken away from Members and Ministers are being given <i>carte blanche </i>to use red tape and bureaucracy.  It should not be allowed and it is morally wrong.  I ask the Minister of State to withdraw that element of the Bill at least.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I listened to the Minister of State when he introduced the Bill.  If one were to take it at face value, one could say that this is just another step on the road in the legal workings of the European Union and that the Attorney General has examined the Bill.  It could be argued that this Bill would be good for ordinary people.  </P>
        <P>It is well known in the House that my party is pro-European.  I am a very pro-European person and this sentiment is shared by many hundreds of thousands of Irish people.  There are many good reasons for this attitude.  Many years ago both the Minister of State and I were members of the Macra na Feirme organisation.  We canvassed day and night to ensure that this country joined the European Union.  I am sure the Minister of State remembers that time well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>We were there together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>We did so for many reasons.  The objectives at that time were no different from what they are today.  We did it because Ireland is an island nation and an exporting nation.  There is obviously a limit to what we could do if we were not in cahoots, in co-operation and joined in so many ways &mdash; industrially, socially and educationally &mdash; with Europe.  This was the great dream.  I sincerely hope the next generation of Irish people will consider that dream important for everybody.</P>
        <P>As has been noted on many occasions in this and other EU parliaments, a wide gulf has emerged between citizens of the European Union and its institutions.  A &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude prevails, with a large majority of Irish people no longer laying claim to what is happening in Strasbourg or Brussels because people do not have any connection with EU decision makers.  The Minister of State takes his job seriously and will have heard this issue being raised during many discussions with various organisations and individ<Col N="410"/>uals.  This gulf would have emerged irrespective of which Government was in power.</P>
        <P>France is a large country which has subscribed to the concept of European union from the outset.  It was not a Johnny-come-lately, having signed the treaty in 1956.  Despite this, it rejected a referendum on the proposed European constitution.  While the populations of France and the Netherlands continue to support the general concept, they do not like certain aspects of the European Union and said so when given an opportunity to express themselves in the secrecy of the ballot box.</P>
        <P>We have secured many stunning successes in referendums on European affairs and I hope we will achieve many more.  I believe, however, that if more legislation such as the Bill before us were to be introduced, we would have serious problems trying to convince people to continue supporting Irish involvement in an outfit such as the European Union.  I do not want to overstate the case as one must always take a balanced view.  However, if Ireland was to hold a referendum and put this Bill to the people, it would be rejected by a margin of 80% to 20%.</P>
        <P>I oppose the legislation because it calls to mind the process of delivering a registered letter.  In future, the registered letter &mdash; legislation from Brussels &mdash; will arrive on the Cabinet table and the Government&rsquo;s only involvement will be to sign an acknowledgement of receipt.  The Houses, vocational groups and members of the business community will have no input into decisions.  This approach cannot be good for the relationship between citizens and the European Union.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt the Minister of State has good legal reasons for introducing the Bill and while I do not agree with his opening remarks, I am not a constitutional lawyer.  I know when something is wrong and this legislation is flawed.  The Minister of State indicated the Bill was small.  In his view, it should be rammed through the House in an hour or two.  The sentiments expressed in this debate reflect those expressed by Senators.  Leaving aside opposition for the sake of it, many people have genuine misgivings about the principle involved in the Bill.  I do not believe my interpretation of the way ordinary people think is too far wrong.  This Bill will cause great trouble in future.</P>
        <P>The central tenets of the European Union&rsquo;s primary goal may have been refined but have remained fundamentally the same over the years.  Apart from the noble ambition to avoid further war in Europe, the Community was established to ensure the living standards of its people would increase to a level that would not otherwise be achieved in the absence of co-operation.  This principle has been proved correct.  Ireland, for example, has done very well out of the European Union and I hope we will continue to play our part in it.</P>
        <P>Irish people and most other nationalities are not prepared to cross a certain line.  Although the <Col N="411"/>sky will not fall tomorrow if the Bill becomes law, the principle it enshrines will come back to haunt future Governments.  As the Minister of State is aware, thousands of decisions are taken in Brussels every week.  The human brain could not keep up with them, particularly given the population of the European Union, its many problems and the range of issues addressed by EU legislation.</P>
        <P>When a Bill of this nature appears, we are informed that a decision has been taken in the various EU organs in the interests of Europe.  In 1972, an undertaking was given that national parliaments would be given an opportunity to discuss decisions.  Countries such as Denmark even tied government ministers to a commitment that proposals would only be agreed once they had been approved by parliament.  Our approach is less strict and involves the Committee on European Affairs and other bodies.  If all 27 member states decided not to agree to any proposals in Brussels without first securing the approval of their respective national parliaments, it would be virtually impossible to reach decisions.  However, there is a middle way.  Until now, the Oireachtas had an opportunity, either in the Chamber or at committee, to discuss all legislation emanating from Brussels.  I understood it was proposed in the Seanad to place a copy of all legislation in the Oireachtas Library for 21 working days.  This would be a simple matter.</P>
        <P>Several of my colleagues have adverted to the fact that if Senators and the democratically elected Members of Parliament are not entitled to make this input, Parliament will clearly not be able to change legislation.  In cases where anything is involved that might be contrary to a vital national interest, which can often happen, there should be a way for this democracy to say &ldquo;No, our interpretation of that is different&rdquo;.  It will form the basis of the European Union&rsquo;s decision to introduce that law, but the way in which we transpose it into Irish law will be more suitable for us.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Naughten said, rural Ireland in particular has many reasons to be unhappy with the way in which this measure was transposed, given that at that stage we thought we had the opportunity to do so.  Can one imagine what would happen if we had no say in the matter?  Bureaucratic messing and madness of the highest order went on with our farm inspections.  The Minister of State knows all about it.  Most farmers are now part time and are afraid that when they come home from work they will find somebody in a field checking whether they meet the requirements of various schemes they have entered.  I can speak with a certain amount of authority on this subject.</P>
        <P>Everyone accepts that there must be checks and balances in every system.  A validation system, run by the Government or the EU, is required to ensure that subsidy schemes are being <Col N="412"/>run correctly.  No government, including our own, can back away from that task.  Matters can go overboard, however.  In 2006, we were foolish enough to believe that the diktat of on-farm inspections without prior notification had been signed in red ink in Brussels and that we had to put up with it.  Only two months ago, however, it transpired that the German Government was not using this system.  Berlin accepted the necessity of on-farm inspections but that Government said it would give German farmers 24 or 48 hours&rsquo; notice that inspectors were coming.  I cannot speak on behalf of all Irish farmers, but there is a major difference between the system as it operates in Germany and officials coming on to a farm unannounced.</P>
        <P>It was the same with the nitrates directive when we went into convulsions about it.  The EU wanted that directive to be prescribed in a certain manner yet when it came down to our Minister, it appeared we were talking about a different matter.  Although the Government has the numbers to implement this measure, I urge the Minister to think hard about it first.  I assume that like most factors of this type, it will be forgotten about in a week&rsquo;s time.  I guarantee, however, that it is establishing an unwelcome precedent.</P>
        <P>I presume the Cabinet examined this matter in great detail but what would be wrong with accepting the Opposition amendments tabled in the Seanad?  If that were done, all such proposals would be placed in the Oireachtas Library for 21 days prior to ministerial signature.  It may be a small step but at least it would mean there was some control by elected representatives who would have the chance to inspect such measures.  In addition, expert views could be sought before the measures were signed by the Minister.</P>
        <P>I spoke earlier about a widening gulf between the EU establishment and ordinary working people.  We may get to a situation whereby the European constitution will have to be changed again.  In an ever-changing society it is not unreasonable to expect that in ten or 15 years&rsquo; time something like this will recur.  If that happens, we will find that it will be done by parliaments alone, with no discussion concerning referenda.  Some countries may not have the confidence to get such a measure through so all of a sudden it will become our problem.</P>
        <P>Serious matters affecting business, education, farming or other sectors should be decided by referendum to allow the people to say what they think.  We should never sway from that basic principle.  If there is much more legislation like this, where our only input is to sign a registered letter, we may be considered good Europeans but will it be good for Ireland?  Will it be good for the men and women we represent?  That is the question.  Some of the things that happened in this country as a result of decisions made by bureaucrats in Brussels certainly did not suit us.  We would not be up to speed if we did not state categorically <Col N="413"/>how that happened and why it should be stopped.  This Bill will not help in that regard.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael will be tabling amendments to the Bill, one of which was discussed in the Seanad.  I think that, deep down, the Minister of State does not disagree with many of the points I have made.  I hope he sees the error of his ways before this Bill is enacted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on this legislation.  In his speech, the Minister of State said: &ldquo;The Bill relates to the implementation of routine Community directives and day to day regulations into Irish law through secondary legislation&rdquo;.  That is what worries me most about this Bill.  As one who was deeply involved in the referendum campaign on EU membership, I want to state clearly that I was, still am and always will be truly committed to the European idea.  However, I cannot and will not accept some of the things I have seen happening in recent years, including the way individuals have been treated through over-regulation by Irish laws which are often blamed on Brussels.  Members will be aware that as chairman of a European committee on beef and veal for a number of years, I dealt with Commission officials at the highest level.  In that context, I know what I am talking about.  It is extremely difficult to understand how and why we have implemented some of those regulations.</P>
        <P>I remember sitting here with Alan Dukes during the debates on regulations to deal with the foot and mouth crisis.  We, the then Labour spokesman and others got a commitment from the then Minister, Deputy Walsh, that while the regulations he had to introduce were essential, and he wanted our support for them, he would bring them to the House 12 months later to have them discussed again.  That 12 months has long passed.  Although we asked for them to be discussed several times, it has never happened.  Once legislation such as this Bill is passed, it is ultimate and is the means used to deal with these issues.</P>
        <P>I find it hard to understand how the Bill can be retrospective.  While the Government has obviously taken legal advice, when we sought retrospective legislation in other areas, such as health, we were advised it was not possible and could not be considered.  Will the Minister of State explain the legal basis for this aspect of the Bill?</P>
        <P>The Bill is necessary in some form due to the background outlined by the Minister of State with regard to legal actions taken by a number of different groups.  While we fully understand the need for it, its provisions are frightening, in particular the total ministerial power for which it provides.  It is suggested it would clog up the work of the House if we had to reconsider regulations in the House on a regular basis but in fact the House is totally under-utilised.  While the committee rooms might be effective &mdash; in some ways they are the most effective area of the Houses &mdash; they <Col N="414"/>do not get any recognition or media coverage.  In that context, this Chamber should sit on a much more regular basis, which would provide the opportunity to discuss regulations and not simply have them approved by ministerial order, which is dangerous.</P>
        <P>Some issues raised by Deputies Connaughton and Naughten cannot be over-emphasised.  No group has benefited more from our entry to the European Union than farmers.  This is beyond question and there are major benefits yet to come from Europe.  However, farmers are also subject to a litany of red tape and bureaucracy.  When I visit other European countries with fellow Oireachtas Members to see the type of farming that happens there and how these countries compete with us, I am extremely anxious for the future.  That is why the implications of the Bill are so important.</P>
        <P>I was concerned by an on-farm inspection at the farm of one of my closest friends.  His wife&rsquo;s brother had died suddenly on the morning of the inspection but that was no excuse.  He did not have much education so his wife had to deal with the book-keeping on the farm.  She had to abandon her brother&rsquo;s relatives and remain on the farm during the inspection.  That is a long way from the Christian Ireland in which I and the Minister of State were brought up.  There should be some degree of common sense and an understanding of how problems like that should be handled.</P>
        <P>In another example, the mother of four children, who was expecting twins, had her farm inspected.  Although the man in charge of the farm had died a few weeks earlier and she had not appointed a replacement, the inspection took place regardless.  As all the sheep could not be found on the hills of west Cavan that day, she has never been paid.  It was literally an army that was brought in to carry out that inspection.  Such an approach cannot continue if we are to retain any level of progressive farming.</P>
        <P>With regard to the food industry, in the past an abattoir was attached to most butchers&rsquo; shops in towns and villages but that is no longer the case because regulations were imposed far beyond the letter of the law.  Despite this, the product today is no better, cleaner or more acceptable to the housewife than it was 25 or 30 years ago, when high quality butchers were using their own animals, slaughtered in their own yards, for the use of the people.  However, the laws are not being imposed to the same degree in other European countries.  The then Minister, Deputy Walsh, promised five years ago that this matter would be dealt with, but nothing has happened.  All we have is a further decline in these activities.</P>
        <P>Can we not have a common sense approach to the issue of red tape?  We have forced most of our farmers into part-time farming because of the income crisis.  As another Deputy noted, when a farmer comes home from work to find an inspector has been on the farm all day and will be there <Col N="415"/>the following morning, it is not easy for him to organise time off work to ensure he can look after his rights and entitlements.</P>
        <P>I met the father of a farmer in Cavan late last year.  When I visited that farm soon afterwards, I found the farmer had been the subject of eight inspections last year despite the farm being a single unit.  The farmer had to take time off to go through all sorts of bureaucracy and red tape.  During one inspection, the inspectors had to telephone headquarters a number of times to get explanations of what they were looking for because the forms were so detailed.  This sort of bureaucracy must be addressed.</P>
        <P>I visited Scotland recently with colleagues from the Minister of State&rsquo;s party.  We were told in no uncertain terms that the Scots did not have to deal with the nitrates directive or red tape in the way we must.  The previous speaker dealt with the situation in Germany.  If the situation which applies in other countries applied here, we would not have a problem supporting the Bill.</P>
        <P>A farmer may have given his life to build up a farm but because somebody arrives on the farm one day and has a problem with how the unit is run, he can lose all his income for that year &mdash; as the Minister of State knows, the single payment in many cases is 80% to 100% of his profit.  It is different for somebody who robs or does damage to property.  If such a person goes to court, as happened recently in my area, he or she can get off on a technicality if the Book of Evidence has not been fully processed, for example, and walk free.  If there is one technicality at farm level, whether a lost tag or a box not filled in properly by an uneducated farmer, he or she is likely to lose the entire payment.  These are issues the Government, or whatever Government replaces it this summer, must deal with immediately.</P>
        <P>The frustration at farm and food industry level is unbelievable.  The fear and dread are unbelievable.  Farmers are getting out of the business.  People of the calibre of John Boylan and many others are getting out of the business as a result of frustration.  It is not the smallest farmers nor the least educated, but the best who are getting fed up with all the red tape.</P>
        <P>It is legal for a farmer to spread slurry today, but slurry spreading is done by the calendar, not by following common sense.  We have allowed ourselves to be forced down on such issues, supposedly by Brussels.  As far as the nitrates directive is concerned, it was not Brussels which forced us, but the enactment of the legislation.  We have got the worst deal imaginable as a result.  Farmers must take their slurry miles in January to get it into somebody else&rsquo;s tank.  Farmers have had no choice about when to spread their slurry, yet yesterday garda&iacute; were out on the roads warning farmers to be careful about bringing slurry onto the roads on their tractor wheels and causing problems for road users.  This is the sort of farming to which we are reduced.  These types of regu<Col N="416"/>lations worry us.  We look at the nitrates directive as something that just concerns nitrates, but its introduction means farmers cannot use phosphates either.  Until recently, many farmers were not aware of this.</P>
        <P>Farm organisations are extremely worried about the Bill as it stands.  I understand it is necessary to deal with legal issues, but Fine Gael will bring forward amendments to try and make it acceptable and to ensure the House has some role to play in what the European Union hands down to us.  It is vital that industry, whether farming or any other sector, is not tied by ministerial order in red tape without the issues having been thought through.  I, more than most, am committed to Europe and have seen how it works here and elsewhere.  We in Ireland are good Europeans to the extreme in our observation of the regulations.</P>
        <P>Some years ago as a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food I visited Chicago where we saw the large market where agricultural produce is sold.  We also saw a beef, dairy and poultry farm run by three brothers some distance outside the city.  The beef was produced with the use of hormones, the milk with steroids and they used anything they could to improve the growth of the chickens so as to get their produce to market as early and as cheaply as possible.  When I asked the Taoiseach if these practices were allowable under WHO rules, he said they were.  They are different rules than we have here and the quality of the product is different, yet we must compete with such practices.</P>
        <P>When we see industries like Motorola and many others are going to the wall, we realise the importance of indigenous industry and farming for the nation.  We cannot ignore the fact that people have a right to this industry.  We can produce at farm and factory level as well if not better than anywhere else provided we are not impeded by rules and fines that come through a Bill such as this which is completely unacceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill, particularly as it relates directly to the work I have been doing over the past two and a half to three years in the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>This is a short Bill and has been described by the Minister as a short, technical Bill.  It has been introduced on a Thursday afternoon for debate and if one was not careful, it would be deemed insignificant legislation that was just being passed out of necessity.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is an extremely significant proposition we are debating.  In summary, what the Government seems to be trying to achieve is to avoid the inconvenience of having to debate the transposition of European Union directives into Irish law in the House, though obviously we can still seek clarity on a range of issues.  The Government wants to be able to introduce sanctions for breaches of EU directives, with fines of up to <Col N="417"/>&euro;500,000 and three years&rsquo; imprisonment, by ministerial order, without discussion or debate.</P>
        <P>What is of most concern is that the Government wants to be able to amend primary legislation by statutory instrument, when necessary, to give effect to EU law.  Again, this would be without discussion or debate if it suited the Government at the time.  In other words, it would be on the whim of the Minister or Government to decide whether it was appropriate for the Oireachtas or the Opposition to discuss or debate what the Minister decided was appropriate to introduce.</P>
        <P>Let me be clear on one issue.  Fine Gael has consistently been the strongest supporter of the EU project and the principles behind it.  We continue to maintain that position.  Unlike some colleagues from other parties, I have no intention of using this debate to try and throw cheap shots at the European Union and the way it does business or the way it is trying to improve doing business.</P>
        <P>The Bill is not being driven by Brussels or Strasbourg.  The Government hand is not being forced on the issue.  The Bill is about how our Government decides to deal with decisions and legislation agreed collectively at EU level and about how we transpose those decisions into Irish law and how we enforce them.  The Bill is a Government decision.  Before the heat comes on the Government and we get the usual response of &ldquo;This is Brussels forcing our hand on the issue&rdquo; or &ldquo;We must introduce the legislation because it is being forced upon us&rdquo;, let me say that is not the situation.  The debate is welcome because there is a genuine problem with which the Government must deal, but I will deal with that later.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the issue because we need to look at how EU directives are debated and introduced in Ireland and at how they are enforced.  I have been a member of the European Parliament for the past three years.  The directives that will be transposed into Irish law next year and result from issues discussed and debated in the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission during this year and last.  Ironically, when we consider what is happening with this legislation, it is interesting that what has been happening in Brussels is that the European Parliament is getting more rather than less power.  Ten or 15 years ago we could have said the European Parliament existed, but it was not nearly as powerful as the other two institutions, the Commission and the Council, which were the big decision makers.  Much has changed in recent years and the European Parliament, which speaks on behalf of the people, if one may put it in such terms, is now an equal partner involved in a co-decision process with the Council on most matters.  The Minister will be well aware of that, having had to deal with many parliamentary resolutions that have landed on his desk.  The change in Brussels and Strasbourg has been inconvenient for the Commission and the Council, but it has been good for democratic principles of trans<Col N="418"/>parency and accountability in European law-making.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Today in Ireland, we are doing the opposite, saying that it is too inconvenient and time-consuming, with too many directives and sanctions that must be introduced to ensure that Ireland fulfils its responsibility to implement them.  It is felt that we do not have time in the Chamber to debate everything fully in the same way as we would debate primary legislation.  That was the attitude in Brussels ten years ago on the part of the Council and Commission when they wanted to avoid the inconvenient process of involving the Parliament.</P>
   <?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>That sometimes prolongs the process but is more democratic and transparent, while also ensuring that fewer mistakes are made and the EU becomes more open.  In that way, facing the challenges of the next ten to 15 years, we could bring people with us, unlike what happened in the past, when the EU unfortunately failed in that respect, the constitutional referenda in France and the Netherlands providing the most recent examples.</P>
        <P>That is why I am so concerned about this legislation, which is contrary to our goals in Europe.  One of those is more efficiency and I understand the Government&rsquo;s concerns regarding this Bill, which endeavours to make it easier to introduce sanctions expeditiously.  Unfortunately, however, democracy is not always that convenient and in this instance concerns about openness and transparency must override the Minister&rsquo;s arguments regarding convenience and efficiency.</P>
        <P>I recognise that the Government must deal with a problem.  This issue is far too important for us to embarrass or oppose the Government reflexively.  The way to deal with it is surely to sit down with the Opposition and acknowledge the problem.  A raft of legislation must be introduced in Ireland, with a further raft of amendments to existing legislation, to ensure that we adhere to European commitments.  We must also introduce sanctions to ensure that people comply with regulations to which we have signed up.  I do not believe that, if something is unpopular, we should ease off on the sanctions.  There must be sanctions for breaches of the rules, whether by farmers or fishermen.</P>
        <P>They must be fair, however, and if we are to make such decisions, we must have proper accountability rather than introducing something quietly without discussing the matter with other parties.  The Minister would find Fine Gael very receptive to attempts to find a sensible way to pass legislation more efficiently and quickly &mdash; &ldquo;fast-track&rdquo; is the wrong word &mdash; when dealing with specific urgent European issues.  We are obliged to do that, and we will co-operate with it, but we will not agree to the Government deciding that it is no longer the role of the Oireachtas but that of Ministers, since it has made commitments at a European level, wishing to make the required changes by ministerial order.</P><Col N="419"/>
        <P>That is not how the EU works.  As the Minister knows, we reach collective decisions in a range of areas through debate and discussion, with consensus achieved between the three institutions.  Then the legislation, directive, strategy or plan from Brussels goes to the individual member states, who transpose it into national legislation tailor-made for the country concerned within that framework.  While there are exceptions, that is generally what happens.</P>
        <P>However, we are now proposing that such tailoring be decided by a Minister, allowing no say to people such as Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy Kenny, or me.  That is not how a democracy functions.  If a Government decides how laws should be introduced and what level of sanctions, including imprisonment, should be imposed if rules are breached, that is a dictatorship.  As a staunch pro-European who seeks efficiency in line with the Lisbon Agenda, with fewer laws and better, fairer implementation, I cannot support what the Minister proposes.  Nor can the other parties on the Opposition benches.</P>
        <P>When visiting universities and schools to convince people that our work in Brussels is relevant to their lives, I state the accurate fact that up to 70% of legislation that passes through the D&aacute;il and Seanad is a case of the Government legislating to fulfil EU commitments.  That is true whether the area is the environment, agriculture, fisheries, or hygiene standards in shops, restaurants and public houses.  The laws introduced and debated here regularly originate in the Government&rsquo;s transposition of EU directives into our law.</P>
        <P>We are not talking here of a small number of inconvenient measures that must be introduced but about most legislation and its attendant sanctions.  We are proposing to change fundamentally the way in which this House does its business, yet this debate is happening on a Thursday afternoon when most people do not even know what we are discussing.  That is why there has been such a strong reaction from my party, with speaker after speaker lining up.</P>
        <P>I will give examples of directives being introduced that may require sanctions.  The nitrates directive has been raised by many speakers and although Government representatives will always sell it as the EU nitrates directive, it is really just the Government&rsquo;s nitrates action plan to comply with that directive.  They have got it wrong, and it is too restrictive, but it is coming.  Do we seriously propose that, if the Minister deems it necessary, we should introduce or increase sanctions relating to the nitrates directive that will impinge on farmers and their families?  Do we propose that, in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy, if a fisherman breaches the law and a Minister decides to introduce the sanction of imprisonment, he or she should be able to do so without consulting the rest of this House?</P>
        <P>I have no problem with examining more efficient ways of piloting legislation and, if neces<Col N="420"/>sary, tough sanctions, through the House, but I do not like being excluded from that process when I have been elected to make such decisions.  If I were on the Government side of the House, I hope I would take the same view, even if it were less convenient for me, since I would have to address Opposition concerns and sometimes the playing of politics with situations that are difficult for the Government and subject to time constraints regarding implementation.</P>
        <P>Laws are laws, even if they are introduced primarily by a Minister and have nothing to do with European law.  The origins of legislation do not matter, but the impact of such legislation on people&rsquo;s lives matters.  That is the reason this House exists and we have a system whereby a Government is held to account if it makes poor decisions.  It should be no different whether those decisions are based on EU directives or on law and order, an area in which the European Union does not generally intervene.</P>
        <P>If a family&rsquo;s life is affected by the laws we pass, we should all have a say because we represent such people.  We are elected to do that job.  Up to 70% of the legislation going through this House is introduced by the Government in line with its commitments at European level.  Most of the legislation coming through here has improved the quality of people&rsquo;s lives dramatically over the past 20 years in terms of the air we breathe, water we drink and hygiene standards that we benefit from etc.</P>
        <P>If we now say we can amend legislation retrospectively or introduce new sanctions without the matters coming through this House, we will be saying that 70% of the legislation we are now passing can be changed by a Minister with no consultation, debate or scrutiny at Oireachtas level.  Is that what the Government is standing over?  If it is, the process will be fundamentally anti-democratic and anti-European.</P>
        <P>The irony is that the supposed reason behind the need for this legislation is that so many directives come from Brussels and there is insufficient time to debate all of them.  As Governments are elected to make decisions, the Government will make decisions on behalf of the Irish people on a range of issues.  That argument is rubbish and the Minister of State knows it.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas exists for a reason and if laws are being changed we must be involved in the process.  This Bill excludes us, which is why it needs to be changed.  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw it and come back with amended legislation.  I hope I speak for my party when I say he will get a positive response from Fine Gael in trying to find a more efficient but democratic manner of introducing or amending legislation, or introducing criminal sanction relating to EU law obligations.</P>
        <P>In his opening statement outlining why he could not support the Bill, Deputy Costello summed up the position well in bullet-point form.  He stated that introducing offences and changing laws requires democratic scrutiny, and I agree <Col N="421"/>with that.  I also agree with his point that these issues should continue to have the same scrutiny process as any other primary legislation; in amending any legislation, we would debate it.</P>
        <P>He indicated that there is a significant shift in powers from the Oireachtas to Ministers.  I agree with this and believe it is fundamentally anti-democratic.  Deputy Costello is correct in arguing that this is a rubber-stamping process taking in a significant amount of legislation.  This allows Ministers to make policy changes in addition to technical alterations to legislation without consultation at Oireachtas level.  He stated this Bill is a dilution of democracy, which it is.  This makes it, ironically, anti-European and it should be withdrawn.</P>
        <P>This Bill is mostly about convenience and making life easier for the Government.  It is also about making it easier for Departments to make changes and recommendations without having to go through the headache of consulting difficult people or those with a different viewpoint.</P>
        <P>The two main political parties in this House would agree on most European issues and there would not be very much difficulty in getting consensus for most of the recommendations that need to be introduced.  The Government will have a big problem now if it decides to go it alone in introducing sanctions and amending primary legislation where necessary.</P>
        <P>This has implications for the credibility of the European Union, or the European project as people now term it.  Many serious issues must be tackled as a European Union and we must sell to our people in Ireland the strategy we propose to adopt as a Union.  This type of legislation will make people more cynical and will result in more people blaming Europe for difficulties we have instead of seeing it for what it is.  It should be a very positive force to improve the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and provide stability and opportunity for business, travel, study, work and other quality of life factors.</P>
        <P>We are instead witnessing cloak and dagger action where the Government is taking it upon itself, through Ministers, to do the job.  Ministers will make decisions fundamental to Irish law and people&rsquo;s lives without consultation and scrutiny.  They will make mistakes as a result and people will suffer because the opinions are not being sought of people with opposing views.  That is wrong and is a reason this Bill should be withdrawn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been significant debate on this issue all morning and there is much objection to the introduction of the Bill.  There was also much debate over a sea fisheries Bill, with the Supreme Court finding it in breach of a directive.  That debate focused attention on other Departments and was at the time very controversial because the Minister stated there was difficulty in imposing EU laws in light of the Supreme Court case.</P><Col N="422"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill would include a provision for retrospectively dealing with issues from 1972 onwards.  It is regrettable that there would be no debate in the D&aacute;il on this nor a forum for debating the issues.  Parliamentary scrutiny, which is very important, will be lost.  There is also the matter of constitutionality, as treating all statutory instruments as Acts of the Oireachtas is a sweeping change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is right about that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The statutory instrument is not an Act, it is a catch-all measure.  This comes back to Kennedy and the Attorney General.  It is regrettable that we did not include all the orders in this Bill.  We are talking about 1972 and a statutory instrument is not an Act of the Oireachtas.  There is no debate on the impact of this and for every action there will be a reaction.</P>
        <P>Deputy Durkan spoke on the matter and clearly established the possible risks involved.</P>
        <P>One must consider the retrospective nature of Government action on many issues in the past.  In the case of illegal charges on the elderly the Government raised the Statute of Limitations.  Originally, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, came here with a regulation that the measure would apply retrospectively only for a month.  That was proven unconstitutional and the President would not sign it into law.  It was then overturned and made apply retrospectively for a six year period.  How is the Statute of Limitations qualified in this legislation?  Perhaps the Minister of State might explain how the Government indicated, on the basis of the Statute of Limitations, that the repayments to those charged illegally could apply retrospectively only for a six year period, even though the case went back 25 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Statute of Limitations is clear.  It only lasts for a specific period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Does statute law apply to directives involving the imposition of a fine?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>It applies if the necessary action would not have been taken to proceed within a particular period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>We were speaking of the six-year statute bar.  How would this impact on the constitutionality of a case that went back 12 years?</P>
        <P>This will give a wrong signal, even if this involved attaching all the orders to it.  This involves thousands of statutory instruments and directives.  Ireland has benefited considerably from Europe and in every sense the Irish experience has been a success story, but was it bad management that allowed this through?  Was it not identified prior to the Kennedy case that we were failing in our duty to regularise this matter in the D&aacute;il?  This involves going back to 1972, more than 34 years.  The long time involved is critically important in introducing such a sweeping change. <Col N="423"/> Why did the Minister of State need to go back as far as 1972?  Perhaps he might explain the impact of going back to 1972, rather than to 1982 or 1992.  What would be the consequences if this provision applied retrospectively to 1992 rather than for 30 years?  He might explain the impact and the likely fall-out from this.  No doubt the Minister of State has applied due diligence in assessing the consequences of the Bill and the likely impact in the future of enacting it.  It is important he explains that, although I heard him speak this morning.  He is doing a good job as Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs.</P>
        <P>It is important to put some of the down sides on the table.  For every positive there must be a negative.  I am quite certain there must be a certain level of negative impact involved in this, and it would be important to voice some of those concerns.  The one case in which I was involved was that of the illegal charges on the elderly where the State fought tirelessly to ensure the Statute of Limitations applied, even though the matter went back 25 years.  The Government is certainly cherry-picking when it speaks of acting retrospectively for such a length of time in this legislation.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the European Communities Act 1972 which allowed the transposition of certain EU law into Irish law by way of statutory instrument.  However, it has been argued by veterinary pharmacists in a legal challenge that it was not lawful to make ministerial orders that comprised criminal sanctions, and this Bill will clarify the position and will allow a Minister to transpose into Irish law EU law which carries the penalty of imprisonment or fines.</P>
        <P>The issue of fines has arisen in cases related to agriculture, the environment and fisheries.  Following the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005, it is important that issues of fines and criminal sanctions would be debated here because they will have a significant impact.  This Bill, in short, will allow the Minister to put in place a regulation that can send a person to prison without it ever appearing on the Order Paper of this House.  One must remember that to date all actions of the State have been debated in the House.  The laws of the land are created here in the House.  They are debated and voted upon.  It is the duty of the Government to bring in legislation and it is up to the establishment to implement it.  It is not good that we are considering giving a Minister such wide-ranging powers without involving validation by these Houses.</P>
        <P>The Bill also will retrospectively validate all statutory instruments made since 1973 to transpose EU legislation into Irish law, including those that compromise criminal sanction.  The main problems of the Bill are as follows.  It validates legislation retrospectively.  That was the point in the case of the illegal charges, which is only one such issue.  There was a vast number of other issues dealt with by the House.  For instance, the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 criminalised fishermen for minor offences <Col N="424"/>whereas on the Continent minor offences are dealt with by administration.  I spoke of the Government cherry-picking what suits.  We in Fine Gael have stated in the policy document launched last week that when in Government we will amend the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 to decriminalise fishermen who commit minor offences.  This is the norm within Europe and Commissioner Borg, the EU Commissioner for fisheries, has stated clearly that this is the best practice.  If the Minister of State is speaking of transposing EU statutory instruments and directives, and validating them with legislation, he is cherry-picking certain aspects of legislation.  If we are speaking here of unifying policies retrospectively and giving a Minister such legislative powers, one must consider the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005, with which I dealt quite closely and which was brought in here on a certain amount of falsified facts that there were people in breach of the law.  The case was unproven and the plaintiffs had not been brought through the courts.  It was an allegation made.  If we are speaking of decriminalisation when it comes to EU law, the Government should seriously consider decriminalising fishermen convicted of a minor offence.  Such people are now deemed as criminals.  In certain cases it prevents them from travelling to the US and to the Continent.</P>
        <P>This Bill grants Ministers too much unscrutinised authority.  It removes the European Union even further from the day-to-day lives of citizens and it removes the political input, the entire legislative function of the Oireachtas, from law making.  Legislation can pass from Brussels to national implementation without the input of the Oireachtas &mdash; that is the nub of this case.</P>
        <P>Far too often we are seeing the role of the Oireachtas being removed.  We see it in the health service, where accountability lies not with the Minister but with the HSE.  We are educated in not raising a matter with the Minister, who has now delegated this function to the HSE.  That level of accountability is not good enough.  The National Roads Authority is another such autonomous body, where the Minister for Transport tells us not to raise related matters here in the House but to contact the National Roads Authority.</P>
        <P>We are elected by the people to represent them.  Issues such as this are fundamental to the national parliament.  It is important to have a debate on Europe.  People can be quite suspicious about the entire European project when something of this nature can be brought to the D&aacute;il on a Thursday without any real debate.  It is essential that an extensive level of debate takes place on this matter.</P>
        <P>Section 3 allows a Minister to implement EC law by way of statutory instrument and to amend domestic legislation in this way without any accountability.  This leads to a concern that the authority of the Oireachtas may be superseded by individual Ministers.  It may also lead to legis<Col N="425"/>lation by stealth as the scrutiny of ministerial statutory instruments is neither as rigorous nor democratically accountable as the scrutiny of legislation.</P>
        <P>An enlarged Europe, consisting of up to 500 million people, is in question and this includes countries that joined the European Union, recently.  Other countries may join the EU in the coming years.  While Members of European Parliament are elected by the people, it is equally important to recognise the overlap of European politics, national politics and local politics that should be integrated.</P>
        <P>We have all heard about the National Forum on Europe and the openness and transparency expected of an open society.  It is clear the Government has been caught without its homework done on this matter.  The Kennedy case, which was fundamentally based on the Sea Fisheries Bill, indicated the Government was in breach of legislation in imposing EU fines on coastal communities.</P>
        <P>When before the Seanad Fine Gael did not oppose this legislation but put forward amendments to change aspects of the Bill we found of concern.  Our amendments were not accepted and our Front Bench seeks to oppose the further progress of the Bill on the basis the Government has not indicated any concern regarding the legislation or any willingness to accept amendments.</P>
        <P>We sought to amend the Bill to require that all statutory instruments deriving from European legislation be laid before the Oireachtas for 21 sitting days to allow any Member to challenge its provisions.  When no challenge is made the statutory instrument can automatically become law.  This is a fair proposal because we are not suggesting retrospectively laying thousands of statutory instruments before the Oireachtas; we are referring to the future.  If we are discussing European integration it is important people be aware of statutory instruments.  It is important that a Minister in charge of any Department can indicate that a statutory instrument is coming and put a notification to that effect on his or her website explaining that it relates to his or her Department and will be laid before the Oireachtas, with Members invited to raise parliamentary questions to bring it into the public domain if they have concerns.</P>
        <P>We would also like to remove the retrospective effect of this Bill by amendment as we do not believe it is constitutional in this regard, when one considers the statute bar of six years.  Perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Treacy, could explain why he is going back to 1973 with this measure.</P>
        <P>As the Bill passes through the D&aacute;il we should state clearly that these amendments are important.  When one hears the level of debate on this matter it is clear that people feel the European project has been an extraordinarily successful story.  People are concerned, however, at the lack of information relating to this Bill.  This is titled a short Bill but a sample scope of the types <Col N="426"/>of statutory instrument retrospectively given legislative powers should have been supplied.  What Departments do the statutory instruments affect and which have the most?  This has not been discussed.</P>
        <P>I have huge concerns because I feel this Bill is a further diminution of the role of elected Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  This is legislation the Government wanted to perfect before the conclusion of the 29th D&aacute;il and I think a marker was put down a year and a half ago.  The Sea Fisheries Bill was well debated and at that point each Department could have discussed the statutory instruments that applied to it.  The Minister of State is discussing regulations that go back over 30 years and affect 15 Departments.</P>
        <P>The Government could have done far more to explain the likely impact of this.  This is not a clean sweep but rather a very lazy way of perfecting something that should have been done many years ago.  It is regrettable the Government has taken such a lazy attitude and engaged in a cherry picking approach.  The question of the Government being duty bound to make a payment to the citizens of this State was automatically blocked.  If retrospection meant there would be a refund to the citizens of Ireland I can assure the House that such retrospection would not go back one month.  Whatever the consequences of this Bill, there will be no impact of financial benefit to any citizen &mdash; though infringements of the law may see penalties arise.  It is regrettable that we have taken this line.</P>
        <P>Many Members have taken their full allotted time to speak on this issue and the Minister of State must realise he cannot remain seated at this late stage without taking account of their concerns.  He is duty bound to give a concession and, at least, accept the amendment that in future a statutory instrument deriving from Europe be laid before the Oireachtas for 21 sitting days to allow any Member challenge its provisions and cause a debate or put down a related parliamentary question.  We are talking about the integration of local, national and EU politics and it is important that people be informed on these matters.  A Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann should be aware of statutory instruments that are signed into law and they should be discussed.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has not even formulated a procedure that would put statutory instruments on a computer database.  Such a measure would ensure statutory instruments do not arrive unannounced and that a notification period of their arrival could be given.  A system should exist in the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department that flags statutory instruments that are due and circulates them to the relevant Opposition spokespeople.  A brief explanatory notice of the impact of these statutory instruments could also be included.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am disappointed the Government has presented this as a procedural Bill that will get nodded through the House without disapproval.  The Government has misread the situation but has an opportunity to make amends.  A clear <Col N="427"/>message has been sent by speaker after speaker today urging the Minister of State to act on this.  We are talking about the European Union, European politics and national politics.  We are talking about the accountability of public representatives elected by the people and I assure the Minister of State that if he was on this side of the House and Fine Gael was introducing this Bill he would take a similar point of view to the one we have adopted.</P>
        <P>He must consider the matter objectively as he cannot be happy about the agenda that is being driven by someone.  Perhaps the Attorney General, or somebody else, is advising that this Bill can be pushed through without debate but that person is misreading the situation entirely.  We are talking about a democratic deficit and people are very concerned about European affairs.  People listening to this debate will assume we are rushing this Bill through roughshod, with Europe issuing statutory instruments and Ministers who are not accountable to the D&aacute;il left to do as they wish.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has listened attentively all day and he has an opportunity to make a concession that will show some appreciation of the input that has been made by every speaker.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is with some sadness and reluctance that I rise to speak on this Bill because I have great respect for the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and the commitment to the European project that the present Administration and its predecessor have displayed.  I am on record as having admired the way in which the last Irish Presidency carried out the responsibilities of this Republic on behalf of the then other 24 member states.  However, I must draw the attention of the House to another side to this debate.  In this regard, I note that the name of the sponsor of this Bill is Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, Leader of the Government side in the Seanad.  I am not sure whether the Bill originated in the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of Foreign Affairs, but either way, it is ill-considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the officials in Iveagh House, for whom I have much time and respect and who are under-resourced in many respects, not to forget the lesson of the first Nice referendum.  Let they not forget that we lost the debate on that referendum because there was a presumption of approval and acquiescence, which presumption can no longer be taken for granted.  I will not rehearse the debate that took place at the time or outline the way in which the Labour Party saved the nation&rsquo;s bacon, and particularly that of the Government, because I was at the European Council meeting in Gothenburg in Sweden when the only fig leaf the Government had was the proposition of a forum on Europe.  This was pro<Col N="428"/>moted by my colleague, former Deputy De Rossa, then a candidate for election to the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>The forum has proceeded with the support of the Government and has become an exemplary method of communicating Europe and the European ideal to a new generation of European citizens, including my 12 year old son, for whom Hitler, Napoleon and Attila the Hun are all grouped together in the same historical timeframe.  Included in this are the Second World War and all the reasons for wanting to bring 300 years of nationalist conflict towards consensus, conciliation and compromise, which characterise the shared sovereignty of the nation states of Europe in a unique constitutional settlement that has no parallel or equivalent in the internationalised, globalised world.</P>
        <P>As I was born in 1946, I realise we are not dealing with the same people who were involved when the Union was founded.  When I met Mitterand, Kohl and others, I noted they were children and orphans of the Second World War.  They, in their hearts, souls and flesh, said, &ldquo;Never, never again&rdquo;.  My children, however, and most of the people in this room do not relate to their experience and therefore a new narrative must be constructed and a new legitimacy must be established.  It is called democracy and accountability.  One cannot say, as is purported in section 2, that indictable offences, that is, offences that warrant punishments, charges and court hearings, can be dealt with by statutory instrument rather than primary legislation in the House.  Doing so is no way to build the Europe of the future.</P>
        <P>The Europe of the future must be built on consent and accountable democracy, which this legislation purports to reverse.  I can understand why the diplomatic service and the Administration, of which I was honoured to be part, might be stretched.  Ireland probably has the best generalists in the entire European public service, including those of the other 26 member states.  Generalists, of necessity, need fast-tracks to deal with certain issues.  From my experience as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, I know exactly what that means.</P>
        <P>We will be stripping the legitimacy of democracy if we move towards enacting this Bill.  To my friend and colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, I say we must provide extra resources within the public service to do the job that needs to be done.  This Bill is an attempt by a hard-pressed Executive and stretched public service to contend that we need a fast-track to allow us to proceed and that we do not have the time, resources or ability to proceed by way of primary legislation.  They are asking for this instrument so we can become compliant with all the regulations and requirements of the European Union.  I can understand the legitimate arguments and have heard them in the past, but <Col N="429"/>I wonder how these arguments can be counter-placed against their alternatives.</P>
        <P>There is nothing wrong with or untoward about the sentiments behind this Bill, and Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, God love her, did not write it.  No Minister got up on Monday morning and said he would connect with the electorate of Galway East by introducing a European Communities Bill on the grounds that it would get it excited, thus putting himself on top of the poll.  Rather, it is a bureaucratic Bill driven by the constraints and restraints of bureaucracy, with a view to fast-tracking a system whereby the Republic of Ireland, as a member state, could be made comply with the requirements of the Union.</P>
        <P>It is a question of indictable offences.  They may be fairly minor, such as the pollution of a stream outside Ballinasloe by a farmer in east Galway.  Having been indicted and prosecuted for such an offence in court, a farmer may well enter the constituency office of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and ask him whether he voted for this Bill.  He may ask whether the criminal offence with which he was charged and for which he incurred a fine was discussed in the House and whether the four Members from Galway East consciously stated in the House that the offence was an act of aggression against the Republic of Ireland and its territory.  The Members will say they did not vote for the creation of such an offence and that it was designed by some civil servant without reference to anybody, which civil servant decided that &euro;500 or &euro;5,000 should be the fine imposed.  The charged farmer will ask where all the Deputies were when the offence was deemed to merit such a fine.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister of State too well to believe he is serious about this Bill, which is not characteristic of democracy.  The Land League was founded in Woodford in his constituency.  One must ask why it was founded there and determine the sense of passion that drove uneducated, poor, destitute tenant farmers to do so.  They were driven by a sense of justice in the belief that the laws under which they would live would be laws to which they would give their assent, or laws that their representatives, whom they would freely elect, would construct, debate, amend and place on the Statute Book, and for which, if enacted, they would take responsibility.</P>
        <P>This Bill represents a perverse change and reversal of all these ideals and the Minister of State knows it.  Who is driving this change?  I can understand and do not dispute the bureaucratic necessity to be compliant with a very substantial body of legislation and the heavy <i>acquis communautaire</i>, but this Bill is the wrong solution to a current problem.  The real solution involves more staff, facilities, time and research, and more bodies to do the job required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill is not part of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats programme for Government, nor is it part of the programme of the alternative rainbow coalition, which will have to take responsibility for its implementation when it takes office <Col N="430"/>in 100 days.  This is a bureaucratic response to a problem which has not been dealt with in the first instance by the political people who can produce &euro;350,000 for a bash in Dublin Castle at the drop of a pen to launch the national development plan.  It was the most expensive launch of a political manifesto that the taxpayers have ever paid for.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and I share a common interest, and hopefully a common future, as regards the next referendum to face the citizens of the Republic of Ireland, namely the constitutional treaty.  We need to change the rules of decision making in the current Community of 27 member states.  I not only want to see Croatia become a member of the EU but all the former Yugoslavian states, so we may consolidate that part of Europe.  It means we can consolidate the wider territorial community and bring them in so that as residents within the Union they will be much better participants than outside neighbours who may be prone to none of disciplines that EU membership provides.  Imagine what the Patricia McKennas of this world will do with a document such as this or the Eurosceptics, who are alive and well in this country, as the money which we used to receive from the European Union has started to decrease and we approach the status of net contributors.  I welcome this new status because I regard the day Ireland becomes a net contributor to the European Union as like the time my eldest child went off my payroll, earned his own salary and paid some money back to me.  Not only had my investment in him matured, so had he, and he became a full member of adult society.  Similarly Ireland will have matured, because the money we got from German taxpayers and others enabled us to do the things that in part helped to create the Celtic tiger.  The cash that used to be the one driver which persuaded people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in European referenda time after time will not be there.</P>
        <P>I can still recall Dana, in her wonderful, seductive manner saying how she felt about the first Nice treaty and how she worried about the applicant countries.  The Minister of State might recall how Dana said, with her soft Derry accent, that she worried about all the Polish farmers who wanted to get a slice of action out of the Common Agricultural Policy, and how many they were &mdash; all 40 million of the Polish population.  We know how the first Nice treaty turned out.  The Government is now giving an unbelievable additional instrument to the type of person who wants to make that sort of anti-European argument.  Forget about the D&aacute;il, 1916, 300 years of oppression and the struggle for independence.  As Deputy Perry said a few minutes ago the Government is not even willing to accept the Fine Gael amendment that at least no statutory instrument can go through this House without reference to a public debate or public accountability.  For the benefit of those who might have the curiosity to read the public record, I will state clearly what are statutory instruments are.  Statutory instruments are tertiary legislation that are derived and written by <Col N="431"/>the Government and the Civil Service that supports it which are not, in effect, open to democratic scrutiny.  They give effect to the body of legislation in whatever area and can set fines as well as other requirements, obligations and responsibilities.  Even though, theoretically, we can table a motion after the 21 days and say a matter must be debated here in the House, the Minister of State&rsquo;s and my experience indicate this seldom, if every, happens.  We are being asked on this side of the House to provide a democratic bypass to Leinster House whereby a set of offences and other requirements and responsibilities placed upon citizens are not open to the normal scrutiny of law and will descend upon the undiscerning citizen as a bolt out of the blue.</P>
        <P>I thought that was what the struggle for independence was all about.  I thought that is what 1913, 1916 and 1798 were about, so we should have the right to run our own affairs, make accountable rules that would be debated in public, on which we would vote, divide the House, differ from left to right, green to orange or whatever, but come to a conclusion and a consensus.  Because of the sense of republican values that I know the Minister of State and I share, it was accepted that whoever lost on the day would accept the view of the majority because the greater good of all was more valuable than the individual&rsquo;s viewpoint.  When the Government loses the next general election I know the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, despite taking a long time to accept the Constitution in the first instance, will nevertheless reluctantly but democratically and peacefully cross from that side to this side of the House and the life of the Republic will continue.</P>

	<P>No, we shall be with our colleagues and friends in Fine Gael, and Fianna F&aacute;il will be with its friends in Sinn F&eacute;in on this side of the House.  That is what this is about.  I do not know what the urgency is about this legislation.  I can think of a host of pieces of legislation that need to be enacted between now and either 10 or 17 May, but why this and why now?  I have great respect for the integrity, motivation and enthusiasm of the Civil Service and the public service.  Could this be a crisis management response to an avalanche of work that needs to be addressed, which at present requires to be enacted through primary legislation in this House?  Because of time constraints are they looking for a &ldquo;Fermoy bypass&rdquo; with or without a toll?  Perhaps this is the manner that effective, efficient and well-motivated public servants have decided we may comply with European requirements.  If this is the political equivalent of the Fermoy bypass, the democratic toll will be enormous.  If in the next two or three years we are asked to amend the treaties of the European Union, either by enacting a new <Col N="432"/>constitutional treaty or some variation of it, that will provide for the admission of Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania and perhaps one or two other countries, which we need a treaty for, the Government is giving, in the parlance of the Provos of west Belfast, an entire golfbag of baseball bats to beat around the heads of democrats in this country.  They will see, that in the name of Europe democratic accountability and responsibility has been stripped out of the D&aacute;il for indictable offences that can now be determined by people who are not accountable to anybody.  There is nothing wrong with people not being accountable to anybody &mdash; they are accountable to their Minister or the Secretary General of the Department or to their employer &mdash; but they are purporting to recommend a series of measures, which in turn will be rubber-stamped by way of statutory instruments.  These in turn, can affect the lives of individuals. </P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The history of this State was based upon the tradition and the sense of oppression, of unaccountable government and governance, over which the Irish people had no control.  We learned that lesson and our near neighbours, which had to cede independence to us, learned it in spades.  Why are we reversing that tradition and that history?  Why are we doing it at a time when we need to build confidence and a new sense of narrative about why the European Union is such a good thing?  It needs more democratic accountability.  It needs more openness and reference back to this Chamber so as to give it a validity which memories of the Second World War can no longer provide.  I cannot understand why the Minister of State, of all people, has given credence to this measure.  The people who have to implement these statutory instruments do not need to be re-elected, but the Minister of State does and so do the rest of us.  Therefore, as one elected representative speaking to another, I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this measure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I was asked to speak about this by my party and, to be honest, I do not fully understand much of the Bill.  As someone who has only been in this House for five years, I admit that I have not developed the intellectual scope to articulate the democratic concerns in the same eloquent way as Deputy Quinn.  However, I think that what we are witnessing is a debasement of our democracy.  It is a reflection of the way we have treated D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for a number of years.  We have treated it as a substandard Parliament and we do not agree on how to invest time and energy into what we actually do in this Parliament.  This Bill is an accumulation of what we have allowed happen to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the past few years.  This is not a criticism of the EU or of the civil servants in Ireland, it is a criticism of the way we allow things to happen.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il describes itself as the republican party.  What do people like the Minister of State mean when they say that?  What is Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s <Col N="433"/>definition of republicanism?  At least the French people clearly understand democracy and republicanism.  The French people talk about fraternity, equality and freedom.  We have a weird form of what Fianna F&aacute;il describes as republicanism.  It is not the type of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Deputy interrupts when I comment that his party has no republican values.  They play on the word &ldquo;republicanism&rdquo;.  The French genuinely feel it when they say those words.  When one meets French parliamentarians and those involved in politics in France, they genuinely believe in fraternity, equality and liberty.  They live it.  The Government here considers itself part of a republican Ireland, yet it is trying to pass a Bill that treats the D&aacute;il with contempt, something it has done whenever it has been in power in the past two decades.  It is attempting to debase the D&aacute;il even further with its carry-on regarding freedom of information and the way it rams legislation through the House.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il has reached the epitome of contempt for the Irish people when it is prepared to support a Bill that, if enacted, avoids even the rubber-stamping of legislation by this Parliament.  If there is any indication that the party has been in power for too long, this is it.  EU legislation should never be transposed by statutory instrument in the manner proposed by this Bill.  In some respects, it is an indication of how this House often works and what happens to legislation here.  It is only when Bills reach Second Stage or Committee Stage that concerns are expressed about their weaknesses.  The Government seldom accepts these concerns and it continues to ram the Bills through the Houses.  A great amount of legislation that passes through this Houses originates in Europe, and the Government is now trying to bypass all discussion by passing this Bill.  It initially looked very innocent and most people did not realise what was happening.</P><Col N="434"/>
        <P>We need to make it clear that nobody is knocking the European Union.  The EU has been a strong and positive force for change in Ireland.  It has delivered much financially and socially in this country, as the Minister of State pointed out in his speech.  However, if measures coming from Europe have not been successful, much of that is due to the way the Government has failed to implement them &mdash; for example, Euroroutes 1 and 2 cross County Wexford, which are supposed to stretch across the EU.  Nobody would consider the N11 or the N25 as Euroroutes, given the state of those roads.  No action was taken on bypassing major towns in the 30 years since we have been part of the EU.  That is due to a failure in the Government to believe in what Europe is all about.  The Government has taken what was given for agriculture and fishing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not notice the Deputy promoting those bypasses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>We have always looked for those bypasses.  The Minister of State should come down to County Wexford more often.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has been around only a short time and I never heard him talk about them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been around long enough to understand what is going wrong.  The Minister of State has been around long enough to know that he has not delivered for the people of County Wexford.</P>
        <P>The European Union has been very good regarding health services.  We do not promote it much, but the EU would be a substitute for many of the weaknesses of the Irish health services if people better understood it.  People can receive medical treatment in the EU free of charge under the E112 system if that service is not provided in Ireland in a timely fashion.  I am surprised that it has not been taken up to a greater extent by people in Ireland.  A case in the UK was brought by a woman who challenged the British Government on the issue and &ldquo;a timely fashion&rdquo; was defined as less than a year&rsquo;s wait for an important operation.  The year began the moment the GP referred the patient and ended on the date of the operation.  In that case, the woman needed a hip replacement operation.</P>
        <P>If a GP decides that somebody needs a hip replacement in Ireland, that person could wait up to four years to avail of the operation.  The EU has a website to help people access health services in Europe.  Therefore, the EU can be positive, progressive and proactive across different areas, not just agriculture and fisheries.  If people logged on to that website, they might get off the waiting list a lot faster than they would ever hope to do under this Government.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il has always tried to dismiss the European Union as it has tried to set up republican values that people do not understand.  Part of <Col N="435"/>the operation of setting itself up as a parochial republican party is the desire not to be seen to have anything to do with the greater European project, even though the people of Ireland have been part of it for the past 30 years.  We have let the people of Ireland down in that respect because the EU receives a bad press to some extent.  That is the case because we do not actively promote it.  I would like to know how many Members know where the European Commission&rsquo;s office in Dublin is located.  Do Members know where to find the European Parliament&rsquo;s office in Ireland?  They might be surprised to learn that the two buildings are just 100 yards from here, on Molesworth Street.  I suspect that the vast majority of Members have never been in either of the two buildings, have never attended any meetings there and have never met the EU officials who represent the European Parliament and the European Commission in Ireland.  I suspect young people in schools throughout the country do not understand the workings of the EU, although things may have improved in that regard.</P>

        <P>European Union legislation is usually initiated by the European Commission rather than the European Parliament.  The Commission seems to have most of the authority in the EU.  We need to engage in a strong public relations campaign <Col N="436"/>to highlight how the EU works.  Many of the concerns about the EU, some of which have been articulated by other speakers during this debate, are based on ignorance &mdash; people do not fully understand what the European project is about.  People tend to reject things when they do not understand them.  The offices of the European Parliament and the European Commission on Molesworth Street in Dublin are willing to provide huge amounts of information about what happens in this country and in Europe.  They are happy to explain how the EU affects the lives of the citizens of this country and the other member states.  The Government seriously needs to publicise the role of the EU.  The negative impact that this Bill will have on the public perception of the role of the EU will be the fault of the Government rather than the EU itself.  The Government is attempting to rationalise democracy in this country in a manner that suits its objectives.</P>

	<P>Allow the Deputy to speak without interruption.  If the Deputy addressed his remarks through the Chair, he might not provoke interruptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I know.  It is difficult because the Minister is easily provoked.  Senator Bradford asked two further questions.  Can the Minister unilaterally undo D&aacute;il legislation?  What safeguards are in place?  The Minister said, in summing up his contribution, that he fully accepted the Bill is technical and complex and that the issues involved do not, unfortunately, lend themselves to simple explanation.  That is a little different from his opening remarks, when he said that if Ireland is to retain its proud place at the heart of the European Union and avail of the full benefits of membership, it is imperative that it fulfils its side of the bargain and implements EU laws to which it has committed itself on foot of decisions taken by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>All I ask is that the Minister answer the three questions I posed.  The Minister says the Bill is technical and complex but it has transpired that it is not and that certain issues lend themselves to simple explanations.  The Minister is, in some respects, watering down the authority of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with this legislation.  That might not have been clear when the Bill was going through the Seanad, but when these matters are discussed for long enough one can see the true intent of the legislation.  I am sure the Minister was fully aware of that intent before it went through the House.  Otherwise he would be more conciliatory in this discussion and would accept that what is happening in the Bill is not good for democracy and the people of Ireland.   There is a serious need for this Bill to be withdrawn.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s Progressive Democrats colleagues can be quite bullish about these matters.  However, the Minister for Health and Children and the T&aacute;naiste are usually so correct that the Supreme Court is required to stop them.  Both Ministers have had their legislation rejected by the Supreme Court.  The Minister should stop making an ass of himself with the Supreme Court as well and examine this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to keep the language simple so the Minister will understand.  I hope he will accept the points made by a number of speakers.  This is not good legislation and there is a serious need for the Government to review it.  Whatever the people of Ireland feel about politicians and what we do in the House, and they might not be particularly worried that we do not get heavily involved in legislation, they will have serious concerns if we sign away our democracy <Col N="440"/>at the stroke of a ministerial pen.  This issue will become far bigger than the Minister anticipates and he needs to stop it now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have followed the debate over the course of the afternoon and having heard the contributions of some Members I am concerned.  I had not planned to speak in the debate.  I contacted the staff of the Committee on European Affairs and was told that they were first contacted about this Bill yesterday and again this morning.  They were asked whether it would be appropriate to refer it to that committee.  Obviously it should be, given that it is part and parcel of the committee&rsquo;s business.</P>
        <P>I should have been consulted about this Bill before it was brought to the House.  Given that it pertains to the functions of parliamentarians this is not the proper way to deal with it.  Obviously I must be balanced in my comments because I am chairman of the Committee on European Affairs.  It is not a divisive committee; we do things by consensus and it has never had a vote.  I do not believe that will be the case if this Bill is referred to the committee.  We can anticipate votes and a divisive debate.</P>
        <P>I accept that the State is vulnerable following the Supreme Court decisions.  However, concern has been expressed by Members with regard to their role as parliamentarians and, ultimately, the circumvention of the Oireachtas as a result of this legislation.  That is very serious.  Deputy Quinn spoke about eurosceptics, the European constitution, the erosion of trust in the European Union and the removal of decision making power from the member states and from the Oireachtas.  He made a fair point and a genuine concern has been registered in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the debate on this Bill will not conclude today.  That is probably a good thing.  I hope to speak to the Minister with a view to addressing some of the concerns voiced by Members.  When the role of Members is potentially affected so significantly, a different procedure from the one being followed today might be more appropriate.</P>
        <P>Last week the committee dealt with the scrutiny of EU directives.  IBEC came to testify before the committee and was firmly of the opinion that many of the directives from Europe were not being scrutinised properly.  There was no insight and investigation into the outcome or the effect they were having on Irish law, and the proper regulatory impact assessments were not being made.  The decisions were not being taken appropriately.  When one looks at this Bill and considers the concerns expressed in the D&aacute;il today, and taking into consideration that the Committee on European Affairs is not divisive, I do not believe that this is the appropriate place to deal with this legislation.</P>
        <P>I am glad the debate on the Bill will not conclude today.  The Minister made a mistake in not consulting the staff of the committee and me, as chairman, more rigorously before bringing the <Col N="441"/>Bill before the House.  I am trying to temper my comments and to be constructive.  However, I take seriously the concern Members have raised regarding the erosion of their role as parliamentarians.</P>

	<P>The Green Party is always concerned when it sees power drifting upwards.  One of the more important issues in a democracy is that the representatives of that democracy do their utmost to ensure that power is exercised at the lowest effective level.  I am nervous when legislation is introduced in a hurry, particularly legislation that will give the Government and Ministers significant powers to decide what will be criminal offences for Irish citizens under EU law.  The penalties which can be imposed under this legislation can amount to &euro;500,000 in fines and/or three years imprisonment.</P>
        <P>We need a lively debate on what functions should be carried out respectively by the European Union, the national Parliament and its Departments and at local level.  Local government, in terms of its powers, is very much an empty vessel compared to its equivalents in most other countries in Europe.  We need to invigorate local government by giving it the powers it deserves.  We should also be careful of giving powers to Ministers to determine what will or will not be indictable offences.  Section 2 of this Bill is very powerful.  There has not been a good debate about it, as we are coming to the issue late in the day.  There should be an extensive debate about what powers should be given to Government, Brussels and to local government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 5 together.</P><Col N="442"/>
        <P>A comprehensive settlement in the Middle East is more urgently needed now than at any time over the past 60 years.  During my visit last week, I held discussions with political leaders in Israel, Palestine, Egypt and Lebanon.  I outlined the role which the Government is playing, directly and in co-operation with our EU partners, to promote a lasting and just peace in the region.  I found broad agreement that there can be no unilateral or military solutions and that the opportunity must be taken now to revive a credible political process.  At its heart must be a negotiated, viable two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</P>
        <P>I had a detailed discussion with Foreign Minister Livni on the need to build on the meeting in December between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas and to deliver in full on the commitments made.  I urged the Israeli Government to seize the opportunity offered by the US Secretary of State&rsquo;s plans to open trilateral talks in Jerusalem and by the determination of the EU to ensure the international Quartet becomes more actively engaged, on a sustained basis.</P>
        <P>I raised the Government&rsquo;s strong concerns regarding the expansion of settlements, the proposed construction of the E1 corridor east of Jerusalem, the construction of the security barrier on Palestinian land, house demolitions in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and the effects of security measures on the Palestinian population.  I stressed that Israel had an obligation to act in accordance with international law, and the requirements of the road map and argued strongly that settlement expansion and other measures increasingly threaten to undermine the viability of a two-state solution.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I suggested that if Israel wished to strengthen the position of President Abbas, it was in its own interests to demonstrate readiness to act on his concerns for the welfare of his people.  I also asked that the total amount of tax and customs revenues which Israel has withheld from the Palestinian Authority be transferred as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>During my visit to Bethlehem, I announced a 27% increase in funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for its services to Palestinian refugees.  This will amount to &euro;11.4 million over the next three years.  It will involve a further significant increase in the Government&rsquo;s assistance to the Palestinians in 2007, which increased by 40% last year to &euro;6.4 million.</P>
        <P>I had very positive discussions in Ramallah with President Mahmoud Abbas and emphasised the Government&rsquo;s strong support for his efforts to negotiate the early formation of a national unity government.</P>
        <P>In Cairo I met with the Foreign Minister and other Cabinet Ministers, and with the Secretary General of the Arab League.  I travelled to Beirut for a meeting with Prime Minister Fouad Siniora.  I emphasised the Government&rsquo;s strong support for the sovereignty and independence of Lebanon, as underlined at the international con<Col N="443"/>ference in Paris, at which Ireland pledged a further &euro;2 million in humanitarian assistance.  I also visited the members of the Defence Forces serving with great distinction in the strengthened UNIFIL force in southern Lebanon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Minister obtain a flavour of the extent to which his remarks and suggestions to the various factions were received?  Was there acceptance of the position he put forward?  Was there recognition of the need on the part of the Israelis and Palestinians and both Palestinian factions to proceed in a constructive way in the future?  Was there a recognition that the present impasse cannot continue indefinitely and that the longer it continues the more serious the problem becomes, the more imbedded the issues become and the more dangerous and precarious the situation and peace becomes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The general feeling in the area is that the situation is extremely difficult but that there is a window of opportunity between now and at least the end of this year.  I was in the region when the Quartet was meeting last Friday in Washington.  It gave strong support to the efforts to have tripartite talks which President Abbas informed me are due to be held on 20 February when Condoleezza Rice travels back to the region.  These tripartite talks will be held between President Abbas, Condoleezza Rice and President Olmert.</P>
        <P>I understand from President Abbas he expects that a government of national unity would be put in place within days of my visit and they are meeting as we speak in Mecca and I am delighted with some of the soundings that have come out.  They recognise the seriousness of the situation and they recognise that there needs to be a government of national unity.  The manner in which the international community responds to this will be very important and this was the subject of the discussion I had with my colleagues not just in Palestine and in Israel but also in Egypt.</P>
        <P>There is a general feeling and understanding that this situation in Palestine and Israel must be dealt with as it is the core reason for instability in that region.  I pledged Ireland&rsquo;s support both on a bilateral basis and on an international basis through the EU and otherwise.  We will support it from a humanitarian point of view and we will support the political process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the Minister&rsquo;s reply, does he agree it would be valuable to have a secretariat established to solve the road map?  For example, with regard to the peace process in Northern Ireland, the fact there was continuity and a continuing interest from the major participants was invaluable.  It is one of the singular features of the road map proposals that it lacks such.</P>
        <P>I noted from the press accounts of the Minister&rsquo;s visit that he visited Bethlehem.  I am sure he and I agree there has been a destruction of the <Col N="444"/>economy of Bethlehem on foot of the wall which the International Court of Justice has condemned.  Does he condemn that wall and its effects on the communities surrounding Bethlehem, Beth Sahour and Beth Jala?</P>
        <P>With regard to East Jerusalem, would it have been valuable if the European Union had held off a confrontation with the Hamas Government?  Would it not have been valuable if more attention had been paid to the expansion of settlements beyond East Jerusalem?  The housing permissions granted illegally totally exceed the number of people who withdrew from Gaza and at the same time in the Occupied Territory there is widespread demolition of Palestinian homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The suggestion of a secretariat for the road map is an interesting idea.  I am not certain if those people who have been involved in the Quartet would be interested in putting that together.  Those of us in the EU and in Ireland are underwhelmed by the progress of the Quartet with regard to this.  We have exhorted our EU colleagues to be extremely vigilant from now on with regard to a re-invigoration of the Quartet process which includes the tripartite talks which will take place later this month.</P>
        <P>I have a sense that both in Israel and in Palestine, through speaking to President Abbas, there is a better understanding.  These people are now talking to each other on a constant basis and this is progress.</P>
        <P>I roundly condemn the wall and have done so in this House many times.  I saw for myself how it is being expanded even since my previous visit.  I visited a school in Bethlehem and saw the difficulties that young children encountered in their schooling.  I was delighted to be able to say to those involved in the project with us that the Irish Government is prepared to increase funding over the next three years by a substantial amount and by 27% this year.</P>
        <P>On the question of East Jerusalem I made the point strongly to the Foreign Minister Ms Livni, about the proposal for the E1 complex in East Jerusalem that if it proceeds it will effectively mean the end of a two-state solution and rule out the possibility of an agreement.</P>
        <P>Ms Livni stated candidly that she was disappointed the proposal would not proceed.  Despite that, we were shown a photograph of a relatively new police station which had been built in the location in question and it was pointed out by the Palestinian side that police stations are always built first because it entails building all the infrastructure required to facilitate settlement.  They are then followed by housing and so forth.  We must be vigilant and maintain pressure at Quartet level regarding the expansion of settlements.</P>
        <P>During my visit I sensed a feeling that the coming months offer a final chance to try to come to some understanding as to what is meant by a two-state solution.  The feeling within the general <Col N="445"/>Arab community was one of abhorrence that Arabs were fighting Arabs.  The fear of such conflict is manifested in the fairly good soundings we are hearing from Mecca, although the delegations have been meeting for two days.  Speaking privately to President Abbas, he indicated how much progress had been achieved in forming a national unity government.  I believe the two sides are not far from reaching this objective.  At that point, it will be necessary for the international community to take a reasoned, balanced response to this type of government being established.</P>

        <Quest> if he has discussed the US-India nuclear agreement with his counterpart in the US Administration or the Indian Government; the views of the Government on this agreement and on the way it impacts on nuclear non-proliferation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 4 together.</P>
        <P>In July 2005, President Bush and Prime Minister Singh agreed to establish a new strategic partnership between their two countries.  One element of this partnership was a proposed agreement on civil nuclear co-operation.  In March 2006, the two leaders announced that agreement had been reached.  On 9 December 2006 the US Congress adopted the Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Co-operation Act, which was subsequently signed into law by President Bush.  The Act effectively gives India a waiver from current US legislation prohibiting the transfer of nuclear material and technology.</P>
        <P>A number of further steps remain, however, before civil nuclear co-operation can commence between the US and India, including the conclusion of a formal bilateral agreement between the two countries which must also be approved by the US Congress, negotiation by India of a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, and a decision in the Nuclear Suppliers Group, NSG, to exempt India from its export guidelines.  We expect the decision by the NSG will be the final step in this process.</P><Col N="446"/>
        <P>We have been closely following developments in the US-India proposed agreement and have had useful contacts with both countries on the issue.  Three separate discussions on the proposed agreement have been held at the NSG since the March 2006 announcement and Ireland has played an active role, with several other countries, in seeking to clarify a number of issues.  The concerns raised have included the potential impact of the deal on the global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime established by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, the type of safeguards agreement which will eventually be agreed with the IAEA, the issue of possible future nuclear tests and whether the contentious question of enrichment and reprocessing is to be included.</P>
        <P>In the margins of the NSG meeting last October, representatives of the Indian Government briefed NSG participants.  On 18 October, I received the Prime Minister of India&rsquo;s special envoy on civil nuclear co-operation, Mr. Shyam Saran.  In the course of our discussions I conveyed to him Ireland&rsquo;s deep-rooted commitment to the NPT and reiterated our disappointment that India remained outside it.  While recognising India&rsquo;s energy needs and its great and growing economic and political importance, I stressed Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the potential impact of the US-India deal on the NPT.  Useful technical discussions were also held at official level.  Mr. Saran also met the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs during his visit.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the position taken by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on this matter and have taken careful note of it.  I have met with the committee to discuss this issue, most recently last November.  At that time, I explained that we were carefully analysing the proposed US-India agreement in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the NPT and the global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime.  I indicated that the issue of whether nuclear co-operation with India would undermine its core principles and obligations would be a fundamental consideration for us.  I also made clear that this is not a simple process and it is made more difficult by the fact that all the elements of the proposed agreement are not yet in place.  I indicated that we are consulting like-minded countries.  These consultations are ongoing.</P>
        <P>The next NSG plenary meeting is scheduled for mid-April in Cape Town.  The timing of any decision by the NSG will be determined by the pace and outcome of India&rsquo;s negotiations with the IAEA on safeguards and the US on the bilateral agreement.  Our current sense is that these two elements are unlikely to have progressed to the extent necessary for the plenary in Cape Town to take a decision.  Such a decision is likely to be delayed until a meeting of the NSG later in the year.</P>
        <P>As to the position we will take, not all elements are yet clear and we would wish to have the fullest possible information in order to make a con<Col N="447"/>sidered judgment when the time comes.  Ultimately, our final view will depend on our assessment of the potential impact of the deal on the global non-proliferation regime, the approach taken by normally like-minded countries and the overall balance of views within the NSG.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will agree that there is no disagreement on some matters, one of which is that the Nuclear Suppliers Group, of which Ireland and 44 other countries are members, operates by consensus.  This means that to stop the agreement coming into effect Ireland need only refuse to agree to a waiver.  The Minister will also agree that the IAEA is not a secretariat to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  One of Ireland&rsquo;s most glorious achievements at the United Nations was its sponsorship of the NPT, of which another small country, Finland, was the first signatory.  Given that the Nuclear Suppliers Group will decide whether the proposed US-India agreement on nuclear material will proceed, is it not a matter of a parallel process being established which will operate alongside the non-proliferation agreement?  Will the agreement not make it impossible to hold the NPT in place or, as like-minded countries, universalise it and eliminate the threat of nuclear weapons?  A comparison of the number of nuclear weapons in 2007 and 1945 shows that the danger to the planet is now 1.5 million times greater than it was in 1945.  </P>
        <P>Is it not the case that India proposes to offer 14 of its 22 nuclear installations for civil nuclear energy and that a further eight installations will not be subject to inspection and are being reserved for military purposes, with the result that there would be no control over the traffic of material?  Is it not also the case that the military establishment in the United States stands to gain $100 billion from the transfer of nuclear capacity to India?</P>
        <P>I, too, met the special representative of the Prime Minister of India and, as a friend of that country, I believe it has taken the wrong road.  I am glad the Minister has taken note of the views of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  He will be aware that the joint committee decided unanimously to stand by the non-proliferation treaty.  Most Members take the view that Ireland should not facilitate a treaty which endangers rather than advances the universalisation of the movement towards peace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>While I empathise with much of what the Deputy said, the strong advice I have received indicates that there is no sense in taking a position on this matter until all elements are known and on the table.

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, we have to see why and that is one of the reasons we are having discussions with them.  Much remains to be done concerning this matter.  Even people such as Dr. ElBaradei, the director general of the IAEA and Hans Blix have signalled they believe that while there may be negative aspects there are also positive ones.  I am relating what they have said, although I am not saying so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I know but there are differences between them, as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Last September, when Dr. Blix appeared before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, he indicated his view that there did not seem to be an obstacle in the NPT to this particular deal.  I am fully conscious of what the House feels about this matter but at the end of the day I must go along with the strong advice from experts in my Department who are centrally involved on a day-to-day basis.  To a certain extent, Ireland is making a nuisance of itself on this deal.  That was exemplified by a recent report in a German paper which stated the Irish representative on this body was asking the most pertinent questions and was trying to tease out why there are so many nuances concerning the deal.  Why are some countries, which would normally be vehemently against this type of deal, coming out in favour of it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister posed questions about the extent to which this deal might impact upon the existing treaty and whether it might encourage breaches of the treaty?  Might it be an example to friendly or unfriendly nations to breach or ignore the treaty in view of the fact that this particular deal is in place?  Following his discussions with the American and Indian authorities, has the Minister formed an opinion on the extent to which damage might be done to the NPT as a result of the deal?  Does he consider that other countries may take that as an example and proceed in a manner that may not be helpful either to the NTP or to world peace?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I can go no further than what I said earlier to Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  I await the response from my officials concerning their discussions at the various meetings of the NSG.  They have indicated strongly to me that there is no sense in coming to an informed view as to where we stand on this matter until we have all the information and all the elements are on the <Col N="449"/>table.  A number of significant countries, including China, have already indicated that they have difficulties with this.  So far, however, no country has come down one way or the other.  It may very well be that countries will assent to the deal in such a way &mdash; by inserting so many conditions or qualifications &mdash; that it would be impossible for it to go ahead.  There is a lot to play for but I assure the House that the Government is absolutely rock solid behind the principles of the NPT, which we will defend irrespective of whom it discommodes.  We will defend the principles of the NPT even if it means going against this agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty has been weakened by countries that have indicated support for the US-India agreement?  Countries such as France have supplied others with a nuclear capacity.  The weakest part of the treaty was the clause concerning the elimination of nuclear weapons because those countries which have insisted on retaining their nuclear weapons are now lining up to expand their nuclear capacity.  I hope the Minister will be guided by considerations of international security rather than by any trade relations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  Trade does not enter into it in the slightest fashion.</P>

	<P>Come on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We have made that quite clear in dealing with any queries on this.  We will defend the situation from a global security viewpoint and nothing else, even if it means going against our strategic interests.  A surprising number of countries are adopting unusual positions on this matter and that is one of the reasons we want to have the full facts on all aspects of it.  Some people say the NPT is no longer relevant but I totally disagree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In the 1960s, it was predicted that there would be over 20 countries with a nuclear capability but due to the NTP that is not the case.  I accept there are moves in this respect by quite a number of countries, including Iran and others, but the fact is that the NTP has stood the test of time.  Of course, it needs to be reviewed and we strongly support such a review mechanism, as we have said at all UN fora.  This deal is yet another element of the ongoing review of the NPT.  It could possibly have a significant impact on the treaty despite Dr. Blix&rsquo;s view, as expressed here last September, that he saw no obstacle in the NTP to this deal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland, along with its EU partners, condemns all acts of terrorism, regardless of their target or motivation.  Terrorism can never be justified by any cause, reason or ideology.  It places the lives of innocent people at risk and undermines tolerance, openness and respect for fundamental freedoms in society.</P>
        <P>With regard to the general thrust of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, and as I have made clear in my replies to his many previous parliamentary questions on this matter, I am not in a position to comment in any substantive way due to the imprecise nature of the allegations.  However, with regard to the mid-air bombing of a civilian aircraft, I assume the Deputy is referring to the 1976 bombing of Cubana Airlines flight 455, in which all 73 people on board died.  Two individuals, Mr. Orlando Bosch and a Mr. Luis Posada Carriles, were detained and charged in Caracas with the bombing of flight 455 in 1976.  Neither was convicted.  Mr. Carriles escaped detention in 1985, while Mr. Bosch was released two years later.</P>
        <P>Since May 2005, Mr. Carriles has been detained in US custody, charged with illegally entering US territory.  The US Government has decided not to grant the extradition requests for Mr. Carriles submitted by the Venezuelan and Cuban authorities.  It is my understanding that this decision was based on the principle of non-refoulement.  This principle, which is contained in article 3.1 of the United Nations Convention against Torture, requires states not to expel, return or extradite persons to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing they would be in danger of being subjected to torture.</P>
        <P>These cases are legal, bilateral matters between the countries concerned and are not cases on which it would be appropriate for the Government to take a position.  Consequently, I do not intend to raise these cases at UN or EU level.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The overriding objective of Ireland and our EU partners in our relations with Cuba is to encourage a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as set out in the European Union&rsquo;s 1996 common position on Cuba.

The European Union has emphasised its willingness to co-operate with Cuba on the basis of a dialogue with the Cuban Government and Cuban civil society, as soon as the Cuban Government shows the political will to engage in a dialogue aimed at tangible results, especially in the field of human rights and political freedom, the restriction of which remains a matter of deep concern to us in Ireland and in the EU generally.  In this regard, I again urge the Cuban Government to release all prisoners of conscience and to respect internationally acknowledged principles and practices.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am absolutely appalled by the Minister&rsquo;s response.  Cuba is a small island nation like ours, sitting beside a major international power.  For over 47 years, Cuba has suffered and over 2,000 people have been killed in terrorist attacks.  A further 3,500 have been maimed and injured, including tourists, and a civilian aircraft carrying Cuban citizens was bombed.  It is not good enough for the Minister, or for Ireland, an independent, neutral country, not to have a strong voice on this issue, particularly as this is a small island nation.  May I also say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are getting like Fidel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am so annoyed at the response that I had to make a statement on that aspect of the issue.  Does the Minister share my abhorrence at the hypocrisy of the US authorities when they lecture the world about terrorism yet have nothing to say about the 2,000 people killed and the 3,500 people maimed by terrorists based in Miami, Florida?  Will the Minister call on the US Government to investigate the terrorist activities of groups infiltrated by the five Cubans known as the Miami Five with a view to ensuring there will be no repeat of these actions?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree with Amnesty International that the denial of family visits is a form of torture?  Will he call on the US authorities to permit Olga Salaneuva and Adriana Perez O&rsquo;Connor to visit their respective husbands, Rene Gonzalez and Gerardo Hernandez, who are both incarcerated in the USA?  Does the Minister consider this a bilateral issue beyond his competence to address?  Why was his predecessor willing to comment on another bilateral matter when 75 so-called dissidents were arrested for mercenary activities in Cuba?  This is not about politics.  It is a simple matter of the denial of the human rights of five prisoners.  Can the Minister not bring himself to acknowledge the injustice involved and call for the wives to have permission to visit their husbands?</P>
        <P>In May 2005, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion finding that the USA had failed to guarantee the <Col N="452"/>Cuban Five a fair trial.  I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to support the UN working group on this issue.  I urge the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to raise this case, about which many people have major concerns.  The Minister and the Minister of State should support the Miami Five campaign in Ireland.  We are joined in Leinster House today by Eleanor Lanigan and Simon McGuinness, who are very active on human rights issues.  I ask the Minister to assert Ireland&rsquo;s authority as an independent, neutral country and campaign for the human and civil rights of these five people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the question of unfair detention to which the Deputy refers, in a report of 2005 the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stated that its determination does not imply consideration regarding the innocence or guilt of the concerned persons and that the working group does not substitute itself for the domestic courts.  It is my understanding that a number of appeals have been lodged on behalf of the defendants and these remain under active judicial review within the framework of US domestic law.</P>
        <P>Of course we condemn all abuses of human rights but it is fair to say that the Cuban regime has left much to be desired in regard to the issue of human rights over the past 50 years or so.  This is one of the reasons the EU, as far back as 1996, adopted a common position in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The US has not done so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We are willing to act in a balanced way.  It is not all &ldquo;Cuban, good; US, bad&rdquo;.  Let us be fair.  On a case by case basis, there must be a clear raising of issues.</P>
        <P>We do not have any standing in this matter.  It is a bilateral issue between the US and Cuba.  However, through the various instruments at our disposal as a small island nation within the EU, we raise issues of human rights abuses, whether they occur in the US or Cuba.  Over the years we have voted at the UN Assembly against the US embargo of Cuba.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Rightly so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We are prepared to stand up with regard to the effect on the general community.  The Cuban position on human rights must be put right.  Thankfully, some more reasonable soundings are coming from the replacement, for the time being at least, of the President of Cuba.  Perhaps there will be more opportunity for the international community and the US to liaise with the Cuban Government in that respect.  It remains to be seen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I visited Cuba, where I met the Vice President.  There is a major interest there in dialogue with the rest of the world.  There seems to be a fudge by the Minister with regard to the 2,000 people killed and the 3,500 injured <Col N="453"/>over 47 years.  This is the core issue.  A small country is being attacked by groups based in Miami and we have nothing to say about it.  That is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>When we go on to the international stage, both at EU and UN level, we must highlight this fact and the case of the five people involved.  In Cuba they are treated like the Birmingham Six.  When one goes into pubs, restaurants and hotels, one will see pictures of the Miami Five on every wall.  This is a major international human rights issue and the Minister should do his best to address it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want in any way to imply that we do not have sympathy for anyone who is incarcerated.  That applies equally to those incarcerated in Guantanamo and prisoners of conscience held by the Cuban authorities.  However, we have no standing with regard to the case referred to by the Deputy.  As I said, I do not propose to raise the issue at EU or UN level.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 204 together.</P>
        <P>Negotiations regarding Turkish accession to the European Union commenced on 3 October 2005.  An extensive screening process is ongoing which closely scrutinises the compatibility of Turkish legislation with that of the EU.  In all, there are 35 negotiating chapters in the accession process.  After a chapter has been screened, the EU can decide, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, whether the negotiations in that sector should proceed.  In June 2006, the European Council welcomed the provisional closure of the science and research chapter with Turkey.  To date, this is the only chapter to have been provisionally concluded.</P>
        <P>The European Commission published its annual enlargement package on 8 November 2006.  In its assessment of Turkey&rsquo;s progress, the <Col N="454"/>Commission stated that reforms have continued but have slowed during the past year.  Improvements are needed on freedom of expression, the rights of non-Muslim religious communities, women&rsquo;s rights, trade union rights and civil control of the military.  Further progress in aligning its legislation with that of the Union is also required in a range of areas, including agriculture, taxation, state aid and the free movement of goods, workers and capital.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to prioritise particular issues as all the points identified in the Commission report require Turkey&rsquo;s active attention.  However, it is clear that Turkey&rsquo;s continuing failure to implement the Ankara Protocol fully by opening its ports and airports to vessels registered in the Republic of Cyprus is complicating the accession negotiations.  As a result, the Council of Ministers on 11 December 2006, acting on a recommendation by the Commission, decided, first, that negotiations on eight negotiating chapters be suspended and, second, that no other chapter be provisionally closed until the Commission has verified that Turkey has implemented the protocol.  The Commission will report further on Turkish progress towards meeting its obligations, including implementation of the Ankara Protocol, in its annual reports to the Council, in particular in 2007, 2008 and 2009.</P>
        <P>At its meeting in January, the Council of Ministers noted progress to date in implementing its approach on the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community.  It called for work to continue on agreeing a Council regulation on special conditions for trade with the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister indicate whether adequate emphasis is being placed by the European Union on the need for Turkey to accelerate its programme to bring its institutions into line with EU norms?  Will he indicate whether there is reluctance on the part of the Turkish authorities to accelerate this programme or whether they are taking their cue from the diverse opinions sometimes expressed within the European Union?  For example, the Presidency of the European Union could always be deemed to have a leading, influential expression in this regard.  To what extent has that manifested itself at this time?  Is there likely to be progress on the sharing of the ports and on the acceptance of vessels from Cyprus into Turkish ports?</P>
        <P>Finally, does the Minister think it is a good idea to allow the negotiations to drag on for 12 to 14 years?  Is it the intention to stabilise the European Union and bring conditions related to human rights, including women&rsquo;s rights, in Turkey into line with the Union?  Would it be better to proceed as intended or would it be better to have a clearly defined pattern whereby recognition could be available for all groups within a reasonable <Col N="455"/>time, which would motivate them in their attitude?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When it was originally agreed to open discussions and negotiations with Turkey, it was accepted agreement would take a considerable time and this was accepted by the Turks.  Negotiations have been tortuous, not least because of the Ankara Protocol, which concerns the issue of the opening of ports and airports.  This is a divisive issue for both the Turks and people from the Republic of Cyprus.  I experienced this divide when I tried to travel from Ankara to Nicosia during my time as envoy.  I was unable to travel directly and had to stop off in Beirut or somewhere else before going to Cyprus.  Direct travel from either country to the other was impossible because of the embargo on airports and ports.  As a member of the European Union, I found it difficult to understand why I could not fly from a country hoping to become a member of the European Union to one that was a member and mentioned that to the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr. Gul, many times.</P>
        <P>There has been some slowing by the Turks on what had previously been a rapid move towards fulfilling the requirements for EU membership under the various chapters.  This may well be due to the fact elections are due to take place in Turkey.  Being a politician, Deputy Durkan will understand there are issues the Turks must deal with within their country.  To be fair, the Turkish Government has been proactive in its efforts, but there has been a slowdown to some extent.</P>
        <P>This country supports the accession of Turkey, on the basis that it is necessary in the greater scheme of stability for the region, but at the same time it must come up to the mark on all the issues, human rights including women&rsquo;s rights, trade union rights, civilian involvement in the military etc.  The country has made progress, but much more must be made.  It is a little like our slogan in the last general election, &ldquo;A lot done, more to do&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>One would favour the admission of Turkey if the Cyprus issue and human rights issues could be resolved.  I put it to the Minister there is another issue, namely, the acknowledgment of genocide in the past history, which would be compatible with squaring up to the truth.</P>
        <P>That said, is it not true that some countries in the European Union are using these issues and the delaying of the process to mask the fact they are totally opposed to Turkey&rsquo;s entry to the European Union?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is fair to say some countries are not particularly enamoured with the position.  Some countries have indicated they would require a referendum at the end of the process.  This causes some difficulty and clearly demonstrates they are saying to the rest of the European <Col N="456"/>Union that no matter what the Union agrees, they plan to have a popular vote on the issue.</P>
        <P>Much of the concern relates to general uneasiness in the European Union about further enlargement.  It is felt the Union has enlarged too rapidly over a short period and that given we cannot reform the structures, as per the draft constitution, any further enlargement must wait until we have those structures in place.  We have a commitment with regard to Turkey and Croatia and further commitments with regard to the Balkans in general.</P>
        <P>We are conscious there is within the Union a feeling that we should pause and reflect on the issues.  This feeling comes via the political systems in member states which hear the message from their people, as exemplified by the votes in the referenda in France and Holland with regard to the constitution.  There is no doubt, however, that some countries are using the Turkish issue to slow the process.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the position of the Government in relation to the vindication of Irish entitlements under the law of the sea and related instruments to the seabed. </Quest>
        <QRef>[4307/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides that a coastal state exercises sovereignty over its territorial sea, which is the belt of water located immediately adjacent to its land territory.  Every state has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles.  Sovereignty extends to the bed and subsoil of the territorial sea.  Ireland ratified the convention on 21 June 1996 and has established a territorial sea 12 nautical miles in breadth.</P>
        <P>The convention also provides that a coastal state exercises sovereign rights over its continental shelf for the purpose of exploiting its natural resources.  Each coastal state is entitled to a continental shelf 200 nautical miles in breadth regardless of whether the shelf naturally extends this far, subject only to the same rights of neighbouring states.  Where the shelf naturally extends beyond 200 nautical miles, this must be established to the satisfaction of the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf before a coastal state can exercise its sovereign rights there.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s shelf naturally extends beyond 200 nautical miles both to the west and the south of the country.  Scientific and technical data must be submitted to the UN Commission to satisfy it that all claims are valid.  For the purposes of our claims we have divided our shelf into three sectors.</P>
        <P>The first sector is to the south west of the country on the edge of an area known as the Porcupine Abyssal Plain.  This sector, which is approximately half the size of the State&rsquo;s land territory, <Col N="457"/>is not disputed by any other state and was therefore the subject of Ireland&rsquo;s first submission, made in May 2005.  The UN Commission is expected to make its recommendations concerning the limits of the claimed area in March of this year.  The Government will then designate the additional seabed enclosed by these limits as continental shelf belonging of the State.  Ireland is likely to become the first state in the world to establish a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from shore.  Once this sector is designated, hydrocarbon prospecting and exploration can be licensed there.</P>
        <P>The second sector of claimed extended continental shelf is in the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay.  This was the subject of a joint submission made together with the UK, France and Spain in May 2006 and covers an area of approximately 80,000 square kilometres, which is slightly larger than the State&rsquo;s land territory.  The UN recommendations are also expected shortly on this sector and the question of delimitation of the zone established on the basis of these recommendations will be finalised thereafter.</P>
        <P>Finally, we claim shelf on the Hatton-Rockall Plateau in the north-east Atlantic where there are overlapping claims by Iceland, Denmark and the UK.  Despite meeting regularly since 2002, the four states have as yet been unable to agree on the making of a joint submission or co-ordinated national submissions.  These consultations are continuing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this information which I have been seeking for some time.  I have also submitted a parliamentary question for a written response on an issue which is a rather sad affair, namely, about Irish oil and gas companies that have announced they are taking up licences off the former territories of the Spanish Sahara that are in fact the property of the Saharawi people.  While other international companies have withdrawn from those waters by arrangement with Morocco, the EU has illegally granted mining rights just off the shores of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic&rsquo;s territory, which is currently under occupation.  That is scandalous.  I presume that such companies might be more assured of moving into our waters if they become available.  Does the Minister anticipate legislation being prepared quickly to implement results likely to come under UN consideration in March?  I am not sure whether it took 30 or 40 years for decisions to flow from previous conferences on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.</P>
        <P>Second, it will obviously require an entirely new minerals and resources legislative regime.  Does the Minister envisage that?  If the UN report, as is expected, rules in our favour, will he institute bilateral talks with the UK and Denmark to establish the basis of the UN recommendation on Rockall?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not yet known whether legislation will be required.  It will obviously <Col N="458"/>depend on the determination of the UN commission.  The first application was made during my tenure as Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and I have now taken it over to a certain extent.  What was the second question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to a later written question on the illegal actions of an Irish company.  The second question was whether the Minister would introduce a new marine and natural resources Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a question for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and it would very much depend on the UN commission&rsquo;s determination.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>What about bilateral talks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise regarding our claim to Rockall.  Negotiations took place leading to the adoption in 1982 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and Ireland successfully resolved the issue of Rockall by ensuring that the convention provide that &ldquo;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf&rdquo;.  While neither we nor the British recognises each other&rsquo;s claim to sovereignty over Rockall, the issue no longer has relevance to the delimitation or extension of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue arose at the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources as well as at meetings on energy.  If it transpired that a very profitable zone containing minerals, ore, oil, gas or something else were discovered in that region or nearby, or in some other similar region, how would we resolve the problem of rights, entitlements and ownership in terms of what the Minister has said?  I recognise that he dealt with the matter before, but similar circumstances could arise, as referred to by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That too is a matter for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and I would not like to comment on it.  As it stands, there is an agreement to disagree regarding Rockall.  The Deputy is talking hypothetically when he speculates about anything being discovered there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was hypothetical.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>In anticipation of the vindication of our rights and sovereignty over an extended area, which would be very welcome, should we encourage Irish companies to respect such sovereignty elsewhere?  Perhaps the Minister will write to me about this.  I am raising it now, but my later question was transferred to written answer for various reasons.  I would be concerned if the European Commissioner facilitated an <Col N="459"/>illegal act off El Aai&uacute;n in former Spanish Sahara.  The Council of Ministers agreed by a qualified majority to go along with the Commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Deputy say that the question had been transferred?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a supplementary priority question transferred to written answer so I will have to wait for a reply.  It would be worthwhile to face up to the fact that the Commission, in a flagrant breach of law, granted exploration and fishing rights off the shores of an occupied country.  Some Ministers at the Council felt that it prejudiced a solution in the dispute between Morocco and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There are situations where the EU negotiates with African coastal states on fishing rights and oil exploration.  As Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have had some difficulty with those agreements over the years.  However, that does not have much relevance to the question.  One must deal with each situation on a case-by-case basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 8, 27, 79, 92, 107, 197 and 202 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is making use of all avenues, both bilaterally and through the EU, to focus urgent international attention on the crisis in Darfur and work towards a resolution, and it will continue to do so.  Most recently, in my meetings in Cairo on 1 February, I discussed the situation with the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Aboul Gheit, and the Arab League Secretary General, Amr Mussa.  I know that the Oireachtas is also deeply concerned, as reflected in the all-party motion passed on 28 November.</P>
        <P>The UN and the African Union are co-ordinating international efforts to revitalise the May 2006 Darfur peace agreement and strengthen peacekeeping.  The two organisations&rsquo; special envoys for Darfur, Mr. Jan Eliasson and Dr. Salim Salim, are actively trying to get negotiations under way between the parties to the agreement and non-signatory rebel groups.  The African Union&rsquo;s ceasefire observation mission in Darfur, AMIS, is being strengthened in a phased manner with UN support and is aimed at the deployment of a strong AU-UN hybrid force later this year.  Already 100 UN military, police and civilian personnel are in place under the first phase of UN support.  In December 2006 President Bashir of Sudan gave his approval in principle to that phased approach to strengthening AMIS.  However, regrettably, he has not as yet specifically endorsed the deployment of the AU-UN hybrid force.</P>
        <P>Since 2004, Ireland has provided over &euro;16 million in emergency aid to Darfur, including &euro;3 million for AMIS.  A further &euro;2.1 million in humanitarian support has been approved to date in 2007 and more financial support for AMIS is being considered.  Three members of the Permanent Defence Forces serve in support of AMIS.</P>
        <P>The security situation in Darfur remains very unstable.  Ceasefire violations by all parties, including the unacceptable bombing of civilian sites by the Sudanese airforce, banditry and inter-tribal conflicts, are undermining efforts to revitalise the peace process and having dire humanitarian consequences.  Currently, humanitarian access is at its lowest level since 2004.  During 2006, some 500,000 more Darfurians were displaced and in January alone a further 25,000 were forced to flee.  In that overall context, the work of the UN human rights assessment mission due on the ground in Darfur within days is of great importance.</P>
        <P>I strongly condemn the murder of an AMIS police officer on 1 February and the recent <Col N="461"/>increase in violent attacks on humanitarian workers, including international aid workers.  If current efforts to revitalise the political process are to succeed, it is essential that all parties immediately halt the violence and abide by their ceasefire commitments.</P>
        <P>The international community must, in particular, present a united front in demanding that the Sudanese Government and rebel groups negotiate without preconditions and co-operate fully in implementation of all three phases of the UN support for AMIS.  The EU, for its part, has implemented a comprehensive arms embargo against Sudan since 1994 and applies individual sanctions against four individuals designated by the Security Council in Resolution 1591(2005).  On 22 January, EU Foreign Ministers expressed their readiness to consider further measures, notably in the UN framework against any party that obstructs implementation of the phased approach to strengthening AMIS and to establishing the AU-UN hybrid force.</P>
        <P>Sudan&rsquo;s 2005 interim national constitution guarantees respect for fundamental human rights, but implementation of its provisions is very uneven.  The EU maintains regular dialogue with Sudan on human rights issues in an effort to address the situation.</P>
        <P>I will continue to avail myself of every possible opportunity to emphasise the urgent need for unhindered provision of humanitarian support to all those in need in Darfur and the speedy deployment of a well resourced peacekeeping operation under UN auspices with a strong mandate to protect civilians.  The current situation is simply unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister indicate how effective is the peacekeeping arrangement?  Can any means be found to co-operate with peacekeepers and are there sufficient deployments to clearly convince opposing factors that the violence and atrocities which have taken place must come to a halt?</P>
        <P>How effective is the arms embargo and how well policed is it?  To what extent has it been breached and the breaches identified?  There is a degree of violence in the region and arms embargoes should apply to everybody if they are to be effective in cutting off supplies.</P>
        <P>To what extent has the Minister, either directly or through the EU or UN, attempted to influence a settlement or recognition that violence must come to an end in the region?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The AMIS supply is insufficient, as I saw for myself when I travelled to El Fasher, one of the major towns in Darfur.  I met with the commanders of the AMIS and saw that it was too small a force for too large an area.  The area in question is approximately one and half times the size of France.  This was one reason I very strongly urged our EU counterparts to use all our influence, even if it meant a plan B.  In conjunc<Col N="462"/>tion with the Danish Foreign Minister, I stated that we should consider other options against the Sudanese Government.</P>
        <P>Thankfully, events have moved on since then as the UN, and Kofi Annan in particular, has been instrumental in at least getting an acknowledgement and understanding from President al-Bashir with regard to the three-phased approach.  The UN is already looking for personnel from various countries and a number of nations have indicated they would be willing to participate in the second phase, provided they are allowed in.</P>
        <P>It is not an easy issue with which to deal.  I saw for myself a demand by the international community to send in the UN, but it is not that simple.  Out on the ground one can see why it is not as easy as sending in troops from Ireland or anywhere else in the world.  There is incredible suspicion there not just from the Sudanese Government, but also from a broad spectrum of people, that this is in some way an effort by the international community &mdash; specifically some countries &mdash; to destabilise the Sudanese Government.</P>
        <P>One reason I stopped in Egypt for six hours on my recent visit was as a result of discussions I had here with President Mubarak and Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit when they visited Dublin.  I got the general feeling from President Mubarak in particular that this issue needed to be handled sensitively and in such a way that rather than the issue being forced and not getting the desired result with the Sudanese Government, it was better to discuss it with like-minded countries who understand the psyche of the Sudanese Government.  The Egyptian view was confirmed by a number of countries, including South Africa, representatives of which I spoke to in New York in September.</P>
        <P>The process is moving ever so slowly but it is going in the right direction.  Before I travelled I spoke to Jan Eliasson, a good friend of Ireland who is the former Swedish Foreign Minister and current special representative of the UN Secretary General.  He appreciated our strong support on the issue and our strong articulation of the difficulties in Darfur.  He stated that his job and that of the special envoy of the EU was to try to bring the non-signatories of the peace agreement into the fold, which might require some additional assistance from the international community.  As long as those parties are outside the deal, it would appear that the violence will continue.</P>
        <P>That may even mean the international community will have to put money on a plate in order to deal with the issue of compensation, a significant matter for those who have been displaced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s reply was comprehensive.  It has been pointed out by some of those interested in advancing peace in the region that there is some progress when there is an international presence which stays on at the talks.  In that regard, is there a possibility that some struc<Col N="463"/>ture could be put in place towards advancing the peace process?</P>
        <P>The point has been made with regard to those who are outside the southern Sudanese agreement that when there is an international presence, it stops people moving back into their absolute dispositions of non-co-operation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I entirely agree with the Deputy about the international presence.  That is a reason the UN assessment mission is going on the ground in the next few days, following on from visits by Jan Eliasson.  Much progress was made at the recent African Union meeting in Addis Ababa.</P>
        <P>I exhorted our colleagues at the EU table, long before it was first mooted, that it was perhaps incongruous that President al-Bashir would be the chairperson of the African Union from 1 January this year while this difficulty was occurring within his own country.  He was part of the solution and his government part of the problem.  I welcome the position of the African Union, which is dealing with this difficult and sensitive issue.  People here think the Iraqi problem is bad but this could flare up in all our faces if it is not dealt with properly and could become another war on another front in the African continent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister yesterday stated he was not into gestural politics.  What concrete action is being proposed by the Government to tackle the Darfur crisis?  In particular, does the Minister still believe we should be backing tougher international action against Sudan, including a British proposal for a no-fly zone over Darfur, which he earlier supported?  Will the Minister elaborate on the type of sanction he believes would be effective, or how such a no-fly zone would operate?</P>
        <P>Has the Minister considered that Ireland has, via the National Pensions Reserve Fund, unethical investments in Sudan?  According to the Sudan Divestment Task Force, which had a letter printed in this week&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i>, Ireland has invested &euro;460 million in companies operating in Sudan, including an Indian energy consortium and Chinese oil firm PetroChina.  All of these have documented complicity with those directing the terror against Darfur.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister speak to the Minister for Finance on the issue, or would this not be a concrete action?  Is this not the type of action to be proposed by the Minister instead of the gestures of which he accuses others?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As usual, Deputy Gormley must be a little divisive.</P>
        <P>Concrete action is &euro;16 million in humanitarian aid.  Every time there is a request, whether to help AMIS or people on the ground in need of humanitarian assistance, the Government has been forthcoming.  That is concrete action, apart from any political involvement.</P><Col N="464"/>
        <P>I would safely say there has been no Foreign Minister as vigilant and busy on this issue as I in that I was the first Minister to go into Darfur after the peace agreement.  I think I am the only Minister to go into a displacement camp, which I saw for myself was hell on earth, so that I could articulate clearly to the rest of my colleagues the type of difficulties these people faced.  As I stated, I went out of my way to go to Egypt to continue my discussions on the ground with the Egyptians, who have a particular point of view given that they are neighbours in this area.  Those are not gestures but work by us, as a small nation within the EU and within the UN, through which we endeavour to articulate a crisis happening on our doorstep.</P>
        <P>The divestment of Irish funds from Sudan is an issue we raised with the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Deputy Gormley would be the first one hopping up and down complaining about involvement by us in the independent statutory obligations of the National Pensions Reserve Fund board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Quite the opposite, I call on the Minister to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We passed legislation which gave them the authority, independent of Government, to control and manage the fund of investment.  The fund is a founder signatory to the principles of responsible investment launched by the UN Secretary General in April last.  It is committed to a process of change that would enable it to take account of ethical questions in its investment decisions.</P>
        <P>The fund is now going to considerable expense to ensure scrutiny and oversight when it comes to these particular issues.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, met with the Sudan Divestment Campaign on 9 November and with the National Pension Reserve Fund on 14 December 2006 to give a political view on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Are they listening?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are listening.  They are bringing their internal procedures up to speed.  Shareholdings previously managed by external fund management companies are now being brought back under the direct supervision of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  That means it will have greater control and it will be spending considerable amounts of money to ensure it is present at shareholder gatherings such as AGMs where these issues may arise.  The fund is trying to act not merely in accordance with the spirit, but in accordance with the letter of the principles the UN.  It is taking on considerable cost to ensure that such is the case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the past few days a number of constituents have come to me to complain that their close family members are about to be moved to nursing homes outside the Dublin area.</P>
        <P>A 34-year-old man, who is brain damaged and has been hospitalised for many months, is one of the cases in question.  His elderly mother visits him every day in a local hospital.  Not long ago she was told that he was on a waiting list for a long-term care place in Dublin.  His mother thought this would have been great because she would then be able to take him home regularly.  Over the past few days, however, his mother has learned that there is some debate going on in the HSE about whether he was ever on that waiting list.  She was then told he would be moved to one of two care homes in County Kildare.  It would take his mother, who does not own a car, much time and effort to reach either of these homes.  She is understandably very upset by this development.  At a case conference yesterday in a hospital in my constituency, his mother and <Col N="466"/>family were apparently told that regardless of whether they consented, the patient was about to be moved to County Kildare.  She is expecting him to be sent there tomorrow.</P>
        <P>A second case involves an 82-year-old woman whose husband suffers from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  He is to be transferred to a nursing home in Kildare.  I understand that this nursing home is two miles from Kildare railway station on the Athy road.  My constituent, who is 75, had to walk this two miles with no footpaths to see the nursing home.  This elderly woman would not be capable of making this journey on a regular basis.  The family will find it impossible to visit.  It is very expensive to do so.  This lady is afraid that she will never see her husband alive again.  I am being told about the family&rsquo;s unwillingness to consent to this man&rsquo;s removal to Kildare, but the HSE has stated that he would be moved regardless of whether they consent.</P>
        <P>Each of these patients, for one reason or another, has a limited capacity to make decisions about his own welfare.  In each of these cases, family members have been told their loved ones are going to a nursing home outside Dublin.  In each case, family members would be incapable of visiting their loved ones if they are moved outside the Dublin area.  Each family has been told in a variety of ways that, regardless of whether they like it, their loved ones will be moved.</P>
        <P>Why are Dubliners in need of long-term care being moved out of the county, far from their loved ones?  I understand and appreciate that there is much competition for beds in the HSE.  I also understand that hospitals are not necessarily the most appropriate places for those in need of long-term care.  What I cannot understand is how we can countenance dispatching people in need of long-term care far away from where their close family members live.</P>
        <P>The second issue that arises is one of consent.  What is wrong with the law that in such cases, where non-minors are incapable of giving consent, there is no obligation on doctors contemplating medical operations or procedures to obtain the consent of those who love the incapacitated ones most?  My suspicion is that these two cases are merely the tip of the iceberg and that we are entering an era where, in order to cover up for chronic incapacity in the Dublin hospitals and care homes, we are exiling people from one area to another where their family members cannot visit them.  Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the right of every person to a private and family life and these patients are being denied that right.</P>
        <P>I want the Minister to investigate not necessarily these two cases, but the broader issue surrounding them, that is, the movement of these people away from an area where they can be visited by their families and to take account of the <Col N="467"/>need of those people to get such visits on a regular basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and I thank Deputy Upton for raising it.</P>
        <P>The issues raised are appropriate to the Health Service Executive working in conjunction with the hospital concerned.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question centres on the movement of patients from acute hospitals to nursing care at an alternative location and on the issue of consent by families to the placement of their relatives.  The Deputy will appreciate that this is a complex issue and one which requires sensitive management in all cases.</P>
        <P>Every effort is made by the executive and individual hospitals to ensure that patients are placed in a care setting which is appropriate to their individual needs.  This involves interaction both at hospital and community level and the input of a number of care disciplines, for example, clinical, nursing and allied health professionals.</P>
        <P>Hospitals are encouraged to commence discharge planning with patients and their families as early as possible in all cases.  Patients may be discharged to a range of settings.  Hospitals engage extensively with patients and families to ensure that the post-hospital requirements of the individual are comprehensively assessed and that as much choice as possible is made available.  It is not always possible to place a patient in a facility close to the family.</P>
        <P>In certain circumstances, a family may be offered financial support to cover travel costs where a specialist placement may be some distance from the family home.  At all times, the hospital strives to advise patients and their families and to ensure that the best solution is agreed.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children is advised by the HSE that a reply has issued to the Deputy regarding the two specific cases raised.  The HSE advises that in both cases a place was offered in a nursing home but was refused.  Alternative places have been identified and these are the subject of ongoing contacts between the HSE and families.  Every effort will be made by the executive to accommodate the wishes of the families concerned.  The HSE advises that, regarding the third case, the hospital is engaged in ongoing consultation with the family with regard to suitable placement of the patient.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment, though I am saddened by the fact that issues of this type are becoming more frequent in the Cork <Col N="468"/>region and in the constituency that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, and I represent.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will be aware that Pfizer made an announcement today on employment at their facilities in Ireland.  Some 65 jobs are to be lost at the end of the year in the company&rsquo;s facility in Ringaskiddy and attempts will be made to sell as going concerns the facilities at Loughbeg, also in my constituency, and at Little Island, in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency.  It is indicated that if these sales do not go ahead the 400 or so remaining jobs will be lost as a result.  Given Motorola&rsquo;s announcement last week, this is devastating economic news for the region and demands an appropriate and speedy response in the House.  For this reason I am grateful that my request for an adjournment debate has been accepted and that the Minister of State will speak on behalf of the Government.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will outline the Government&rsquo;s prior knowledge of these events.  Workers within the company were nervous in recent months that a decision of this nature would be made.  With this in mind perhaps the Minister of State will reveal to the House the extent to which State agencies were aware of these issues and were working in anticipation of such a decision.  The Minister of State will be aware that there will be knock-on consequences for spin-off industries in the area.</P>
        <P>The facility in Ringaskiddy, where the 65 jobs are to be lost, is likely to be a deserted industrial site because half of the plant was given to Archer Daniels Midland, ADM, which closed in recent years.  There have been three announcements of major job losses in Ringaskiddy in recent years.</P>
        <P>In his reply will the Minister of State point out alternative jobs that have been sourced, particularly in Amgen in his own constituency?  Do announcements of the type made today, and that relating to Motorola last week, mean we should consider these replacement jobs rather than additional jobs in the Cork economy?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State veer from his prepared statement to indicate the extent to which decisions of this type might be made by other companies?  Are State agencies doing specific things to anticipate these decisions, as I mentioned regarding Motorola in an Adjournment debate last week, and try to see that they are not made in the first instance?  There are fears, in light of today&rsquo;s announcement, that similar announcements will be made by other companies.  Will the Minister of State state the specific things the Government can do in this regard?</P>
        <P>I accept that this decision was made based on the internal workings of the company, the international climate surrounding pharmaceutical companies and the products produced by the company.  Does the Minister of State accept that it behoves all public representatives in the area to <Col N="469"/>work collectively towards addressing the concerns that have resulted from today&rsquo;s statement and put in place a proper economic environment where decisions like this will not be made?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  My colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, was in ongoing discussions with Pfizer prior to today&rsquo;s announcement.  He met senior management at the company last Tuesday evening at its request and was fully briefed by the vice president on the company&rsquo;s future plans globally and in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Following the rejection by America&rsquo;s Food and Drug Administration, FDA, of the company&rsquo;s latest cholesterol drug in December 2006, Pfizer is now implementing the outcome of a major review of production facilities worldwide.  As part of this review 65 jobs are likely to be lost in the company&rsquo;s facilities in Ringaskiddy by the end of 2007.  This is very disappointing news for the workers and their families but instead of predicting gloom and doom for Cork the workers are best served by the Government and IDA Ireland assisting Pfizer in every way possible to ensure that these 65 people get alternative employment.  Pfizer understands its responsibilities in this area and it has assured the workers that every assistance will be given to them.  F&Aacute;S has also been contacted to make direct contact with the workers so their needs can be met.</P>
        <P>In addition to the 65 redundancies, the operation at Little Island, employing 180 workers, and the Loughbeg plant, employing 300 people, are to be put up for sale as going concerns over the next two years.  The vice president of Pfizer pointed out that the company has successfully sold on such plants in the past.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to save these 480 jobs by supporting the company in its efforts to secure the sale of the plants.</P>
        <P>I should point out that Pfizer is shedding 10,000 of its employees worldwide.  However, the company&rsquo;s plants in Cork and D&uacute;n Laoghaire remain pivotal and Pfizer is heavily committed to Ireland, employing close to 2,300 people and accounting for a capital investment in excess of &euro;1 billion.</P>
        <P>The recent decision of the company to initiate a project for a new biological small scale facility in Cork, with the support of the Government, is significant and has potential.  Pfizer continues to invest in its Irish facilities and is clear that Ireland remains a key manufacturing location.  New technologies are changing the way drugs are being manufactured and &euro;375 million has been invested in new technology very recently to secure the future of the company&rsquo;s Irish operations.  Recent investments include sterile operations as well as new technology and two process development facilities.  As I previously stated, the <Col N="470"/>initiation of the project for a new biological small scale facility in Cork is also under way.</P>
        <P>The Pfizer&rsquo;s manufacturing operations in Ireland have not been previously impacted by restructuring.  The termination of the company&rsquo;s experimental cholesterol drug by the FDA in the USA is by far the most significant factor impacting future capacity demand in Ireland.  The cumulative impact of these events has resulted in the in depth review of the company&rsquo;s operations in Ireland, as well as worldwide, which has concluded that the sale of the two plants as going concerns is required to bring capacity in line with future demand.  The Irish plants will still be responsible for 33%  of active pharmaceutical ingredient production for the global market after 2009.  I understand that the company is confident that the steps that it is taking will better align its operations in Ireland with its future needs and strengthen its manufacturing base for future growth.</P>
        <P>The traditional pharmaceutical sector is experiencing huge change worldwide.  Ireland is the top location in Europe for life sciences projects and 13 of the top 15 pharmaceutical companies have operations here.  They employ approximately 40,000 people, including 18,000 in the pharmaceutical sector.</P>
        <P>Regarding investment in Cork generally, I assure the Deputy that the Government, through its agencies, is continuing to promote Cork for employment opportunities.  New investment announcements in the region made over the last year include GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly, Centocor and Amgen.  Amgen recently announced 1,100 new jobs at its facility at Carrigtwohill, which is of particular importance, being a major global project that has chosen Cork as its development location.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Eli Lilly project was announced as recently as last December and the Centocor facility is now built.  Overall these companies will employ 1630 new people in the Cork region by 2010 and 2011.  Enterprise Ireland is also actively involved in assisting its client companies to grow and expand their businesses in Cork.  Last year, Enterprise Ireland made payments of almost &euro;9 million to its client companies in County Cork.  All these projects will have a significant positive effect on the economy and the people of the Cork region.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the urgent need for a school bus for the primary school children who must travel each day from their homes in Ballina in County Tipperary to the little country national school in Boher, which is within the same parish.  T&aacute;im an-bhu&iacute;och as ucht an seans labhairt ar son tuismitheoir&iacute; dalta&iacute; na scoile.  I am grateful to the Minister of State at the Department of Education and <Col N="471"/>Science for attending to address this issue directly.</P>
        <P>Ballina is a quite unique area in Munster and the 2006 census figures reveal a 64% increase in population since 2002.  Oversubscription to the primary school in Ballina is such that the school at Boher, situated four miles distant, has had a major influx of new pupils.  Each day, approximately 43 pupils travel from their homes in Ballina to the little country school, which is served by  narrow rural roads that are not conducive to heavy traffic.  Some of the children travel by private car and others have attempted to arrange a private bus service to travel the journey safely.</P>
        <P>Boher has experienced an increase in population in its own right and thereby increased enrolment in its school.  One reason is that the locals and the management of the school, much to their credit, provided an autism unit therein.  It therefore attracts children from a large catchment area in addition to the large number attending on foot of oversubscription in Ballina.</P>
        <P>It is unfair that parents are expected to transport the 43 young children beyond the two-mile limit each day at their own expense.  I have already been in contact with the Department and it is aware of the problem.  However, it is urgent that a response be returned as soon as possible to the parents, who have also been in communication with the Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent times, population growth has exceeded the expectations of the Department.  This does not reflect negatively on the Department because unforeseen and unprecedented increases have occurred in Ballina and Boher, which is on the shore of Lough Derg.  We are very pleased and grateful that 16 classrooms have been approved for Ballina national school, four of which were approved by the Department at quite short notice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is envisaged that the children travelling to Boher will be able to return to the newly refurbished school in Ballina when the extension is finally completed.  However, difficulties are arising at present because of the volume of traffic outside Boher national school.  There is very limited parking space and the children&rsquo;s lives, and those of motorists and pedestrians, are all in danger because of the failure of the Department of Education and Science to provide a school bus at an early stage.  There is a very good case for its provision and I am grateful for the opportunity to present it on behalf of the parents of the affected schoolchildren in Ballina.</P>
        <P>The population growth in the hinterland of Ballina has had a dramatic impact on school numbers.  It is quite extraordinary that the population projected in 2002 for 2011 has already been reached in this unique area, and it is therefore no surprise that the schools in the area are first to feel the impact.  We expect that 27 young children from the school in Ballina will graduate in June 2007 and they will be replaced by approximately 74 pupils in the incoming infant class.  This <Col N="472"/>presents a serious problem and I will therefore welcome the comments of the Minister of State on how it might be addressed.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy Hoctor for tabling this matter on the Adjournment and I welcome the opportunity to outline to the House my Department&rsquo;s position on school transport to Boher national school, Killaloe, County Clare.</P>
        <P>One of the main objectives of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for pupils who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.  In order to be eligible for transport under the terms of the primary school transport scheme, pupils must reside 3.2 km or more from, and be attending, their nearest national school, as determined by my Department.  While it is the prerogative of parents to send their children to the school of their choice, it is not the objective of the school transport scheme to facilitate that choice.</P>
        <P>My Department has no objection to pupils availing of concessionary fare-paying transport to a school other than their nearest, provided a written evidence of agreement form is obtained from the management authorities of the pupil&rsquo;s nearest school.  However, tickets for concessionary fare payers are issued only if spare seats are available on a bus after all fully eligible pupils have been accommodated.  This concession is also subject to no extra State cost being incurred by way of extending or altering the route of an existing service.  Continuation of transport will depend on the availability of spare seats on the service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 14 December 2006 my Department received a request for the establishment of a school bus service from a parents&rsquo; representative of children attending Boher national school.  The main case being put forward is that these children cannot be accommodated in the school in Ballina, which is their nearest national school, because it is oversubscribed.</P>
        <P>My Department wrote to the parents&rsquo; representative on 15 December 2006 requesting details of the ages and addresses of the pupils involved.  A list of over 40 pupils was returned.  This list was made up of pupils ranging in age from 4 to 11 years.  My Department subsequently received representations from Deputy Hoctor regarding the issue of transport for the pupils concerned.  The list of pupils has been forwarded to Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department, as it is necessary in the first instance to establish each pupil&rsquo;s eligibility for school transport and the availability of existing transport.  My Department&rsquo;s school transport section will examine the matter further on receipt of the Bus &Eacute;ireann report and in consultation with the school planning section.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy again for affording me this opportunity to explain the position to the House.</P>

      <sTitle>EU Directives.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>It used to be the case that people discussed the performance of their cars in terms of miles per gallon, but a new topic of conversation concerns the energy performance of one&rsquo;s home and the cost of gas and electricity.  The Power of One campaign seeks to make us much more environmentally friendly and there are two reasons behind the great support therefor.  These include the cost implications of energy consumption and concerns about climate change.</P>
        <P>The EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings was published in January 2003 and it will result in the need to have an energy performance certificate when selling one&rsquo;s home in the future.  The Irish Government sought to delay the improvement of building standards and therefore thousands of homes have been built to a lower standard and will not achieve an &ldquo;A&rdquo; rating.  Given the amount being paid for new homes and the enormous profits being made, it is the very least a purchaser should expect.  For a household which has forked out the equivalent of a lottery sum to purchase a starter home and which wants to move on as the family grows, it will mean having to shell out thousands more on experts to advise on how to get an &ldquo;A&rdquo; rating.  Remedial works must follow in order to achieve the much sought after rating, which will be in demand from more environmentally astute purchasers.  In the meantime the family will continue to pay through the nose to heat the sub-standard home.</P>
        <P>In whose interest was it to postpone the introduction of energy rating?  To see the special relationship between Fianna F&aacute;il and the construction industry, one needs to look no further.  Despite the EU legislation being in place, any housing units that received planning permission prior to the end of December 2006 need not comply or produce certificates on energy efficiency.  However, who is going to buy a pig in a poke?  Who will purchase a house that costs a fortune to heat, where remedial works are required when a comparable dwelling with an &ldquo;A&rdquo; rated energy certificate is available for the same price?  This is nothing short of an absolute scandal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to highlight the fact that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has applied for a further delay in implementing the EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings and the negative impact this will have on consumers, house buyers and, of course, the environment. </P>
        <P>To some this might seem to be a technical matter that will not have a major impact on their lives.  However, every person buying a house from 1 January 2007, and who has to spend the next 30 to 40 years paying a mortgage on it, will be adversely affected by the Minister&rsquo;s action.  For the next two years approximately, builders will not have to provide energy performance efficiency certificates for the houses they build.  Therefore house buyers will lose out on two <Col N="474"/>counts.  They will need to obtain an energy certificate if they decide to sell or rent the house, which will involve extra cost.  However, the big issue is that a purchaser will not know the energy efficiency standard of the house he or she is buying or what it complies with.  Substantial remedial work may have to be done to raise the standards of homes if people wish to sell them in the future.  In this scenario the big losers are the house buyers and the environment and the winners are those in the building industry, whose pockets will be lined.</P>
        <P>I believe pressure from the building industry is the main reason for this delay.  I have been told, for example, that the software is not ready.  However, that is just a smokescreen and the real reason is that builders do not want it.  The purpose is to facilitate a small group of very large builders.  Of course it is not the first time this has happened.  In 1997 a memorandum from his adviser to the then Minister for the Environment stated that the Department should revise Part L of the building regulations in 1998 or 1999 rather than waiting until 2002-3.  The memorandum states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The next leap in building standard insulation will probably involve making it difficult for hollow block construction, used widely in the Dublin area, to survive.  This has implications for manufacturers of hollow blocks and builders etc.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Nothing happened until the regulations were revised in 2003.  In the meantime in excess of 250,000 houses were built with an energy efficiency rating approximately 35% below standard.  The winners were the hollow block manufacturers and builders and the losers were the 250,000 families who bought those houses.  That was a scandal, but it is even more scandalous that once again house buyers are being held to ransom.  The environment will suffer and the building industry will clean up.</P>
        <P>This Minister is spending millions of euro telling consumers how to conserve energy, yet his action in this matter will cost house buyers millions in remedial work in the future.</P>

	<P>The EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings was adopted on 16 December 2002.  The transposition date was 4 January 2006.  However, Article 15 of the directive allowed for an additional period of three years, up to 4 January 2009, for transposition of Article 7 which requires the building energy rating, BER, certification of new and existing buildings where they are being offered for sale or letting.  The certificate will provide house owners and purchasers with information on the energy performance of their dwelling &mdash; and indeed other buildings &mdash; and how to improve that performance.</P><Col N="475"/>
        <P>The impression has been given that Ireland has delayed in implementation of the EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings.  In fact the opposite is the case.  Ireland is one of the leading group of EU member states in terms of implementing the directive.  Prior to last year, only one member state, Denmark, had a BER system.  Four member states introduced the system last year on foot of the directive and Ireland is one of seven countries to introduce it this year.  The various implementation deadlines set out in the regulations are in line with those published in Ireland&rsquo;s implementation action plan, save for one additional transitional period for new homes for which planning permission was obtained in the second half of 2006.</P>
        <P>The EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings is a complex piece of work.  The challenges both in Ireland and other EU member states have been to develop supporting administrative, computer and training systems to underpin energy rating.  BER will be phased in, as set out in the Government&rsquo;s original action plan, as follows: new dwellings, with effect from 1 January 2007; new non-domestic buildings, with effect from I July 2008; and all existing buildings when sold or let, with effect from 1 January 2009.</P>
        <P>The regulations provide for an exemption for new dwellings for which planning permission had been applied before the end of December 2006.  It had been intended that the exemption would apply where planning permission had been sought prior to end June 2006.  The extra time was allowed, however, at the request of Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI,  which has primary responsibility for practical implementation of this directive on the ground, primarily to enable the roll out of a substantial number of trained and registered BER assessors in the first half of 2007, and to allow SEI to complete the setting up a system for the smooth and efficient administration and oversight of the BER certification system, involving the recruitment of staff, the installation of ICT systems, etc.  However, the exemption ceases as originally intended at 30 June 2008 unless substantial work has been completed.  All new dwellings are covered from 30 June 2008 and this date has not changed</P><Col N="476"/>
        <P>I should explain that the directive <i>per se</i> does not set standards for energy performance, other than to specify that national standards be expressed in a particular format.  Irish law requires buildings to comply with the conservation of fuel and energy requirements of Part L of the building regulations.  I should also make clear that there has been no postponement of the actual energy conservation standards which apply to new homes.  The change in the transitional date relates only to the energy labelling system.</P>
        <P>I would like to respond to the Deputies&rsquo; concerns about the use of hollow blocks in housing.  When the Department commenced the process of upgrading Part L in the 1990s, in keeping with good administrative and governance practices it had to consider all aspects of the proposed stricter standards, including impacts on the construction industry at a time when demand for houses was putting severe pressure on house prices.  The broadly based building regulations advisory body therefore commissioned an assessment of the impact of higher thermal performance standards on house building.  This independent study was carried out by UCD-ERG, which showed that all the most common house building systems could be insulated to comply with the proposed higher standards, including hollow block construction.  The results of this study were published in November 2000.  Draft proposals were published for public consultation in 2001 and the definitive regulations were made in 2002.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The original idea, as set out in the national climate change strategy, October 2000,  was to increase thermal performance standards in two phases &mdash; in 2002 and 2005.  As a result of the UCD-ERG study, Part L regulations were made in 2002 which applied the higher standards, in a single step, to new dwellings commencing on or after 1 January 2003.</P>
        <P>Energy rating will provide important information for the consumer under the able guidance of Sustainable Energy Ireland.  I emphasise that the delay was at SEI&rsquo;s request and I do not believe anyone doubts its commitment in this whole area.</P>

        <Quest> his view on the recent investigation by the Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland into the killing of Raymond McCord junior and other murders; if he has met with the McCord family to discuss the report; if he has discussed the report with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Chief Constable of the PSNI; his views on whether prosecutions must follow the findings of the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s report into the circumstances surrounding the killing of Raymond McCord junior is a shocking catalogue of murder, serious crime and collusion: events which should never have been allowed to happen. Its findings are damning, particularly on the failings of RUC Special Branch in the 1990s. The Ombudsman has found that RUC officers colluded in crimes by their failure to tackle the most serious activities of their informants &mdash; including murder.</P>
        <P>The position of the Government is clear: the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendations should be implemented in full; re-investigations should take place; prosecutions, where possible, should follow; and police officers implicated in wrongdoing should be held accountable for their actions.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the British Government and the PSNI Chief Constable have acknowledged these failures, have accepted the Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendations, and have undertaken to implement them fully. For our part, the Government will closely follow all <Col N="478"/>aspects of implementation of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and I discussed the report with Secretary of State Hain at our meeting in Cardiff on Sunday. The Taoiseach also raised the report with Prime Minister Blair at their Downing Street meeting on 30th January last. We will continue to stress to the British that the report must be implemented in full, that the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office be given the necessary funds to investigate other past cases, and that a means be found of addressing the past which meets the needs of families and victims in this and other such cases.</P>
        <P>At this juncture, it is also important to note the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s assessment that the systems which led to failures of this type were part of a different policing environment to what pertains now.  Since these events took place, there has been a transformation in policing in Northern Ireland. The policing and criminal justice systems have been thoroughly reformed. The strong accountability and oversight arrangements recommended by Patten, including the Policing Board and Police Ombudsman, are now in place and are working well.</P>
        <P>I would like to take this opportunity to commend Raymond McCord Snr for his tireless efforts to uncover the truth. The Government has been in regular contact with Mr McCord over the last year at both political and official level. The Taoiseach met with Mr McCord on 22 March 2006. Our officials met with Mr McCord again last week and assured him that we will be closely monitoring the British response to the report.</P>
        <P>Finally I would also like to pay tribute to the work of the Police Ombudsman and her staff. Yet again, her office has proven its worth with this latest report. In holding the police to account, she has been a central figure in building confidence <Col N="479"/>in the new policing arrangements in Northern Ireland.</P>

        <P>My Department initially became aware of the case the Deputy is referring to through reports in the media, but the priest referred to has written to me in recent days, and I have instructed the Department to pursue the issues involved.</P>
        <P>Our Ambassador in Singapore, who is also accredited to the Philippines, has now raised the matter directly with the local EU Presidency in Manila, with a view to the Presidency raising it at an early meeting with the Philippine Authorities. The Ambassador has likewise conveyed our concerns directly to the Philippine authorities, through their Ambassador in Singapore, and has also been in contact with the Columban community in Manila.</P>
        <P>While it remains the right of the legal authorities of any country to decide to permit or refuse entry to foreign nationals, a number of aspects of this case are of serious concern. The individual referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question has expressed the view that this incident relates to his work on a report, prepared at the express request of the Philippine Conference of Catholic Bishops, on the human and environmental impact of the mining industry in the Philippines. I understand that another member of the team working on the report was also prevented from entering the Philippines in December. I would, of course, be very concerned at any efforts by the Philippines authorities to seek to limit in any way the legitimate work of human rights advocates.</P>
        <P>I intend that this issue will continue to be pursued actively with the Authorities in the Philippines.</P>

	<P>I am aware that legislative changes in relation to homosexuality have been proposed in Nigeria. A Bill entitled &lsquo;Prohibition of Relationship between Persons of the Same Sex, Celebration of Marriage by them and other matters connected therewith&rsquo; had its Second Reading on 17 May 2006 and was referred to the Nigerian Parliament&rsquo;s Joint Committees on Women Affairs and Youth Development, Human Rights and Justice.

They are worried that lawyers could be prosecuted for defending people who face criminal charges in relation to homosexual activity.  EU Heads of Mission in Abuja met several Nigerian NGOs to discuss these concerns.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that these proposed changes to the law risk infringing Nigeria&rsquo;s international human rights obligations, including in the areas of freedom of assembly, freedom of opinion and the right to privacy. They may also infringe the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Nigeria acceded without reservations in 1993. It is conceivable that the Bill could criminalise non-governmental organisations who may be working to promote homosexual rights in Nigeria.</P>
        <P>In June 2006, representatives of the EU Heads of Mission in Abuja drew the attention of the Nigerian Minister for Justice and of senior figures in the Nigerian Federal Parliament to concerns that the proposed legal changes could infringe international human rights instruments to which Nigeria is a party.</P>
        <P>Our Embassy in Nigeria, in common with other EU Embassies, is actively seized of this issue and will continue to convey our serious concerns to the Nigerian authorities.</P>

	<P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 13, 30 and 81 together. </P>
        <P>In regard to the nuclear agreement between India and the United States, I would refer the <Col N="482"/>Deputies to the priority questions today on this issue.</P>
        <P>In July 2005, President Bush and Prime Minister Singh agreed to establish a new strategic partnership between their two countries. One element of that partnership was a proposed agreement on civil nuclear cooperation. In March 2006, the two leaders announced that agreement had been reached. On 9 December 2006 the US Congress adopted the Henry J Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act, which was subsequently signed into law by President Bush.</P>
        <P>A number of further steps remain, however, before civil nuclear cooperation can commence between the US and India, including the conclusion of a formal bilateral agreement between the two countries (which must also be approved by the US Congress), negotiation by India of a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and a decision in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to exempt India from its export guidelines.</P>
        <P>We have been closely following developments on the US-India deal and have had useful contacts with both the US and India on the issue. Three separate discussions on the proposed agreement have been held at the NSG since the March 2006 announcement and Ireland has played an active role, along with several other countries, in seeking to clarify a number of issues.</P>
        <P>On 18 October I received the Prime Minister of India&rsquo;s Special Envoy on Civil Nuclear Cooperation, Mr Shyam Saran. In the course of our discussions I conveyed to him Ireland&rsquo;s deep-rooted commitment to the NPT and reiterated our disappointment that India remained outside it. While recognizing India&rsquo;s energy needs and its great and growing economic and political importance, I stressed Ireland&rsquo;s concerns over the potential impact of the US-India deal on the NPT and the global disarmament and non-proliferation regime. Useful technical discussions were also held at official level.</P>
        <P>The next NSG Plenary meeting is scheduled for mid April in Cape Town, South Africa. The timing of any proposal in the NSG will be determined by the pace and outcome of Indian negotiations with the IAEA on safeguards, and with the US on the bilateral agreement. Our current sense is that these two elements are unlikely to have progressed to the extent necessary for the Plenary in Cape Town to take a decision. Such a decision is likely to be delayed until a meeting of the NSG later in the year.</P>
        <P>As to the position we will take, not all elements are yet clear and we would wish to have the fullest possible information in order to make a considered judgment. Ultimately, our final view will depend on our assessment of the potential impact of the deal on the global non-proliferation regime, but also on the approach taken by nor<Col N="483"/>mally like-minded countries and the overall balance of views within the NSG.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 65 together. </P>
        <P>While significant progress has been achieved in Afghanistan, considerable challenges still remain. The reform process in the country is continuing with the assistance of the international community, and it is vitally important that the progress made since 2002 is consolidated.</P>
        <P>The security situation in Afghanistan remains a cause of serious concern. There has been a substantial increase in insurgent activity in 2006. Attacks by groups linked to the Taliban have continued, though at a lower level throughout the winter months. The International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF) has engaged in heavy fighting with Taliban insurgents in the South, and has been able to establish itself in former key centres of Taliban resistance. ISAF have also continued operations with a view to preventing the Taliban taking new positions in Southern Afghanistan ahead of an expected increase in insurgent activity in the spring.</P>
        <P>A key issue has been engaging Afghanistan&rsquo;s neighbours in actively supporting stability in Afghanistan and ensuring that militants are given no safe haven. It is important that Afghanistan and Pakistan and the international community work together to actively address the problem of cross border insurgent activity.</P>
        <P>ISAF is now operating throughout all of Afghanistan, working to provide security and stability. It seeks to protect the welfare of civilians, both on humanitarian grounds, and because the support of the people is vital to the success of their mission. Seven members of the Irish Defence Forces currently serve in ISAF, based in Kabul.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember that security and stability in Afghanistan cannot be achieved by military means alone. Long-term success will depend on significant improvements in govern<Col N="484"/>ance and prompt delivery of humanitarian and reconstruction assistance.</P>
        <P>Ireland has contributed a total of &euro;31 million in humanitarian and development assistance since 2000. Ireland&rsquo;s assistance in support of recovery and development programmes is delivered through the World Bank, UN Agencies and civil society.</P>
        <P>At the meeting of the EU-Afghanistan Troika on 29 January, the EU underlined its readiness to continue to work with the Government of Afghanistan to stabilise and rebuild the country through addressing issues of both security and development.  In this regard, the EU is currently considering a substantial increase in its support for training the Afghan police force, in line with the recommendations of a Fact-Finding Mission to Afghanistan in November/December 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation to which the Deputy refers concerns a state of civil unrest in Oaxaca in southern Mexico, which began with a strike by teachers in May 2006. This strike subsequently developed into a prolonged and increasingly violent and politicised protest whose objectives included removing the elected State Governor. The immediate consequence was the occupation by the protesters of the main square in the city centre. </P>
        <P>Following an unsuccessful attempt by state police in June to evict striking teachers from the main square, the protest was enlarged under an umbrella organisation called the &lsquo;Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca&rsquo; (APPO). The protest group took control of Oaxaca city centre in June, bringing the local government in the city to a virtual standstill, erecting barricades, blockading local businesses and burning state-owned buildings.</P>
        <P>The Mexican Federal Government held a series of talks involving representatives of the state government and APPO, and using the good office of both the UN High Commission for Human Rights and the local Catholic Dioceses, in an attempt to broker a peaceful resolution. These talks were unsuccessful and, following further rioting, about 4,000 federal police were deployed in October 2006 to restore order. Estimates as to the precise number of people killed, injured, arrested and disappeared during the troubles in <Col N="485"/>Oaxaca vary, but are believed to be in the region of those posited by the Deputy in his question.</P>
        <P>The situation in Oaxaca has now stabilised and the withdrawal of federal police, which began in December, is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
        <P>Ireland, along with our European Union partners, monitors and regularly discusses with the Mexican authorities the human rights situation in Mexico and the fulfilment of their obligations under international law. The EU Presidency in Mexico City has raised the situation in Oaxaca with the Mexican Federal Government, and EU missions have met with local human rights activists to hear their perspectives on the difficult situation there. Our Embassy in Mexico is keeping the situation in Oaxaca under review, while EU Member States and the European Commission are working with federal and local governments in Mexico to seek to improve governance and respect for human rights in the area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The welfare of the undocumented Irish in the United States is an issue of the highest priority for the Government. In all of my dealings about comprehensive immigration reform, I stress our strong support for measures that would enable the undocumented to regularise their status and have open to them a path to permanent residency. </P>
        <P>Immigration reform is one of the most contentious and high profile political issues in the US. The Democratic victory in the mid-term elections has given a considerable boost to the prospects for enacting comprehensive reform that would address the legal status of most of the more than 11 million undocumented.</P>
        <P>Although progressive legislative proposals lapsed with the outgoing Congress, the issue is still on the political agenda of the new Congress and I understand that new bills are being drafted. There is now a majority in the Senate and the House in favour of reform and contacts in both parties maintain that immigration is one area where bipartisan cooperation could be possible. At the same time, considerable political hurdles remain and opinions on the prospects for enacting legislation this year still vary considerably.</P>
        <P>In the last Congress, the Kennedy/McCain bill had considerable bipartisan support. Only a bipartisan solution can succeed in reforming the immigration system. Strong leadership from President Bush and from both Democrats and Repub<Col N="486"/>licans in Congress are all needed to secure the passage of comprehensive reform.</P>
        <P>President Bush reiterated his strong commitment to comprehensive reform during the mid-term election campaign and again during his recent State of the Union address. His statements added momentum to the campaign to provide legal status to the undocumented, including to thousands of Irish people. Positive statements from the Senate Majority and Minority leaders also identified immigration reform as a key legislative priority for the period ahead. While the legislative timetable has yet to be clarified, the latest indications are that the Senate will have completed its consideration of a reform bill by early summer.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue its active engagement on behalf of the undocumented Irish in the US. The Taoiseach and I will highlight our concerns once again when we meet with President Bush and key members of Congress, and with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform (ILIR) during the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day period.</P>
        <P>I maintain very close contact with our community in the United States. The ILIR campaign is having a very significant and positive impact in Congress. The ILIR held the latest of its &lsquo;town hall meetings&rsquo; in San Francisco on 1st February. A large crowd attended (over 1,500) &mdash; the majority were undocumented Irish. The Consul General and the Vice Consul were present. The mood of the meeting was positive and focused predominantly on garnering support for the &lsquo;National Lobby Day&rsquo; scheduled to take place in Washington DC on 7th March. A notable feature of the Rally was the strong message of support from the new Speaker, Nancy Pelosi.</P>
        <P>I look forward to a further intensification of the Government&rsquo;s efforts on behalf of the undocumented in the period ahead. I am cautiously hopeful that progress can be made.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 53 and 88 together. </P>
        <P>I view very seriously the allegations relating to the harvesting of live organs from Falun Gong practitioners. Enquiries on this issue have been made by the Department of Foreign Affairs within the EU and UN frameworks, as well as through our Embassy in Beijing.</P>
        <P>A senior official from the Department met with Mr David Kilgour during his visit to Dublin last November to discuss the findings of the report prepared by him and Mr. Matas on behalf of the Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of the Falun Gong in China (CIPFG). I have asked that these contacts be maintained to ensure that I am kept properly informed on this issue. My Department is also in direct contact with representatives of the Falun Gong in Ireland. To date, no concrete evidence has been revealed to substantiate the allegations contained in this report. However, the matter is being kept under review by my officials and enquiries by the EU and other organisations are continuing.</P>
        <P>For some time, concerns have been raised about the harvesting of organs of executed prisoners in China. The Chinese Government now state that this only occurs where the prior consent of the individuals has been obtained, but concerns about this practice remain. I am also aware of allegations of a trade in human organs in China generally. I would note that the sale of organs for transplant is illegal in China, and that the authorities state that they are firmly opposed to the illegal trade in human organs for transplant. In July last year, the Chinese Government introduced a regulation to govern the clinical use of body parts as well as the transplantation of body parts. I understand that they are in the process of drawing up ethical guidelines to cover the regulation of the organ donor and transplant market in general. I hope that these guidelines can be brought forward as soon as possible. Wherever this practice occurs, and whatever the circumstances, the illegal harvesting of, and trafficking in, human organs is a deplorable act.</P>
        <P>As regards the specific issue of a travel warning raised by Deputy Murphy, I do not feel it appropriate for my Department to issue travel advice regarding organ transplant operations in China. <Col N="488"/>As it stands, I am not aware of any cases of Irish people travelling to China for such operations. But I certainly would urge extreme caution to anyone considering travelling to the region for such purposes and advise them to inform themselves fully of all the issues, including Chinese Government regulations prohibiting the sale of organs.</P>
        <P>Although allegations regarding the involuntary harvesting of human organs, including from the Falun Gong, remain unproven, I do believe that it is in the interests of the Chinese authorities to reassure the international community that everything possible is being done to ensure that all practices involving the use of human organs conform to international standards. It is also essential that the Chinese government seek to address the considerable human rights concerns that have been raised, including those relating to the situation of Falun Gong practitioners.</P>
        <P>As reported to this House on many occasions previously, questions relating to the treatment of the Falun Gong &mdash; including specific cases &mdash; and issues relating to human rights, and fundamental freedom more generally, are raised regularly in our own bilateral dialogue with the Government of China and in the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue.</P>
        <P>When I met with Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing on 12 May during a visit to Beijing, I had the opportunity to raise human rights issues and concerns, including the importance we attach to freedom of speech and freedom of religion. More recently, the T&aacute;naiste held official talks on 25 September with visiting Chinese Vice-Premier Zeng Peiyan during which he also raised human rights issues and concerns. Discussions in this regard also take place at official level here and in Beijing.</P>

	<P>During the 1960s and 1970s the issue of Rockall was a source of legal and political controversy in both Ireland and the United Kingdom. Much of that controversy lay in fears at the time that jurisdiction over Rockall and similar rocks and skerries was thought to be central to the mineral rights in the adjacent sea-bed and to fishing rights in the surrounding seas. </P>
        <P>However, during the course of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which took place from 1973 to 1982, the Irish delegation worked hard to establish a satisfactory legal regime applicable to islands. This effort was <Col N="489"/>successful. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was adopted at Montego Bay at the conclusion of the Conference on 10 December 1982, provides at Article 121 paragraph 3 that: &ldquo;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Article 121 (3) applies to Rockall. Ireland ratified the Convention on 21 June 1996. The United Kingdom acceded to the Convention on 25 July 1997. It is accordingly accepted by both states that Rockall cannot be used as a basis for delimiting their respective continental shelves or fisheries zones. While the United Kingdom continues to claim jurisdiction over Rockall, this claim is not accepted by Ireland. Each country remains aware of the position of the other.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The United Nations&rsquo; Development Programme (UNDP) is the leading development organisation within the UN system and poverty reduction is at the core of its mandate and work. In recognition of the central role played by UNDP within the UN development system, Ireland has increased its core contributions to the organisation in recent years, for instance contributing &euro;16.2m in 2006. </P>
        <P>UNDP works at a strategic level to reduce poverty and assist in reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). National ownership is at the heart of its approach. It works closely with Governments in the formulation of national poverty eradication strategies based on local needs and priorities. UNDP supports the implementation of these nationally-owned solutions and helps ensure their effectiveness by connecting countries to global best practice and resources, and by coordinating the efforts of central Government, civil society and outside funders.</P>
        <P>Specific activities undertaken by UNDP include advice and capacity building in the area of macroeconomic and financial sector reform, as well as cooperation with Governments and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in the development of employment strategies for implementation at national level.</P>
        <P>UNDP also maintains a number of programmes which provide economic incentives for poverty reduction, such as its Growing Sustainable Business for Poverty Reduction Initiative, which works with the private sector to pro<Col N="490"/>mote sustainable business projects in developing countries. This programme identifies new investment opportunities, facilitates access to finance and develops partners&rsquo; skills to encourage investment, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. These investment opportunities provide an economic incentive for countries to change the way they do business. Ireland contributed &euro;50,000 to this initiative in 2006.</P>
        <P>UNDP also works through its subsidiary Fund, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), to invest in Least Developed Countries and to enhance the economic capacity of national Governments. UNCDF takes an innovative approach to this work, using microfinance to empower the poorest members of society, who are normally excluded from the financial system. It also builds the capacity of policy makers to identify constraints in the financial sector and to implement reform. Ireland contributed &euro;400,000 to its work in 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 31 together. </P>
        <P>I can confirm categorically that no steps will be taken to develop diplomatic relations with Burma until Aung San Suu Kyi is released from house arrest. I remain deeply concerned that Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained continuously for more than three years without charge and would, once again, urge the Burmese government to restore fully her freedom and civil liberties.</P>
        <P>There have been no recent direct bilateral contacts with the Government of Burma. However, at the ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting) Summit held in Helsinki last September, the Taoiseach raised the situation in Burma in the presence of the Burmese Foreign Minister, calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. The Burmese Foreign Minister attended as a member of ASEAN (the Association of South East Asian Nations &mdash; whose members are part of the ASEM process). Burma was the only participant at the Summit not invited at Head of State or Government level. The EU Troika met with the Foreign <Col N="491"/>Minister in the margins of the Summit to reinforce the EU&rsquo;s strong concerns about the lack of progress in Burma. We continue to raise the issue of Burma with our ASEAN partners at every appropriate opportunity and I welcome their increased efforts to put pressure on the Burmese r&eacute;gime.</P>
        <P>In my statement to the 61st Session of the UN General Assembly on 26 September 2006, I referred to the particularly grave human rights situation in Burma, and called once again on the Burmese r&eacute;gime to move towards democracy and to release all political prisoners, in particular Aung San Suu Kyi.</P>
        <P>The situation in Burma was most recently discussed at the EU General Affairs and External Council Meeting in Luxembourg on 12 June 2006. Subsequently, the UN Security Council included Burma on its agenda on 29 September when it was briefed by UN Under-Secretary-General (UNUSG) Gambari, who had visited Burma in May. In a welcome development, UNUSG Gambari paid a second visit to the country in November. These visits were the first high-level visits to that country by a UN representative in more than two years. I welcome the fact that during his visits Mr Gambari was able to meet with the most senior Burmese leaders, as well as with Aung San Suu Kyi and representatives of her party, the National League for Democracy.</P>
        <P>While I strongly welcome the inclusion of Burma on the Security Council agenda, I regret the recent failure of the Council to adopt a draft resolution calling on the Government to cease military attacks against civilians in ethnic minority regions and to begin a substantive political dialogue that would lead to a genuine democratic transition. It is vitally important that the Burmese government allow the UN to play a role in promoting common ground between the government and the National League for Democracy, so that the National Convention can proceed in a more inclusive way. Without broader representation, including, and in particular, that of the National League for Democracy (NLD), the usefulness of the National Convention, whose task is to draft a new constitution, will be very severely limited.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The peace process in Nepal has made significant progress since the restoration of Parliament and accountable Government, following a decision by King Gyanendra of Nepal, in response to public protests, to restore executive power last April. This was followed by the signature of a Comprehensive Peace Accord between the Seven Party <Col N="492"/>Alliance (SPA) and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists) on 21 November 2006, which stated the commitment of both parties to transforming the existing ceasefire into a permanent and sustainable peace. </P>
        <P>I welcome the adoption on 15 January 2007 of an interim constitution and the establishment of an interim legislature, with the participation of the Maoists. The interim Parliament will oversee the working of the interim Government and the holding of elections for a Constituent Assembly, planned for June 2007. I would encourage all sides to engage actively in carrying on the work towards representative elections.</P>
        <P>On 23 January 2007 the UN Security Council established a United Nations Political Mission in Nepal with a mandate to monitor the ceasefire and assist in the election of a Constituent Assembly. The Mission is also tasked with monitoring the management of arms and armed personnel of both sides through a Joint Monitoring Coordinating Committee. The EU is also considering sending an EU Election Observation Mission to Nepal.</P>
        <P>While Nepal has made remarkable progress towards peace, challenges remain and disturbances continue in the south of the country. Ireland and the EU will continue to support the peace process in Nepal and the United Nation&rsquo;s role in assisting in the electoral and arms management process and will urge the Government of Nepal to ensure the peace process is inclusive.</P>

        <Quest> the number of incidents involving Irish citizens abroad which required consular assistance through Ireland&rsquo;s embassies in 2006; the number of times Irish citizens availed of the services of the embassy of another EU Member State where there was no Irish diplomatic representation available; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Department of Foreign Affairs provides consular assistance to thousands of Irish citizens who travel or reside abroad each year. The consular services provided by our Embassies and Consulates abroad include the following: </P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />issuing passports including emergency travel documents</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />assistance to victims of serious accidents, illnesses or crime</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />assisting people detained, arrested or imprisoned abroad</P><Col N="493"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />transferring funds, provided by family members, to Irish citizens abroad where conventional means are unreliable or non-existent</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />repatriation of Irish citizens in emergency circumstances</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />assistance in connection with deaths abroad and the return of remains to Ireland</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />providing local travel advice to Irish citizens</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />voluntary registration of Irish citizens.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Over the last decade, the number of Irish citizens travelling abroad has increased dramatically. As well as an increase in the numbers travelling to traditional western hemisphere destinations, Irish people are now travelling in greater numbers, and indeed living abroad, in a wider range of locations throughout the world than ever before. As the numbers of Irish citizens travelling and living abroad continue to rise, so also does the need for consular assistance and support.</P>
        <P>An example of the number of Irish people travelling abroad can be gauged from the fact that in excess 1.5 million of our citizens visited Spain in 2006 and over 500,000 visited the USA.</P>
        <P>Ireland now has 74 resident Missions and 85 Honorary Consuls representing the country in all parts of the world. They are readily available, as the need arises, to provide consular assistance to our citizens in need abroad. Likewise, in countries where we have no resident presence, citizens can avail of the services of any EU Embassy. As I believe the Deputy will appreciate, the above embraces a very substantial number of contacts which would be difficult to quantify. I am very pleased, however, that the overwhelming number of our citizens indicate that they are extremely appreciative of the quality of the support and advice they receive from the Department&rsquo;s offices overseas.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 102 together. </P>
        <P>The Embassy in London is located at the corner of Grosvenor Place and Chapel Street. At approximately 12 noon on 30 January, a man climbed from the street onto the Embassy&rsquo;s first-floor balcony on Grosvenor Place. He then unfurled and tied to the balcony railings a banner protesting against the Shell company&rsquo;s plans for bringing natural gas ashore at Rossport, Co. Mayo. At the same time, about 12 other protestors were seen at street level, handing out leaflets to passers-by on Grosvenor Place.</P>
        <P>Embassy staff immediately alerted the Police and a number of officers from the Diplomatic Protection Group of the London Metropolitan Police were on the scene within minutes, liaising with the Ambassador and Embassy staff and monitoring the activities of the protesters. Escorted by Embassy staff, two Police Officers also proceeded through the Embassy to the balcony, where they held discussions with the protester. Within a short time the protester agreed to leave the premises and did so via the main staircase, in the company of the Police Officers. The banner was also removed. The Embassy understands that the man was questioned by the Police and was released some two hours later. In the meantime, the other protesters had been moved on by the Police.</P>
        <P>Throughout the incident the Embassy remained in constant contact with relevant officials of the Department at HQ. At no time did any protester gain entry to the Embassy building except, as indicated, in the company of Police Officers. Nor was there any threat to Embassy staff or any damage to Embassy premises.</P>
        <P>In consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, security at the Embassy is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Nevertheless, I regard this as a serious incident and I have asked the Ambassador, in consultation with relevant officials at Headquarters and the Garda Liaison Officer stationed at the Embassy, to again review Embassy security in order to ensure that the premises and its staff are and remain safe and secure.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 64, 104 and 108 together. </P>
        <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs will decentralise to Limerick. This is scheduled to take place during the second half of 2007 and will involve the relocation to Limerick of 124 posts.</P>
        <P>I am aware from my ongoing contacts with the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) of their concerns in relation to decentralisation and the role of development specialists in the Irish Aid programme.</P><Col N="496"/>
        <P>Development specialists perform an important role in the business of Irish Aid. The specialists work alongside diplomatic and general service staff, in close contact and co-operation with each business unit within the Division.</P>
        <P>There are a number of issues to be worked out with regard to the specialist posts which are scheduled to move. Discussions are on-going at a very senior level with representatives of the specialists, with their union IMPACT and with the Department of Finance in order to resolve the outstanding issues. I am conscious of the concerns of the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) about the position of the development specialists, but I hope that these discussions can be brought to a successful conclusion at an early date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The present situation, given that the discussions referred to above are actively under way, is that no Principal Development Specialist has applied to decentralise to Limerick while of the twelve Senior Development Specialists posts at headquarters, two originally applied but subsequently withdrew their applications.</P>
        <P>There are also nine Development Specialist posts at headquarters. Five Development specialists originally applied to decentralise to Limerick and subsequently withdrew their applications. At present four specialists, who commenced employment since the announcement of the decentralisation programme in December 2003, are scheduled to decentralise.</P>
        <P>I should also point out that there are 20 development specialists attached to Embassies in our programme countries.</P>
        <P>Decentralisation is a Government decision and the Government is committed to moving ahead with its implementation. At present, 53 posts in the Directorate are filled by officers who have signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick. A further 15 officers who are serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad will be taking up duty in Irish Aid in Limerick in advance of the move. In addition, 20 officers from other Departments who have applied to decentralise to Limerick, most of whom are cur<Col N="497"/>rently based in provincial locations, will transfer to the Department closer to the date of the move. Once these officers take up duty in Irish Aid, 88 posts (71% of the 124 posts scheduled to move) will be in place.</P>
        <P>A small number of staff at entry grades will be recruited for direct assignment to Limerick in the months preceding the move.</P>
        <P>Very importantly, almost all of the senior management team for Limerick are in place. In this regard, the Director General of Irish Aid will be decentralising to Limerick, as will 8 Counsellors who are already in place in the Directorate. The changeover of the senior management team, just as in other grades, has been implemented in a planned and careful way so as to minimise disruption to the business of the Directorate.</P>
        <P>In addition, and in order to help effect the smoothest possible transfer to Limerick, plans are in train for an advance party move involving approximately 50 staff members which is scheduled for May.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 38, 39, 68, 85 and 198 together.</P>
        <P>The Government remains very actively engaged, directly with the parties, in cooperation with our EU partners and at the UN in the promotion of a negotiated two-State solution to the Israeli &mdash; Palestinian conflict.  This must be at the heart of a comprehensive settlement to the interlinked problems of the Middle East.  During my discussions with Israeli, Palestinian, Egyptian and Lebanese political leaders last week, I found broad agreement on the need to revive a credible political process.  I urged all parties to seize the <Col N="499"/>opportunity offered by the renewed engagement of the international Quartet.</P>
        <P>Since its victory in the Palestinian legislative elections one year ago, Hamas has refused to commit decisively to the peace process.  The EU and the international community have suspended direct assistance to the Government of the Palestinian Authority as a result.  However, it is important to note that the EU remains the largest donor to the Palestinian people and that the level of its assistance actually rose by some 30% last year, to &euro;650 million.  A significant proportion of this was channelled through the Temporary International Mechanism for direct assistance to the Palestinian people, which the EU took the lead in establishing in July last year.  Ireland&rsquo;s assistance to the Palestinians increased by 40% in 2006, to &euro;6.4 million.  Our assistance will increase further in 2007 as a result of the decision, announced during my visit to Bethlehem, to increase funding to the United National Relief and Works Agency, for its services to Palestinian refugees.</P>
        <P>However, no amount of humanitarian assistance will resolve the problems being experienced by the Palestinian people.  Their root causes can only be addressed through political negotiations.  The Government therefore strongly supports the continuing efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas to negotiate the formation of a Palestinian government of national unity, and to develop substantive negotiations with Israel for a viable two-State solution.  The EU has made it clear that it looks forward to the formation of a government with a platform which reflects the conditions set out clearly by the Quartet last year.</P>
        <P>Despite the deadlock in the process over the past year, the EU has continued to impress on all parties the need to act on their obligations under international law, and under the Quartet Roadmap.  In this context, the EU has consistently called for an immediate freeze of Israeli settlement activity, an end to the construction of the separation barrier on occupied land and the ending of the practice of demolition of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.  These, and other Israeli activities in and around East Jerusalem and in the Jordan Valley, are contrary to international law and threaten to undermine the viability of a two-State solution.  I raised all of these issues very clearly in my discussions with Foreign Minister Livni in Jerusalem last week.</P>
        <P>The Government has also monitored specific cases of demolitions in villages near Hebron and in East Jerusalem, and our concerns are actively raised with the Israeli authorities through the Embassy in Tel Aviv.  We are continuing to monitor development in cooperation with our EU partners and with Palestinian, Israeli and Irish NGOs.  We will continue to express our serious <Col N="500"/>concerns on these and related issues directly in our contacts with the Israeli Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the beginning of last year, significant progress has been made towards securing the Government&rsquo;s overriding priority &mdash; the restoration of power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland and full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  </P>
        <P>The St. Andrews Agreement, published by the two Governments on 13 October 2006, sets out a clear way forward for all parties to commit to the full operation of stable power-sharing government in Northern Ireland and to full support for policing and the criminal justice institutions.  We are convinced that if implemented in good faith by the parties, it will clear the way for the restoration of the devolved institutions on 26 March 2007.</P>
        <P>There has been important progress in that regard since we met with the parties at St. Andrews. Practical changes to the operation of the institutions on restoration have been agreed.  Both Governments have announced financial packages to help underpin restoration and there has been progress across a range of equality, human rights, victims and social exclusion issues.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the recently published IMC Report confirms that the decision of the Sinn F&eacute;in Ard Fheis on policing on 28 January contains all the necessary elements of support for policing and criminal justice set out in the St. Andrews Agreement.  This landmark step, together with the subsequent statements by the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership, opens up the prospect for the first time of inclusive policing across the entire community.</P>
        <P>Our primary focus now is to ensure that all of these positive developments can be built on through the restoration of shared accountable government, consistent with the St. Andrews Agreement.  We will spare no effort to achieving that objective by 26 March.  The Assembly election due to be held on 7 March is an integral part of the process and timetable agreed at St. Andrews.  It is being held for the explicit purpose of endorsing the St. Andrews Agreement and of electing an Assembly that will form a power-sharing Executive on 26 March in accordance with that Agreement and timeframe.</P><Col N="501"/>
        <P>However, in the event the parties fail to agree to share power by that date and consistent with the St Andrews Agreement, new British-Irish partnership arrangements have been prepared jointly with the British Government.  The Taoiseach and I reviewed developments in this regard when we met with Secretary of State Peter Hain in Cardiff on 4 February to discuss the implementation of the St. Andrews Agreement. Our officials also continue to keep the matter under review.</P>
        <P>The partnership arrangements would ensure the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to the fullest extent possible, and in a manner which assures that the rights and interests of all in Northern Ireland and on these islands are fully protected and respected.  This would also include advancing North/South co-operation for the benefit of all.  The North/South Bodies, established under the Good Friday Agreement, play a crucial part in delivering the benefits of such co-operation.</P>
        <P>The new partnership arrangements have been prepared in the event they are required.  However, we have made clear that this is not our preferred outcome.  After four years of suspension, the people of Northern Ireland are entitled to see devolved government restored and their elected representatives working actively and openly for them in a fully restored Assembly and shared Government</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 103 together.</P>
        <P>European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) is an integral part of the European Union&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy, the principles and objectives of which are set out in the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice Treaties, approved by the people at successive referenda.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are nine ESDP missions currently under way, both civilian and military.  The civilian missions include police and rule of law missions, security sector reform assistance, and border monitoring missions in the Balkans, the Middle East and Africa.  The principal military mission has been the ongoing peace stabilisation mission <Col N="502"/>in Bosnia-Herzegovina (EUFOR Althea).  An EU Planning Team has been deployed to Kosovo to prepare for an expected rule of law mission in Kosovo to commence in early summer, in succession to the current UN mission operating there. EU Foreign Ministers have also held preliminary discussions regarding a possible mission to Afghanistan to assist with police training and other related tasks.  Current and future ESDP missions were reviewed by Foreign and Defence Ministers meeting together at the General Affairs and External Relations Council last November.  I continue also to have regular discussions of relevant ESDP issues with my EU counterparts at bilateral meetings as they occur.</P>
        <P>The Union is continuing to develop its capabilities for crisis management operations, both military and civilian based on the objectives set out in the (military) Headline Goal 2010 and the Civilian Headline Goal 2008.  These include having the capacity to undertake humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking, along with conflict prevention and civilian crisis management.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Apart from Ireland, twenty-six nations &mdash; including Turkey and Norway &mdash; have also committed to forming or joining the rapid response EU Battlegroups, which are now fully operational. At our meeting on 14 November 2006, the Government decided that Ireland would provide a contingent of the Defence Forces to participate in the Nordic Battlegroup, scheduled to be on stand-by in the first half of 2008.  The Government will shortly seek the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in this Battlegroup. Any actual deployment of the Irish contingent of the Nordic Battlegroup will of course remain subject to the requirements of the &lsquo;triple lock&rsquo; of Government decision, D&aacute;il approval and UN authorization.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 116 together. </P>
        <P>The 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome on 25 March, 1957 is a milestone in the history of the Union.  As I indicated in the House at the end of last year, it is entirely <Col N="503"/>appropriate that citizens throughout the Union should have the opportunity of commemorating the peace and prosperity achieved by Europe over the past half century.</P>
        <P>The German Presidency is preparing a declaration on the occasion of the anniversary for adoption by EU Heads of State and Government during their meeting in Berlin in March.  We fully support the Presidency in their intention to produce a text in straightforward terms that will recall the immense achievements of the Union, the distance we have travelled since the adoption of the Treaty, and our shared determination to meet the challenges of the future in the interests of our citizens.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Ireland also it is appropriate that we should mark this important anniversary and we are planning a number of events during the year. My Department is coordinating its efforts with, among others, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Education and Science, the European Movement, the National Forum on Europe, the Central Bank, An Post, the Institute of Public Administration, the Institute of European Affairs, the European Commission, and the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>Planning thus far includes a commemorative coin and stamp; a series of schools&rsquo; competitions; a DVD for distribution to schools; and a programme of lectures at various third level institutions throughout the country.  As regards my own Department, we intend to fund a special commemorative newspaper supplement on the European Union and Ireland; a book of essays on the EU; and a public event, possibly at Farmleigh in the summer.  I believe that it is especially important for our young people, who have not had direct experience of the transformation of Ireland since we joined the European Communities, to be made aware of Europe&rsquo;s remarkable progress over the past fifty years.</P>
        <P>In addition to events at home, there is an expectation that Ireland will participate in a number of events abroad. A Jack B Yeats painting, The Singing Horseman, from the National Gallery has already been loaned to the Italian authorities for an exhibition they are mounting in Rome in connection with the anniversary. In Brussels, also, we intend to participate in Europalia, a major cultural event in which all Member States are likely to take part.</P>

	<P>Accession negotiations were opened with Croatia <Col N="504"/>on 3 October 2005.  The screening process, which scrutinises the compatibility of Croatian legislation with EU legislation has continued since then, although progress has been slow in comparison with previous enlargement rounds.  After each chapter has been screened, the EU can decide, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, whether the negotiations in that sector should be opened.  </P>
        <P>Croatia has opened and provisionally closed negotiations on two chapters (&ldquo;Science and Research&rdquo; and &ldquo;Education and Culture&rdquo;).  Negotiations have been opened on three further chapters (&ldquo;Economic and Monetary Policy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Enterprise and Industrial Policy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Customs Union&rdquo;).  To date, the Commission has presented its reports to the Council on 11 further negotiating chapters for Croatia. Benchmarks, which must be achieved before negotiations may be opened, have been agreed for 7 of the 11 chapters for Croatia.</P>
        <P>The European Commission published its annual enlargement package on 8 November 2006.  The package includes an individual assessment of the progress made by all of the candidate and potential candidate countries as well as an overall enlargement strategy paper.  The Commission report commends the good start Croatia has made to its accession negotiations.  The report also noted that Croatia needs to accelerate the pace of reforms in order to ensure that its good start to the accession process is maintained.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At its meeting of 11 December 2006, the General Affairs and External Relations Council welcomed the Commission&rsquo;s report and recommendations.  While commending Croatia for the advances it has made in the past year, it stressed the need for Croatia to build on its progress to date and continue its reform programme including, in particular, in the areas of judicial and public administration reform, the fight against corruption and economic reform.  The Council stated that rigorous implementation of Croatia&rsquo;s obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, in particular in the areas of state aid and real estate acquisition, would be essential to maintain Croatia&rsquo;s positive momentum on the path to EU membership.  The need for Croatia to continue its cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and to pay due attention to good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation was also emphasised.  The European Council endorsed the conclusions of the General Affairs Council at its meeting of 14-15 December.</P>

	<P>Passport fees during 2005 amounted to &euro;32.6 million, with total expenditure at &euro;31 million, giving a surplus of over &euro;1 million.  This figure is arrived at using cash-based accounting methods. Using accrual-based accounting methods, involving a depreciation charge for capital investment on the new passport project, there may well be a slight deficit. Overall, however fees and expenditure could be said to break about even.  </P>
        <P>The above represents an average cost of &euro;45.54 and an average revenue of &euro;47.89.  The average revenue reflects the fact that, for instance, passports are issued free of charge to applicants over the age of 65, while there are reduced rates for persons under 18 years of age and infants up to the age of 3.</P>
        <P>In 2006 a total of 86,970 passports were issued by our Embassies and Consulates abroad and some 40,000 were issued to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland.</P>

        <P>I have outlined the main elements of my visit last week to the Middle East in my reply to Questions No. 1 and 5 answered earlier.</P>
        <P>I held discussions with political leaders in Israel, Palestine, Egypt and Lebanon, which focused on the urgent need to revive a credible political process in the region.

There is broad agreement that, at its heart, must be a negotiated, viable two-State solution to the Israeli &mdash; Palestinian conflict.  I urged all the parties to seize the opportunity now available to resume substantive negotiations.  I assured them of the determination of the Government and of our EU partners to support efforts in this direction, both directly and through a more active and sustained engagement by the international Quartet.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputies will be aware that I had hoped to visit Gaza to see for myself the extent of the humanitarian crisis in the area. I cancelled the visit at the request of President Mahmoud Abbas, in view of the very difficult security situation.  In addition to meeting with the President in Ramallah, I visited Bethlehem, where I witnessed the effects of the construction of the security barrier on the lives of ordinary Palestinians.  I also visited the impressive UNRWA school for girls in the Aida Refugee Camp. During my discussions there with the Commissioner General for UNRWA, Karen Koning Abu Zayd, I announced a 27% increase in Government funding for the UN Agency, for its services to Palestinian refugees. This will amount to &euro;11.4 million over the next three years.  It represents a further significant increase in the Government&rsquo;s assistance to the Palestinian people in 2007, which increased by 40% last year, to &euro;6.4 million.</P>
        <P>Following my meetings on 31 January with Foreign Minister Livni, President Abbas and a number of other Israeli and Palestinian political figures, I travelled to Cairo on 1 February for meetings with three members of the Egyptian Government, Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit, General Omar Suleiman and Trade and Investment Minister Rasheid Mohamed Rasheid.  My meetings built on the very positive discussions held during the visit to Ireland by President Mubarak in December.  We reviewed developments in the Middle East Process and across the region and I raised in particular the role which Egypt is playing as part of the international efforts to resolve the crisis in Darfur.  I also met with the Secretary General of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, for a discussion on regional developments and Darfur. He also briefed me on his efforts to broker an agreed solution to the political crisis in Lebanon, through national dialogue. I assured him of the Government&rsquo;s full support for these efforts.</P>
        <P>On 2 February, I met with Prime Minister Fouad Siniora in Beirut, and emphasised the Government&rsquo;s firm support both for his Government and for the sovereignty and independence of Lebanon.  I briefed him on the Government&rsquo;s assistance for the reconstruction of Lebanon, in <Col N="507"/>particular the pledge of an additional &euro;2 million announced at the international conference on Lebanon in Paris on 25 January.  He expressed particular appreciation for the longstanding involvement of the Defence Forces in the UNIFIL peacekeeping mission, since its inception in 1978.</P>
        <P>I travelled to Southern Lebanon in order to meet the members of the Defence Forces who are serving with great distinction in the strengthened UNIFIL force, as part of a joint contingent with Finnish forces, which is based near the town of Marjayoun.</P>

        <P>On Monday 5 February, my Spanish colleague, Miguel &Aacute;ngel Moratinos, and I met in Dublin, and among the matters discussed was extraordinary rendition.  Foreign Minister Moratinos was the only Minister for Foreign Affairs, apart from myself, to attend a meeting of the TDIP Committee.  He expressed particular interest in my proposal that the prospect of updating the 1944 Chicago Convention be examined at the European level as one concrete way in which instances of extraordinary rendition will be prevented from occurring in the future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 82 together. </P>
        <P>Somalia has not had an effective government since 1991.  A Transitional Federal Government (TFG) representing a range of clans was established in Nairobi with UN approval and EU support in 2004, but it was unable to make a significant impact on the ground. Discontent with a decade of anarchy led to increased support for the United Islamic Courts (UIC), which enforced sharia law in large parts of southern Somalia, including Mogadishu, from mid-2006.</P>
        <P>Islamic extremists gained the upper hand over moderates in the UIC, and threatened a jihad against Ethiopia.  In late December 2006, a joint operation by the Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian troops led to the collapse of the UIC.</P>
        <P>In January 2007, Ethiopia began to withdraw its troops from Somalia, and on 19 January the African Union decided to send a peace support force (AMISOM) to the country for an initial period of six months.  Its mandate will be to support the TFG, facilitate the provision of humanitarian aid and help to create conditions conducive to long-term stabilization, reconstruction and development in Somalia.</P>
        <P>The situation in Somalia is high on the EU agenda.  It was discussed at the European Council on 14-15 December 2006, and again by EU Foreign Ministers on 22 January.  The Council concluded that &lsquo;The EU believes that a window of opportunity exists for a sustainable solution to Somalia&rsquo;s difficulties.&rsquo;</P>
        <P>The EU supports the African Union&rsquo;s decision to send a force to replace Ethiopian troops in Somalia, but has also stressed that for the force to be effective in sustaining peace, a national reconciliation process should start in parallel. EU Foreign Ministers placed great emphasis on the need for dialogue between the Transitional Federal Government and a wide range of other groups, including clan elders, Islamic leaders, business people, civil society and women.  They also expressed the EU&rsquo;s readiness to support AMISOM financially, provided the right conditions are in place.  In the longer term, the question of what role the UN can play in Somalia will have to be considered.  On 2 February, the UN Security Council asked that a UN technical mission be sent to Somalia to assess security and to report on the prospects for peace.</P>
        <P>In all discussions on Somalia, Ireland has also laid particular emphasis on the need for inclusive dialogue which reaches out to moderate Islamists as a basis for a future stability.  The Government gave over &euro;5 million in humanitarian assistance to Somalia and funding to Irish NGOs working in the country in 2006.  This was a major increase <Col N="509"/>on recent years, due both to severe drought and flooding, and to growing concern at the security situation and its humanitarian consequences.  So far in 2007, we have committed &euro;3.1 million in humanitarian funding to the UN Consolidated Appeal for Somalia.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The United States carried out two aerial attacks in the extreme south of Somalia in January 2007, targeting suspected al-Qaeda members, who the US alleged may have been responsible for bombings of US Embassies which resulted in significant loss of life in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.  The full details of the effect of the US bombings on the ground are not clear, although the loss of life is greatly to be regretted. Supporting a swift return to peace, stability and the rule of law in Somalia is the best way to prevent the country from becoming further destabilised and a haven for terrorism.  I have not had any discussions with the US authorities to date on this issue.</P>
        <P>The next General Affairs and External Relations Council on 12 February will continue discussions on how the EU can best support stability and development in Somalia.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 61 together.</P>
        <P>The Government has consistently stated that the border crossings closed by the British authorities on grounds of security should be reopened as part of the wider process of security normalisation in Northern Ireland, and in order to facilitate economic development in border areas.  To date, 102 crossings have been reopened since 1994, with just two remaining closed at Annaghroe and Knockaginney.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to the reopening of these remaining closed roads, and this commitment is set out in the chapter on All-Island Cooperation in the National Development Plan.</P>

	<P>The Government gave a commitment in the Good Friday Agreement to actively promote and develop respect, reconciliation and mutual understanding between the different traditions on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain. Following this, the Department of Foreign Affairs has provided assistance and grant aid to groups involved in cross-community and cross-border reconciliation and outreach work throughout this island.  This work assists the development of lasting political stability, and serves to underpin wider political efforts to reach agreement.  </P>
        <P>In pursuit of this commitment, the Department&rsquo;s Reconciliation Fund provides funding to organisations on both sides of the border, including groups from both nationalist and loyalist communities in Northern Ireland.  To give effect to the commitments made in the Good Friday Agreement, the budget of the Reconciliation Fund was increased almost eight-fold in 1999 to &pound;2 million. Since then, the Department of Foreign Affairs has awarded grants of just under &euro;21 million to over 580 groups involved in a wide range of cross-community and cross-border reconciliation activities.  The overall allocation for 2007 is &euro;3 million.</P>
        <P>It is not the practice of this Department to categorise the community background of the organisations that it deals with.  Indeed the work carried out by many groups in loyalist areas has a strong cross-community and cross border dimension.  However, a full list of all projects which have received funding is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The Department is committed to working with both sides of the community in Northern Ireland, and strives to build relationships with people from across the political spectrum.  Accordingly, many members of staff in my Department regularly have contact with those living and working in loyalist areas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland signed and ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against <Col N="511"/>Women (CEDAW) on 23 December, 1985. Ireland is strongly committed to the implementation of the Convention. States Parties to the Convention must submit periodic reports to the Committee on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women on progress in implementing the Convention. These reports describe in detail the measures undertaken by States Parties to implement the rights enshrined in the Convention.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland submitted its first report under the Convention in 1987.  Most recently, our fourth and fifth consolidated reports were submitted in 2003 and examined by the Committee at their 33rd session in July 2005.  Ireland&rsquo;s delegation was led by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with Special Responsibility for Equality Issues, Deputy Frank Fahey. The Committee issued concluding observations in July 2005 and these are being given full consideration.  The Government will also continue to submit regular periodic reports to the Committee in line with its obligations under the Convention.</P>
        <P>Ireland ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on 7 September, 2000.  The Optional Protocol came into force on 22 December, 2000.  It establishes an individual complaints procedure that gives individuals the right to bring complaints, alleging breach of the provisions of the Convention, to the UN Committee on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women.  The Protocol also establishes a general enquiry procedure that allows the Committee to conduct enquiries into serious and systematic abuses of women&rsquo;s rights.  The Committee has not to date received any complaints or requests for the instigation of an inquiry relating to Ireland under the Optional Protocol.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a strong supporter of the United Nations&rsquo; efforts to eliminate discrimination against women. We are represented each year at the Commission on the Status of Women by a delegation of representatives from my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and will continue to input actively into the work of the Commission and the related UN bodies which deal with the rights of women.</P>

	<P>The White Paper last year recommended a Rapid Response Initiative to address some perceived gaps in the international community&rsquo;s response mechanisms to sudden onset humanitarian crises such as the Tsunami and the devastating earthquake in Pakistan.  Considerable progress has been made in each of the three key elements of the Initiative: </P>
        <P LI="1" el="10"><i>1.  Pre-positioning of Humanitarian Supplies</i></P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">To allow for the immediate deployment of the key necessities in any crises, consultations have been held with UN agencies and specifications agreed on the stocks of shelter and housing, water and sanitation equipment &mdash; including such items as tents, blankets, plastic sheeting, water tanks and kitchen sets.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Last October, I signed an agreement with the UN World Food Programme (WFP) tasking them with the set up, procurement, management and transportation of two stores of humanitarian supplies on behalf of Irish Aid &mdash; at the UN&rsquo;s main humanitarian response base in Brindisi, Italy and at the Curragh Camp in Ireland.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Later this month, most of Ireland&rsquo;s supplies, sufficient to provide for more than 20,000 people, will be delivered to Brindisi.  The Curragh depot will hold similar supplies for <Col N="513"/>10,000 people and will become operational in the 2nd quarter of 2007.  Funding is available to cover three annual rotations of this material to crisis areas.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="10"><i>2.  Establishment of a Rapid Response Corps</i></P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Last Monday, my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and I launched a national campaign to recruit a Rapid Response Corps.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0" Just="Left">The Corps will comprise a select number of highly-qualified and appropriately experienced experts.  The skill sets required have been identified by our partner UN agencies.  A recruitment campaign is now under way to identify roughly 50 individuals with the necessary skills and experience.  Appropriate training will be provided for members of the Rapid Response Corps, who will be on stand-by for deployment on 72 hours&rsquo; notice in the early stages of a humanitarian response.  Their skills will be available to three of Ireland&rsquo;s key UN partner agencies: the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA).  In certain circumstances, our NGO partners could also have access to recruit expertise from the Corps.</P>
       <P LI="1" el="10"><i>3.  Enhancing the Emergency Capacities of International Humanitarian Response Agencies and Mechanisms:</i></P>
         <P LI="1" el="0">Irish Aid will assist our key partners in the UN system, the Red Cross family and among NGOs to improve their own response mechanisms.  In that context, targeted funding in the amount of &euro;3.4 million was disbursed last year.  For example, funding was provided for the new UN humanitarian response depot for Africa based in Accra, Ghana.  The depot was formally opened in December 2006 and the first airlift of food and humanitarian supplies, to assist vulnerable displaced persons in Chad, took place on 16 January 2007.</P>

        <P>The Deputy may wish to know that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has received government approval for the drafting of the Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill.  The Bill is at present being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government.  This Bill will create an offence of trafficking in persons for the specific purpose of sexual or labour exploitation.  This will supplement existing legislation in that area.  It is expected that the Bill will be published this year.  A copy of the draft Bill is available on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform website.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform has also indicated his intention to address the position of victims of trafficking via a policy statement in the context of the forthcoming Immigration Residence and Protection Bill.</P>
        <P>The ongoing struggle against human trafficking is a priority issue at EU and international level.  My Department actively supports measures against human trafficking in various international fora, such as the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the United Nations.  Ireland has signed the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. In addition, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform has recently <Col N="515"/>announced that he intends to ask the government to approve Irish signature of the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings.</P>
        <P>In addition, through the Irish Aid&rsquo;s Civil Society Fund, the Department of Foreign Affairs currently funds ECPAT (End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes International).  This is a global network of organisations working together to achieve the realisation of the right of all children to live free of child prostitution, child pornography and child trafficking for sexual purposes.  Funding amounts to &euro;300,000 over three years.</P>
        <P>Also, under the Civil Society Fund, my Department supports Children in Crossfire.  The overall aim of this programme is to combat trafficking in human beings, especially women and children, within South Asia through increasing and promoting the roles of community and local government in the reduction of trafficking, as well as increasing the level of participation of poor women and children in social and economic activities.  Funding for this programme amounts to &euro;379,000 over three years.</P>

	<P>This year Irish Aid will deliver significant development and humanitarian funding to a number of countries in the Middle East.  Subject to the situation on the ground, it is likely that the bulk of Ireland&rsquo;s assistance will be allocated to Palestine, Lebanon and Iraq. </P>
        <P>Palestine will remain a significant recipient of assistance from Irish Aid.  Ireland has been providing development and humanitarian assistance in support of the Palestinian people since 1993.  In 2006, we allocated &euro;6.4 million to meet the humanitarian and development needs of the Palestinian people.  In 2007, we will provide at least a similar level of assistance.  Our focus will continue to be on the three sectors of education, rural development and support for civil society.  Ireland&rsquo;s core objective in providing assistance to Palestine is to alleviate the consequences of the conflict by enhancing the capacity of Ireland&rsquo;s partners in Palestine to respond to the current crisis and, where possible, to begin to meet future development needs.</P>
        <P>The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) remain key partners for Ireland in the provision of basic emergency assistance to the Palestinian <Col N="516"/>people.  Increased funding of &euro;3.8 million has already been allocated to UNRWA in 2007 &mdash; an increase of 25% on 2006.  Furthermore, I have made a commitment to maintain this increased level of funding for a three year period.  Core funding at this early stage will allow the Agency greater flexibility and predictability in budgeting for service delivery.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland responded swiftly to the crisis in Lebanon last year, providing nearly &euro;1.6 million in humanitarian assistance support.  At an International Conference in support of the Lebanon hosted by France last month, my colleague, Minster of State Noel Treacy, pledged a further &euro;2 million for recovery assistance in Lebanon, which will be allocated through targeted support for the work of Irish Aid&rsquo;s partners.</P>
        <P>I am deeply concerned at the continuing deterioration in the humanitarian situation in Iraq.  I am committed to continuing to assist the vulnerable population in that country.  Since 2003, Irish Aid has made funds of nearly &euro;8 million available for humanitarian interventions in Iraq.  Activities supported by Irish Aid currently include mines&rsquo; clearance work by the Mines Advisory Group, health care programmes for the Marsh Arab population run by the Amar Foundation, and support for the United Nations High Commission on Refugees for the provision of services to internally-displaced persons.  Already this year, Ireland has pledged a further &euro;3 million to help those affected by violence.  We will continue to play our part in alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi people through trusted partner agencies including the UN, the Red Cross family and NGOs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 58 and 193 together. </P><Col N="517"/>
<P>To date, eighteen Member States have ratified the Constitutional Treaty.  Luxembourg and Spain have done so by referendum, while sixteen Member States have ratified by parliamentary means.  As the House is aware, the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums held in France and the Netherlands in 2005. </P>
        <P>Following the outcome to the referendums in France and the Netherlands, the European Council initiated a period of reflection in order to allow time for further consideration of how to proceed with the Constitutional Treaty.  In June 2006, the European Council agreed to extend the reflection period for another year and to focus also on the Union&rsquo;s delivery of tangible results to EU citizens.</P>
        <P>The European Council mandated the Presidency to consult extensively with Member States and to present a report to the European Council in June 2007.  That report is to contain an assessment of the state of discussions with regard to the Constitutional Treaty and to explore possible future steps.  The report is intended to assist the European Council to take the necessary decisions on the Constitutional Treaty; these are expected during the second half of 2008 at the latest.</P>
        <P>In line with its mandate from the European Council, the German Presidency is currently holding a series of bilateral consultations with Member States.  In these discussions, we re-iterated Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to the Treaty as agreed by Heads of State and Government in 2004, and affirmed our readiness to proceed with ratification once there is clarity on the way forward at EU level.  The Presidency was advised of our view that the Constitutional Treaty is a carefully constructed package and remains the best available means for equipping the Union to meet the challenges facing us now and into the future.  For this reason, we believe that any attempt to alter the essential balance and substance of the draft Treaty would be unlikely to succeed.</P>
        <P>We have also made clear our position on the Treaty in our ongoing contact with the Presidency, both at Ministerial and official level.  Ireland strongly supports the efforts of the German Presidency, both with regard to the proposed Berlin Declaration as well as to their ongoing work to find a way forward for the Constitution.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 96 and 110 together.  </P>
        <P>The Government shares the widespread concern at the deterioration of the situation in Iraq.  Developments have been dominated by the appalling security situation, with daily bomb attacks aimed specifically at the civilian population and a continuing spiral of vicious sectarian violence.  The violence is effectively blocking the political and reconstruction efforts of Iraq&rsquo;s first fully sovereign and democratic Government and Parliament.</P>
        <P>The main concern of the Government and our EU partners is obviously for the welfare of the Iraqi people, as they attempt to rebuild their country after years of dictatorship and war.  The EU has provided over &euro;700 million in assistance for reconstruction since 2003.  Last month, the Government announced a pledge of a further &euro;3 million in assistance for the victims of the current violence, in particular the large numbers of families who have been forced to flee their homes.  This represents a substantial increase on the &euro;7.9 million already provided by the Government for humanitarian assistance in Iraq.</P>
        <P>Regrettably, there is no evidence that the insurgency and the inter-communal violence are being brought under control.  The situation in Baghdad is particularly grave.  According to the United Nations, almost 5,000 people lost their lives in the city in the last two months of 2006.  Last weekend, almost 130 people were killed in a single bomb attack at a market in a mainly Shia area of Baghdad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The execution of Saddam Hussein and a number of his associates has done nothing to stabilise the situation.  I strongly condemned both the fact and the manner of the executions, in line with the firm opposition of all EU Member States to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances.  I also stated clearly that, in the interests of justice and reconciliation in Iraq, the Iraqi Government should now take the step of ending executions.</P>
        <P>It would clearly be inappropriate for me to comment in this House on the State of the Union address by President Bush to the U.S. Congress, most of which related to the domestic political situation.  Deputies will be fully aware of the President&rsquo;s proposals to strengthen security in Iraq, and of the political controversy which they have engendered in the United States.  During my discussions in the Middle East last week, Arab pol<Col N="519"/>itical leaders emphasised that they fully supported the objectives of the US initiative.  It is in the interests of all parties that every effort be made by the international community, in cooperation with the Iraqi authorities, to improve the security situation in Iraq, as an essential step in stabilising the country and rebuilding its place in the region.</P>
        <P>The Government continues to believe that a secure and peaceful Iraq can only be assured through the maintenance of its territorial integrity, the development of shared political and other institutions and the consolidation of strong political and economic links with all the countries of the neighbouring region.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 115 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are currently no negotiations under way between the EU3 and Iran.  The last discussions to take place were between High Representative Solana, on behalf of the EU3, with lead Iranian negotiator Ali Larijani.  They met on a number of occasions in September 2006 but failed to agree an acceptable formula for commencing negotiations on the package of incentives presented to Tehran in June 2006, on behalf of the EU3, the United States, the Russian Federation and China. <Col N="520"/> The EU side was obliged, reluctantly, to conclude that Iran was not at that stage seriously interested in responding to this package.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An important development since then was the unanimous adoption by the United Nations Security Council of Resolution 1737 on 23 December 2006.  The Resolution stated that Iran should, inter alia, suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, and requested a compliance report from the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency within 60 days of the Resolution&rsquo;s adoption.  This report is awaited.  The Resolution also requested all Member States in the meantime to deny Iran any equipment, technology, technical expertise or financial assistance that could contribute to the proliferation of sensitive nuclear activities.</P>
        <P>The question of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme is kept under constant review within the European Union at official level and is also the subject of regular discussions at Ministerial level.  The most recent such discussion was at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting of 21-22 January 2007 in Brussels.  At the meeting, the Council welcomed the unanimous adoption of Resolution 1737 as a necessary and proportionate response to Iran&rsquo;s disregard for the concerns of the international community and the Security Council.

At the same time, the Council reiterated its continuing support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term solution and reaffirmed its support for the proposals presented to Iran in June 2006, which it saw as opening the way for a new relationship with Iran based on mutual respect and expanded cooperation.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The 13th Report of the Independent Monitoring Commission was requested by the two Governments as part of the St Andrews Agreement.  The <Col N="521"/>Report finds unambiguously that &ldquo;terrorism and violence have been abandoned&rdquo; by the Provisional IRA leadership.  The decision of the Sinn F&eacute;in Ard Fheis to endorse policing, as well as the significant efforts made in securing that endorsement, are recognised by the IMC as further substantial evidence of the commitment to the democratic process.</P>
        <P>On intelligence-gathering, the IMC states that it is its view that the Provisional IRA &ldquo;is not gathering intelligence for paramilitary or other unlawful purposes&rdquo;.  The report notes that &ldquo;the organisation continues to gather information about suspected informers or dissidents, but again there is no indication that it has been used to support illegal activity&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I welcome the finding of the IMC that the IRA as an organisation is not involved in any form of criminality, in this area or elsewhere.  I believe therefore there are no grounds for delay in moving ahead with the political process, and the timetable for devolution laid out at St Andrews.</P>
        <P>The picture with regard to dissident republican groups is clearly less positive.  The IMC confirms that dissident republican groups remain active and dangerous.  They have engaged in incendiary attacks against commercial targets and have attempted a number of attacks on police stations.  This and other activity is totally unacceptable.  As the T&aacute;naiste stated publicly when publishing the report, these findings stiffen the Government&rsquo;s resolve to ensure the Garda&iacute; are given all the resources and backing necessary to counter the threat posed by these groups.  There is a clear need for vigilance against attempts by such groups to destabilise the political process in the coming period.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates from 14 to 18 January 2007.  I was not part of the delegation.  The Taoiseach was accompanied by the Ministers for Agriculture and Food, Enterprise Trade and Employment and Education and Science.  A business delegation of 114 people, organised by Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland, also travelled. </P>
        <P>While the primary purpose of the visit was to promote the development of trade and economic relations, the Taoiseach and other members of the delegation held important meetings with senior political figures, including King Abdullah <Col N="522"/>of Saudi Arabia.  The Government&rsquo;s human rights concerns were raised during these meetings.  The Taoiseach also stated in a major political address at the King Faisal Foundation in Riyadh on 15 January that it is the clear position of the Government that fundamental human rights are inalienable.</P>
        <P>The promotion of fundamental human rights is a clear priority of the Government, and a central element of our foreign policy.  The overall human rights situation in Saudi Arabia is closely monitored by our Embassy in Riyadh, in cooperation with our EU partners. Individual cases are regularly raised with the Saudi authorities.  Human rights issues also form an important element of the dialogue between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council, which is the main framework for the EU&rsquo;s relations with Saudi Arabia.</P>
        <P>During the visit to Saudi Arabia, the Taoiseach and his Ministerial colleagues held a meeting with a group of Saudi businesswomen, in order to encourage their progress and to hear their concerns directly.  The development of closer economic relations between Ireland and Saudi Arabia provides an important opportunity for the examination of a range of political and other issues.  I am pleased that, in this context, there appears to be an increasing willingness on the part of the Saudi authorities and civil society to discuss important human rights issues.</P>

	<P>In the context of suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2002, the two Governments, in order to protect and maintain the achievements of the Good Friday Agreement, entered into an Agreement to ensure the continuation of the necessary public function performed by the North/South Implementation Bodies.  At the same time, the two Governments agreed that no new functions would be conferred on the Bodies during the temporary suspension of the Assembly. That Agreement remains in force. </P>
        <P>However, in the case of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, the functions to be carried out had been agreed by the two Governments prior to suspension.  The Agreement in 1999 which provided for the establishment of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission also provided that legislation be brought forward in both jurisdictions to enable the Body to carry out certain specified functions.  The Foyle and Carlingford Fisheries Bill 2006 gives effect to the two Governments&rsquo; agreement on the functions to be exercised by the Body.</P>
        <P>The drafting process, North and South, was complex and lengthy.  Now that the two Governments are in a position to fulfil this outstanding commitment, we are determined to do so in a timely manner.  Draft legislation is currently being brought through the legislative process in both jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>I particularly welcome this legislation as it is vital that we ensure effective regulation of aquaculture activity in the Loughs.  The legislation provides for the development and licensing of aquaculture by the Body and the exercise of a development function in relation to inland fisheries in the Foyle and Carlingford areas.</P>
        <P>The Government has been committed to ensuring the effective functioning of the North/South Bodies during suspension.  I very much look forward to these Bodies becoming fully operational again with the restoration of the Northern Ireland institutions and the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 74 and 94 together.</P>
        <P>I would like to set out the present context for the efforts to develop an international instrument to address the humanitarian concerns related to the use of cluster munitions. But let me make my position clear at the outset. I call for a total ban on cluster munitions.  The Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) is the recognised international forum for negotiations on humanitarian problems posed by such weapons. Discussions to date within the CCW have focussed on regulating their use in order to protect civilians, during and after conflict, rather than a total ban. As I made clear in my reply to PQ No 29 of 23 November 2006, Ireland has been calling for action on cluster munitions within this framework since July 2002. We have repeatedly stated our clear concern about the impact of these weapon systems on civilian populations.</P>
        <P>At the last CCW Review Conference, Ireland was among a small core-group of States calling for an international, legally-binding instrument to address comprehensively the issue of cluster munitions. This position is inspired by our tradition of involvement in UN peace-keeping operations, including in Lebanon, where our troops are both witnesses of the harm caused by such weapons, and are themselves at risk. Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has called for a freeze on the use of cluster munitions against military assets located in or near populated areas. My own preference, of course, is for a total ban on cluster munitions. I made this position clear during my visit last week to the Middle East, when I discussed the issue with our Defence Forces in Lebanon, including the dreadful impact of cluster bombs during the recent conflict there.</P>
        <P>At the Review Conference, our proposal for an international instrument was eventually supported by 25 States. We also joined these States in a Declaration calling for an international agreement that would include a prohibition on the use of cluster munitions within concentrations of civilians and a prohibition on the development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of cluster munitions that pose serious humanitarian hazards due to their unreliability and inaccuracy. Unfortunately, as I indicated last November, even this more limited proposal did not meet with consensus.  We remain committed to working within the CCW process, and elsewhere, to seek agreement on such an instrument. A series of meetings to further this objective will be held in the coming months. The Norwegian Foreign Minister has convened a meeting in Oslo later this month of countries and organisations interested in working towards an international ban on cluster munitions that have an <Col N="527"/>unacceptable humanitarian impact. The International Committee of the Red Cross is also organising an expert meeting in April to examine a range of humanitarian, military, technical and legal issues relating to these weapons and to consider all possible means of reducing their negative impact on civilian populations. The CCW itself will hold a meeting of government experts in June with a particular focus on cluster munitions. We will do everything possible so that these meetings can contribute to building momentum towards an effective international instrument.</P>
        <P>While a total ban remains the clear national objective, we believe that it is nonetheless important to continue to work with other governments and civil society to achieve as much progress as is possible in present circumstances. Any international agreement on cluster munitions must be effective in tackling the serious humanitarian concerns that have been raised and we will spare no effort in working to achieve this aim. In the absence of a ban, and pending an effective international instrument to address concerns regarding their use, we support the call for an immediate freeze on the use of cluster munitions.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to previous replies to similar questions concerning the United Nations Convention against Corruption, most recently on 23 November 2006. The Convention was adopted by the UN General Assembly in October 2003 and was signed on behalf of Ireland, when it opened for signature, in December 2003. The Convention entered into force on 14 December 2005. My colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has lead responsibility in this area, and his officials, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, are currently examining the Convention. They have also undertaken consultations with other Departments and Agencies. While the majority of its provisions are catered for in existing legislation, some additional legislation will be required to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention. The first Conference of the States Parties to the Convention was held in Jordan in December 2006, one year after the Convention&rsquo;s entry into force. The purpose of this Conference was to improve the capacity of and cooperation between States Parties to achieve the Convention&rsquo;s objectives, and to promote and review its implementation. Ireland was rep<Col N="528"/>resented by officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 111 together.</P>
        <P>The Spanish and Luxembourg Governments convened an informal meeting of Ministers for European Affairs to discuss the European Constitution in Madrid on Friday, 26 January. The meeting, entitled &ldquo;Friends of the European Constitution, for a better Europe,&rdquo; was held with a view to bolstering support for the Constitution and to assisting the German Presidency in its efforts to find a way forward. The eighteen countries that have already ratified the Constitutional Treaty, together with Portugal and Ireland as observers, participated in the meeting. Ireland was represented at the meeting by Minister of State Noel Treacy. A number of other Member States attended at official level. The meeting was a welcome opportunity to demonstrate the extensive support that exists for the Constitutional Treaty. We were pleased that participants agreed on the need to preserve the substance and balance of the Treaty; that we must support the German Presidency in their efforts to re-launch the ratification process; and that we must pursue an inclusive process taking account of the needs of all Partners.</P>
        <P>Ireland also availed of this opportunity to re-iterate our strong commitment to the Treaty as agreed by Heads of State and Government in 2004, and also to affirm our readiness to proceed with ratification once there is clarity on the way forward at EU level. The aim of the Constitutional Treaty is to allow Europe to address more effectively the challenges of the 21st century and to meet the expectations of our citizens. It is a carefully constructed package, achieved after a long and difficult negotiating process. It will allow for a more effective, more transparent and more democratic Europe, one which is at the service of its citizens. In short, it will equip the Union to meet the challenges facing us now and into the future. We do not underestimate the difficulties standing in the way of the Constitution&rsquo;s ratification, but we do believe it is <Col N="529"/>important for those who support the 2004 text to set out their views clearly and publicly, as was done at the informal Ministerial meeting in Madrid.</P>

	<P>United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 of 25 October 1971 recognised the Government of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China as the sole representative of China. Although Taiwan continues to exercise autonomy and to term itself &lsquo;The Republic of China&rsquo;, this is not recognised in international law. Taiwan&rsquo;s official status is that of a Province of China. In common with most Member States of the UN, Ireland recognises the Government of the PRC as the sole legitimate government of China. Ireland does not maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan and there is no inter-Governmental contact between the two sides. A Taipei Representative Office, established in Dublin in 1988, has a representative function in relation to economic and cultural promotion, but no diplomatic or political status. The relationship with the PRC is by far the most important domestic and foreign political issue for the leadership and people of Taiwan. It is at the heart of Taiwanese party politics, with the current government favouring greater independence, while the Opposition Coalition favours closer links with the mainland.</P>
        <P>Cross-China Straits relations are also a top priority for the PRC, with particular emphasis on maintaining the one-China policy in all international fora, and the ultimate reunification of Taiwan with the mainland. Ireland, together with our EU partners, has consistently stressed the importance of harmonious cross-Straits relations to the peace, stability and development of the PRC, Taiwan and the region in general. The adoption by the PRC in March 2005 of an anti-secession law concerning Taiwan which, though asserting that China would do its utmost to achieve a peaceful reunification of the country, also contained a military threat should Taiwan seek to declare independence, was much criticised by the international community, including the EU. Equally, the EU also expressed its concerns regarding provocative remarks made by the Taiwanese leader in early 2006. The economic relationship and interdependence between the China and Taiwan is expected to expand and deepen in the coming years. China is Taiwan&rsquo;s number one export market and Taiwan is one of the mainland&rsquo;s biggest investors. It is to be hoped <Col N="530"/>that these economic relationships will help ease political tensions across the China Straits in the longer-term.</P>

I have made clear on numerous occasions, however, that the Government, in addition to forcefully condemning extraordinary rendition, has no knowledge, as apparently alleged, of aircraft using Irish airports for this purpose. On the contrary, we have sought and received categoric assurances from the US authorities, confirmed at the highest levels, that this does not happen. This reality is further supported by the findings of the recent report of the European Parliament&rsquo;s Temporary Committee investigating extraordinary rendition. Moreover, in none of the investigations conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this matter, has evidence been adduced of such illegal activity at Irish airports.</P>

	<P>The UN Secretary-General&rsquo;s Special Envoy, former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, visited Belgrade and Pristina on 2 February to present his Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo status settlement. President Ahtisaari has indicated his intention to hold further consultations with the two parties on the Proposal during the coming weeks. My understanding is that he plans to deliver his final proposal to the UN Security Council in March, at which time he will pronounce on the status issue itself. The declared aim of the Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement is to define the provisions necessary for a future Kosovo that is viable, sustainable and stable. It includes detailed provisions concerning the promotion and protection of the rights of communities and their members, the effective decentralisation of government, and the preservation and protection of cultural and religious heritage. It also sets out constitutional, economic and security measures, aimed at contributing to the development of a multiethnic, democratic and prosperous Kosovo. A key element of the proposed Settlement is the mandate provided for a future international civilian and military presence in Kosovo, to supervise implementation of the Settlement and assist the competent Kosovo authorities in ensuring peace and stability throughout Kosovo.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Together with our EU partners, Ireland has consistently expressed strong support for the efforts of President Ahtisaari and his team since they commenced work on this most challenging and complex issue twelve months ago. While the precise details of President Ahtisaari&rsquo;s final proposal will not be known until after the period of consultations with the parties, I welcome the current proposal as reflecting our view that the future status of Kosovo must be based on multi-ethnicity, democracy, the rule of law and full respect for human rights, with effective guarantees to ensure the protection of minorities. I look forward to discussing these issues further with my EU Foreign Minister colleagues at the next meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 12 February, when we expect to receive a briefing from President Ahtisaari.  With regard to the question of implications for separatist movements in Eastern Europe, I am aware that Russia has advocated the need for &ldquo;universal principles&rdquo; to settle conflicts in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region, and has argued that the outcome in Kosovo will have <Col N="532"/>implications for these conflicts.

The EU, as a party to the Declaration, is committed to supporting developing countries&rsquo; efforts to protect public health, including access to affordable, quality medicines, and to ensuring these rights are protected in its bilateral trade agreements. Currently, negotiations are planned for new free trade agreements between the EU and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), South Korea and India, as well as Association Agreements with the Andean Community and Central America. Discussion on the draft mandates is at a preliminary stage. Ireland is actively engaged in this drafting process and is committed to ensuring that the negotiations will result in agreements which are consistent with the European Consensus on Development and that will benefit all sectors of the populations in the partner countries.</P>

	<P>The IMF and World Bank have made increasing efforts to tackle the problem of debt in developing countries since the launch of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in 1996. The HIPC Initiative, which was strengthened and enhanced in 1999, sought to reduce the debt burden of qualifying counties to sustainable levels but did not entail cancellation. Ireland contributed some &euro;30m towards the costs of implementation of the Initiative. The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), agreed by the G8 Countries at Gleneagles in July 2005 and which came into effect on 1 July last year, goes further. It is a commitment to the cancellation of the multilateral debt owed to the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund of many of the poorest and most indebted countries in the World. Most of these countries are in Africa. For the first time, the most powerful countries acknowledged that many poor countries need 100% debt relief if they are to address the development needs of their people seriously. This is an important basis from which we can continue <Col N="534"/>to work for a complete and sustainable solution to the debt problem facing poor countries.</P>
        <P>The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative is separate from the earlier HIPC Initiative, but linked to it operationally. Under this new Initiative, cancellation of eligible debts is granted to countries which have completed the HIPC Initiative process, i.e. have already been judged as qualified to receive debt relief. From the information available to me, we can see that progress is slow but positive. As of January 2007, 31 countries (the latest being Sierra Leone) of the 40 defined heavily indebted poor countries had received debt relief under the HIPC Initiative amounting to US$35 billion. So far, 20 of these countries have also received MDRI debt relief from the IMF and World Bank, amounting to a further US$17 billion. The total cost of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative is estimated at US$62 billion in nominal terms. The IMF share of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative&rsquo;s costs will largely be met by own resources, as authorised by IMF Members including Ireland. Ireland&rsquo;s additional share of the costs of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative amounts to &euro;58.6m out of the approximately US$37 billion total cost of debt relief to be provided by the World Bank. As a gesture of support and to underline our strong commitment to 100% debt relief for the poorest countries, this amount has already been paid over in full.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 113 together.</P>
        <P>As Deputies will be aware, I was one of only two Ministers for Foreign Affairs to attend a meeting of the European Parliament&rsquo;s Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners (the TDIP Committee). There is absolutely no suggestion in the TDIP Committee&rsquo;s Report that extraordinary rendition took place through Irish territory, and I welcome this. It is consistent with the clear and repeated assurances we have received from the US authorities.</P>
        <P>However, I regret that certain members of the European Parliament&rsquo;s Committee squandered the opportunity to produce a forward-looking document, focusing on the changes that may need to be made to the regulation of international civil aviation, as I had suggested during my exchange of views with the TDIP Committee, and have instead in places used the report to try and score partisan political points.</P>
        <P>This has resulted in a number of extremely strange inclusions in the Report. In particular, I would highlight its call for a ban on all CIA aircraft landing in Ireland, which is extraordinary for two reasons. Firstly, Ireland is the only country where a ban is called for. This peculiar situation is explained by the fact that the &ldquo;ban call&rdquo; results from an amendment tabled by an Irish MEP.  Secondly, the call for an absolute ban on landings by CIA-operated aircraft here is based on an illegitimate assumption that all CIA-operated flights are inherently sinister. Senator Dick Marty, for instance, who conducted a separate, Council of Europe investigation, recognised that &ldquo;it is evident that not all flights of CIA aircraft participate in &lsquo;renditions&rsquo;<?oasys _is0p1- ?>&rdquo;, and has indicated on other occasions that only a tiny minority of such flights might be engaged in such a practice.</P>
        <P>There are many legitimate reasons for international cooperation in intelligence matters. The Report&rsquo;s suggestion that all such cooperation by Ireland should be cancelled because of a risk of extraordinary rendition, which it itself implicitly recognises does not occur here, defies logic.</P>
        <P>Similarly, I fail to understand the Report&rsquo;s observations on parliamentary scrutiny. As I made clear to the TDIP Committee, the Ministers for Defence and for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are fully accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the activities of the security and intelligence services.</P>
        <P>Finally, in relation to the call for a parliamentary inquiry, I would draw Deputies&rsquo; attention to the fact that for the third time in less than one year, Seanad &Eacute;ireann has voted not to establish a Committee of enquiry in this matter. It is not a question of the Government stifling debate, rather that Members of the Oireachtas are rather <Col N="536"/>more objective in their assessment of the issues than are some of the members of the TDIP Committee. The time has surely come for all of us to focus on what concrete measures we might take to help prevent extraordinary rendition in the future instead of calling for even more inquiries.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s recently launched National Development Plan for the period 2007-2013 includes a comprehensive statement of Government policy on North/South co-operation. All-island collaboration is a key horizontal theme of the Plan. For the first time, the Plan contains proposals for significant Irish Government investment in North/South projects and initiatives for mutual benefit. The Government wishes to agree and implement these with the British Government and a restored Northern Ireland Executive.</P>
        <P>The proposed package, which will be funded from the overall NDP envelope, includes plans for: Joint investment in new strategic projects to benefit North and South; and the opening up of access to existing development funds on an all-island basis, and/or the introduction of new, agreed joint funding measures with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive upon restoration.</P>
        <P>The NDP also sets out the range of current and already planned North/South initiatives. We are investing over &euro;1 billion in projects such as the completion of the Dublin to Belfast road corridor, the upgrade of other major roads to the North, the second North-South electricity interconnector, the new South-North gas pipeline and the development of the City of Derry Airport.</P>
        <P>The two Governments have already agreed an ambitious agenda for strengthening North/South economic co-operation. Last October, Secretary of State Hain and I launched a ground-breaking Comprehensive Study on the All-Island Economy and agreed a range of important initiatives. These include further collaboration in research and development, including maximising access to EU funds and a new targeted approach to enterprise training and to identifying labour market needs on an all-island basis. We agreed to pool our resources in trade promotion, including the opening up of trade missions to businesses across the island and the placing of the overseas offices of Enterprise Ireland and Invest NI at the disposal of companies, North and South. The Taoiseach has recently returned from a very successful trade <Col N="537"/>mission to the Gulf that included over 20 Northern Ireland businesses.</P>
        <P>We also agreed to encourage the development of all-island business networks. I was very pleased to note that the first All-Island Business Networks Conference was held at Farmleigh House last week and was opened by Minister Miche&aacute;l Martin and his Northern Ireland counterpart Minister Maria Eagle. It was attended by over 100 companies from throughout the island.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to taking forward North/South co-operation to promote economic prosperity and high quality public services for all the people of the island of Ireland. I want to reach early agreement with the British Government and with a restored Northern Ireland Executive on the proposals we have put forward in the NDP. I particularly look forward to working with locally elected Northern Ireland Ministers to deliver the benefits of greater North/South co-operation.</P>

	<P>The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stated in its General Comment Number 15 that &ldquo;the human right to water entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Government supports the views expressed by the Committee in its General Comment Number 15.  Although national governments bear the primary responsibility for delivering on the obligation to provide water for all, General Comment No. 15 also highlights the role of international cooperation.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid is working to ensure that financial and other support is provided to enable developing countries to devise and implement national strategies and action plans aimed at delivering water and sanitation to all their citizens, with priority to the poorest rural and urban slum dwellers.</P>
        <P>I was pleased to note that the UNDP&rsquo;s 2006 Human Development Report recognised the Irish Government&rsquo;s commitment to investing in water and sanitation &mdash; a commitment which has been reiterated in the Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Irish Aid.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the decision taken by the Sinn F&eacute;in Ard Fheis on 28 January last to support policing and the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland. As the Taoiseach stated in this House last week, this was a landmark step. I also welcome the clarity offered by the leadership of Sinn F&eacute;in since the Ard Fheis in calling on everyone to cooperate with the police, including specifically on the murder of Robert McCartney, and supporting anyone from a nationalist background who wishes to join the PSNI.</P>
        <P>There is every indication that Sinn F&eacute;in are taking forward this change of policy without further delay or conditionality, and I would encourage the party&rsquo;s representatives to continue doing so, including at local level. When the Policing Board is reconstituted following elections and the restoration of the institutions, it will be important for Sinn F&eacute;in to continue this approach and take their places on that body and participate fully in its work.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?><P>I believe that these steps, together with the additional confirmation given by the IMC that the leadership of the IRA remains committed to an exclusively political path and has abandoned violence and terrorism, mean that there are now no grounds for delay in moving ahead with the political process, and the timetable for devolution laid out at St Andrews.</P>

	<P>Improving access to medicine is one of the critical challenges to improving health in the developing world. Many poor people do not have access to essential medicines due to a range of factors, including lack of drugs at health facilities, lack of trained staff to provide treatment and the high cost of medicine to poor people. Lack of access to medicine causes the deaths of many people each year in developing countries, particularly from HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria and infectious diseases in children. Access to medicine needs to be improved along with complementary measures for prevention and care.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to health and tackling HIV/AIDS and communicable diseases is set out in the White Paper on Irish Aid. We are committed to developing programmes that address the key causes of illness and ill health among the poorest and most vulnerable people and to strengthening health systems in the poorest countries. Providing access to essential medicines is a key part of this response. The greatest need in terms of medicine is for the treatment of communicable diseases, and that is why the Government has committed &euro;100 million annually to tackling HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases.</P>
        <P>One of the challenges in access to medicine is that drugs widely used in developing countries have become less effective. TB causes two million deaths a year, mainly in poor countries, yet there has been no major new TB drug developed for over 30 years. The Government is making a substantial investment in research and development for new drugs for TB and malaria. In 2006, Irish Aid committed &euro;9 million over three years both to the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development and the Medicine for Malaria Venture. These organisations offer the prospect of creating access to new and more effective drugs to developing countries within the next few years.  As outlined in the White Paper on Irish Aid, the issue of health will remain a top priority for our aid programme.</P>

	<P>On 9 January last, I officially opened the Department&rsquo;s Crisis Centre which is located in Hainault House, 69-70 St Stephen&rsquo;s Green. The Crisis Centre is located in the same building as the existing Consular Assistance Section of the Department. In the event of a crisis abroad affecting Irish Citizens, the Crisis Centre can be activated within minutes during normal work times and within an hour over weekends or overnight.</P>
        <P>The activation of the Crisis Centre will be made following an assessment by the Head of the Consular Division in consultations with the Secretary General and myself.

        <P>The Centre, which has 24 work stations, has a standby team already of well over 100 volunteers. I am very pleased that so many members of staff have responded quickly to our request for volunteers. The phone lines will operate on a freefone basis. The Centre is also provided with video conferencing facilities connecting the Department with crisis centres and similar facilities in other EU countries, and also elsewhere depending on the location of the crisis in question.</P>
        <P>The staff at the Centre will ensure that the Department&rsquo;s website is updated regularly and will in particular, carry all the latest developments in, and reports on a crisis. This will be an important tool for keeping families fully up to date about developments.</P>

        <P>A number of Trade Ministers who were present at the Forum met informally on 27 January for an exchange of views on the situation in the now suspended current round of WTO negotiations, the Doha Development Agenda. As this was an informal meeting, there was never any question that decisions relating to the negotiations would or could be taken. The informal meeting included representatives of the major parties to the negotiations, including EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and US Trade Representative Susan Schwab, as well as representatives of the developing countries.</P><Col N="542"/>
        <P>Reports from the meeting indicate that the participants had a very useful exchange of views on the prospects for relaunching the WTO negotiations. They signalled their hopes that the negotiations could be formally relaunched at the earliest possible date and that full-scale activity in the different official-level negotiating groups in Geneva should be resumed without any delay with the aim of making progress towards the successful completion of the Round. The participants also stressed the importance of the development dimension in the negotiations and reiterated the firm commitments made in Doha when the negotiations were launched and more recently at the WTO ministerial meeting held in Hong Kong in December 2005 in this regard.</P>
        <P>There exists now an opportunity to relaunch the negotiations in the coming weeks and all parties to them have an obligation to seize this opportunity and to participate constructively in efforts to bring them to a successful conclusion.  Together with our partners in the EU, Ireland remains fully committed to bringing the current round of WTO negotiations to a successful conclusion. This is a development round and its successful conclusion offers the best outcome for the developing countries. Ireland has always stressed the need to take account of the needs of the developing countries in the current round. All parties to the WTO negotiations have an obligation to look to the needs and interests of the poorest of the developing countries. The richer among the developing countries, as well as the industrialised countries, must ensure that these special needs are taken into account. The EU, for its part, is ready to work for a fair and balanced outcome in this regard.</P>

	<P>The Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) are trade agreements currently being negotiated between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states.</P>
        <P>The mandate for the negotiation of EPAs comes from the legally-binding Cotonou Agreement, the central objective of which is that of &ldquo;reducing and eventually eradicating poverty, consistent with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Article 46 of the Cotonou Agreement recognises the need to ensure an adequate and effective level of protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights. In this context, it underlines the importance of adherence to the existing Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), to the WTO Agreement and the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD). The question of additional requirements for ACP states in relation to intellectual property rules does not therefore arise, nor would the Government be in favour of any such development.</P>
        <P>Ireland is following the EPA negotiations closely and will continue to urge that the negotiations result in agreements that are supportive of ACP countries&rsquo; development needs and their poverty reduction efforts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Council on 22 January was particularly noteworthy for three reasons. It was (a) the first held since Irish became an official and working language of the Union, (b) the first in which an intervention was made in Irish and (c) the first since the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Union.</P>
        <P>The Council considered the Commission&rsquo;s Annual Progress Report on the Lisbon Strategy. Ministers also discussed the EU&rsquo;s relations with Ukraine and adopted negotiating directives for an enhanced agreement between the EU and Ukraine. Following an exchange of views on a Commission Communication on strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy, Ministers discussed the situation in Sudan/Darfur, Somalia and Iran and adopted conclusions. Ministers also discussed the external relations aspects of the Commission&rsquo;s proposed package on Energy and Climate Change.</P>
        <P>Over lunch, Ministers discussed the outcome of the elections in Serbia and the Middle East Peace Process, as well as the situation regarding Bulgarian nurses who have been sentenced to death in Libya and the Death Penalty Moratorium. Under Any Other Business, Commissioner Peter Mandelson briefed Ministers on the negotiations with the Gulf Cooperation Council to establish an EU-GCC free trade area.</P>
        <P>While enlargement was not discussed at the Council meeting in January, it had been discussed at the December Council.  At the December meeting, Ministers welcomed the progress made by Bulgaria and Romania in their preparations for accession. The Council noted that cooperation would continue with Bulgaria and Romania as full Member States to verify progress in the areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime.</P>
        <P>The Council also discussed the reports prepared by the European Commission on progress made by Croatia and Turkey in meeting the requirements for membership of the European Union. While welcoming the advances made to date by both countries, the Council noted that both Turkey and Croatia would both have to accelerate the pace of reforms in various areas.</P>
        <P>In the case of Turkey, the Council said it was essential that Turkey undertakes determined efforts to intensify the reform process in the areas of freedom of expression, freedom of religion, women&rsquo;s rights, minority rights, trade union rights and civilian control of the military.  In the case of Croatia, the Council identified the areas of judicial and administrative reform, the fight against corruption, property restitution and economic reform as requiring particular attention.</P>
        <P>The Council of Ministers also noted the continuing failure of Turkey to implement the Ankara Protocol fully by opening its ports and airports to vessels registered in the Republic of Cyprus. As a consequence, the Council agreed to <Col N="545"/>accept a recommendation from the European Commission to suspend negotiations on 8 of the 35 negotiating chapters relevant to Turkey&rsquo;s accession. Furthermore, the Council decided not to provisionally close any chapter until the Commission verifies that Turkey has implemented the Ankara Protocol. The European Council meeting of 14-15 December 2006 subsequently endorsed these conclusions.</P>
        <P>The European Council also noted the candidate status of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and held an in-depth debate on future enlargement of the EU. The Council recalled the contribution of previous enlargements to peace, stability and prosperity across Europe, and the Union&rsquo;s commitment to partners already in the enlargement process was reaffirmed. The Council also agreed that the Union&rsquo;s future enlargement strategy would be based on the principles of consolidation, conditionality and communication. The pace of enlargement would also have to take into account the capacity of the Union to absorb new members. Furthermore, the Heads of State and Government stressed the importance of ensuring that the EU maintains and deepens its own development. It finally noted that, as the Union enlarges, successful European integration requires the EU institutions to function effectively and EU policies to be developed and financed in a sustainable manner.</P>

	<P>President Mubarak visited Ireland on 6-7 December 2006, the first visit ever by a Head of State of the Arab Republic of Egypt. He was accompanied by an important Ministerial delegation, including Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit and Trade and Industry Minister Rasheid. The programme for the President&rsquo;s visit included meetings with President McAleese and with the Taoiseach, and a Ministerial meeting, which I chaired, on the development of trade and economic relations between Ireland and Egypt.</P>
        <P>I also met with President Mubarak on the morning of 7 December. We discussed the Middle East Peace Process and other regional developments, and I raised the continuing crisis in Darfur. We also agreed to intensify efforts to develop bilateral economic relations, and I followed up on this further during my meetings in Cairo last week.</P>
        <P>We agreed on the urgent need to revive a credible process for a comprehensive settlement of the interlinked problems of the Middle East. At its heart must be a negotiated two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the absence of which is a major factor in the increasing tensions and violence across the region. I assured the President of the Government&rsquo;s active engagement directly with the parties, and in cooperation with our EU partners, in the promotion of urgent movement towards a just and lasting peace. We also discussed the situation in Lebanon and agreed on the need for firm international support for the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701, and for the sovereignty and independence of the country. We reviewed the grave political and security situation in Iraq and developments in relation to Iran.</P>
        <P>I emphasised to the President the very serious concern of the Government and people of Ireland at the continuing humanitarian crisis in Darfur. I urged him to maintain Egypt&rsquo;s efforts to bring the parties together and encouraged him to continue to support the active engagement of the African Union and the Arab League in promoting a political settlement and an end to the terrible suffering in Darfur.</P>

	<P>The humanitarian situation in the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) remains fragile, particularly in the context of poor food security and environmental degradation.</P>
        <P>Despite some improvement in harvests in recent years, the DPRK continues to suffer widespread food shortages. Severe economic problems, particularly in the agriculture sector, and an acute energy crisis mean that cereal production remains well below the minimum required. Overall, the country remains food deficient, with an annual gap of 800,000&ndash;1,000,000 tonnes, or 15&ndash;20% of the total estimated requirement. The United Nation&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Fund, UNICEF, also reports that rates of chronic malnutrition among children in the DPRK remain high and food shortages threaten to undermine progress in the battle against malnutrition.</P>
        <P>The country is also prone to natural disasters, such as flooding and drought, which are aggravated by environmental degradation. Flooding in July of last year caused extensive damage to infrastructure, which had a knock-on effect on agricultural production levels. While the DPRK Government continues to accept development assistance, it has instructed all humanitarian agencies to cease their aid activities in the field. <Col N="548"/>Nonetheless, modified programmes of assistance continue, but with minimum expatriate involvement.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s aid to DPRK has been focused on supporting food security and providing assistance to those affected by flooding. Since 2003, Irish Aid has provided &euro;2 million in humanitarian assistance to the DPRK through key partner agencies such as the UN World Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF, the Red Cross family and Non-Governmental Organisations, such as Concern. Irish Aid will continue to respond to the humanitarian needs of the people of DPRK, by supporting those partner agencies which are providing targeted assistance there.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In my interview with <i>The Irish Times</i> on 29 December last, I observed that Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy is entering a new phase. This reflects the progress of Ireland&rsquo;s development, from the initial stages as a newly independent nation where our foreign policy focused on securing international recognition, through the more recent years where we have focused on securing peace and prosperity on the island.</P>
        <P>We have achieved a number of key goals in the process. We have a strong and vibrant economy that is providing jobs not just for our people but for immigrants. We have a successful Northern Ireland peace process that has tackled a range of profound issues including questions of identity and rights, the development of North South bodies and reform of the justice and security sectors. We have integrated into the European Union while preserving our traditional values, not least our non-membership of military alliances and our commitment to the primacy of the United Nations. We have committed to reaching the 0.7% target of GNP dedicated to overseas aid. This builds on the Government&rsquo;s record of trebling ODA since it came to office and commits us to double it between now and 2012.</P>
        <P>In this context, I believe that Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy should now develop further to reflect and give expression to these developments.  We are at a juncture where we have an enhanced opportunity to focus on what we have to offer other <Col N="549"/>members of the international community. I strongly believe that we have a duty to share the lessons of our experience with others who may benefit from them. It is, I believe, time for Ireland to develop further our approach to international affairs, building on our long and proud contribution in areas such as peacekeeping and development. In an era when differences between the developed and developing worlds continue to challenge us, we have the opportunity, and obligation, to seek to build on our reputation as a bridge between nations.</P>
        <P>I have taken a number of initiatives in this context. I have, for example, established a Conflict Resolution Unit in my Department. Initial meetings have taken place with various domestic and international partners. My intention is to focus Irish support for conflict resolution in a few key areas where our expertise can best support international efforts to bring about lasting peace and stability in regions affected by conflict. I am deeply conscious of the human suffering caused by conflict. Though conscious that we must be realistic in our ambitions, I also believe that if our unique experience with conflict resolution on this island can help alleviate the pain suffered elsewhere, then we have a responsibility to act.</P>
        <P>I would also like to see Ireland develop its traditional profile as a supporter of the United Nations generally and of key items on its agenda, notably on disarmament and human rights. As the Deputy is aware, I have taken a particularly close personal interest in international efforts to address the issue of cluster munitions. Ireland will be participating actively in a series of forthcoming meetings to promote an adequate response from the international community to the serious humanitarian concerns that are associated with such weapons. There are three such meetings in the next six months &mdash; the first organised by Norway in Oslo later this month; the second in Montreux, Switzerland, in April, organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross; and the third, within the Convention on Conventional Weapons process, in Geneva next June, In accepting the invitation to the Oslo meeting, I made clear that Ireland is actively calling for a ban on cluster munitions. In the absence of such a ban, however, we support the call for an immediate freeze on their use.</P>
        <P>There is scope for Ireland to take on a more active role in other areas too, not least in the development sphere in light of our commitment to reach the 0.7% target. Having seen at first hand the contribution that Irish people can make on the ground from peace keeping operations to emergency humanitarian relief in areas such as Darfur and the Tsunami affected areas, we have established a Rapid Response Initiative. As part of this initiative, I and my colleague the Minister for State at Irish Aid, Conor Lenihan, launched the Rapid Response Corps earlier this week. It will comprise highly skilled and experienced pro<Col N="550"/>fessionals willing to volunteer to assist in the humanitarian response effort of three of Ireland&rsquo;s UN partner agencies.</P>
        <P>In essence, we are a small nation but we have significant skills and experience to offer the international community. I am determined that we should step further up to the mark and enhance our foreign policy profile so that it fully reflects the remarkable progress we have made as a nation in recent years.</P>

        <Quest> if in relation to the 13th report of the Independent Monitoring Commission, he is concerned at ongoing paramilitary and criminal behaviour by loyalist organisations; if he has raised this issue with the British Secretary of State and with the authorities in Northern Ireland; his views on whether efforts to assist and develop loyalist areas that his Department are involved in are compromised by the activities of these groups. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Independent Monitoring Commission confirmed in its 13th Report that efforts by some in the leadership of the UVF and UDA to move those organisations away from violence and criminality are continuing, but that progress on this front remains mixed and limited. While it is to be welcomed that the level of loyalist shootings has &ldquo;continued to decline sharply&rdquo; in the period of the report, and that the incidence of loyalist assaults is lower, I am concerned that the leaderships of both the UDA and UVF have reportedly decided against early decommissioning.</P>
        <P>The ongoing paramilitary activities and sectarian violence on the part of loyalist groups are a consistent feature of our discussions with the British side at all levels. I discussed the situation with Secretary of State Hain at the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference meeting in December, and at more recent meetings. Following the publication of the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s report on the McCord case, I took the opportunity once again to call publicly for loyalist decommissioning and an end to criminality.</P>
        <P>The Government remains committed to supporting leaders in loyalism who are attempting to transform their communities in a positive way, and are working to achieve an end to paramilitary violence and criminality. It is clear that in any effort to develop loyalist communities, the complete cessation of paramilitary activity and the decommissioning of all weapons is a crucial issue.</P>
        <P>We have seen tremendous progress in normalising the security environment in Northern <Col N="551"/>Ireland in recent years, as well as full decommissioning by the IRA and a complete shift to a political path. In this context, the need for greater progress by loyalist groups in ending paramilitarism and engaging with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning is all the more urgent. I call upon all those in positions of influence in these communities to work in support of this objective.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I presume the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the two trials currently under way of Ethiopian opposition politicians, journalists and civil society activists who were detained in early November 2005, after post election tensions resulted in violent demonstrations in June and November 2005 in which 193 civilians and six members of the security forces were killed and 834 people were injured.</P>
        <P>On 23 February 2006, the trial began of 129 people, including leaders of the opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD) party, journalists and civil society activists. Several of the CUD members on trial were elected to public office in May 2005. The Ethiopian authorities claim that the group was responsible for launching and organising the June and November 2005 riots, as part of an agenda to overthrow the Government by force. They were charged as a group with outrage against the Ethiopian constitution and the constitutional order; obstructing the Government and the National Electoral Board in the exercise of their powers; inciting, organising and leading armed rebellion against the Government; impairment of the defensive power of the State; high treason; and genocide. Although the Ethiopian penal code provides that the death sentence may be imposed in cases of treason and genocide, a moratorium on executions has been in operation since 1998 and is expected to continue. On 22 March 2006, all charges were withdrawn against 18 of the detainees, including 9 being tried in absentia, and the prosecutor was instructed by the court to amend the genocide charge to &ldquo;attempted genocide.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>All 76 detainees currently before the court have been denied bail. The three civil society representatives have appointed lawyers and are <Col N="552"/>defending themselves actively. The remainder have refused to appoint lawyers or to defend themselves, stating that they do not recognise the court and that they have been convicted in advance. &ldquo;Not guilty&rdquo; pleas have been entered on their behalf. However, some of these detainees have intervened occasionally during the trial. The prosecution concluded the presentation of its evidence [both videos and witnesses] on 29 November 2006 and the case was adjourned until 19 February 2007. This lengthy adjournment was necessary to allow the judges time to assess the admissibility of many hundreds of extra pages of evidence, which the prosecution had.  All 76 detainees currently before the court have been denied bail. The three civil society representatives have appointed lawyers and are defending themselves actively. The remainder have refused to appoint lawyers or to defend themselves, stating that they do not recognise the court and that they have been convicted in advance. &ldquo;Not guilty&rdquo; pleas have been entered on their behalf. However, some of these detainees have intervened occasionally during the trial. The prosecution concluded the presentation of its evidence [both videos and witnesses] on 29 November 2006 and the case was adjourned until 19 February 2007. This lengthy adjournment was necessary to allow the judges time to assess the admissibility of many hundreds of extra pages of evidence, which the prosecution had submitted during the summer. It is currently unclear whether the judges will return with a verdict on 19 February or to hear further arguments &mdash; Ethiopian law allows for both possibilities.</P>
        <P>In the second case, 33 people &mdash; including two members of the CUD&rsquo;s Central Committee &mdash; are charged with outrages against the constitutional order, inciting political violence and/or attempted genocide. While bail has been refused, these detainees are legally represented. I understand that hearings in this case resumed on 29 December 2006.</P>
        <P>The Ethiopian authorities agreed to an EU request for international observation of the first trial and a distinguished international lawyer, Mr Roger Briottet, is observing it on behalf of the EU. He will endeavour to monitor the second case also. Ireland will fund this observer for three months during 2007. EU Embassies in Addis Ababa, including the Embassy of Ireland, are following developments.</P>
        <P>I visited Addis Abba in July 2006 and met with the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, opposition parliamentarians and some detained members of the CUD leadership. In these meetings, I emphasised the importance of the trials being conducted in a just, transparent and speedy manner in accordance with international standards and urged that all sides make every effort to ensure that the eventual outcome does not exacerbate the situation in Ethiopia. I was encouraged by the general acceptance by both <Col N="553"/>Government and opposition of the importance of political dialogue and of working to strengthen democracy and promote reconciliation within Ethiopia. I would add that I very much hope that current efforts to reflect Ethiopia&rsquo;s tradition of clemency in these cases will be successful.</P>

	<P>Ireland was represented at the African Union (AU) Summit held in Addis Ababa on 29- 30 January 2007 by the Director for Sub-Saharan Africa in the Department of Foreign Affairs. </P>
        <P>The Summit was attended by Heads of State or Government and Foreign Ministers from all AU Member States, except Eritrea. The new UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the Palestinian Authority President Abbas, and the Secretary General of the League of Arab States, Amr Moussa, were also among those in attendance.</P>
        <P>Ghana&rsquo;s President Kufor was elected as Chairman of the AU for 2007, following the withdrawal of the candidacy of President Bashir of Sudan. Ghana&rsquo;s Chairmanship is particularly appropriate, since that country is celebrating its 50th anniversary of independence in 2007 and will host the next AU Summit in July 2007.</P>
        <P>Declarations were adopted on the Summit&rsquo;s two themes of &ldquo;Climate change and development in Africa&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Science, technology and scientific research for development.&rdquo; To mark the 50th anniversary of the Confederation of African Football and encourage Africa&ndash;wide involvement in South Africa&rsquo;s hosting of the 2010 World Cup, the Summit launched 2007 as the International Year of African Football. The Summit adopted the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance and urged Member States to sign and ratify it as soon as possible. The AU&rsquo;s budget of US$132.988 million for 2007 was approved. A Declaration was adopted on the negotiation of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), while the Summit also called for the prompt resumption and speedy and successful conclusion of the Doha Round of WTO negotiations.</P>
        <P>In his address to the Summit, UNSG Ban Ki-moon reiterated that Darfur will remain his top priority and stressed the importance of AU/UN partnership in addressing the crisis there. Chairperson Konare, head of the AU&rsquo;s executive Commission, highlighted the need to implement the May 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement and called on the Sudanese parties to immediately halt all violence. He also expressed concern about the <Col N="554"/>regional implications of the Darfur crisis in his address to the Summit, UNSG Ban Ki-moon reiterated that Darfur will remain his top priority and stressed the importance of AU/UN partnership in addressing the crisis there. Chairperson Konare, head of the AU&rsquo;s executive Commission, highlighted the need to implement the May 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement and called on the Sudanese parties to immediately halt all violence. He also expressed concern about the regional implications of the Darfur crisis on Chad and the Central African Republic. The Summit endorsed the efforts being undertaken by the AU and the UN to revitalise the Darfur peace process; welcomed Sudan&rsquo;s approval of these efforts; called on all parties to cooperate; and urged the UN to assume responsibility for the funding of the peace support operation in Darfur as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Summit stressed that recent events, particularly the return of the Transitional Federal Government to Mogadishu, provide a unique opportunity to re-establish government structures in Somalia and promote lasting peace and reconciliation. It called for the immediate deployment of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM); encouraged Member States to contribute troops in order to prevent a security vacuum following the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops from Somalia; and urged the international community to assist with the rapid deployment of AMISOM. The Summit also supported current efforts by ECOWAS to restore peace and security in C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire and resolve internal problems in Guinea.</P>
        <P>Finally, AU Foreign Ministers welcomed the planned organisation of a second Africa-Europe Summit in Lisbon before the end of 2007, and endorsed the results of the Africa-EU Ministerial Conference on Migration and Development, held in Tripoli in November 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As indicated to the House, most recently on 11 October 2006, the case for ratification of this Convention has been examined by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has lead responsibility on the issue. </P>
        <P>As previously indicated, the rights of migrant workers and their families are already protected under existing national legislation and under the Irish Constitution, as well as under EU law. In addition, the rights of migrant workers and their families are also addressed by Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under international human rights instruments to which the State is already a party. These <Col N="555"/>international instruments include, for example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</P>
        <P>The Convention referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1990, and it entered into force on 1 July 2003, following ratification by the requisite number of States (20). The Convention has been open for signature and ratification since December 1990. However, to date only 35 States have ratified it. No European Union Member State has as yet signed or ratified the Convention, nor has any indicated an intention to do so.</P>
        <P>The position essentially is that, in order for Ireland to ratify the Convention, significant changes would have to be made across a wide range of existing legislation, including legislation addressing employment, social welfare provision, education, taxation and electoral law. These changes would also have implications for our EU commitments. The operation of the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK might also possibly be affected.</P>
        <P>There are no plans at present to sign or ratify the Convention. However, as with all outstanding ratifications of international human rights instruments, the position regarding the International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families will be kept under review.</P>

	<P>The person in question applied for permission to remain in the State under the revised arrangements for non EU national parents of Irish children born prior to 1 January 2005, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 scheme. It is a requirement of this scheme that each applicant must be resident in the State on a continuous basis since the birth of the Irish born child and that evidence of such residence be provided with the application.  The person concerned did not provide satisfactory evidence of being continuously resident in the State and consequently his application was refused on that basis.  He was advised of this decision by letter dated 30 November 2005. </P>
        <P>The IBC/05 scheme ceased accepting applications for permission to remain on 31 March 2005. Any representations made by or on behalf of the person in question, in relation to permission to remain in the State, will be considered in the context of any proposals arising under Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the frequency and length of visits can vary according to the type of institution. The 1947 Prison Rules provide the legislation for visiting arrangements. Under these rules a sentenced prisoner is entitled to one visit per week of 30 minutes duration and a remand prisoner is entitled to a visit on any weekday of 15 minutes duration. However, additional or longer visits may be granted where circumstances permit, at the Governor&rsquo;s discretion. </P>
        <P>In the specific case referred to by the Deputy, the prisoner was facilitated with additional visits <Col N="557"/>on numerous occasions. In fact he has received 32 visits in the 9 weeks since his committal from family members. It is the prisoner who nominates the visitors he wishes to receive while in custody. The prisoner&rsquo;s wife, for example, was afforded additional visits on 7 occasions in this period and has visited him on 14 occasions.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006.  This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at 31 December 2006 was 14,068.  Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000.  The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met.  The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities also inform me that Killucan Garda Station forms part of the Longford/Westmeath Division.  The personnel <Col N="564"/>strength of the Longford/Westmeath Division on 31 December, 1997 and on 31 December, 2006 was 232 and 278 (all ranks) respectively.  This represents an increase of 46 (or 19.82%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.  I have been further informed that the personnel strength of Killucan Garda Station on 31 December 2005, 31 December 2006 and 6 February, 2007 was 2 (all ranks).  Local Garda Management report that the Killucan sub-district benefits from additional on-going patrols by members attached to the Divisional Traffic Corps and the District Detective Unit.  I am also advised by Local Garda Management that special patrols under Operation Anvil are carried out on in the Killucan, Raharney and Rathwire areas.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In relation to the second part of his Question, it should be noted that the effect of a deportation order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State. That being the case, a person the subject of a <Col N="567"/>deportation order wishing to return to the State legally, must apply for revocation of his/her deportation order.</P>
        <P>Statistics are not maintained in such a way as to enable my Department to produce a reliable figure for enforced deportation orders subsequently revoked. To attempt to obtain this figure would involve a disproportionate use of my Department&rsquo;s resources. Indeed the persons concerned may, or may not, have returned to the State since the revocation of their deportation orders. Further it is the case that some persons the subject of enforced deportation orders have been known to re-enter the State illegally. This cohort of persons is subject to arrest and detention pursuant to Section 5 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, should they come to the notice of the Garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>It is the case that deportation orders have been made in respect of persons from EU accession States:- Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovak Republic and Slovenia, who acceded on 1 May 2004 and Bulgaria and Romania who acceded on 1 January 2007. Said persons may exercise EU Treaty Rights and it is open to them to apply to have their deportation orders revoked.</P>

	<P>The Reception &amp; Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department has a contract in place for the accommodation of asylum seekers in the premises referred to by the Deputy, until 9 May 2007.  After that time the premises will no longer be available for this purpose and my Department has no further knowledge on the future plans for this building.</P>
        <P>All State service providers (e.g., HSE, Department of Social and Family Affairs) have been advised of the closure of this centre so that they can prepare for the necessary adjustments to the provision of their services.  In addition, the local support group, who have provided on-going support and assistance to the many residents who have resided at the centre since it first opened in December 2000, has also been advised of the closure.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the residents of this accommodation centre are involved in a <Col N="568"/>process to determine the outcome of their claim for asylum in the State.  In the event of a positive determination of refugee status, the residents will be free to reside in Kilkenny or anywhere else in the State.  In the meantime, residents will be offered alternative RIA accommodation nearer to the date of closure.  As the availability of accommodation  at any one time is governed by a range of factors, including the numbers and class (i.e., single / families / couples) of persons requiring accommodation, the RIA is not in a position to offer specific accommodation to the residents of this centre at this time.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, following a seizure of heroin in Belgium and the related arrest of three Irish nationals last year, the Revenue Commissioners initiated a review of Customs Controls at Licensed Aerodromes.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their review has now been completed. The review examined the controls, the conditions of approval and the risks, from a Customs point of view, attached to the operation of the aerodromes.</P>
        <P>It is important to note by way of context that the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the European Union. Of specific relevance are the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU and the elimination of Customs controls on the baggage of intra-community passengers other than anti-smuggling checks. In this context, Revenue&rsquo;s approach has of necessity been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling and enforce prohibitions and restrictions.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that the key conclusions of the review team are as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The risk based approach being adopted is a sound one, indeed the only appropriate one in the circumstances;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Intelligence and related risk-rating rely on timely information and need to be reviewed regularly;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Ireland&rsquo;s approach is in line with the methodology adopted by other EU administrations in similar circumstances;</P><Col N="569"/>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The increase in the volume of international air traffic requires a corresponding increase in Revenue activity.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Revenue Commissioners have also informed me that drawing on the conclusions, they have agreed on recommendations. They have drawn up a wide ranging Implementation Plan covering diverse areas including visits to aerodromes, risk rating, the issue of approvals, guidance for staff, training and deepening of co-operation with other agencies. The Revenue regions are giving the control of smaller aerodromes specific attention in their business plans for 2007.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners assure me that having regard to the context set out above, they are satisfied that their risk based approach remains valid and that, with the implementation of the review recommendations, their operations will be on a par with, and may even exceed, those of many other EU Member States.  I am also assured that the Revenue Commissioners continue their strong commitment to playing their part in combating smuggling criminal activity without unduly impeding international travellers or international trade.</P>
        <P>It will be appreciated that the Revenue Commissioners do not intended publishing the Report of the Review Group, as to do so would, for operational reasons, be counterproductive.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, thirty State Agencies are due to relocate under the Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation Programme. Some 2,340 posts are involved, or just over 22% of the programme.</P>
        <P>The Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) did not set specific timeframes for the State Agencies as they believed that it was the responsibility of the board and senior management of each agency to implement the Government decision and to report to its &ldquo;parent&rdquo; department in the first instance on the progress being made.  The DIG noted in its latest Report that while progress has been made by some State agencies, there has been a marked lack of action in some other agencies. The Group is currently meeting with CEOs from a number of State agencies to get an overview of progress to date and to identify the challenges remaining in implementing the Government policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The main issues facing the State agencies are those relating to the filling of posts in undersubscribed locations, the placing of staff choosing to remain in Dublin and promotion arrangements.  These issues are further complicated by the absence of any tradition of or agreement on inter-changeability between Public Service organisations and between the Public Service and the Civil Service. The Decentralisation Implementation Group is of the view that resolution of the outstanding issues is central to the overall implementation process in the State Agencies.  The Group has asked my Department to pursue directly with ICTU proposals for getting central discussions under way on the full range of industrial relations issues relating to the decentralisation of State agencies.</P>
        <P>An approach based on negotiations and agreement has enabled significant progress to be made in relation to the Civil Service moves and it is the intention to continue with this policy in relation to the State Agency sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a large number of areas throughout the country where flood relief works are being considered by the Office of Public Works. These works are generally carried out by OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts but may be carried out by Local Authorities under their own powers with OPW funding.</P>
        <P>In general, a Feasibility Study will be carried out before a decision is made to undertake a flood relief scheme under the Arterial Drainage Acts. If the Feasibility Study indicates that a scheme can be implemented, that it is cost beneficial to undertake such a scheme, if an Environmental assessment confirms that there are no environmental impediments to undertaking the scheme, and subject to the outline of the scheme having the agreement of the local authority, then a formal Public Exhibition of the <Col N="573"/>proposals must take place in order to progress the scheme. Following the successful completion of the Exhibition process, OPW may decide to undertake the detailed design of the scheme which must then be Confirmed by the Minister for Finance in order for construction to commence.</P>
        <P>The following list indicates the areas, which are at various stages of development. As some of <Col N="574"/>these schemes have not reached detailed design stage it is not possible to give exact costings, but it is estimated that to construct flood relief schemes in all these areas would cost in excess of &euro;400 million. Construction is scheduled to commence in some of these areas in 2007 and OPW has a budget of &euro;32 million for flood relief activities in 2007 as part of the National Development Plan.</P><Col N="573"/>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children. </P>
        <P>The NCIP came into effect from 1 January 2006, with an allocation of &euro;575 million for the 5 year period of 2006-2010. The NCIP is a key element of the National Childcare Strategy 2006-2010, the aim of which is to deliver a more comprehensive approach to early years care and education. The NCIP is designed to deliver 50,000 additional childcare places, with a greater focus on pre-school places for 3-4 year olds and school age childcare. Childcare places are provided either through community based/not for profit childcare groups or by private providers.</P>
        <P>Under the EOCP support is provided towards the staffing costs of employing childcare workers in community based childcare facilities in disadvantaged areas, ensuring that less advantaged parents in those areas have access to quality <Col N="576"/>childcare in order to facilitate access to education, training and employment opportunities. Staffing grants under the EOCP have been extended to 31 December 2007 for all groups who are meeting the terms of their existing staffing grant contracts. A new programme of staffing grants under the NCIP is expected to be announced in 2007 and will be informed by the outcome of a Value for Money Review of the EOCP which is currently in progress. The Review is expected to be completed in the first half of 2007 following which the procedures and criteria governing the new grant scheme will be made available both generally and to existing staffing grant recipients.</P>

	<P>The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 in keeping with Section 53 of <Col N="577"/>the Health Act, 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges may be levied.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Class 1</i></P>
        <P>Class 1 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;120 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;35, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Class 2</i></P>
        <P>Class 2 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;90, or the weekly income of that person less &euro;55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person. The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo;. Under Section 1 (b) of the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005, the HSE can examine a person&rsquo;s overall financial situation in view of the person&rsquo;s reasonable expenditure in relation to themselves or their dependants, if any.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the HSE, based on its own legal advice and taking into account the individual circumstances as well as the service being provided, to make a decision on any charges levied.</P>
        <P>In this regard, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The start date for the new nursing home support scheme &mdash; A Fair Deal &mdash; is 1 January, 2008. This is because primary legislation must be passed in order for the scheme to commence. The Department is currently working on preparing the Heads of the Bill. </P>
        <P>In the interim, the Minister announced an initiative to make the existing subvention scheme fairer. The standard subvention has been increased to a maximum of &euro;300 a week.  In addition, the HSE may pay an enhanced subvention to people who cannot afford to meet the cost of care. An extra &euro;30 million has been provided in 2007 for this purpose.</P>
        <P>In relation to the individual concerned, operational responsibility for the management and <Col N="578"/>delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised by the Deputy.

        <Quest> the long ongoing claims being pursued by the Irish Nurses Organisation and the Psychiatric Nurses Association, particularly with regard to hours of work and the anomaly between child-care workers and registered nurses and midwives; her views on whether these justifiable claims need to be addressed; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[4497/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Nurses Organisation (INO) and the Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA) are pursuing a number of cost increasing claims in respect of pay and conditions of nurses and midwives. These include claims seeking a reduction in working hours from 39 to 35 hours per week and a pay increase relative to the pay of the social care worker grade (formerly known as child care workers). It is estimated that annual cost of these two claims alone would be &euro;477m. In the case of the pay relativity claim with social care workers the INO and PNA are also seeking retrospection back to 2002.</P>
        <P>The claims were heard by the Labour Court on 20 June 2006 and a recommendation (LCR 18763) issued on 9 November 2006. In its recommendation the Labour Court noted that the social partnership agreements have brought significant benefits to workers, employers and to the economy overall and they provide a fair mechanism within an agreed framework by which workers can obtain improvements in pay and conditions of employment. The Court did not recommend concession of the major cost increasing pay claims. Instead the Court urged the Unions concerned to reconsider their position with regard to Benchmarking so as to have their pay claims examined through that process.</P>
        <P>In relation to the claim for a reduction in working hours the Court stated that concession of this claim at this time would have profound consequences for both health care delivery and costs unless effective countervailing measures could be put in place. The Court did recommend that the parties should jointly explore the possibility of initiating an appropriate process aimed at achieving major reorganisation of working arrangements and practices within the health service gen<Col N="580"/>erally. The Court also stated that such an initiative should take account of and support existing development involving other groups. It held the view that if such a programme of change could be successfully implemented, the efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits accruing may allow this claim to be processed within a reasonable timeframe to be agreed between the parties.</P>
        <P>I would emphasise that the Labour Court Recommendation has been accepted by the Health Service Employers but regrettably the Unions have stated that they neither accept or reject the Labour Court Recommendation.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Health and Children I would like to place on record that I hold the nursing and midwifery professions in high esteem  and view the care they provide to patients as a critical component of our health services. I believe that a solution to the current dispute can be found within the context of the Labour Court Recommendation and the prevailing national agreements. In this regard I  arranged for exploratory discussions to be held between all the parties concerned at the offices of the HSE-Employers Agency on 19 January 2007.  While I understand the discussions provided clarity as to the respective positions of the parties the meeting adjourned without agreement on the way forward.</P>
        <P>On 2 February 2007, in accordance with &ldquo;A Framework for Dispute Resolution in the Health Services&rdquo;, the INO and PNA served twenty one days notice of industrial action to the Health Service Executive and related agencies. I am disappointed that the Unions concerned have resorted to the industrial action contained in that notice. I do not believe such action is in the best interest of nurses and midwives or indeed of patients and those dependent on nursing services throughout our Health Service.  I would urge the Unions to give further consideration to the course of action and the proposals contained in the Labour Court Recommendation. I believe that this is the most appropriate means by which the nurses claims can be addressed.</P>
        <P>I remain hopeful that a resolution to this dispute can still be found and I believe it remains open to the INO and PNA to enter the Benchmarking process and have their pay claims processed through this forum. Two other unions, SIPTU and IMPACT, which also represent nurses are currently participating in the Benchmarking process and have made a submission for improvements in pay and conditions on behalf of their members. In addition the INO and PNA could also decide to accept the national agreement, Towards 2016. If they accept this agreement their members would be eligible for pay increases of 10% as provided for in that agreement.</P>

	<P>Home Care Packages (HCP) including Home Care Cash Grants and are designed to facilitate timely discharge of older people from acute hospitals; reduce inappropriate admission; reduce pressure on A&amp;E departments and support older people to continue to live in their own community.  In the first instance use of mainstream community services are maximized to support and maintain the older person at home. If further services are assessed as being required these services may be provided through the Home Care Package Scheme. The decision to allocate a Home Care Package is based on the assessment of needs of the individual and the identification of any assessed needs which are not being met by mainstream services together with consideration of the appropriateness of care in the community in the individual <Col N="582"/>case. Home Care Packages are therefore an additional support over and above existing mainstream community services and are designed to enhance rather than replace existing home support services. The scheme is designed to be flexible and is particularly targeted at those at risk of admission to long term care from the community, inappropriate admission to acute hospital or requiring discharge to home from acute hospital. </P>
        <P>During 2006, following discussions with the Department and the Health Service Executive, draft guidelines were drawn up for the standardised implementation of Home Care Packages (including cash grants) across the HSE. These guidelines are currently the subject of detailed discussion between the HSE and the Department and it is intended that a document will be concluded shortly in line with the agreed approach being taken. Thereafter, a standardised approach will be rolled out across the health system. In the meantime Home Care Packages will continue to be provided in line with existing arrangements in individual local health office areas.</P>
        <P>An additional &euro;110 million has been allocated to the home care package scheme in the past two years. This represents the largest ever increase in the funding for this scheme. However, this increased funding does not mean that everyone is entitled to a home care package, regardless of their means. The cost of this scheme, as with all health services, has to be met from within the budget allocated, and the financial assessment of applicants ensures that the services are targeted at those most in need.</P>

	<P>Since the beginning of 2005 the medical card assessment guidelines  have been increased by a <Col N="584"/>cumulative 29%.  Other significant changes which I have introduced are that applications are now considered on the basis of income net of tax and PRSI and that allowance is made for reasonable expenses  incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work. In June 2006, I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those used in respect of medical cards.  My Department and the HSE are at present considering whether any further changes to the guidelines are required, having regard to factors such as changes in income levels generally, the nature of typical household outgoings and also changes to the various social welfare schemes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 172 and 173 together.</P>
        <P>When Ms Anne Dunne SC presented her report on post mortem practice to me in March 2005, I was advised by the Attorney General that it could not be published for legal and natural justice reasons. Some sections of the report were released on 18 July 2006 in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Acts from Parents for Justice.  However, in the light of the legal advice available to me, I have no plans to publish the full report.  The 54 boxes which comprise the report and appendices are stored in Damastown, Dublin 15 at the premises of Glenbeigh Records Management, who are contracted to provide secure offsite document storage for the Department.</P>

	<P>The start date for the new nursing home support scheme &mdash; A Fair Deal &mdash; is 1 January, 2008. This is because primary legislation must be passed in order for the scheme to commence. The Department is currently working on preparing the Heads of the Bill. </P>
        <P>Some of the benefits and key commitments to individuals as part of A Fair Deal will be:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Nursing home care will now be affordable to every person and fair to all;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />For those currently in private care, their costs will be reduced significantly;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Individuals will be asked to make a contribution towards the cost of care, limited by the cost of care;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The basis for contributions will be fair, based on each person&rsquo;s means and assets;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Contributions during a person&rsquo;s lifetime will be less than their disposable income;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Care recipients will not have to sell or mortgage their house to meet the contribution;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A spouse or dependent child will not have to sell or mortgage the house to meet the contribution;</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The deferred contribution from the principal private residence will be capped at a maximum of 15%.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I would also like to inform the Deputy that under the new scheme the State will continue to fund the largest part of care costs overall.</P>
        <P>In the interim, the Minister announced an initiative to make the existing subvention scheme fairer. The standard subvention has been increased to a maximum of &euro;300 a week.  In addition, the HSE may pay an enhanced subvention to people who cannot afford to meet the cost <Col N="586"/>of care. An extra &euro;30 million has been provided in 2007 for this purpose.</P>

	<P>In 2007, total health funding is &euro;14.6 billion, which represents an underlying increase of 8.6% in revenue spending over 2006.  The vast bulk of this funding is provided under the vote of the Health Service Executive which has statutory responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.  This continuing high level of investment by the Government provides the Executive with considerable capacity to address the healthcare needs of the population in the most effective manner.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

Parliamentary Questions are dealt with, as the need arises, by the staff in the sections dealing with the particular issue(s) raised in individual Parliamentary Questions.

	<P>The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations made thereunder regulate and control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act.  Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland, which could merit the criminalisation of their sale and use.  Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is currently not a scheduled substance under the Act.  </P><Col N="593"/>
        <P>The list of scheduled substances is kept under review on an ongoing basis.  In particular, the Department reviews any evidence that substances are being abused and are causing significant harm to public health.  For example, last year the law surrounding psychotropic (magic) mushrooms in their raw state was clarified in the light of evidence of increased availability and significant harm being done and it is now an offence to sell or possess magic mushrooms.</P>
        <P>A risk assessment is being carried out at EU level on BZP.  This engages the relevant experts across the EU to assess the possible health and social risks/consequences of the identified substance and the implications of placing it under control.  The results of the risk assessment will be presented to the Council, the European Medicines Agency and the Commission for a decision on whether BZP should be subjected to control measures.  Control measures and penalties are decided according to national laws which in turn comply with UN conventions.</P>

	<P>The vast majority of General Practitioners (GPs) providing services to General Medical Services (GMS) patients hold the GMS GP capitation contract.  These contracts for service are with the Health Service Executive (HSE).  In accordance with the contract the GP receives an annual fee from the HSE which is based on the number of patients on his/her GMS patient panel and the GP undertakes to provide all proper and necessary treatment of a kind generally undertaken by a GP to these patients.  Accordingly, under this contract a GP should not demand or accept any payment or consideration for services provided by him/her, including blood tests, where they are indicated as part of a recognised treatment of an ongoing medical condition of a patient. </P>
        <P>If the Deputy is aware of a particular case where a person is experiencing any difficulty, I suggest he should bring the matter to the attention of the Health Service Executive who will investigate the matter.  I would also be happy to facilitate the Deputy in raising the case with the HSE.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement was adopted by the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 22 May 2006. When Morocco has completed its ratification procedures, the Agreement will come into force following an exchange of notifications by both sides.</P>
        <P>The Agreement states that it applies to &ldquo;the waters falling within the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Morocco&rdquo;.  As the Deputy will be aware, Morocco considers the Western Sahara and its waters to be an integral part of its territory. However, Ireland and our EU partners do not recognise Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara. The Government has consistently and strongly supported the right to self-determination of the people of the territory.</P>
        <P>The European Commission is responsible for the negotiation of such agreements with third countries. They are adopted by the Council by Qualified Majority Vote. In 2005, the Council approved the Commission&rsquo;s mandate for the negotiations with Morocco. At that time, Ireland raised concerns about possible implications for the overall issue of the status of the Western Sahara and regarding the exploitation of the resources of the Saharawi people. The Commission undertook to ensure that the Fisheries Agreement would not prejudice the issue of status, and would reflect exactly the terms in relation to territorial extent contained in previous Fisheries Agreements between the EU and Morocco.</P>
        <P>During consideration by the Council of the draft Agreement negotiated by the Commission, Ireland again focused on these issues and the Government proposed that the EU might adopt a Declaration which would accompany the Agreement. However, it emerged that there was a qualified majority of Member States in favour of approving the Agreement without an EU Declaration.</P>
        <P>At the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 22 May 2006, Ireland agreed to the adoption of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement but made a National Declaration in relation to the Western Sahara. The full text of the Statement is as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;Ireland supports the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of <Col N="595"/>Morocco on the basis that it does not prejudice the long-standing position of the EU on the status of the Western Sahara. The EU continues to support the efforts of the UN Secretary General to encourage a negotiated solution which will allow the people of the Western Sahara to exercise their right to self-determination.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Ireland emphasises the importance of the future dialogue within the EU-Morocco Joint Committee foreseen under this agreement. It is essential that the Joint Committee make use of all instruments under the Agreement to ensure that the Agreement is implemented to the benefit of all the people concerned and in accordance with the principles of international law&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Under international law, the economic resources of a non-self governing territory may only be exploited on condition that the benefits should flow to the people of the territory. This is the principle which the Government has upheld in the position it has taken on the renewal of the EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 200 together.</P>
        <P>Human rights remain central to our foreign policy. Together with our EU partners, the Government monitors the human rights situations in many countries, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official and non-governmental organisations. Where the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question, either bilaterally, through the EU, or through action at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council. At these bodies, the EU regularly makes statements on the human rights situation in various countries. Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.</P><Col N="596"/>
        <P>At the most recent session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the EU tabled resolutions on the human rights situations in Burma/Myanmar and in the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Both resolutions were adopted by the Third Committee. In addition, the EU co-sponsored resolutions on the human rights situation in Iran (tabled by Canada) and in Belarus (tabled by the USA).</P>
        <P>In relation to Africa, there is concern regarding human rights in a number of countries and, in particular, regarding the situation in Darfur. The UN Human Rights Council, which meets in Geneva, held a Special Session in December 2006 to consider the urgent human rights situation in Darfur. Ireland, along with our EU partners, was instrumental in calling for this Special Session. The Council adopted, without a vote, a resolution which expressed concern at the seriousness of the human rights and humanitarian situation in Darfur and decided to dispatch a High-Level Mission to assess the human rights situation in Darfur and the needs of Sudan in this regard.</P>
        <P>Active participation in multilateral organisations such as the EU, UN and the Council of Europe provides an opportunity for Ireland to voice its concerns regarding human rights abuses. Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for human rights violations.</P>
        <P>The EU has also adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. In addition the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights as part of political dialogue meetings.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to use these mechanisms as a means of highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.</P>

        <Quest> the extent of the discussions that have taken place at EU level with a view to ratification of the EU Constitution; if it is intended to alter, revise or resubmit for consideration by the people of Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>To date, eighteen Member States have ratified the Constitutional Treaty. Luxembourg and <Col N="597"/>Spain have done so by referendum, while sixteen Member States have ratified by parliamentary means. As the House is aware, the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums held in France and the Netherlands in 2005. </P>
        <P>Following the outcome to the referendums in France and the Netherlands, the European Council initiated a period of reflection in order to allow time for further consideration of how to proceed with the Constitutional Treaty. In June 2006, the European Council agreed to extend the reflection period for another year and to focus also on the Union&rsquo;s delivery of tangible results to EU citizens.</P>
        <P>The European Council mandated the Presidency to consult extensively with Member States and to present a report to the European Council in June 2007. That report is to contain an assessment of the state of discussions with regard to the Constitutional Treaty and to explore possible future steps. The report is intended to assist the European Council to take the necessary decisions on the Constitutional Treaty; these are expected during the second half of 2008 at the latest.</P>
        <P>In line with its mandate from the European Council, the German Presidency is currently holding a series of bilateral consultations with Member States. In these discussions, we re-iterated Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to the Treaty as agreed by Heads of State and Government in 2004, and affirmed our readiness to proceed with ratification once there is clarity on the way forward at EU level. The Presidency was advised of our view that the Constitutional Treaty is a carefully constructed package and remains the best available means for equipping the Union to meet the challenges facing us now and into the future. For this reason, we believe that any attempt to alter the essential balance and substance of the draft Treaty would be unlikely to succeed.</P>
        <P>We have also made clear our position on the Treaty in our ongoing contact with the Presidency, both at Ministerial and official level. Ireland strongly supports the efforts of the German Presidency, both with regard to the proposed Berlin Declaration as well as to their ongoing work to find a way forward for the Constitution.</P>

	<P>Africa is at the heart <Col N="598"/>of Ireland&rsquo;s programme of official development assistance. The complex series of factors, which contribute to the enormous needs encountered in Africa, include food insecurity, poverty, environmental degradation, weak governmental capacity and policies, unequal global trading relationships, protracted conflict, severe infrastructural weaknesses, poor governance, debt and the effects of HIV/AIDS.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid&rsquo;s emergency humanitarian budget is a key instrument in responding to the humanitarian needs arising from conflict, food insecurity and the effects of natural disasters. Our recovery and long-term development programmes seek to assist countries emerging from natural and man-made emergencies and also address the underlying causes of poverty in all its manifestations.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid provides development assistance to many African countries, either directly, or through our partnerships with the United Nations, the Red Cross family and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) such as Concern, Goal, Tr&oacute;caire, Oxfam and others. In the context of an increasing aid budget as we approach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012, these interventions are being further strengthened through enhanced support at the global and country levels.</P>
        <P>Addressing Africa&rsquo;s needs, especially the interests of the poorest and most vulnerable, necessitates a comprehensive and coordinated series of actions by the international community and African Governments. In order to measure development progress and to set benchmarks, the United Nations developed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were endorsed by world leaders in 2000.</P>
        <P>While the MDGs are undoubtedly ambitious, they can be reached if all stakeholders, the affected countries themselves, the donor community, the UN and EU work together to ensure that poverty reduction, good governance and sustainable development are the cornerstones of all our efforts in Africa.</P>
        <P>In addition to our humanitarian response, Ireland&rsquo;s approach to efforts to promote security and stability in Africa includes our contribution to the security and stability of Liberia through the deployment of troops with UNMIL, the UN Mission in Liberia, since 2003. Ireland has also provided assistance to the African Union (AU) Mission in Sudan (AMIS), as part of the EU&rsquo;s joint actions to foster peace and security in Darfur. In addition, we have provided support to the UN&rsquo;s Peace Building Fund and have been strongly supportive of the establishment of the Peace Building Commission. We are actively seeking ways to support regional organisations in addition to our humanitarian response.  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to efforts to promote security and stability in Africa includes our contribution to the security and stability of Liberia through the deployment of troops with UNMIL, the UN Mission in Liberia, since <Col N="599"/>2003. Ireland has also provided assistance to the African Union (AU) Mission in Sudan (AMIS), as part of the EU&rsquo;s joint actions to foster peace and security in Darfur. In addition, we have provided support to the UN&rsquo;s Peace Building Fund and have been strongly supportive of the establishment of the Peace Building Commission. We are actively seeking ways to support regional organisations in Africa, particularly the AU which represents an important strategic partner for the European Union and the international community generally.</P>
        <P>The challenges facing Africa are enormous. But there is some encouraging news. Many African economies are growing. Inflation, now averaging 8% a year, is at its lowest level in many African countries since soon after independence. While there are exceptions such as Somalia, Zimbabwe and others, many African countries now have less violence and civil strife than for many years. There is relative peace in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Angola and southern Sudan. In 2006, free and fair elections took place in the Democratic Republic of Congo and a President and Prime Minister have been appointed.</P>
        <P>Through our growing aid programme, we will continue to address needs and build on progress to make a real and lasting difference in the lives of the poorest in Africa.</P>

	<P>HIV/AIDS continues to be the single biggest obstacle to reducing poverty and to attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Current statistics from the United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) indicate that, in 2006, almost 40 million people were living with the HIV virus. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the worst-affected region in the world and is now home to over 25 million adults and children living with HIV. Infection rates are increasing in other regions also, with some countries in Eastern Europe and central Asia recording the highest rates of new infections worldwide.</P>
        <P>The HIV/AIDS pandemic is impeding development and leading to an increase in poverty. It generally affects the most productive and economically-active members of society and serves to <Col N="600"/>further disadvantage those people most vulnerable to infection &mdash; such as migrant workers, women and adolescents.</P>
        <P>Responding to the global problem of HIV/AIDS is a key priority for the Irish Government. This commitment is very clearly outlined in the White Paper on Irish Aid which was published last September. Following the commitment made by the Taoiseach in his speech to the United Nations in September 2005, funding for HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases doubled from &euro;50 to &euro;100 million in 2006. Funding has been directed at programmes at international, regional and country level to provide increased access to HIV prevention, treatment and care services. Dr Peter Piot, Executive Director of UNAIDS, last week confirmed that Ireland is one of the leaders in the global response to HIV/AIDS. He commended, in particular, Ireland&rsquo;s leadership in tackling HIV-related stigma and discrimination through the &lsquo;Stamp out Stigma Campaign&rsquo; which was launched by the Taoiseach on World Aids Day, December 1st, 2006.</P>
        <P>While HIV/AIDS remains a critical threat to human progress in many countries, there has been some progress in the international response in recent years. This is reflected in stronger political commitment to halt the epidemic, more funding becoming available for AIDS programmes, the establishment of effective national AIDS control programmes &mdash; all leading to a real decrease in HIV prevalence rates in countries such as Uganda, Zambia and Cambodia.</P>
        <P>Ireland is supportive of the introduction of anti-retroviral treatment programmes in developing countries. In these countries we have supported the strengthening of health systems, the procurement and supply of medication and the training of health workers, which are all necessary for the introduction of HIV treatment programmes. In addition to this, Ireland has provided support to the &lsquo;3 &times; 5&rsquo; Initiative of the World Health Organisation &mdash; a programme that has led to the provision of anti-retroviral treatment for over 1.5 million people in poorer countries. Ireland is also working closely with the William J. Clinton Presidential Foundation to allow those infected with HIV/AIDS access treatment in Mozambique and in Lesotho.</P>
        <P>Ireland will continue to work with the international community in advocating for a sustained and resourced global response to HIV/AIDS, strengthened leadership at all levels and improved coordination of resources for effective HIV/AIDS prevention and control.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation in the Horn of Africa is a high priority for Ireland, the EU and the United Nations. The problems of the region include the ongoing conflicts in Darfur and Somalia; a prolonged stalemate in the Ethiopia-Eritrea peace process; the need to rebuild southern Sudan following decades of civil war; and challenges relating to development, including recurrent food security problems. These issues are being addressed through a combination of political initiatives, peace-keeping operations, and emergency, humanitarian and development assistance.</P>
        <P>The UN Security Council regularly discusses Horn of Africa issues, while the new UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has described the crisis in Darfur as his top priority. Currently, the UN has two peace-keeping operations in the Horn of Africa &mdash; the UN Mission to Ethiopia and Eritrea, UNMEE, and the UN Mission in Sudan, UNMIS. UNMEE monitors the ceasefire agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea. UNMIS is supporting implementation of the 2005 North/South Sudan Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People&rsquo;s Liberation Movement/Army, and since August 2006 it is also mandated to support implementation of the May 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement . In addition, the UN has agreed to strengthen the African Union&rsquo;s ceasefire observation mission in Darfur, AMIS. A fact finding mission from the UN Human Rights Council will visit Darfur during February 2007.</P>
        <P>The UN Secretary General has several representatives dealing specifically with the Horn of Africa, including a Special Humanitarian Envoy for the Horn of Africa, a Special Representative for Somalia and a Special Envoy for Darfur.  Appointment of Special Representatives for Sudan, and Ethiopia/Eritrea is pending.  The UN and African Union Special Envoys for Darfur will travel to Sudan in mid- February 2007 to promote the revitalisation of the Darfur peace process.</P>
        <P>EU Foreign Ministers discussed Sudan and Somalia on 22 January 2007 and will do so again on 12-13 February.  The EU actively supports the restoration of peace and stability in Somalia and is one of the Witnesses of the 2000 Algiers Peace Agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea.  An EU Special Envoy for Sudan, Mr Pekka Haavisto, was appointed in July 2005.  Most of the EU&rsquo;s &euro;250 million African Peace Facility, APF, has been used to support the African Union Mission in Sudan, AMIS. &euro;15 million will be provided for the African Union&rsquo;s peace support operation in Somalia, AMISOM.</P>
        <P>The European Commission&rsquo;s October 2006 Communication on &lsquo;EU partnership for peace, <Col N="602"/>security and development in the Horn of Africa,&rsquo; sets out a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention in the region.  In 2004, the last year for which complete figures are available, total European Commission development aid to the six Horn of Africa countries amounted to more than &euro;240 million.  Ethiopia is the largest beneficiary of EC development assistance and more than &euro;2.3 billion has been allocated to the country since 1975.</P>
        <P>In addition to participating fully in EU initiatives to support peace, security and development in the Horn of Africa, Ireland supports the development of the region through our bilateral aid programme.  Ethiopia is one of Irish Aid&rsquo;s priority countries, and in 2006 Irish bilateral aid to Ethiopia amounted to approximately &euro;30 million. This is expected to increase to approximately &euro;32m in 2007.  Ireland&rsquo;s support to Ethiopia is focused on addressing the needs of the rural poor.  Total Irish Aid emergency, humanitarian and NGO funding to Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea and Kenya since 2004 amounts to over &euro;86 million.</P>

        <P>The White Paper on Irish Aid, published in September 2006, designated Malawi as Ireland&rsquo;s newest programme country. Irish Aid is currently developing a country strategy for Malawi, with a view to beginning the implementation of a full programme of bilateral assistance to that country.

	<P>Ireland is committed, through its overseas development assistance programme, to helping the poorest and most vulnerable people in developing countries.</P>
        <P>Across the programme, strategies are devised in close consultation with national governments and other key stakeholders to ensure that the support provided complements national poverty reduction plans and targets those most in need. These strategies also include monitoring frameworks to ensure that our assistance is effective and that it is implemented for the benefit of those for whom it is intended.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid has in place rigorous accounting and audit controls which are essential to ensuring a transparent, effective and high quality programme. Irish Aid programmes are regularly and intensively audited and evaluated by independent audit firms, by Irish Aid&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit and by the independent Audit Committee of the Department. Programmes are evaluated to ensure that funds are used for the purposes intended and in respect of outcomes and value for money.</P>
        <P>It is a fact that, in some of the countries where Irish Aid works, there are concerns surrounding governance issues including corruption. This is a reality and a challenge which Ireland, in common with other donors, has to face. I am satisfied that the methods used by Irish Aid in devising its strategies, combined with its audit and evaluation systems, serve to protect the funding provided, in accordance with best international practice and highest standards in this area.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The 2006 grants were allocated in July, November and December last and most of those allocations are still to be drawn down.  The 2006 allocations, combined with those from 2005, account for the greatest proportion of grants to be drawn down.  Following the allocation of a grant under the capital programmes responsibility rests with each beneficiary to comply in a timely manner with the conditions of the grant award to enable the payment of the grant to be made.</P>
        <P>The allocations made to clubs and organisations under each year&rsquo;s sports capital programme are published in the media and on my Department&rsquo;s website. Details of the individual payments made each year are listed in the Appropriation Accounts for my Department. It would not, however, be considered appropriate to publish the names of the individual grant recipients which have not yet drawn their full grant allocations, as this information is deemed confidential to the individual organisations involved, many of whom are voluntary, community groups working to provide much needed sporting and recreational facilities.</P>
        <P>Under the guidelines, terms and conditions of the sports capital programme, a &ldquo;sunset clause&rdquo; provision exists whereby my Department can fully or partially withdraw grants in the absence of satisfactory progress being made by the grantee in drawing down the grant. My Department deals with each case on its merits, taking <Col N="605"/>into account the circumstances or difficulties faced by the individual grantee concerned.</P>

        <P>Shannon Development has informed me they do not have any current plans to provide a Business Park in Tarbert. However, Shannon Development has identified Tarbert as the County Kerry location for its E-Towns Live/Work programme.  In the same way that the Shannon Development Knowledge Network has assisted Knowledge based enterprise in the larger urban centres in the region, the Shannon Development E-Towns initiative is aimed at assisting knowledge based enterprise in the smaller towns in the region.</P>
        <P>The E-Towns project incorporates physical development, as well as facilitating town planning, broadband access, and training to help create an alternative enterprise culture in each community.</P>
        <P>The primary aim of this initiative is to enable people to achieve a Live/Work balance in tailor-made accommodation, create clusters of businesses and bring new economic activity back into local communities.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development has taken an option on a site in Tarbert and an application for Planning Permission has been submitted.  Assuming a positive outcome, Shannon Development hopes to have contractors on site before year end.  The proposed development will consist of six live/work units.  A seminar will be held later in the year, to outline the key elements of the project.</P>

SWA provides a safety net against poverty in that it gives a statutory entitlement to a minimum weekly income, based on criteria set out in legislation. Apart from a number of excluded categories, anyone in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs is entitled to assistance under the SWA Scheme.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that it has not refused assistance in the case raised by the Deputy. The HSE forwarded application forms for basic supplementary welfare allowance to the person concerned in December 2006. However no application has been received to date.

	<P>Carers allowance was awarded to the person concerned from 5 April 2001. Following a review of her claim she was notified by the Deciding Officer in December 2005 that she was not entitled to carers allowance for the period from 12 June 2003 to 8 December 2004 on the grounds that she is employed outside the home for more than ten hours per week.</P>
        <P>The person appealed this decision on 8 February 2006 to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, which acts independently of my Department.  On 21 February 2006, in accordance with the statutory requirements, the relevant departmental papers, including a submission from the Deciding Officer, were sought from my Department by the Chief Appeals Officer. The papers were returned to the Appeals Office on 22 December 2006 and were referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing of the case in week commencing 26 February 2007.  The person will be informed of the date, time and venue as soon as the final arrangements have been made.</P>
        <P>I wish to assure you that this Department is committed to providing a quality customer service to all its customers and to ensuring continuous improvement in the standard of services we provide. This includes ensuring that applications are processed, decisions on entitlement and appeal submissions are completed as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.</P>
        <P>In this case, there was a delay in completing the appeal submission due to the high volume of cases which are required be dealt with and the limited resources available to deal with them. My Department is engaged in an ongoing process to ensure that available resources are prioritised to the greatest extent possible on front line service delivery and to ensure that the best possible standard of response is provided across the range of schemes and services. The position will be kept under review to ensure that the best possible customer service continues to be provided.</P>
        <P>Under Social Welfare Legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.  These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

The exchange rates for converting Sterling and other non-EMU currencies are published quarterly in the Official Journal of the European Union.</P>
        <P>Under this mechanism the conversion rate used for means testing purposes is derived from the average of the daily exchange rates in the first month of a quarter.

        <Quest> if, in the interests of promoting public transport use, he will broker negotiations and agreement between the Department of Finance and the RPA in order that the LUAS smart card users can avail of tax credit. </Quest>

	<P>Tax relief is currently available in respect of monthly and annual public transport tickets provided to employees. This applies to monthly and annual Luas tickets in the same way as it applies to tickets from other public transport operators. The Luas smartcard does not carry monthly and annual Luas tickets and therefore the question of applying the tax reliefs to the Luas smartcard does not arise.</P>

        <Quest> the way he will deliver the full 200 buses highlighted as immediately required by the Dublin Bus network review of 2006; the way in view of the recent delivery of 100 buses in response to this need, the second 100 buses will be delivered; the number of these buses that will be provided via private operators granted licenses under the 1932 Act; when they will be delivered; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There are currently in place two regimes governing the approval of bus services &mdash; one for private operators and one for Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann and I am currently considering their replacement with one regime, in the context of replacing of the Road Transport Act 1932.  As I indicated in my statement of 28 September 2006, the precise arrangements for the awarding of franchises to private operators in the Dublin market will be dealt with in this context as will the need for additional buses for the Dublin network over and above the 100 extra buses already provided.   In the meantime, the licensing provisions under the existing legislative regime will continue to be applied and licences will continue to be granted to private bus operators under the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended.</P>

	<P>The location of stations on the rail network is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  The company informs me that there are currently no plans to open a new station on the north side of Drogheda and that any new station in that location would have to be supported by major development taking place within its catchment area. However the company is looking at the feasibility of a station between Dundalk and Drogheda to serve the community in that area.</P>

	<P>The CL&Aacute;R Programme is a targeted investment programme for rural areas that have suffered more than a 35% drop in population between 1926 and 2002. The Programme now covers parts of 22 counties and all of Co. Leitrim and benefits a population of nearly 727,000.  Since I introduced the Programme in 2002, it has been reviewed and extended twice, most recently in April 2006.</P>
        <P>I set out in the following table for the Deputy&rsquo;s information the list of Electoral Divisions in Limerick that are now covered by the Programme.  I have no plans at present for any further review of CL&Aacute;R.</P><Col N="611"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227 and 228 together.</P>
        <P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category B.</P>
        <P>Category B caters for farmers who between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003 made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and /or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000-2002.  Investments can include purchase or long term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.  The person named applied under Category B (i) in <Col N="615"/>relation to purchased/leased land and B (ii) for purchase of sucker quota and has been deemed successful under both categories.</P>
        <P>The person named also benefited from another measure (New Entrant during the reference period) under which the year 2000 was removed when calculating his entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme.</P>
        <P>The Regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme provide that checks must be made to ensure that an allocation from the National Reserve, to an applicant who has already benefited under other measures associated with the Single Payment Scheme, does not result in double benefit.  An applicant may only benefit from the measure that is most beneficial.  An allocation from the National Reserve is more beneficial in this case and therefore the New Entrant status will be rescinded in favour of an allocation from the National Reserve.</P>
        <P>A formal letter of decision has issued to the person named and the relevant payment due will issue shortly.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Category A.</P>
        <P>Category A caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died before 16 May 2005 and who had leased out his/her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000 to 2002. The person named was not successful under this category as the land acquired was not received free of charge or for a nominal sum.</P>
        <P>A formal letter outlining my Department&rsquo;s decision issued to the person named and he subsequently submitted an appeal against this decision which was received in my Department on 23 January, 2007.  In all such cases, the procedure is that all contentions put forward in support of an appeal are first of all reviewed within my Department to see whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant any change to the original decision. In this case the documentation was examined by my Department but did not provide grounds for a change to the original decision. This case has since been forwarded to the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee who will carry out a full review of the case and will correspond directly with the person named following the outcome of their review.</P>
        <P>Under the 2006 National Reserve there are provisions for New Entrants to farming who have leased land.  These provisions cater for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who, while farming during 2002, did not receive any direct payments in respect of that year.  The income and educational qualification that applied to new entrants in 2005 again apply to this category.  In addition, new entrants who are farming leased / rented land will be eligible for an allocation provided they can demonstrate a genuine commitment to farming.  In this context the leased/rented land must have been declared on the 2004 Area Aid application and on the 2005 and 2006 Single Payment Scheme application.</P>
        <P>My Department has forwarded a 2006 National Reserve application form to the person named <Col N="617"/>for his attention. Should the person named feel that he qualifies for the 2006 National Reserve he should return the completed application form to my Department offices in Portlaoise at his earliest possible convenience.</P>

	<P>The position is that an application for the Transfer of Entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme from the person named was submitted on the 5th April 2006.</P>
        <P>During processing of the Transfer application, an official of my Department made direct contact with the person named informing him that his entitlements cannot be transferred by sale as he had applied to consolidate his entitlements in 2005, and consolidated entitlements cannot be transferred for five years following consolidation except by gift or inheritance. The person named subsequently submitted a letter requesting withdrawal of the transfer application and this has now been processed.</P>
        <P>The person named was accepted under the Consolidation measure and was granted 18.62 consolidated entitlements in 2005 which are regarded as having come from the National Reserve.  The rules governing National Reserve entitlements state that each entitlement must be used each year for five years unless transferred by gift or inheritance.  As the person named declared only 12.23 eligible hectares on his 2006 Single Payment application, he will lose 6.39 Consolidated  entitlements to the value of &euro;1,525.42 to the National Reserve forever.</P>

The person named then appealed this decision to the Independent Single Payment Appeals Committee who, having fully reviewed the case, recommended that the decision taken by my Department should be upheld.</P>
        <P>The circumstances outlined in the Force Majeure application refer to land which was used for the production of soft fruit during the reference period 2000-2002 and are  not eligible under the provisions of force majeure.</P>

	<P>In order to ensure that children whose first language is not English can succeed at school, my Department gives additional support to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of teacher posts. </P>
        <P>The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled.  Between extra language support posts and grant aid, the level of support provided to schools to meet the needs of children whose first language is not English has increased dramatically in recent years.  Nonetheless I am very conscious of the pressures on schools, including schools in Dublin West, that have large <Col N="619"/>numbers of non-English speaking children enrolled.  I am determined to provide greater support for these schools.</P>
        <P>To that end, provision has been made in the Towards 2016 partnership agreement for the provision of an additional 550 language support teachers at primary and post-primary level by 2009.  It is proposed to allocate 200 of these posts in 2007 with the balance being allocated in 2008 and 2009.  These extra posts will allow the current limit of 2 teachers per school to be reformed.</P>
        <P>While details as to the precise number of posts to be allocated at both levels in the current school year and the schools to which the posts will be allocated have yet to be finalised I can assure the Deputy that I will be anxious to ensure that the additional resources are properly targeted at those areas where they are most needed.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive strategy is currently being finalised which will ensure that the extra investment in this area is being used to the best effect, and that it is underpinned by the right support and training for teachers.</P>

	<P>The National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) has not directly undertaken a formal evaluation into the use and effectiveness of interactive whiteboards as a teaching and learning tool. However, there are a number of projects which involve the use of interactive whiteboards, for example the NCTE is involved in a project which explores the use of different technologies, including whiteboards, in addressing the English curriculum at primary level. </P>
        <P>The NCTE&rsquo;s 2005 Census on ICT Infrastructure in Schools found that some 2% of primary schools, 5% of post-primary schools and 3% of special schools had interactive whiteboards.</P>
        <P>The NCTE is aware of a growing body of international research on the use of interactive whiteboards and it advises schools on their use.  There is a project involving Drumcondra Education Centre, the Computer Education Society of Ireland and the Irish Computer Society which is investigating the effectiveness of using interactive whiteboards in the classroom.  This project is in its second year and I understand that its findings will be published.</P><Col N="623"/>
        <P>On a general note, the NCTE is preparing advice on the appropriate equipment specification for schools and the role of interactive whiteboards will be addressed in that context.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware the recent Census preliminary figures confirm the Fingal area of Dublin as the fastest growing area in the country.  The Department is of the view that between primary and post primary level, some 20 new schools will be required there over the coming years.  The challenge is to provide these schools in line with or ahead of demand for pupil places.</P>
        <P>The Department recently published a Draft Area Development Plan for North Dublin, East Meath and South Louth areas, which has quantified the extent of extra accommodation which will be required there for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>The Commission on School accommodation has commenced a public consultation process on this document.  When the final plan is published, this will become the framework against which capital investment for the area will be made for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>The Draft Plan will also show that considerable interventions have already been made by the Department to increase pupil places and these interventions are being backed up by a significant capital investment programme.</P>
        <P>At primary level in Swords, the Department is providing three new school buildings for Swords Educate Together NS, Gaelscoil Brian Boroimhe and Gaelscoil an Duinn&iacute;nigh.  An extension is also being provided St. Cronan&rsquo;s Senior NS, Brackenstown.  The Department has a further reserved site in Swords for primary provision and it is in discussion with the local authority for another.</P>
        <P>In Balbriggan, the Department is providing a new 16 classroom school for an Educate Together School N.S. which opened in 2005.  In September 2006 the Department granted provisional recognition to Gaelscoil Bhaile Brig&iacute;n, which opened with an enrolment of 35 pupils.  St. Teresa&rsquo;s NS, Balbriggan is included among the schools recently given approval for the appointment of a design team to progress an extension project.</P><Col N="624"/>
        <P>There are a further two sites reserved in Balbriggan for primary school purposes and the Department will move to acquire and develop these as the need is identified.</P>
        <P>In Lusk, approval was recently given to Lusk NS and St. Catherine&rsquo;s NS to  appoint  design teams to progress  extension projects.  The Rush/Lusk Educate Together NS, was recently granted permanent recognition and its temporary accommodation is grant aided by my Department.  Two sites have been reserved for further primary provision in Lusk.  In Rush a site has also been reserved for primary school development.</P>
        <P>At post primary level, a new 1,000 pupil post primary school is being delivered in Donabate under a design and build contract.  A new 1,000 pupil post primary school is also being delivered in Balbriggan under the Department&rsquo;s PPP Programme and the Loreto Secondary School, Balbriggan was among the schools included on a recent list of projects to go to tender and construction for an extension project.</P>

	<P>As part of the primary school curriculum Irish is a compulsory subject.  Exemption from the study of Irish may, however, be granted to primary pupils under certain circumstances as outlined in Department Circular 12/96. </P>
        <P>A condition for the granting of an exemption to a pupil with a specific or general learning difficulty is that evidence of such a disability must be furnished by a qualified psychologist.  There is however no provision for the automatic granting of exemptions to pupils on foot of a recommendation in a psychologist&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Circular delegated authority to grant exemptions from Irish, within the conditions laid down, has been vested in the individual school authority.</P>

        <Quest> if teacher training students will receive a subsidy to cover the expenses they incur during their mandatory teaching practice placement in view of the fact that these expenses <Col N="625"/>are placing an extra financial burden on students. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that teaching practice is an integral part of the curriculum for the training of both primary and post-primary teachers and, as such, my Department does not provide special financial assistance for students towards costs associated with teaching practice.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that teacher education programmes provided in approved third level institutions are also approved courses for the purposes of the Higher Education Grants Scheme.  Under the terms of the Scheme, grant holders who are required to participate in off-campus placement as part of their course of study may have their grant entitlement paid in the normal manner.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, student teachers who are eligible for grant assistance continue to receive their entitlements while undertaking teaching practice.  My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students which are administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees.  The Higher Education Grant Scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.  Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
        <P>An approved third level course for the purpose of the HEG and the VEC Scholarship Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year&rsquo;s duration pursued in an approved institution.  The Schemes outline their respective courses which are approved for grant purposes.  Any student who is eligible to receive a maintenance grant under these Schemes continues to have the grant paid to them during their teaching practice.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department allocates funding each year to third level institutions under the Student Assistance Fund. This fund is available in order to assist students who may be experiencing difficulties in continuing their studies because of financial hardship.  The disbursement of this funding is a matter for individual institutions in line with guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
        <P>My Department has no plans to introduce an additional scheme of financial assistance, over and above the current provision, in relation to the training of teachers.</P>

	<P>The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.  It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy. </P>
        <P>Officials in my Department have been in contact with the awarding authorities in Kildare and they have no application for the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>If an individual applicant considers that s/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, s/he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
        <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.  However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>

	<P>The admission requirements to higher education courses are a matter for decision by the college authorities.  In general, Irish is not essential except for entry to NUI colleges.  The NUI matriculation requirements generally require students born in the Republic of Ireland to have passed Irish in the Leaving Certificate or GCE/GSE examinations.  However, there is provision for exemption from the Matriculation requirement with regard to Irish for those who have been granted exemptions under Rule 46 of the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools. </P><Col N="627"/>
        <P>The guidelines in relation to an exemption from the study of Irish at post-primary level are set out in Rule 46 of the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools as outlined in Circular M10/94.  Under the terms of this Rule, Principals of post-primary schools have delegated authority to grant exemptions provided that the student meets the criteria as set down.</P>
        <P>The criteria provide that exemptions may be granted by school authorities for (a) students whose primary education up to 11 years of age was received in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland (b) students who were previously enrolled as recognised students in a primary school or post-primary school who are being re-enrolled after a period spent abroad, provided that at least 3 years have elapsed since the previous enrolment in the State and the student is at least 11 years of age on re-enrolment and (c) certain categories of students with special educational needs as set out in Circular M10/94 or (d) students from abroad, who have no understanding of English, when enrolled.</P>
        <P>Any candidate who is granted exemption from the study of Irish under Rule 46 and who intends applying for a place in a Constituent University or Recognised College, is required to forward to the National University of Ireland, a copy of the Certificate of Exemption, signed by the school manager/principal and accompanied by relevant supporting documentation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. This staffing schedule for the 2006/07 school year is outlined in Primary Circular 0023/2006 which was issued to all primary schools.</P>
        <P>In the current school year (2006/07) the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy comprises of a Principal and seven mainstream class teaching posts, based on an enrolment of 180 pupils at 30th September, 2005 as submitted by the Board of Management of the school.  The school also has the services of 1 Permanent Learning Support/ Resource teacher post and 1 Shared Permanent Learning Support/Resource post.</P>
        <P>The Board of Management has submitted a report indicating that there were 164 pupils enrolled in the school on the 30th September 2006. The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2007/08 school year will be determined on that figure and in accordance with the staffing <Col N="630"/>schedule for the 2007/2008 school year which will be finalised as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
        <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
        <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>As you know, all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006-07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that 20 hours per week home tuition has been sanctioned for the child in question for the 2006/2007 school year.  As the Deputy is aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is now operational.  A specific function of the NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is to identify appropriate educational placement for all children with special educational needs.  The SENO is a focal point of contact for parents and schools. It is open to the parent to contact the SENO directly regarding the child&rsquo;s needs.  Contact details for the SENO may be sourced from the NCSE at (046) 9486400.  Alternatively, these details may be accessed on the NCSE website at www.ncse.ie.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the autism-specific class in Scoil Bhr&iacute;de Naas is open and has been in operation since 1st September 2006.  As I advised the Deputy recently, I have requested that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) formally submit to my Department an up to date report on the situation concerning the North Kildare Educate Together school with recommendations on how to proceed.  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department <Col N="632"/>has undertaken to provide a staffing complement to this class in line with staffing levels provided to all other such autism classes.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism receive an education appropriate to their needs, preferably through the primary and post primary school network. In this regard my Department has established: 181 special classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools, 17 of which are in the Kildare area; 5 special classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome; 16 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum; 14 Stand Alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology on a pilot basis, 1 of these facilities based in the Kildare area, with 2 yet to be established.</P>

	<P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc. </P>
        <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment).  In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in <Col N="634"/>enrolments each year.  Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>On the Post Primary side allocations are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment. In general a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established Junior Certificate, Leaving Certificate, repeat Leaving Certificate and Transition Year Programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Post-leaving Certificate courses and Leaving Certificate Applied.  Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils&rsquo; needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation.  Significant improvements have been made in the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years.  The ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996/97 school year to 13.2:1 in the 2005/06 school year.  The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.</P>
        <P>But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.  I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

	<P>In support of balanced regional development, the National Development Plan 2007-2013 proposes to enhance the growth capacity of the nine Gateway cities and towns, designated under the National Spatial Strategy, and to strengthen their role as drivers of the development of their wider regions.  As an incentive to stimulate and reward joined-up strategies and action at Gateway level, a Gateway Innovation Fund (GIF) is being established under this NDP to help fund targeted strategic investments that can trigger the accelerated development of the Gateways and their wider regions.  The Fund will operate initially on a pilot basis over the three-year period (2008-2010) with &euro;100m of Exchequer funding being made available per annum for qualifying proposals.  Lead local authorities, on behalf of each of the Gateways, will be expected to bid on a competitive and &mdash; added-value &mdash; basis for central funding for projects that stimulate Gateway development, with a significant element of co-funding to be provided locally.  After this initial pilot phase, the Fund will be subject to review, and may be continued over the remaining NDP period. </P>
        <P>Under the management of my Department, bids will be evaluated centrally by a broadly representative GIF Management Committee which will assess independently whether the proposals are consistent with the agreed Gateway development strategies, and are critical in leveraging accelerated and co-ordinated gateway development.  The precise operational details of the Fund are being drawn up by my Department, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, and will be disseminated to the relevant local authorities in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The Gateway Innovation Fund will be additional to the significant NDP capital investment already envisaged under the major sectoral investment programmes for the NSS Gateways and Hubs.  I am confident that this dedicated funding line to encourage and accelerate Gateway development will be a powerful instrument in rewarding innovation and cooperation at local level from all the stakeholders in the Gateway, <Col N="636"/>including local authorities, State agencies and the private sector.</P>

	<P>To address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic, designated facilities are being provided on a temporary, once-off basis by local authorities where farmers may deposit stockpiled farm film plastic and silage wrap.  This arrangement operated on a pilot basis in the first instance in counties Galway, Clare, Mayo, Offaly and Waterford during June and July of last year.  This service is free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities is being made available from my Department through the Environment Fund. </P>
        <P>The collections were well supported by farmers in the counties participating in the pilot phase, leading to large quantities of plastic being deposited at designated sites.  A significant finding from the pilot scheme is that it is not possible to operate collections in a large number of counties at the same time due to capacity constraints on the part of recovery operators.  Accordingly, it was necessary to roll out the scheme to other areas on a staggered basis.  Arising from a comprehensive examination of the information available, I approved further collections of waste silage/bale wrap by Leitrim, Roscommon, Carlow, Longford, North Tipperary and Wicklow County Councils which recently concluded.   Announcements regarding further extensions of collections to other areas, including county Kerry, will follow a review of this second phase of the scheme.</P>

	<P>The Mortgage Protection Scheme for local authority loans has applied to all house purchase loans approved by local authorities on or after 1 July 1986.  Under the scheme, the cost of mortgage protection insurance is met by way of an additional charge, currently 0.598%, to the rate of interest charged on individual loans.  One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join.  Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers. </P>
        <P>Under the terms of the current scheme, borrowers must be between 18 and 55 years of age and in good health.  The determination of eligibility in accordance with these and other criteria is a matter for the local authority concerned in consultation with the scheme administrator and underwriter, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>While authorities must operate prudentially in relation to approving housing loans, they are not necessarily prevented from making a loan to a borrower who cannot obtain mortgage protection insurance because he or she by reason of health or age would not be acceptable to an insurer.</P>

	<P>The maintenance and improvement of non-national roads and bridges in County Kerry is a matter for Kerry County Council to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State grants provided by my Department.  The question of special funding to take account of emergency improvements to non-national roads is regularly raised.  The standing approach in my Department is not to hold back a reserve allocation at central level to deal with such situations. Such an arrangement would mean a reduction across all local authorities in the road grant allocations to them at the beginning of each year.  Instead, the non-national roads allocations made each year to local auth<Col N="638"/>orities are inclusive of such risk factors. In determining the annual allocations, the overall objective is to resource each local authority appropriately in relation to their ongoing and special needs. </P>
        <P>On 18 January 2007, I announced the 2007 grant allocation for non-national roads, which at over &euro;607.5 million is the highest ever, and represents an increase of 9%, or almost &euro;50 million, on the 2006 allocation. The total 2007 initial allocation to Kerry County Council is &euro;22,281,800, which represents an increase of 8% on its 2006 initial allocation.  While there are no further funds at my disposal from which I could make a special grant allocation to Kerry County Council for the replacement of Ballinagare Bridge, it is open to the Council to fund eligible works at this location from its Discretionary Improvement Grant provided by my Department or from its own resources. In 2007, the Council has received of &euro;1,186,000 for Discretionary Improvement works, an increase of 3% on its 2006 allocation. The selection of works to be funded from this allocation is entirely a matter for Kerry County Council.</P>
        <P>My Department will be seeking applications under the Specific Improvements Grant scheme later this year and it will also be open to Kerry County Council to submit an application to replace the bridge for consideration for funding in 2008 under the scheme.</P>
        <P>I understand that the matter is currently the subject of court proceedings and accordingly any further comment in relation to the circumstances surrounding the collapse of the bridge would be inappropriate.</P>

The new limits are 90 seconds minimum and 15 minutes maximum duration from the sounding of external alarms in buildings; the alarms must cease automatically after the maximum duration.  This standard has been applied by the National Standards Authority of Ireland for intruder alarms installed by certified installers since 1 March 2004.</P>
        <P>The Private Security Services Act 2004 provided for the establishment of a Private Security Authority to licence, control and supervise all alarm installers of security equipment, and for the Authority to have powers to maintain and improve standards in the provision of services, including standards for intruder alarms. I understand that with effect from 1 November 2005, installers of alarms were required to register with the Private Security Authority and with effect from 1 August 2006, installers cannot operate without a licence, the granting of which will require proof that the installer has attained the EN 50131 standard.</P>
        <P>In addition, I understand that the connection of monitored business intruder alarm systems to Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stations is contingent upon, inter alia, the use of alarm systems which are certified by the NSAI and installed by certified installers. The current European Standard along with improved equipment and the co-operation of the installers certified by the NSAI, should together ensure that the incidence of false alarms and the failure of audible alarms to cut off will be significantly reduced.</P>
        <P>Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994, a local authority or any person may seek an order in the district court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.  A public information leaflet outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available from my Department or on www.environ.ie.</P>

	<P>Kerry County Council has made an application for my consent under section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930 (as amended) to carry out works in respect of a proposed extension to this graveyard.  A national monument in State ownership, Aughamore Abbey, is located within the graveyard.  Due to the sensitive nature of the site from both an archaeological and ecological viewpoint, detailed consideration of the application by my Department was necessary to assess the potential impact of the proposals on both the built and natural heritage. The Office of Public Works who manage the national monument on my behalf were also consulted.  In addition to that I am required under the relevant statutory provisions to consult with the Director of the National Museum of Ireland before granting a consent under section 14 of the 1930 Act (as amended). That consultative process has commenced in this case and on its completion a decision in the matter will issue to the County Council. The statutory period specified for such consultation is not more than 14 days or such other period as may be agreed in the circumstances of a particular case.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for national roads is a matter for the relevant road authority and the National Roads Authority which operates under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Transport.</P>
        <P>Under Section 10 (1) of the Roads Act, 1993, where a national road has been realigned or a by-pass has been constructed on it, the section of the existing road which remains following such realignment or by-pass automatically becomes a local road. I understand, however, that where such a former national road requires strengthening, the National Roads Authority normally finances the necessary improvement works either prior to or following the completion of the by-pass or realignment scheme. Detailed information regarding such funding by the National Roads Authority is not available in my Department.</P>

	<P>As indicated in reply to Question No. 227 of 4 October 2006, local authorities have been asked as a priority to establish a policy on taking in charge housing estates to be approved by the elected members.  These arrangements are premised on the principle that local authorities themselves are best placed to monitor and implement action in this area.  </P><Col N="643"/>
        <P>The Working Group established by Department to develop national guidance for local authorities on management companies and the taking in charge of residential estates is nearing completion of its work. The resulting draft guidance for planning authorities will be issued shortly.  The essential points of this guidance will also be <Col N="644"/>incorporated into the revised and expanded residential density guidelines, the new Sustainable Residential Development Guidelines, which will be available in draft form later in the year.  The Working Group is satisfied that sufficient data on recent local authority practice in this area has been available to it in the context of its work on the new draft guidance.</P>
