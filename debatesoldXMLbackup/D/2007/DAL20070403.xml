      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="2" />
        <P Just="Left">The code of conduct for office holders was drawn up by the Government pursuant to section 10(2) of the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, following consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission, and published in July 2003.  On two occasions since the code was launched, I have provided office holders with additional guidance on it in the light of views expressed by the commission.  The first occasion related to the use of public resources in the context of public events or advertising.  On the second occasion, the guidance related to briefings by civil servants to Members.  These are the only two occasions on which it has been necessary to issue guidance to office holders on the code since it came into operation.  We should obtain wider experience about the effectiveness of the code before reviewing it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am sure the Taoiseach is as anxious as everybody else that everything should be absolutely clear in so far as the remit and role of public servants is concerned.  In respect of briefings to be prepared for Ministers and Ministers of States on political matters in the run-in to the forthcoming general election, can we take it that public servants will not be asked to provide political material?  In other words, if a series of <Col N="3" />information leaflets is to be produced, for example, will it be provided from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s party resources rather than by public servants?  There should be no misunderstanding about this.</P>
        <P>I read a report in the newspapers recently that there are up to 400 positions to be appointed on various boards and bodies.  Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention to go ahead with that before the election?  I understood there was a type of gentleman&rsquo;s agreement that a raft of appointments would not be made until the people decided what they want to do with their votes in terms of the appointment of the next Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Public servants generally, particularly those in the departmental system, never involve themselves in political material or political drafting.  Therefore, the answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s first question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  That has always been the position, even outside election periods.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s second question, those reports arise from an omnibus parliamentary question put down to all Ministers on all the vacancies and positions that arise.  Board positions are filled as they arise.  As I said before, it is not the position to wait until an election period and then fill them all.  In my Department, the list that came out included appointments to the NESC and NDF boards, which are all the social partnership boards.  These amount to 70 or 80 names and they are done in a <i>pro forma</i> way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is any review of the code of conduct planned, particularly in view of the pledge, after the brouhaha last year, that legislation would be introduced to reform the ethics legislation?  The last time the Taoiseach answered questions on this, on 18 October, he said the D&aacute;il would have an opportunity to discuss the matter &ldquo;when the relevant Bill is introduced shortly by the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  It is unlikely we will see that now because the Taoiseach is closing down the D&aacute;il towards the end of this week and he will permit himself some three weeks of campaigning before we start the campaign properly.  When will we enact this legislation the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste pledged would be enacted last October?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That legislation started in the Seanad and there is no reason it should not get through.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I take that as a commitment from the Taoiseach that the Bill will come into this House before the D&aacute;il is dissolved.  In respect of the imposition on Members to pay for the use of facilities during the election campaign, does that imposition apply to office holders?  Is it only ordinary Members of the House who will be obliged to reimburse the Oireachtas for the use of its offices and staff?  Does the imposition apply to <Col N="4" />Ministers in the discharge of their duties or are they in a separate and more privileged position?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it, if constituency facilities are involved or facilities related to one&rsquo;s capacity as a TD, they are apportioned so everyone would pay.  If it is related to one&rsquo;s public office role or departmental role, it does not apply.  That is how I understand it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does that mean Ministers have an advantage?  For example, they have the use of transport.  The Taoiseach and his Ministers can reasonably say that what they are doing is discharging their ministerial functions whereas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I think we have gone well outside the scope of these questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought you might say that, a Cheann Comhairle. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I would prefer if Members would stay within the questions they submit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Furthermore, Sir, you may well be right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, Deputy, and if the Chair is right I expect you to obey the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach heard my question and, perhaps, he will answer it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand, all these matters are being worked out by the commission and we are all bound by the same rules.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The code of conduct requires office holders to declare where they have a particular interest which transcends or encroaches on any particular performance of their office in the course of their holding same.  To the Taoiseach&rsquo;s knowledge, what number of declarations have been made since the requirement was introduced in 2003?  Has he any indication of the regularity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not arise under this question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does it not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is one of the areas under the code of conduct.  Does the Taoiseach see any need to revisit the matter in terms of amending the code of conduct in respect of that area?  Does he agree one way of determining whether an amendment is required is whether the existing codes of conduct requirements are being honoured.  That is why I asked the question in the first place.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="5" />
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said in my original reply, I see no reason to review the code because there have been only two determinations in the six years since we started the process and declarations are made on an annual basis to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  Every Member and office holders, in particular, have to make a detailed declaration every year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Taoiseach specifically if he would amend the code of conduct for office holders.  The reason I asked that question was that on 28 February last the Taoiseach told us very clearly that he was opposed to the packing of State boards.  Will he amend the rules in line with his clearly stated view on that matter, given that in the first six months 375 appointments were made by office holders to State boards and apparently 400 appointments are to be made between now and the end of the Government&rsquo;s term?  Is there any point in taking seriously what the Taoiseach says here, that he is opposed to the packing of State boards, when he will not amend the code of conduct for office holders to reflect that clearly stated preference on his part?  If he is opposed to it, how can his Ministers go against him in that regard?  Will he, therefore, change the code of conduct?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue we debated on that and other occasions was that after an election it was the practice of all Governments, whether they changed, to fill positions on State boards.  There may be some urgent ones but I do not think that generally such boards should be packed in that interregnum period.  On filling positions on boards as they arise, on a daily or weekly basis, they have to be filled and it would be wrong not to fill them.  State boards cover many different areas and have to be filled on an ongoing basis.  There are two different things here, however.  There are 400 vacant positions to be filled, many of which are on nominating bodies, as the Deputy will be aware from the  reply to the questions.  They are nominated by various organisations and bodies, but even if they were not, ordinary day-to-day departmental procedures must be adopted.  The interregnum period is a different matter so my view still holds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is there not a need to change the code of conduct, therefore, at least to reflect that so that it is not ambiguous?  It is so at the moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My view is that people should use common sense in these matters.  There is nothing to stop the positions from being filled in the interregnum period but I do not think it requires a code.  If we start putting everything into codes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Not everything.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="6" />
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Well, we are moving in that direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>How does the Taoiseach draw a distinction between saying he is opposed to State boards being packed on the eve of an election and saying that he will proceeded with 400 appointments between now and the general election, as has been reported recently?  &ldquo;Packed&rdquo; is only a derogatory term applied to the appointments.  It seems the Taoiseach is proceeding as he said he would not at the last Question Time.  </P>
        <P>May I also ask the Taoiseach about the answer he just gave me concerning the reform of this legislation as promised at the time of the Paddy the plasterer affair?  He said the Bill is in the Seanad.  On reflection, can he say if that is the case?  I am advised it is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government Chief Whip tells me that if the Bill is not in the Seanad it is going to the Seanad and it will be dealt with there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said it was in the Seanad.  When does language ever mean anything?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill has passed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not a day the Taoiseach comes in here that he does not tell blatant fibs.  It is either in the Seanad or it is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please, Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said the Bill was in the Seanad, now he says it is going to the Seanad. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Rabbitte to allow the Taoiseach to continue.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Taoiseach never answer a straightforward question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Rabbitte to allow the Taoiseach to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I think Deputy Rabbitte should withdraw his comment that I come in here every day telling blatant fibs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is disgraceful. </P>

	<P>I can rhyme off half a dozen of them the Taoiseach told me in the past two weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy is not going to withdraw it, that is all right.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach told me there were 91 labour inspectors when there were 30.  </P>

	<P>I ask the Deputy to withdraw the comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Five minutes ago, in answer to a perfectly harmless question, the Taoiseach told me that the Bill was in the Seanad and that it would come back here for enactment. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the Deputy unequivocally to withdraw the word &ldquo;fibs&rdquo;, which is unparliamentary.  It has never been allowed by any of my predecessors in this House and I am certainly not going to permit it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

	<P>The Government Chief Whip informs me that the Bill has been approved by the Government and is due to start in the Seanad, although I do not know on what day.  I will check and let Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s office know the date.  I am not responsible for the business of the Seanad, and I think the Deputy knows that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is responsible for his answers here, however.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My answer is that the Bill left the Government to go to the Seanad.</P>

It is concerned with ensuring that I and the Government are advised of high <Col N="9" />level security issues and the responses to them, but not involving operational security matters.</P>
        <P>The committee meets as required and will continue to do so.  In addition to meetings, the members liaise on an ongoing basis to monitor developments which might have national security implications, in particular in the international arena.</P>

	<P>It was reported last year that up to six Islamic terrorist cells were operating in Ireland in 2003.  I raised this matter previously with the Taoiseach and he said that some people were being observed.  Does the evidence available to the Government indicate that these Islamic terrorist cells are still based in Ireland or that personnel associated with them are still based here?  What is the latest information available to the Government and is the Taoiseach happy that if these individuals are here, their activities are not illegal?  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that, if such individuals were involved in planning terrorist activities, the matter has been addressed?</P>
        <P>Last year potentially major terrorist attacks on transatlantic flights between the United States and Britain were foiled and this has implications for Ireland and Irish people who travel abroad.  The Taoiseach said previously that the recommendations of the Emergency Planning Society would be costly to implement.  Has the Taoiseach arranged to implement some of these measures, if not all of them, to help keep an eye on things here?</P>
        <P>There were two major emergencies recently on motorways in County Kildare that were tragic and also caused massive inconvenience to hundreds of thousands of people.  Have the outcomes of these emergencies been evaluated and emergency plans adapted accordingly to help deal with any unfortunate future incidents?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate to speculate on the matter raised in Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s first question but I assure the House that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na closely monitors the security situation, including threats to international security, on an ongoing basis.  A small number of people are closely monitored and those under observation change from time to time.  The situation in this regard has not changed greatly in the past year.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s original question related to the National Security Committee and not emergency facilities.  The only report that I have seen in regard to the crash was on the involvement of the national emergency committee and Naas General Hospital, which worked well.  It is unfortunate that there was a fatality and a number of injuries but the system worked well from the perspective of emergency planning.</P>
        <P>Regarding alternatives, many organisations involved, such as the Garda, local authorities and health groups, feel that their work and roles would be duplicated by an office of emergency planning to bring everything together, as is the <Col N="10" />case in some countries.  What happens is they have a committee like the national security committee and other committees where they come together and co-ordinate their actions.  They do this on an ongoing basis through direct contact and physical proximity meetings with each other.  To replicate this in a major office or structure is not considered necessary by all of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In this regard, is the threat from terrorist groups more extensive than we are being told or is there another explanation for the frequency of resort to examining telephone records by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, given the revelation some time ago that in 2006 alone there were 10,000 such requests by the Garda?  This seems to be an extraordinary high number of such examinations by the Garda.  Does the Taoiseach agree with the assistant Data Protection Commissioner who concluded that perfectly innocent people are having their private records pored over or can he give a logical explanation as to why there should be this frequency of resort to examining the private telephone records of citizens?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On national security and the question about people who are brought to the attention of the security forces because of national or international liaison with groups such as those I referred to earlier, there are not many such persons in the country.  Some of them are in or out of the country and some of them have contacts with the country.  The Garda is continually involved in monitoring ongoing subversion by, thankfully, a limited number of groups and, of course, there are criminal groups.  I do not have a breakdown &mdash; this is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; but the Garda is monitoring criminal gangs, subversives and a small number of people who are or may be associated with international terrorism all the time.  I do not have any details on the make up of the 10,000 or 20,000 figure. </P>

	<P Just="Left">Does the National Security Committee address the dangers to the health and safety of the Irish people from the British nuclear industry, including the site at Sellafield, and the threat that must be real from the fact that Britain is the holder of a nuclear arms arsenal?  Has this matter been addressed, particularly in the context of a vote on 14 March at Westminster when the Labour Government experienced one of the largest rebellions from within its ranks since the outbreak of the war on Iraq and had to depend on Tory party support to see through its measure?  Has the national security committee addressed this decision at Westminster given that Britain is intent on renewing and enhancing its nuclear arms holding?  What plans does the Taoiseach have to address this matter with the British Prime Minister if it has not been addressed?</P>

	<P>After the events of 11 September 2001 the Government set up an office of emergency planning to co-ordinate the work of various emergency services in preparing contingency plans.  The office is chaired by the Minister for Defence and meets frequently to assist in that role.  It oversees emergency planning generally to promote the best possible use of State resources and ensure compatibility between different emergency planning requirements.  Any issues related to Sellafield are dealt with by the two relevant Departments, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  In so far as I raise the Sellafield issue on behalf of the Government, I have had ongoing meetings and correspondence and there has been liaison between senior officials and the British Government, which continues.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is well within the scope of the question.  My question refers to the work of the National Security Committee.  I want to know whether the Taoiseach is considering widening the remit of that committee.  The issue is not just about an Islamic terrorist cell or what might be relevant in other countries.  Is the Taoiseach, for example, considering the possible effects on national security if we could not access the oil supplies we need, and whether this needs to be part of the remit?  Is he considering the incidents of water contamination in Galway, which will be exacerbated by climate change, with flooding and treatment plants unable to provide safe water supplies?  Are these matters part of the remit of the committee?  Where does the remit begin and end?  It is time to reconsider the remit, given the changing circumstances in which we live.</P>

	<P>Matters related to health or water schemes are dealt with in the emergency planning within individual Departments and are not part of the remit of the national security committee.  The committee comprises representatives at the highest level of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Defence, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces, who examine areas of concern where there is a per<Col N="12" />ceived threat to national security, whether of domestic or international origin.  When the committee becomes aware of gaps or inadequacies in responses or preparations, it deals with these issues.  It considers issues around international and national security and is not involved in day-to-day operational issues, which is the function of Departments, local authorities and State agencies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Progress on the implementation of the Government programme is kept under review.  Deputies will be aware that on the completion of each full year that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have been in Government, we have published an annual progress report that sets out progress to date in implementing every commitment in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The last edition of the Government progress report was published in July 2005.  It was decided to defer publication of a report in 2006 and instead to publish a final progress report in 2007, giving a full account of the achievements of this Government in implementing the programme.  This final report will give a more complete picture of the Government&rsquo;s level of delivery over almost the entirety of its term of office.  It is the responsibility of each Minister to ensure the com<Col N="13" />mitments in the programme that fall within his or her portfolio are fully implemented.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of the Taoiseach derives its mandate from my role as Head of Government.  As such, it is involved to some degree in virtually all aspects of the work of Government.  It provides support to me as Taoiseach and to the Government through the Government secretariat, the Cabinet committee system and through its involvement in key policy areas and initiatives.</P>
        <P>The current key strategic priorities of the Department are set out in its strategy statement.  They include Northern Ireland, EU and international affairs, economic and social policy, social partnership, public service modernisation and the information society and e-government.  Both I and the Ministers of State in my Department answer questions in the House on these issues.  In all of its work, my Department works closely with other Departments and offices.  Individual Ministers are answerable to the House in respect of their specific areas of responsibility.</P>
        <P>The key areas for which my Department is responsible in terms of An Agreed Programme for Government can be broadly summarised as follows: supporting the development and implementation of social partnership, working with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to achieve the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects, co-ordinating the e-government initiative to bring about an expansion in the range and quality of online Government services and ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s key objectives in the European Union are carried forward in the context of my role as a member of the European Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the requirement of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department to oversee the implementation of social partnership, in which the Taoiseach has had a long involvement, I made the point some years ago that a one-size-fits-all benchmarking process leading to social partnership does not fit all circumstances.  The current work to rule by nurses is in full swing and in this respect nurses, patients and taxpayers will all suffer.  Obviously, intransigence on either side can lead to stalemate, to more serious action or to a situation where everybody loses.  With regard to responsibility to oversee implementation of social partnership, what is the role of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department in setting sufficiently flexible criteria under the benchmarking process to allow for matters to be put on the table that could be negotiated and discussed and which could lead to the social partnership criteria being fulfilled?</P>
        <P>In other words, there is a problem today with 40,000 nurses and the negotiation process cannot even get started.  The point I made three years ago was that the benchmarking process was not sufficiently flexible to cater for such circumstances.  Does the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department have a responsibility or role in opening up the criteria <Col N="14" />for negotiation so those with legitimate grievances, from whatever sector, are able to say the process allows them to put their grievances on the table and discuss them?  Is this possible if, for example, the nursing organisations say they are prepared to change practices and become more efficient etc., leaving aside the two fundamental issues at stake from their point of view?  If they cannot get through the starting gate to discuss these things, what is the responsibility of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department in so far as broadening the criteria for benchmarking is concerned?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In general, the criteria, the terms of reference and operation of benchmarking are worked out between management and unions.  That has already been done and worked out for the next round of benchmarking.  There are many difficulties in this particular case.  First, some of the nurses, the INO and PNA, have not signed up to Towards 2016, while those who are members of SIPTU have.  The Labour Court has made its position clear that the issue is a matter for the benchmarking process.  The criteria have already been worked out for the next round of benchmarking and both the union and management sides have had a role in fixing those criteria.  Their position has been agreed and that is part of the problem, that it is an agreed position between both sides.</P>
        <P>There are several issues involved.  On the issue of the 35-hour week, this could have been discussed between management and union sides if it arose at the benchmarking discussions.  My people and others tried hard in the national implementation body, NIB, discussions over the past three weeks to make progress on the issue, and did make some progress.  The issue of the pay anomaly is also related to the situation.  It arises as a result of pay adjustments for nurses and midwives and affects a small number of people.  I believe it can be resolved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The big issue is the 10.6% pay increase demand.  We have no mechanism to resolve that because it flies in the face of the overall pay agreement.  There are possibilities in the other areas &mdash; other people worked hard for three weeks to achieve that position.  The Labour Court has recommended that the issue can be dealt with only through benchmarking.  The national implementation body, NIB, despite all its efforts over the past three weeks, was unable to find an alternative solution.</P>
        <P>The dilemma in which we find ourselves is that conceding the nurses&rsquo; demand on pay would spell the end of pay policy, the collapse of the arrangements made not just with the rest of the public service, but with workers generally across the economy.  That is the issue we cannot resolve.  This is not the fault of benchmarking but is due to the fact that we have a national agreement and we cannot have two.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="15" />
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am focused on the responsibility and role of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department in overseeing the implementation of social partnership.  The NIB met for three weeks but not much progress was made there.  If the Labour Court states that benchmarking is the way forward, what is the Department&rsquo;s role in making the criteria sufficiently flexible, given that the Irish Nurses Organisation and the Psychiatric Nurses Association have not signed on to social partnership?  If they understand that the issues they raise regarding efficiency and change of work practices should be dealt with in the benchmarking process, does the Department have a role in making the criteria more flexible given that the NIB was unable to make progress? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Court and the NIB have reached the view that the issue can be dealt with under the benchmarking process.  Nobody can predetermine the outcome but the Labour Court and the NIB tried to see if there was a helpful way of moving the discussion forward for three weeks and concluded that the only way to deal with this was within the benchmarking process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach saying that the nurses&rsquo; dispute may be resolved only within the benchmarking system?</P>
        <P>There are many big ticket items in the programme for Government that have not been achieved. However, there is one that was not in the programme but the Government seems hell-bent on achieving it, judging by the pressure being applied to professionals to sign off on contracts for the building of super private clinics on the grounds of public hospitals.  I understand the deadline of 16 April cannot be met but does the Government still intend, notwithstanding the opposition of so many of the Deputies behind the Taoiseach, to sign off on these contracts to build super private clinics on scarce public land?</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="2" />
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>For the past three weeks under the NIB, officials of my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the management of the Health Service Executive tried to resolve this issue.  A reduction to a 35-hour week, however, would represent a massive change in working arrangements, involving a reduction of 7.7 million nursing hours.  That cannot be undertaken lightly.  They endeavoured to find a way to do this on a cost-neutral basis.  To be fair to the nurses&rsquo; unions, they are open to doing that but they could not find a way to do so outside the benchmarking process.  They want a final date before they discuss how the change can be effected on a cost-neutral basis.  Those in negotiations on the management side rightly want to find out how this will be done and to work out a logical sequence.  Everyone knows it cannot be done in a short period.  It will take some time but we are prepared to make moves to start it.  That <Col N="16" />must be done first, otherwise everyone has to work out how to achieve it before the final date and that is not possible.</P>
        <P>The pay adjustment for nurses and midwives is not a major issue providing that is not treated as a relativity and does not have a knock-on effect for everybody.  Only 44 people are affected by the relativity and the nurses&rsquo; position is they want it extended to 40,000 people.  It is a little different trying to square that but the issue can still be resolved because if there is an anomaly, the pay increase should be confined to those who suffered the anomaly and it should not have a knock-on effect.  Progress can be made on that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government cannot award a 10.5% increase outside the agreement and thereby break the agreement and the entire procedure involving public service workers.  However, within the parameters of last week&rsquo;s discussions, working out the 35-hour week is a possibility.  That could not be agreed last week and we will continue reflecting on that issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Substantial progress has been made in preparing the legislation and it remains my intention to publish the Dublin transport authority Bill shortly.  The establishment of the authority will ensure the full and effective delivery of an integrated transport system in the greater Dublin area under Transport 21.  In anticipation of the publication of the legislation and to commence the process of putting the necessary organisational arrangements in place, I recently appointed Mr. Tom Mulcahy as chairman designate of the authority.  Pending the establishment of the authority on a statutory basis, I have asked Mr. Mulcahy, in his capacity <Col N="17" />as chairman designate, to give initial consideration to the management and organisational structure and to human resource and financial requirements of the proposed authority and to engage the key stakeholders and other interested parties as part of the preparatory process leading to the establishment of the authority and its early discharge of its statutory functions.</P>

	<P>This is probably the final question time with the Minister for Transport in this D&aacute;il; when we reached the final Question Time on transport in the previous D&aacute;il, we were also promised a Dublin transport authority but it has not been established.  The legislation has not been published and I do not know whether the Minister is even still promising to publish it before the end of this D&aacute;il.  It will not be passed and the authority, therefore, will not be established to deal with the significant issues facing Dublin such as the increasing incidence of gridlock and the failure of public transport providers and local authorities to work together as they continue to compete with one another.  It is little wonder a decision cannot be made on how to join the Luas lines or provide integrated ticketing.  There has been a complete failure to plan and co-ordinate the major infrastructure projects under way in Dublin.  The port tunnel is pouring traffic on to the M50, which is a building site that is about to worsen.  Absolutely nobody is driving all the decisions that need to be made urgently in the city.  Will the Minister explain how the Government has taken five years to fail to deliver on the one initiative that might effect some change in transport in Dublin?</P>
        <P>Will he also explain why he deliberately misled the public by promising 100 buses for the private sector?  A further 100 buses were to be delivered through the Dublin transport authority but that authority has not yet been set up.  The Minister did not mention that it could not be set up until he passed another Bill to reform the Road Transport Act 1999.  As everybody in the House knows, reform of that Act has been promised since it was first passed and it is as likely to happen as is draining the Shannon.</P>

	<P>It is ready but I am waiting for final consultations.  We continue to meet all the timelines for the delivery of all the different projects for Dublin under Transport 21.  I have consistently said that in the medium and long-term development of all transport in Dublin, including public transport, a body such as the Dublin transport authority is very important, but I want to make sure it is set up correctly.  The chairman designate is considering the management, organisational structure, human resources needs and financial requirements of the proposed authority and is engaged with all the key stakeholders, which is very important.</P>
        <P>We are making good progress on the delivery of transport services in Dublin and the Dublin transport authority will complement the process by playing a leading role.</P>

	<P>The Minister is talking gobbledegook.  He has promised this for five years and is still only talking about feeding views into the legislation.  His opportunities for legislation have passed.  The incidence of chaos and gridlock in the city is increasing and special interests, who do not want a Dublin transportation authority but to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, have won out because the Government has always put special interests above the public interest, which is why the necessary legislation has not been introduced.</P>

        <Quest> if he will ensure that the financial envelope for metro north is sufficient to allow the line to be kept underground through Ballymun and for an acceptable station design at DCU to ensure that the project does not negatively impact on local residents, local traffic movements and the local environment. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Transport 21 includes budget provision for the implementation of metro north from the city centre to Swords via Dublin Airport, to be completed by the end of 2012.  The Railway Procurement Agency completed a comprehensive and inclusive public consultation on route options for metro north last year and announced its selected route in October.</P>
        <P>Work is under way by the RPA on the complex task of designing the detailed route and the stations that will be served.  This includes engaging with stakeholders on the best design solution for Ballymun.  A surface station can be provided which is safe, accessible and avoids severance.  I also understand the RPA has met interested parties regarding the station design at DCU and that a programme to facilitate further consultation on their concerns has been arranged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister explain how he can propose a surface metro line through a large town such as Ballymun, which has been recently regenerated, without creating severance?  When I asked the same question of the Minister at the Joint Committee on Transport he did not seem to be aware that a surface design would entail high protective walls on either side. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not.  The Deputy has made that up, as usual.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a bit more in touch than the Minister with the details of what is proposed, having discussed the matter with the RPA on a number of occasions.  </P>
        <P>The Minister made a number of recent claims.  He said the Red Cow roundabout coped well, but this issue is completely different.  A new bridge was built at the Red Cow roundabout and grade separation took place, but in Ballymun the metro will be built on the surface with walls on either side.  Two lanes of traffic will be lost and the main traffic artery will be reduced to one lane.  That will be bad enough but with traffic feeding into Ballymun Road from east and west it simply cannot work.</P>
        <P>The Minister also referred to the modelling work that had been done, but that work has not been agreed with the traffic department of Dublin City Council or the regeneration company, and much of it seems to be pie in the sky.  What is the difference in cost between putting the Ballymun metro underground and putting it on the surface?  It seems to boil down to cost, but the surface option is not acceptable to residents living in Glasnevin and Ballymun.  We will not settle for a cheap metro solution when the Minister is prepared to spend millions of euro keeping the metro underground everywhere else.  Does the Minister accept the strongly held view of the public in that regard, in view of the hugely detrimental effect it will have on regeneration in Ballymun, local traffic movement and the local environment?</P><Col N="20" />
        <P>A cheap option also seems to be proposed for DCU station in the form of an open underground station running within feet of people&rsquo;s gable walls.  Is he prepared to ask the RPA to revisit that decision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>All the Deputy&rsquo;s assertions are utterly wrong.  No walls are to be built in Ballymun.  Metro systems throughout the world run on a part-underground and part-overground basis.  The Luas works exceptionally well in Dublin and there is absolutely no need for an underground line.  The Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion that walls are to be built on the main street in Ballymun is utter rubbish.   </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The RPA has shown diagrams of protective walls.  Is the Minister not aware of that? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It has no basis in fact.  The Deputy has highly politicised the situation in Ballymun.  If I lived there I would much prefer an on-street solution to the solution the Deputy proposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister seen the drawings?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is incorrect to say we are foisting cheap options on Ballymun while doing otherwise elsewhere.  The metro can and should be built.  We have agreed the route selection and that it should go through Ballymun.  The only issue raised with me at the outset was the proposal for the line to run on stilts.  That was unacceptable to people in Ballymun so it was reviewed and abandoned in favour of the streetscape design, of which I thought everybody was in favour. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody was in favour of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy now wants it to go underground.  The extra cost would be a minimum of &euro;250 million, just for the Ballymun section, which is a very significant amount.  The RPA has assured me that such a cost is unwarranted and that there is every possibility of reconfiguring traffic in Ballymun.  There will be no difficulty in so doing and it will have little or no effect on the metro&rsquo;s journey times from Swords to the city.  In any event, were the metro to run through an underground section, it would slow down substantially.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy is aware, the matter is still under consideration.  While I am aware of the views expressed, unfortunately, no rational arguments remain in this debate.  The argument is being presented in terms of other locations receiving something better than Ballymun.  It is most unfortunate that someone should present what will be a fantastic state-of-the-art facility in such terms.  Effectively, metro west will run over ground for its entire length.  I do not understand the Deputy&rsquo;s motivation in suggesting there is <Col N="21" />something different about the treatment of Ballymun as this is utterly incorrect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Metro north will be a Luas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Metro north will constitute a major investment.  I have seen metro systems operate worldwide and while some run overground and some run underground, others run partially overground and partially underground.  There is no prescriptive method for labelling one project as being different to another.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>With walls.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The fundamental difference between Luas and a metro is that capacity will be much greater on metro north.  Moreover, speeds will be far higher on the metro and the metro will be able to deliver far greater numbers of people than the Luas.  The RPA is engaged both at DCU and with the people of Ballymun on that basis.  I wish to see a resolution of this issue as quickly as possible in order that the project may proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is either badly briefed or is trying to mislead the House deliberately.  Is he aware the RPA is and has been for some time showing diagrams of the on-surface design with high protective walls?  Is he aware the RPA has cited a figure of between &euro;150 million and &euro;200 million as being the difference?  Why did the RPA engage in highly elaborate public consultation with four design options if the decision had been made already?  Was this simply a charade?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>At-grade running will not result in severance of the main street in Ballymun or in significantly longer or less reliable journey times.  Moreover, at-grade running will not mean greater congestion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>

        <Quest> the reason trains servicing the new Spencer Dock Station are terminating at Clonsilla in view of the significant demand that exists at stations further along the line at Maynooth, Leixlip Confey and Leixlip Louisa Bridge, the latter having recently had a parking facilities upgrade; the reason the double tracking of the Kildare line to Sallins and Newbridge was not included in Transport 21, in view of the considerable increase in service demand over recent years that is set to continue into the future; if the provision of commuter services to Kildare users will be placed on an equal footing with those provided to Dublin users, in view of the expansion of the Dublin commuter area in recent years; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[13140/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of improved rail services to commuters in Kildare is an integral part of the upgrading of rail services in the greater Dublin area and is one of the important elements of Transport 21.  The operation and timetabling of services is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  However, I have been informed by the company that the new and additional services operating between Clonsilla and docklands on the Maynooth line are designed both to provide additional services on the Clonsilla to docklands section to meet growing needs in that catchment area and to relieve pressure on the services serving beyond Clonsilla.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann considers that the services now operating on the Maynooth line, including the additional services between Clonsilla and docklands, represent the optimal use of the railway resources for the benefit of its passengers in Dublin and Kildare.  I understand from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that there are now 35 services each way per day serving between Maynooth, Connolly and Pearse stations, as well as 15 services each way per day, including four peak hour services, serving between Clonsilla and docklands stations.</P><Col N="23" />
        <P>As for the Kildare line, the priority at present is to complete the Kildare route upgrade project.  This project, which involves four-tracking a section of track between Cherry Orchard and Hazelhatch, will enable the separation of long distance and commuter services, thus reducing travel times and offering operational flexibility to increase the amount of services provided.  As part of that project, stations are to be upgraded and parking capacity increased.  I understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann intends to place contracts for the main construction work in April and June this year.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has advised me that the position regarding the four-tracking of the Kildare line beyond Hazelhatch will be reviewed when planning on the interconnector project is further advanced.  In the meantime, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has agreed with Kildare County Council to provide in the latter&rsquo;s development plan for future four-tracking, should demand warrant it.</P>
        <P>Kildare commuter services have already benefitted from major investment in recent years.  Capacity on the Kildare route has increased by 160% through the provision of turn-back facilities at Newbridge, the extension of platforms at Sallins and Hazelhatch and the introduction of new rolling stock as part of the increased investment in public transport under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.  Capacity on the Maynooth line has been more than trebled in the last five years due to the doubling of the track, resignalling and the upgrading of stations and crossings.</P>
        <P>Both lines have also benefited from investment in rolling stock such as the acquisition between 2002 and 2003 of 80 commuter railcars and the more recent entry into service in late 2005 of an additional 36 commuter railcars.  The introduction of a fleet of modern intercity railcars to be delivered in the period 2007 to 2009 will release commuter railcars currently being used on intercity routes such as Sligo to Dublin and Rosslare to Dublin for use on the Maynooth line, among others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>The additional trains are all both welcome and full.  When a major investment was made in Spencer Dock, the expectation was that this service would extend as far as Maynooth, as north County Kildare is regarded as being in the heart of the commuter belt.  However, the service will only operate from Clonsilla inwards although the capacity exists to go as far as Maynooth.  This would offer an alternative service for those who wish to travel to the financial services district instead of across the city.  At present I believe the preferred route for most users is still to travel across the city beyond Connolly Station.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann gave people in Maynooth and north County Kildare the impression that a new service would be on offer.  However, this is not <Col N="24" />the case and it is not sufficient to assert that this is an operational matter as a significant investment has been made in this regard.  Does the Minister agree that such a choice should be offered to the maximum number of people?  There was an expectation in this regard.  As my question noted, new parking has been provided in Leixlip at a substantial cost to the State.</P>
        <P>In respect of the Kildare route project, the irony is that little of it pertains to County Kildare as nearly all of it is located in west Dublin.  While a much better service will be offered from Hazelhatch Station inwards, a similar level of service will not be offered to rapidly expanding locations beyond Hazelhatch, such as Sallins or Naas.  It is expected that the service to such stations will be inferior to that at stations from Celbridge inwards.</P>
        <P>Something like a high-specification train service is required to offer people a real choice.  Were feasibility studies or costings carried out in respect of extending the Kildare route project as far as Newbridge?  Although this certainly constituted part of the original plans, obviously it was chopped due to funding limitations.  Even after the completion of Transport 21, Kilcock, which resembles a town under construction, will still have a single line running from it to Maynooth.  In the context of strategic planning &mdash; this will be delivered in ten years&rsquo; time &mdash; does the Minister agree that such locations should be factored in at present and that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann should be working to deliver them?  After all, the interconnector is not due to be delivered for another ten years or so.  There does not appear to be a long-term strategy.  This appears to be a reaction to what is there at present, rather than taking a long-term view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 15 new services now operate each day on the Maynooth-Connolly-Pearse line.  That is in addition to the 30 original services operating on that line.  Services have increased by over 60% in the past few years on that line.  The investment in the budget this year in public transport is over &euro;777 million.  The investment cannot all be made in just one area.  However, the investment in that route has been substantial.  The new Docklands Station has opened, which is a tremendous benefit not only for Dublin, but in terms of accessibility to Dublin.  It serves Clonsilla, Coolmine, Castleknock, Ashtown and Broombridge stations.  It is a significant addition in terms of capacity and stopping range that is being provided for customers by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>There have been discussions between Kildare County Council and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the development plan being prepared makes provision for future four tracking should demand warrant it.  The important issue now, however, is to complete the projects that are outlined.  The Kildare route project is under way.  That project is important for the Deputy&rsquo;s constituents but it <Col N="25" />is equally important for the overall reconfiguration and integration of public transport and the different modes of transport that will be provided under Transport 21.  Most of those projects are under way or at some level of development at this point.  The investment in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency is hugely significant in the context of the overall budget for Transport 21.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said there is a service from Maynooth to the Docklands Station but the service is only from Clonsilla.  There is no service from Maynooth to Docklands Station, unless one gets off the train at Clonsilla and waits for the train for Docklands.  That makes no sense.  Is the Minister aware that, according to the census figures published last week, Kildare is now the fourth most populated county in the country?  It is at the heart of the commuter belt.  Is the Minister aware of the level of usage of trains?  I accept that trains have been provided but at peak times the train is called the Calcutta express.  That is what it resembles.  There is a high level of use, which is welcome, but does the Minister not accept that it is wrong to provide a new station and not provide a service to that station from a location where there is a clear demand for it, particularly when there is the ability to do so?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The level of investment demonstrates that we recognise there is a huge issue in terms of the commuter belt and the growing population there.  The addition of the Docklands Station means there are an extra four trains at peak times, which cater for an extra 2,500 commuters.  That figure can be improved in the future to 10,000 extra commuters at peak times.  The expansion of the population in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency is the reason we are making this substantial investment.</P>
        <P>In fairness to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, it started the new railway station last year and completed it within a year.  That was a great achievement and demonstrates the company&rsquo;s commitment.  Furthermore, the Phoenix Park station will open towards the end of this year.  It will be an additional stop to benefit that route.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the capacity of Dublin Airport to cope with increasing passenger numbers at the airport, particularly during the peak summer months over the coming two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[13119/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand from the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, that the company will use slot co-ordination and operational planning to reduce congestion at Dublin Airport during the 2007 high season.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation announced its decision on 12 February last to designate Dublin Airport as a co-<Col N="26" />ordinated airport for the summer 2007 season and the DAA is confident that this will help reduce congestion during peak hours.  Under this process, an independent co-ordinator will allocate take-off and landing slots at the airport, up to but not exceeding the agreed operating capacity limits.  In common with other co-ordinated airports, airlines will have no discretion and must accede to the slots allocated by the independent co-ordinator.</P>
        <P>In addition, the company has informed me of a number of capacity enhancement projects that are planned for the 2007 summer season.  These include the opening of a new check-in area &mdash; area 14 &mdash; to provide an additional 25 check-in desks, while the arrivals roadway is being altered to facilitate additional passenger access to this area; additional security points at the security search area to increase the processing capability; additional customer service staff will be provided; and a new coach park has been built providing direct access to the arrivals and departures areas by way of a travelator.</P>
        <P>In addition, pier D is currently under construction and it is hoped to have this completed by the end of this year.  This will provide a net additional ten aircraft parking stands at the airport.  Planning permission is also being sought for a new extension to terminal 1.  This extension is scheduled to be completed in autumn 2008 but will be delivered on a phased basis, with the first element due for use in spring 2008.  The 7,750 sq. m extension will be located at the north-western corner of terminal 1 and will expand the existing terminal at the departures, arrivals and mezzanine levels.</P>
        <P>For more long-term capacity enhancements, the DAA has embarked under its capital investment programme on the development of terminal 2 and the associated pier facilities to be constructed close to the existing terminal.  Fingal County Council granted planning permission for the project in October 2006 and this is now under appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am assured that the DAA is working to the Government deadline to have the terminal operational by 2009.  Finally, the DAA is at the planning stages for the construction of a second parallel runway which will provide for significant additional capacity at the airport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that the DAA is doing its best, in the difficult circumstances in which it finds itself, to maximise the use of what space is available at the airport.  I welcome the move to slot co-ordination.  However, on its own admission the DAA has accepted that it does not have any room for the expansion of services in Dublin Airport, despite the demand for increased services.  The implementation of the open skies agreement is imminent.  The potential of that agreement cannot be realised as a result of the lack of capacity at the airport.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about new facilities being launched at the airport.  However, that is reorgan<Col N="27" />ised space, not new space.  The tent the airport was seeking 18 months ago is still not in place.  The terminal has not been begun and planning permission for it has not been secured.  There is a long lead-in time for all aviation projects and the tardy decision on this means we are badly handicapped in terms of providing services.  The airport does not have sufficient apron, security, immigration or cargo space, not to mention terminals for the passengers.  There are insufficient stands.  Next year, the situation will be worse.</P>
        <P>The Minister said pier D will provide ten extra places.  In fact, many of the existing places, and more than the ten extra being provided, will be gone next year if the work on the terminal goes ahead, which we hope it will.  The situation next year will be worse than it was last year.  Will the Minister explain why the Government failed to make any decisions on aviation until it was too late?  Dublin Port is out of capacity and no decision has been made on its future.  Dublin Airport is out of capacity and, again, no decisions were made for the future.  Will the Minister explain why this was allowed to happen during his term in office?  Ireland has been virtually turned into a blockaded island in terms of its competitiveness, its ability to attract new tourists and even its ability to give choice to passengers.  We are stuck with two airlines that are hardly competing with each other but no other additional airlines can come into the country.  Our trade, competitiveness and passengers are being disadvantaged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with the Deputy.  With regard to area 14, the DAA invested &euro;15 million to transform what was a basement storage area into a new, modern check-in zone.  It was never used as that previously.  It will accommodate 25 check-in desks and eight new ticket sales desks, and it will be capable of handling up to 4 million passengers per annum.  This is significant additional capacity.</P>

	<P>I was appointed to this Ministry at the end of 2004.  I have taken all the decisions on aviation and with regard to Dublin Airport.  We launched the plan for the development of the airport.  The Deputy could help me by talking to the people who are lodging objection after objection and trying to delay, stop and impede the development&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="28" />
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government knew that was going to happen.  Why did it not make an early decision?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Regardless of whether the Deputy likes it, we live in a democracy and there are processes and people are entitled to object to particular developments.  Unfortunately, many people have objected and that is causing us difficulty in terms of the delivery.  I congratulate the management and staff of the Dublin Airport Authority because, as the Deputy rightly noted, they are coping with an extraordinary increase in passenger numbers at Dublin Airport.  They did so last summer with a substantial increase and, in the public&rsquo;s perception, managed it extremely well, notwithstanding the difficulties.  </P>
        <P>I have outlined the new facilities being put in place for this year&rsquo;s summer season.  The Dublin Airport Authority has done everything humanly possible to meet the demands of all the different customers, received planning permission from the local authority and is tied up with An Bord Plean&aacute;la with regard to getting a final decision.  I hope we get a decision on terminal two as quickly as possible because that will be delivered by 2009.  That, with the developments in place between now and 2009 which have realistic, albeit tight, timeframes, will transform the ability of Dublin Airport to deal with its passengers.  We will then have a capacity of well in excess of 30 million passengers at Dublin Airport, where we are currently serving approximately 22 million.  In fairness to the authority, the decisions are made, the plans have been drawn up, planning permission has been approved and the matter is with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  All the ancillary developments, be it pier D or opening up the new area 14 to cater for 4 million passengers this year, will be in place this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the point made by the Minister about the long lead-in time of aviation decisions before they appear on the ground, what measures have been taken to progress terminal three, which is the competing terminal?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am currently focusing on terminal two, which is the immediate priority.  I know the company has had discussions with some of the land holders at Dublin Airport.  It is looking at the configuration and reconfiguration of the airport and the possibilities beyond the immediate delivery of terminal two in less than two years&rsquo; time.  Although I have seen no plans, I am aware that discussions have taken place with different property owners and developers within the land-bank that would be contiguous or part of the Dublin Airport Authority development to prepare for terminal three to be put in place.  </P>

        <askee>Minister for Trans<Col N="29" />port</askee>
        <Quest> the reason for the delay in publishing a new road safety strategy; when he expects it to be published; and the items from the new road safety strategy he will incorporate into and have passed as part of the Roads Bill 2007. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12974/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is responsible for developing a new road safety strategy for the period from 2007 to 2011.  It went to public consultation in October last year and I understand a substantial number of suggestions and proposals have been received as a result of this process.  The RSA also engaged in a process of direct consultation with key stakeholders in December 2006.  I welcome the fact that a large volume of submissions were received and that the authority has been working its way through these submissions prior to finalising the new strategy.  </P>
        <P>It is only on receipt and examination of the new strategy that any new legislative requirements can be identified.  In the meantime, I am anxious that the Roads Bill 2007, which is necessary to underpin the barrier-free tolling planned for the M50, is enacted before the dissolution of the D&aacute;il.  When I receive the new road safety strategy, I will submit it to the Government for approval as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
        <P>The Road Traffic Act 2006 has been enacted and a number of key measures commenced.  These include the provision to combat drink driving through enabling roadside mandatory alcohol testing and a ban on the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving.  It should be noted that the number of road deaths in 2006 was the second lowest in 40 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It beggars belief that at a time when there is so much concern about road safety, we do not have a road safety strategy.  The last strategy related to 2004-06 and effectively ran out last December.  We have entered the second quarter of the year.  Where is the road safety strategy?</P>
        <P>The last time the Minister was asked about this, he said he expected to receive the new strategy in March and that he would consult his Government colleagues.  Has he received that draft from the RSA and, if not, why not?  At this point in the year, 92 people have lost their lives on Irish roads.  Last weekend was particularly bad.  We cannot afford to wait around and take our eye off the ball in respect of road safety, which is what seems to have happened, given that it is now April and there is still no sign of a road safety strategy.</P>
        <P>Last year, when we debated the Road Traffic Bill, Deputies on this side of the House made a number of suggestions in respect of improved road safety.  The Minister undertook at the time to take all these on board and consider them.  He promised that a new road traffic Bill would appear by December last, but that has not appeared either.  We have a roads Bill which is <Col N="30" />primarily about open road tolling, but we do not have a road traffic Bill, as promised by the Minister.</P>
        <P>What is going wrong within the Minister&rsquo;s Department?  Why is it that by April we still do not have a road safety strategy for the current year?  Why, given that the Minister made promises last year in respect of new measures, are there no plans to legislate for them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Deputy has said is extraordinary.  First, I wish to put on record that I have enormous respect for the chairman, the chief executive and the board of the RSA, which has carried out an incredible amount of work since it was put in place.  Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s view is that I should ignore it or beat it up to deliver something she wants simply because she wants something to talk about.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody wants a road safety strategy.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am far more interested in the quality of the work being carried out by the RSA.  My view, although it may not be the view of Deputy Shortall, is that part of the qualitative process is to have very extensive public consultation with all the key stakeholders.  That was the right&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister told us that before and that we would have the strategy.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should at least show me some respect and allow me to answer the question.  A face-to-face public consultation process, which I attended, took place in December.  I will not say that the RSA has been snowed under with submissions, but it has received very substantial submissions, all of which are very good.  There is no point in producing something for the sake of it, and that is not what the people in the RSA are doing.  These people are hugely committed to ensuring that we continue the downward trend to become one of the best countries in the world when it comes to road safety.  That is an enormous task.  The authority has been working on this for only three months.  We are through three months of this year and I am prepared to give the RSA the time for the mandate it has been given by the Oireachtas under the legislation that set it up.  The type of legislation, including primary legislation, we will need and the issues that must be regulated will flow from that. </P>
        <P>What is happening at the moment is the core elements of it.  We have strong law and enforcement in place.  Random breath testing has a huge impact in the public domain, with 30,000 tests being carried out each month.  I, with the Deputy and everybody else in this House, have enormous sympathy for the families that faced tragedy on our roads.  Unfortunately, as we all know, much <Col N="31" />of it comes back to driver behaviour.  While we will put strategies in place, I do not want to argue that a strategy <i>per se</i>  will solve everything.  We need to change driver behaviour and attitudes on our roads.  That is central to why other countries are so much better than us.  It is because it is anathema in societies in other countries to drink and drive, to wantonly speed and do the things that some people believe they can do on the roads, which we have all seen on our television screens.  It is utterly unacceptable.  We must ensure that, in conjunction with legislation and policy, we bring about the culture change needed.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The RSA knows full well that the Deputy and all those in this and the other House are anxiously awaiting the road safety strategy, but it has told me that it wants the time to get it absolutely right.  Nothing has come to me at this stage so it is not as if, as the Deputy seems to imply, I have been sitting on a draft in my Department.  I respect the work being carried out by the RSA and believe the strategy will be a formidable document when it arrives.  As soon as it arrives, I will go to the Government with it and any legislation that arises will be brought before the House.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that there has been significant slippage at political level regarding road safety?  I was not putting words in the Minister&rsquo;s mouth.  He told us in February that he expected to get the road safety strategy in March, but we have not received that yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is correct.  I explained to the Deputy why I have not got it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister was fully committed to doing that, he would ensure we had a current road safety strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>So the Deputy has no respect for the Road Safety Authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>We are now into the fourth month of the year but we do not have a current road safety strategy, which sends out a very negative message about the Minister not taking the responsibility to ensure we have a current road safety strategy.  It sends out the message that there is no political interest in this.  From the messages he has been getting from the European Council about road safety, he knows he and the Government must give priority to this key area.  However, we are in the second quarter of the year without a road safety strategy, and that is the responsibility of the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is highly regrettable that Deputy Shortall, representing the Labour Party view, wants to politicise this issue in the way she has presented it to the House.</P>

	<P>We have a well respected road safety authority which is exceptionally well led.  It is committed from top to bottom to what it is doing.  I have explained to the Deputy what the Road Safety Authority has been doing in preparing for a new road safety strategy.  It has received substantial observations and submissions on what should be in the strategy.  It is painstakingly going through all of those issues and is benchmarking those issues internationally to see what has worked in other countries.  It will present the strategy in a co-ordinated, cohesive way that will stand up to scrutiny and deliver an impact on improving road safety standards.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 117 together.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and funding for the national roads programme element of Transport 21.  The implementation of individual national road projects, such as the proposed eastern bypass route and the Dublin outer orbital route, would be a matter for the National Roads Authority and the local authorities concerned, under the relevant sections of the Roads Act 1993.  At the launch of Transport 21, I indicated that a feasibility study would be undertaken on both of these routes.  Neither project is included in the Transport 21 financial envelope.  The NRA is currently pursuing this work.  I expect to have the study on the Dublin outer orbital shortly and I intend to advise my Cabinet colleagues on its outcome.</P>
        <P>The NRA has engaged consulting engineers to undertake an engineering and feasibility study into the eastern bypass.  This study will examine possible route options, prepare forecasts of traffic demand and report on scheme costs for the var<Col N="33" />ious options examined.  The study is expected to be completed later this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The reservation of some of this road runs through my constituency and it has had a road reservation for as long as I can remember.  It was taken off the pitch entirely when the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto prior to 1997 stated it would never happen.  After its re-election in 2002, it went back on the list for a feasibility study and this has been ongoing for five years.  Is there any prospect of getting an answer to the question on whether it is feasible?  Is the Government contemplating it?  Is the road reservation to be kept indefinitely?  Is it the Minister&rsquo;s intention to speak to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about the new flood barrier that is proposed for the mouth of the River Liffey?  Is the potential for a road on top of this barrier being examined?</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the feasibility study for the outer orbital.  Am I to infer that it is either the outer orbital or the eastern bypass?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the connection between the two?  Are they being considered as alternative projects?</P>
        <P>In any post-construction assessment of the port tunnel, will value for money and the efficacy of the tunnel be taken into account, given that it went ahead after the decision was made to drop the eastern bypass before the 1997 election?  Its efficacy was diminished following that decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Both projects are under feasibility studies.  Some people have suggested the outer orbital is another road outside the M50, but that is not the case.  It is a different route which provides extra capacity for drivers who wish to avoid Dublin.  The study is almost complete on the outer orbital and is slightly ahead of the feasibility study on the eastern bypass.  Although I have not seen it and I am guessing slightly, it will cut across from south of Drogheda and link up with all the other motorways.</P>
        <P>There is substantial engineering involved in the feasibility study of the eastern bypass.  All of these roads are measured against all the other modes of transport available in Transport 21 to see how we can get maximum value out of those projects.  Both are exciting projects.</P>
        <P>The port tunnel is working exceptionally well and will prove to be one of the most sensible and significant projects ever undertaken.  Whether the eastern bypass is built or not, the tunnel has provided much relief to the streets of Dublin following the reconfiguration of traffic due to the cordon put in place.  However, I will not prejudge the operation, unlike the two Deputies who prejudge everything.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Transport 21 provides a very large funding commitment for the delivery of an extensive rail-based public transport network in the greater Dublin area in the period up to 2015.  This network is based on the Dublin Transportation Office strategy, A Platform for Change.  It also includes funding for feasibility studies on those elements of the strategy which are not included in Transport 21, such as the proposed Luas line from the city centre to Dundrum via Rathfarnham and Terenure.  On 30 January 2007, I announced that the RPA is to begin work on the Rathfarnham feasibility study in April.</P>
        <P>As I live in Rathfarnham, I recently received Deputy Ryan&rsquo;s brochure in my door.  I was astonished to see the lack of integrity in it.  He suggested that I put out the feasibility study in response to his comments.  However, my speech to launch Transport 21 included mention of the <Col N="35" />feasibility study, which was initiated more than two years before Deputy Eamon Ryan thought of it.  I was surprised to discover what the Deputy included in the document he recently circulated to constituents in Rathfarnham.  I live there during the week but my vote remains in my own constituency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it as a compliment that the Minister reads my newsletter.  Likewise, I took it as a compliment that he announced a feasibility study a week after my party announced its intention to undertake this project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to examine my leaflet carefully.  The route it proposes would be hugely successful in connecting the north and south sides of the city.  I hope the next Government will be of a different hue.  However, if the current Government decides to build the Rathfarnham Luas line, where will the funding come from given the &euro;34 billion envelope set out by the Department of Finance?  How will the Minister obtain the funding for a project such as this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy knows, the Luas extensions are largely being funded by developers in the areas in question.  Significant resources are coming from the private sector and there is the possibility of public private partnerships.  There are many ways of undertaking these developments.  The feasibility study in respect of the proposed Luas line to Terenure and Rathfarnham through Harold&rsquo;s Cross is one of only three feasibility studies included in Transport 21, the others being those relating to the orbital route and the eastern bypass.  I will make no decisions on this route until that study is submitted to the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The route proposed by the Green Party, as set out in my constituency leaflet, envisages a connection from Dundrum through Churchtown, Nutgrove, Rathfarnham, Terenure and Harold&rsquo;s Cross before crossing the city centre at Christ Church to link up with the old Broadstone line and continue to Finglas and beyond.  Does the Minister agree this route makes sense?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is aware that the RPA is already engaged in consultations on this project.  I am not prepared to endorse  the route proposed by the Deputy, nor will I put forward my personal views.  I am not an engineer or an expert <Col N="36" />on urban landscapes and how these projects are managed.  It will be difficult to build into an older confined space that is already developed.</P>
        <P>I detect a common thread in our discussions of late and it has been building to a crescendo among the parties opposite.  It reminds me of Jimmy Saville&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jim&rsquo;ll Fix It&rdquo; television programme many years ago.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The current dispute involving work to rule by 40,000 nurses is an example of the Government&rsquo;s failure creatively to pre-empt a crisis that threatens the delivery of fundamental quality health services in the State.  As a consequence, it fails patients, taxpayers and front-line workers.  It is more than three years since I proposed that the benchmarking process was not capable of dealing with all of the areas and sectors it was required to deal with so that transparency, clear services and improvements for the public could be brought about in return for these rewards.</P>
        <P>The Government has rejected all challenges to reform what is a flawed benchmarking process.  With a work to rule involving 40,000 nurses, we now have a situation where nobody &mdash; nurses, patients or the public &mdash; benefits as a consequence.  In reminding the Taoiseach and the Government that nurses have signalled their willingness to change work practices and introduce efficiencies and have indicated their willingness not to be seen as obstructionist in this matter, I suggest that the unwillingness of the Government to consider changes to the criteria and flexibility <Col N="38" />of the benchmarking process has brought about this impasse where everybody is suffering.  The Government has known this for some time.  My party and other organisations have made the point that benchmarking does not suit every situation and should be altered to cater for discussion and negotiation of legitimate claims.</P>
        <P>Is the Taoiseach prepared to say that the current work to rule is a consequence of a flawed benchmarking process?  Furthermore, is he prepared to say on behalf of the Government that a willingness to reform that process might have avoided this dispute?</P>
        <P>Is he prepared to apologise on behalf of the Government to taxpayers, patients and nurses for standing over a system that is inherently flawed and incapable of what it was set up to do in the first place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will try to explain the issue briefly.  The current dispute has nothing to do with the benchmarking process whatever.  Effectively, the dispute is about two issues, namely the agreement on a 35-hour week from an early date and the elimination of a pay anomaly as a result of a series of pay adjustments for nurses and midwives who are paid less that assistant house parents despite having higher professional qualifications and responsibility, including responsibility for assistant house parents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Labour Court examined the issues in dispute and said the best way of dealing with them was through the benchmarking process.  The nurses unions, the INO and the PNA, have given consideration to those issues.  On the reduced hours, the management side&rsquo;s position is that a timeframe for a reduction in the hours could not be set without first carrying out a detailed risk assessment which would have to include the involvement of the relevant stakeholders.  Management has no objection in principle to reduced hours but cannot give a definitive commitment as to the pace and the scale of reduction without more careful consideration.  I have said many times that I acknowledge that the nurses unions are prepared to try to make this cost neutral but the management side or the Government, and the taxpayer, cannot go into that unless the work is done.  The Government management side would say let us do the work and see if this can be cost neutral but the union side asked when it would be completed and said they would then enter into it.  A reduction to a 35-hour working week effectively means about 30 extra days off for each of the individual 40,000 nurses, which would represent a massive change in working arrangements.  It might be possible &mdash; I am not saying it is not possible &mdash; but the work needs to be done on it.  Some work has been done on it but not a lot.  It involves a reduction of 7.7 million nursing hours so it cannot be undertaken lightly.  It has nothing to do with benchmarking.</P>
        <P>While the pay anomaly should be a simpler issue the management side is prepared to regrade <Col N="39" />the particular nursing personnel who have responsibility for supervising staff with salaries in excess of the staff nurse scale.  They contend, however, that the more general issue of the appropriate rate for the staff nurse grade is a matter for the benchmarking body.  If that is the case there are 44 or 45 people involved.  The argument of the nurse leaders is that anomaly should be reflected for all 40,000 nurses.  It is either an anomaly for the nurses midwives grade but it is certainly not an anomaly for 40,000 nurses.</P>
        <P>In regard to what is on offer on the nurses side in respect of the reduced working hours, the management position in line with the recommendation of the Labour Court is that it is prepared to address the changes in the organisation, the management and the delivery of health care which it could facilitate and a reduction in the standard working hours for nurses and midwives.  That can be negotiated through the benchmarking body or wherever.  The issue is not where it should be done, it can be done anywhere.  Last week the NIB was trying to find a basis on which to move it on.  We are trying to find a basis were it could move it on.  We are still prepared to try it or any other mechanism, it does not have to be done through the benchmarking process.</P>
        <P>On the issue of the pay anomaly the Labour Court said that issue should be dealt with through benchmarking.  The management side is prepared to regrade the particular nursing personnel who have responsibility in excess of the nurse grade so as to remove the particular anomaly.  On the more general point of a 10.6% increase for all nurses, this is a matter for the benchmarking body.  It is due to start to report later this year.  Other nursing trade unions have already made submissions in this regard.  I should point out that the 10.6% pay claim is in addition to the 10% currently available in return for signing up to Towards 2016.  The last point, one I made earlier to Deputy Kenny, is that the terms of reference and the criteria for the next benchmarking round have already been agreed with the unions, including SIPTU which has a large number of nurses unions.  It is not an inflexible system, it is one that has already been negotiated with the trade unions and everyone knows the rules of the process.</P>

	<P>The time available to the Taoiseach has expired.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply, I remind him of the terms of the letter of 9 March 2007 which he sent to the Irish Nurses Organisation indicating that the Government representatives and the Minister for Health and Children would involve themselves in the intensive discussion process and would be as open and creative as possible in achieving outcomes for the benefit of nurses and patients alike.  What was the political mandate given to the NIB in those discussions?  It appears, and I do not have access to <Col N="40" />all the information, as if the creativeness and openness was coming from only one side.  Will the Taoiseach indicate one or two examples of the openness and the creativity that was coming with the political imperative, through the NIB, to achieve the reductions of which he speaks?  In other words, there was a three week process of intensive discussions.  In his letter the Taoiseach indicated that the Minister for Health and Children and the NIB would be open and creative in the way in which it went about this.  Can he give examples of that openness and creativity, against the background of a dispute which nobody wants to escalate and which, as I said during questions to the Taoiseach, does not help patient, nurse or taxpayer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is a very fair question.  I will try to keep the issues simple and to the point.  Agreement on a 35-hour working week at an early date is what the nurses are seeking.  Management is prepared to concede that in principle and to start the first round at a relatively early date.  That was discussed at the negotiations but I do not want to breach on something where they had their own walls around the discussions.  That was the first issue.  They agreed to work intensely to see how on a cost neutral basis this will work out given the loss of 7.7 million hours.  That work cannot be done in a week or two, it will take some more time.  In fairness to the nurses side, they say they are prepared to engage in that work but want a definite date on completion before they start the process.  That is the obvious difficulty.  That is creative enough if they agree to do the work.  If one agrees to the 35-hour working week, the process will take a few years because every nurse will lose about 30 days per year.</P>
        <P>The second issue was the pay anomaly.  The management side does not have a difficulty with addressing the pay anomaly for those who suffer the anomaly.  That issue was raised in the discussions and should be cleared up.  The third issue is that Towards 2016 provides for a 10% increase for nurses.  If they sign up to it they are entitled to that 10% increase.  We should not forget they are entitled to that increase.  The fourth issue is what I think is the impossible one.  I do not see this as an imaginative issue.  The Labour Court has looked at this at length.  The NIB looked at it for three weeks at length.  One cannot roll on the anomalous grade of 40 to 45 people and give that to everyone to solve an anomaly and give a 10.6% increase to everybody.  Given that an agreement is in place under Towards 2016 it is impossible for a Government to give it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be claimed straight away by the entire 320,000 public servants who have signed up to the agreement.  That end of the argument must go into the benchmarking process.  The other two or three are possibilities, although I do not know whether that has to continue in NIB or some other one.  That aspect of it, however, must go into the benchmarking process because that is what everybody else it in.  It is not a question of being difficult with the nurses, but one cannot take any element out of that as it is just not possible to do so, and certainly not for a group with 40,000 members.</P>

	<P>I know how important the meeting with Dr. Paisley and Mr. Adams is in the morning, although it is regrettable it was not possible to schedule it around Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  I will make one last attempt to ask the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, whether he will cause these contracts to be signed to build super, private clinics on the campuses of public hospitals.  I have been getting a volume of letters and e-mails on this issue.  I suspect the Taoiseach has also been receiving such correspondence, as have his backbenchers, given that they are so disquieted about this.  It shows the depth of concern among health professionals and the public about the new drift of Government policy.  I will read a paragraph from one consultant, which fairly much reflects feelings on this matter.  Talking about the private capacity, he states:</P>
        <P LI="1">They have a real potential to run down the public system and can reduce it to providing core services such as complex medical problems and providing care to acutely ill patients who cannot be catered for in any private system.  So the profitable areas will be creamed off to be done in the private system.  In addition to that, they have a disastrous effect on medical training.  In short, I agree they will not solve any of the current problems.  At present, what is happening in our acute hospitals is nothing short of a national crisis.  The A&amp;E departments are not able to cope and figures that are trotted out by the HSE are very dubious.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad I had finished the quote then.  That quotation is fairly representative of the view of health professionals in nursing and other white collar professional grades, consult<Col N="42" />ants and doctors.  Last week I quoted for the Taoiseach the statement on behalf of accident and emergency consultants who said that not only would we have a two-tier health system but we would also have a two-tier casualty system.  The Taoiseach tore up his own health strategy to provide 3,000 beds in favour of this new shift towards for-profit medicine.  The Irish people do not want an American for-profit health model.  They know that we badly need the land concerned to provide community care and step-down beds to take people who are inappropriately occupying beds in acute hospitals out of the hospitals, thus putting them into that kind of care and freeing up beds in the acute hospitals.  The Taoiseach is going in the opposite direction, however.  Everybody is counselling him against it, including his backbenchers who are excessively glum about this, and properly so.  As this is likely to be the Taoiseach&rsquo;s last time on Leaders&rsquo; Questions, will he permit that, as Head of Government, to satisfy a crazy Progressive Democrats ideology?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s first question, I understand that 90% of the documentation to enable bidders to tender has gone out to the individuals.  The formal quest for tender is on the HSE board&rsquo;s agenda for Friday week, 13 April.  The formal bid for tender would not issue until after that meeting, so that is the formal position. </P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy that acute hospitals have their difficulties, in spite of the enormous amount of resources, staff, equipment and capital they have received.  Part of the solution is to contract nursing home beds in the private and public sectors, and building step-down facilities, which is happening in parts of the country.  In other areas, such facilities are required.  I do not believe this initiative cuts across that.  The aim of the initiative is to transfer private activity from within the public hospital system to new privately-financed and managed hospitals, thereby freeing up 1,000 additional beds for public patients.  The new facilities will have to meet specific requirements, for example, the ability to admit private patients 24 hours a day, seven days a week from public hospitals, accident and emergency departments and GPs, with the capacity to treat all patients currently catered for in the public hospital system through joint clinical governance.  I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point that people have written to him about that, but they are not talking about what the HSE is proposing.  The HSE has made its position absolutely clear on the accident and emergency departments, GP and 24-hour issues.  People may have a point, but it is not what the HSE has said.</P>
        <P>Obviously, the HSE will make its own decision at that board meeting but my understanding is that it has reduced the number.  The executive is looking at the following hospitals: Limerick, Waterford, Cork, St. James&rsquo;s, Beaumont, Connolly &mdash; which is Blanchardstown &mdash; Tallaght <Col N="43" />and Sligo.  There will be a rigorous financial assessment of the proposals, which are subject to planning, including the value of the public site and the cost of any tax expenditure foregone.  As I said previously, the lease of public land will be on a commercial basis, it will fully protect the public interest and there will be full adherence to public procurement law and best practice.  That is where the negotiations currently are and the next move will be on Friday week at the HSE board meeting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach saying that 90% of the bidding documents have issued and that they will be back by the time the HSE board meets on Friday week?  Does he expect a decision to be made on Friday week?  What is the process after that?  What is the duration of the lease in question?  How does it materially matter if a building is physically constructed for the next 99 years on this scarce public land?  How can the Taoiseach say that professionals in the service do not know what the HSE has in mind?  They include people who work at the coalface, consultants, those who have arguably money to gain from working in the private sector and who argue that the migration of personnel will make the public health service worse.  They say it will damage the two-tier divide in our service, creating a new two-tier divide in accident and emergency units.  </P>

	<P Just="Left">How can it be argued that these people do not know what they are talking about?  It is not a HSE initiative.  As recently as 29 March this year, the Minister for Health and Children made a statement in the House and Government backbenchers should read up on it.  They cannot go around the doorsteps whispering that this is a Harney-McDowell frolic.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, stated, &ldquo;In July 2005, following Government approval, I issued a policy direction to the Health Service Executive to develop co-located private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals&rdquo;.</P>

        <P>I wish to reiterate two points I have made on many occasions.  I have seen letters on the argument relating to accident and emergency services.  The new facilities will have to meet specific requirements including the ability to admit private patients 24 hours a day, seven days a week from the public hospital, from the accident and emergency department and from general practitioners, and they will have to have the capacity to treat all patients currently catered for in the public hospital and through joint governance.

	<P>The accident and emergency consultants&rsquo; point does not hold up in this regard.  This is what currently happens in co-located hospitals and there are no accident and emergency services in these hospitals at present.  This has worked in many hospitals, such as the Mater Hospital, St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital and in Cork, for many years.  The aim of the initiative, to transfer private activity from the public hospital system to privately financed and managed hospitals and free up 1,000 beds, has not changed.  As I said here recently when discussing infrastructural issues, the private sector will build this more quickly, by a matter of years, than the public sector, depending on the contract the HSE presents based on technical legal advice.  The length of time involved in getting from A to B on building matters through public procurement contracts is too great.</P>

        <P>In spite of the dishonesty already evident in this plan, that there is no costing for compact fluorescent lamp, CFL, light bulb plans and no timeframes that one might expect, the Taoiseach importantly said there will be a reduction of 20% below 1990 levels by 2020, based on the EU agreement.  I take the Taoiseach at his word on this and presume he knows the implications.  In 2005, the latest figures available, we were emitting 70 million tonnes and a level 20% below 1990 levels would allow us emit a maximum of 44.8 tonnes.  This requires a reduction of more than 25 million tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>, or a third of the current level.</P>
        <P>If the Taoiseach thinks the Northern peace process was difficult, changing to a post-oil economy is of a far greater magnitude.  Carbon trading will not be affordable; the Taoiseach has provided &euro;270 million for this purpose but, according to experts on renewable energy, the actual cost will be &euro;1.5 billion by 2020.  Will the Taoiseach create legislation that will require us to reduce carbon emissions each year by, say 3%, on the previous year?  Will the Taoiseach indicate when this will be done or how will he arrive at the 20% cut he has said will happen?</P>

	<P>I will not go through the entire document as Deputy Sargent is reading it but it sets out in a detailed way the comprehensive measures we have put in place to enable us to meet the target set under the Kyoto Protocol.  All of the preparatory work in this respect sought to set out how this could be achieved.  The national climate change strategy requires co-ordination throughout the Government because without this it will not be possible to meet the commitments made under the Kyoto Protocol.  The strategy builds on progress already made through the original national climate change strategy of seven years ago.</P>

	<P>The strategy addresses measures across all sectors of the economy and encompasses energy, agriculture, transport, the residential sector and the commercial sector.  It includes measures that have been enacted through the national development plan, Transport 21, the White Paper on energy and the bio-energy action plan, in addition to a series of measures to put Ireland on a path to a low carbon economy.</P>

	<P>The strategy is a fiction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the recent agreements of EU leaders to reduce emissions to at least 20% below the 1990 levels by 2020, the strategy looks beyond Kyoto.  Deputy Sargent is right that this is a challenging task and we must take a longer term view.  This was done, particularly in relation to renewable energy targets and investment in public transport to ensure the country is better positioned to meet the challenge of more ambitious targets in the post-2012 period.  The strategy across all the areas is set out in detail.</P>
        <P>On the flexible mechanisms under which developed countries will support the development of clean technology in the developing world in return for emissions, as Deputy Sargent said, we have allocated &euro;270 million in the national development plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;for investment in such projects over the lifetime of the strategy.  In all of the other areas we have spelt out what are the targets and what action is needed to deal with them.  If this is not in one document, it is taken collectively in the four documents I have mentioned.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is the personification of a flexible mechanism but we need firm mechanisms.  He is correct that we face a challenge.  Why was he not present at the launch of the document, given the serious repercussions it has for the country?  He sent along his royal smugness, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who does not carry the weight the strategy deserves.  As this is a cross-departmental matter, the Taoiseach should have been present at the launch to let it be known that it would affect every Department.  He had no problem leading from the front on the second referendum on the Nice treaty.  I challenge the view that it does not have the same importance.  Unless we achieve annual reductions in carbon emissions of 3%, we will not achieve the objective.  The strategy does not have a commitment to a targeted annual reduction.  The Green Party has worked out that, under this plan, the total reduction in emissions after four years will be 3%.  That is not up to the mark. </P>
        <P>The business as usual approach proposed by the Government will have a cost.  For example, carbon trading will cost far more than the figure of &euro;270 million cited by the Taoiseach.  It will also <Col N="48" />have a cost in terms of flooding and it is having an enormous cost in terms of water contamination in Galway.  The poor will be hit hardest internationally, resulting in increased immigration as many people ask why they should not come here given that Ireland will not be as badly affected by climate change as their home countries.</P>
        <P>Britain has introduced a carbon budget system under which it will be able to measure its achievements annually, while Governor Schwarzenegger in California has established a strategy in law.  Rather than dealing in fiction by engaging in spin in advance of an election, will the Taoiseach not accept best international advice and establish a climate change targets Bill?  I ask him to use the Bill published by the Green Party as a template.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will look at all proposals.  The proposals made yesterday include a mechanism to check annually that we are delivering.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be to check that emissions are increasing every year. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Deputy Sargent will see this when he gets the proposals.  The strategy includes a wide range of measures over and above those already in place from the review, as the Deputy must acknowledge.  Fifteen per cent of electricity is to be generated from renewable sources by 2010 and 33% by 2020.  It does not have to be a 3% figure in every year.  It is an average figure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>An annual reduction of 3% is required to reach the target. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Biomass is to contribute up to 30% of energy input at peat stations by 2015. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>All we hear from the Taoiseach is hot air. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a shift to public transport as a result of Transport 21 investment and the rebalancing of VRT and motor taxation.  I would have expected the Green Party to favour revised building regulations which aim for a 40% improvement in thermal performance.  The grants for renewable energy heating available under the greener homes scheme have been an enormous success.  The strategy also includes support for eco-efficient technology and practices, a top-up of EU premium for energy crops and the biomass harvesting scheme.  A commission on climate change will provide high level advice to the Government on progress and increase awareness in all sectors.  We argue that our strategy is better than the British system and helps to keep the economy efficient.  Those are just a small number of the issues that have been outlined and the targets to be met.  The strategy includes a commitment to publish another climate change strategy&mdash;&mdash;-</P>

Indeed, as we have highlighted in the House, a significant number of related EU measures have gone through the Houses of the Oireachtas without even address at committee.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Both the T&aacute;naiste and his predecessor made public commitments to schedule a full debate of this area which were put on the record following the French and Dutch referenda on the EU constitution.

        <P>It is imperative that we have the debate immediately.

	<P>It is not agreed.  I want to highlight the fact there is a flood of legislation being pressed through today, which is clearly a pattern we will see repeated in the coming days.  Given the conclusion time of 8.50 p.m., one would take it there is substantial time for the debate.  However, with Private Members&rsquo; business lasting <Col N="54" />from 7 p.m. until 8.30 p.m. and the previous legislation concluding at 7 p.m. there is only 20 minutes being provided for in this case.</P>
        <P>The National Development Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill 2006 is one that raises real difficulties for a number of Deputies and merits far greater scrutiny than a 20-minute slot at the end of Tuesday evening, which is inadequate time by any standard.

The statements on the nurses dispute have been agreed but, as far as I can establish, while the debate is welcome, nobody asked for it.  I am always suspicious of the Government when it comes bearing gifts, if the Chair knows what I mean.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The fundamental question we have to ask ourselves, as a Parliament, a Government and a society, is what does fairness demand in this situation?</P>
        <P>First, and more important than anything else, is what fairness demands for patients.  More than 1 million patients are seen in our hospitals each <Col N="59" />year.  Fairness demands that we put patients first, avoiding at all costs inconvenience, distress, disturbance and delays for patients and their families.  It is up to those who are strong and healthy in Government, administration, management and trade unions to do this.  Fairness demands that disputes are fully explored and settled without distress to patients.  There is no point arguing in theory over what type of industrial action affects patients and their families.  The test is a simple one: what do patients and their families experience?  What do they say?  On that basis it is clear already.  I deeply regret that the current industrial action is simply not fair to patients, even before any escalation.</P>
        <P>Fairness demands that we should take account of 300,000 other public sector workers who have agreed to a fair and collective way to address their pay concerns through benchmarking and Towards 2016.  We cannot allow one dispute effectively to dishonour that agreement with them.  I believe they rightly expect the Government to hold the line.  Fairness demands that we take account of 1.7 million private sector workers, for many of whom pay and conditions are also set or influenced through partnership and whose taxes pay for the salaries of the public sector.  These workers include nurses in the private sector.  For most of these workers, pay increases amounting to 32%, as per the INO-PNA claims, are unimaginable, and, if paid to others from their taxes, are unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Fairness demands that we take account of all taxpayers who together will pay more than &euro;14 billion for health services and investment this year and who rightly can ask for the reasons upwards of &euro;1 billion more would be required from them to meet the demands in this dispute.  Fairness also demands that we engage reasonably with the issues raised by the two nurses&rsquo; organisations in this dispute, that we make available all the industrial relations machinery of the State to address their claims and that we engage in good faith in those processes.  We have done all this and we stand ready to continue to do so.  In short, fairness demands that a judgment is made taking into account the needs of all groups, starting with patients, and reaching a balance between all.  It is not just about fairness to nurses; it is about fairness to all.</P>
        <P>The public will rightly want to decide whether their Government is balancing all the needs of all people in its response to this dispute.  To make up their mind, the public deserve to know some of the facts.  The INO-PNA lodged eight cost increasing claims in December 2005.  The dispute centres on two claims for a reduction in the working week from 39 to 35 hours and a pay increase of 10.6% for more than 43,000 nurses of all grades to address a pay anomaly in the intellectual disability sector, which affects 50 staff nurses. <Col N="60" /> A four-hour reduction in the working hours of nurses would take 7.7 million nursing hours out of the public health system and would represent a pay increase of 11.4% on the hourly rate for nurses.  The two claims translate into a claim for a 22% pay increase, which, when combined with the 10% available under Towards 2016, amounts to a 32% increase.  The four-hour reduction in working hours per week amounts to 30 more days off a year.</P>
        <P>A total of 70% of the workforce in the health sector is contracted to work a 39-hour week and nurses account for only half of that figure.  Nursing support staff such as health care assistants, attendants and porters, as well as NCHDs and ambulance personnel, also work a 39-hour week.  The two nurses organisations are seeking a Dublin weighting allowance.  The estimated cost of granting an allowance of &euro;3,800 to Dublin-based nurses would be in excess of &euro;52 million per annum.  All other public servants in Dublin would seek a similar allowance.  If an allowance were granted to all public servants, the annual cost would be in excess of &euro;252 million.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The claims were heard by the Labour Court in June 2006 and a recommendation issued on 9 November 2006.  The court did not recommend concession of the major claims, nor the Dublin weighting allowance, but, instead, urged the unions to reconsider their position on benchmarking so as to have their pay claims dealt with though this process.  On the claim for reduced hours the Labour Court stated concession of the claim at this time would have profound consequences for both health care delivery and costs unless effective countervailing measures could be put in place.  The court recommended that the parties should jointly explore the possibility of initiating an appropriate process aimed at achieving major reorganisation of working arrangements and practices within the health service generally.  Health service employers have confirmed their acceptance of the Labour Court recommendation and their willingness to hold discussions on the claim for reduced working hours as recommended by the court.  The national implementation body was made available to the INO and PNA to take up these issues and engaged in good faith to chart a way forward without industrial action.  Unfortunately, this outcome of this process, like that of the Labour Court, was not accepted by the INO and PNA.</P>
        <P>Public sector nurses pay amounts to &euro;2.2 billlion.  The last national agreement, Sustaining Progress, gave cumulative pay increases to nurses of 13.16%, in addition to benchmarking increases of between 8% for staff nurses and 16% for directors of nursing.  Nurses&rsquo; pay has increased by between 75% and 103% across grades since 1997.  The basic pay of a newly-qualified staff nurses, before premium shift pay, is &euro;31,233, which compares to the average industrial wage of &euro;31,360 <Col N="61" />last September.  The average annual salary of a nurse in 2005 was &euro;56,000.  The number of nurses in whole time equivalent terms has increased by more than 11,100 since 1997 to 36,730 whole-time equivalents or 43,000 individual nurses in the public sector alone.  The number of promotional posts in nursing is almost 9,500, an increase of almost 4,000.  We have created over 1,900 new clinical nurse specialist and advanced nurse practitioner posts.  As a strong supporter of expanding the role of nurses, I have given approval for nurse prescribing to start.</P>
        <P>Like most people, the Government and I value and support the profession of nursing and the work of thousands of nurses.  Many people rightly say that no price or payment can be put on compassionate care by a top class nurse.  No price can be put on a top class teacher or the skill of doctors, no amount can be paid for the bravery of a garda facing criminals and no price can be put on the courage of air-sea rescue staff and many other public servants.  Yet we must to settle on a payment and that is why we have to use sophisticated industrial relations methods in a way that is fair to all.  I want to see nursing and nurses continue to be held in high esteem by our society.  No one wants to see the standing of nurses diminished in the eyes of patients.  It would be a tragic mistake if an industrial relations dispute were to have that result and, unfortunately, this dispute runs the serious risk of doing just that.</P>
        <P>So what is the way out?  There is one way out, one way forward, and it is the same way that hundreds of thousands of other public service workers have taken without special preconditions.  It is a way that holds no threat, no dangers, no hidden pitfalls for nurses.  It is easy to take, it is available and it is not a long and arduous path.  It is the benchmarking route.</P>
        <P>Less than nine months are left in this year for the benchmarking process to be completed.  In that context, can this disruption to patients and their families be worth it?  Surely it cannot.</P>
        <P>I urge all involved to reconsider.  The Government remains ready to deal with all these issues in a way that is fair to patients and their families, to public servants, workers, taxpayers and the public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Patient safety is a very important issue at the centre of this dispute.  Everything must be done to resolve the dispute as quickly as possible to protect patients in the Irish health care system.  They must be our foremost concern and we must ensure nobody dies or is put at risk on our wards, increasing the anxiety of families, because we have not done our best to resolve the dispute.</P>
        <P>Like all political parties, Fine Gael has met the INO and the PNA, both of which bodies have been vocal in the course of the dispute.  Their rep<Col N="62" />resentatives told us they did not trust the current benchmarking process and the Minister must address that lack of trust.  She must make clear to the House exactly what options are available to her to resolve the dispute.  Is she saying the Government will do absolutely nothing, only wait for the benchmarking process to deal with the nurses&rsquo; pay issues?  Is she saying it has nothing to do with her and that she will stand back while that process takes place?  That will create the impression that the Minister was stringing the nurses along by asking them to go to the national implementation board, particularly in the context of the letter the Taoiseach wrote to the nurses&rsquo; organisations to the effect that he would look for an imaginative solution.  If she now says she was never going to do anything but was always going to leave it to the benchmarking process, what is the imaginative industrial relations solution about which the Taoiseach spoke?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach appeared to say today, during Leaders&rsquo; Questions, that of the main concerns of the nurses, the claim for a 35-hour week seems to have been sorted out, apart from the timeframe.  Am I correct that the pay anomaly seems also to have been sorted out for the nurses involved?  A pay increase of 10% under partnership seems to be available now and the Minister says the 10.6% increase, to which the nurses say they are entitled, is available if they are willing to take their chances with the benchmarking process.  The Minister talks about holding the line as if she were controlling the public finances, but, as well as being careful about how we spend taxpayers&rsquo; money, we are also responsible for patient care so we must exhaust every possibility to resolve the dispute.  The concerns I have pointed to, however, do not seem to be as insurmountable as they have been portrayed up to this point.</P>
        <P>When we met the nurses on 9 January, two months before the Taoiseach wrote his letter to them, they stated their willingness to change their rosters and work practices to counterbalance, to some degree, the costs involved in the changes they sought.  How far did the Government take that discussion?  I do not have the same amount of information as the Minister but I have heard from the national implementation body that the nurses felt they had almost achieved agreement on those changes.  Significant changes will take place to nursing in the next decade.  Nurses will be involved in prescribing and advanced nursing practitioners will come into being.  Nurses will take up duties currently performed by doctors and will delegate some responsibilities to care assistants.  There seem to have been significant discussions on those changes so if everything is going in the right direction, why are nurses going on strike?</P>
        <P>I spoke to nurses on this issue and some of what they say does not bode well, perhaps explaining why the INO takes such a hardline <Col N="63" />stance.  Nurses feel unacknowledged by the HSE and the Government and undervalued as people and as professionals.  They feel incredibly frustrated in their dealings with Government and the HSE, which I can understand, and there seems to be a significant lack of trust, which might have its roots in the last benchmarking process.  As the Minister said, frontline staff nurses received an award under benchmarking of 8% but administrative nurses received 16%.  The Government made it clear in the last round of benchmarking that it valued administration more than it valued frontline nurses, who deliver the service every day to elderly patients and people in accident and emergency units.  A lack of trust has developed because nurses feel a lack of appreciation, which is a serious issue and must be addressed.</P>
        <P>We have no idea why some received 8% and others 16% in the last benchmarking process because, in its wisdom, the Government shredded all the background material.  That lack of accountability and transparency has contributed to the lack of trust.  The reason for that lack of trust can also be traced to the Minister&rsquo;s statement on the &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; yesterday.  She implied that the dispute contributed to the fact that some elderly patients could not be moved to the Beaumont nursing home.  If she had made a simple telephone call she would have found that the Beaumont nursing home, which had closed down three years ago but had recently been redecorated, did not have medical cover for elderly patients.  More important, the nurses who would look after those patients were not in dispute with the Government because the HSE is in India looking for them.  Unless nurses in India are on a work to rule with their colleagues in Ireland, that was a red herring.  The nurses know that and it contributes to the lack of trust they have in the Minister.  The Minister is playing mind games with nurses, with patients in the middle.  She should get off her hobby horse and resolve the dispute.</P>
        <P>The HSE has taken a very active part in the spin-doctoring in which the Minister loves to partake.  It is great when the TV cameras are around to show its incidents room, manned with personnel, but if one was looking for staff in an emergency one would not be able to get hold of them.  The HSE owns St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital in Raheny, which had plans to build a long-term care unit for the elderly, which the HSE said would be constructed by the end of 2006.  However, not even a single shovelful of dirt has been dug from the site to construct that care facility.  It was galling to watch the HSE shedding crocodile tears on the television news.  The Minister should stop playing such public relations exercises with patients.  This issue is serious and neither she nor the HSE can simply spin their way out of it.  While I was surprised the HSE has participated in this exercise, <Col N="64" />it has begun to act like an arm of the Government, which is of concern to me.</P>
        <P>The Government should begin to take patients&rsquo; concerns seriously.  The Taoiseach and the Minister should negotiate.  They appear to have written letters and will probably meet the nurses&rsquo; organisations in the corridors of Government Buildings to whisper into their ears that all will be well and that they will do the business.  However, the Government should be protecting patients and, thus far, I have seen nothing in this regard that cannot be resolved to some degree.</P>
        <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to try to wash her hands of this business and to state that only benchmarking will solve the problem.  There must be a resolution to this dispute and, if not, the Minister should make it clear that she believes the Irish Nurses Organisation, INO, to be completely wrong in this regard and to be intransigent in respect of its grievances with her.  This is a very serious matter and both the Taoiseach and the Minister should make up their minds.  They should tell Members exactly what the Government is doing and whether it can solve this issue on patients&rsquo; behalf.  The Minister should stop the nonsense of belittling nursing or putting them down in some statements.  While I accept that some of the pay costs involved are enormous, this matter is negotiable.</P>
        <P>The Minister made some interesting statements, including the fact that nurses&rsquo; pay has increased by between 75% and 103% across all grades since 1997.  The same is true of the Minister&rsquo;s pay, which also doubled during that time and is far greater than the salary of &euro;31,000 that basic grade nurses will receive this year.  The mind games should stop and this issue should be resolved.  Nurses are willing to make some concessions and are willing to change their work practices.  New clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners have entered the health services and have made fantastic changes to it.  While I also believe that benchmarking is the route to take, the Minister must regain the nurses&rsquo; trust in regard to these negotiations.  If she cannot do so, she should tell the House the reason and what is happening in this regard.</P>
        <P>At present, many patients are suffering because of what is taking place.  I am under no illusions as I have worked in the health service and I am aware of the work carried out by nurses.  If one loses goodwill from nursing, patients will suffer seriously.  My concern is that some nurses may either become militant or despondent.  They may simply give up because they feel frustrated, undervalued and unacknowledged by the Minister and completely lack trust in the manner in which she has been treating them.  The Minister should have been following these concerns as they went through the Labour Court.  On meeting the INO and the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, in early January, Members were made <Col N="65" />aware of a problem and the Minister would have been in the same position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As for the national implementation body&rsquo;s talks with the nurses, the Government was simply dragging them through a process and stringing them on, while getting closer to a general election, to ascertain whether it could get its way on this issue.  I note that when concerns arose, the Government established a commission on nursing.  I am unsure whether this pertained to a different matter or whether the Government&rsquo;s commitments in this regard are clear.  However, it is incredibly important that such games stop, for both patients and the 40,000 nurses who work in the health service.  Whoever is responsible for this problem should make the decisions and if the Minister really believes she is getting no help from the Irish Nurses Organisation or the Psychiatric Nurses Association, she should state what are the problems.</P>
        <P>I know many nurses, having worked with hundreds, if not thousands, of them during my medical career.  They are serious about patient care and do not take such action lightly.  I am aware their anger and frustration may lose them public goodwill and may not help their cause.  Moreover, being baited by the Minister and other members of the Government will not help some of those involved to keep their cool because they have been so angry with the Government for so long.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s job is to protect patients and she should tell the House exactly what is happening.  As Members are only making statements, they have no idea as to how the Minister intends to respond to them.  I have no method of replying in respect of any concerns she may raise.  However, I wish to be made aware of what is happening and whether this issue is solvable.  My only interest is in whether this matter is capable of resolution.  If not, the Minister should explain clearly to the House why she does not believe it to be so and who she believes to be responsible.</P>
        <P>The only issue that patients and potential patients of the health service want answered today is whether this issue can be resolved and, if so, who is responsible for so doing.  If nurses lack trust and do not believe in the benchmark process as it is constituted at present, what commitments can the Minister or the Taoiseach give that do not disrupt social partnership but that will bring nurses back into the process?  Must the terms and conditions of benchmarking be changed?  How advanced are the talks regarding those work practices and changes mentioned by the Minister?  Can such negotiations be resumed and can the Minister ensure that patients do not suffer during the next two months?  A general election in the offing means that matters become extremely confusing and I do not wish to see patients suffer for the next eight or nine weeks because the Minister and Taoiseach are grandstanding, or, in the Minister&rsquo;s phrase, holding the line.  I seek a resolution.</P>

	<P>I note that in the Minister&rsquo;s speech, she continually repeated the word &ldquo;fair&rdquo;.  This is a verbal device used by script writers.  However, it is somewhat paradoxical when one considers that the Minister&rsquo;s political outlook is to promote inequality.  The leader of her party has made it clear that he considers inequality to be good for us all.  If Members consider the Minister&rsquo;s approach to the health service, they will have observed a deepening of the divide, promotion of privatisation and greater provision being made for those patients who can afford to pay.  Meanwhile, public facilities such as the acute hospital sector are struggling to an increasing extent to stay within their budgets.  The entire concept of fairness does not come easily or appropriately to the Minister&rsquo;s lips.</P>
        <P>A short time ago, I raised an issue relating to elderly people.  If one cannot look after the very elderly, who literally have been robbed by the State, I am unsure how one can claim to be fair.  However, the Minister has presided over a system and has promoted a privatised option in respect of paying repayments to elderly people, which simply has not been working.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A new feature has arisen in the health service, namely, a serious escalation in the nurses&rsquo; dispute, which has been simmering for some time.  It arises in a context of a health service that has been shamefully mismanaged by the Government.  This is the Government that promised to eliminate waiting lists within two years of its re-election.  It promised 200,000 medical cards and to end the severe problems that persist in accident and emergency departments.  None of the aforementioned promises were kept and a point has been reached at which the Government&rsquo;s commitments no longer have any credibility.</P>
    <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>  
        <P>This loss of confidence in the Government on the part of patients and those who care for them creates uncertainty and disaffection at a time when certainty and commitment are most needed.  The Government is reaching the end of its term and, remarkably, despite a significant increase in health funding, the list of key stakeholders in the health service with whom the Minister has failed either to begin or to conclude negotiations is lengthening on a daily basis.  Hospital consultants, junior hospital doctors, chiropodists, dentists, pharmacists and general practitioners have all found their contract negotiations being attenuated or ended peremptorily by the HSE and the Department of Health of Children.  However, the most serious dispute is with nurses, the biggest group of health workers by far.  It is disturbing that the Minister for Health and Children has displayed a certain lethargy and, at times, an ignorance about the critical problems affecting these professionals.</P>
        <P>At the start of this year I tabled the following motion in the Joint Committee on Health and Children:</P><Col N="67" />
        <P LI="1">That the Joint Committee on Health and Children notes, with concern, the emerging industrial unrest between the Health Service Executive and the nursing and midwifery unions, the Irish Nurses Organisation and Psychiatric Nurses Association.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">It is clear to the committee members, from representations received, that the professions hold a deep sense of grievance with regard to their hours of work and relative pay position within the health service.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Nurses and midwives are among the most flexible of public servants who provide essential care to the community on a seven day, 24-hour basis.  They are an essential part of our health service.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The joint committee believes they hold substantial grievances, are prepared to engage in significant reform towards improving patient services and are seeking accommodations in line with those provided for other public servants.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">On that basis, we call on the Taoiseach, Minister for Finance, Minister for Health and Children and the Health Service Executive, and its employer organisations, to engage with the INO and PNA and to take all reasonable steps towards ensuring equitable conditions apply in the health service and, therefore, avoid a potentially damaging dispute in our already challenged health service system.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The motion was supported by all members of the committee across all parties, including the Minister&rsquo;s.  However, the Government has not done what it was asked, and we now face a deepening crisis.  Every effort must continue to be made to find a resolution to this dispute.  None of us is under any illusion about how difficult is that task.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a well thought out industrial relations structure in place which has, generally, served us well, but it is not clear that this dispute can be resolved within the current mechanism.  I pay tribute to the members of the national implementation body who have spent the last few weeks trying to move towards a conclusion.  It is important to recognise that this dispute is not just about money but is also about a shorter working week.  Nurses have shown that they are willing to be flexible and to approach this issue in new and innovative ways.</P>
        <P>A feature of nursing that has not been acknowledged by the Government is that nursing is continually changing.  I recall a previous occasion when nurses were in dispute with a Minister.  The Minister at the time, Deputy Noonan, established the Commission on Nursing, which had the brief of considering the changing role of nursing and making recommendations for the future.  That commission was worthwhile and dealt with many issues.  In a way, this dispute is a follow-on from <Col N="68" />concerns that might not have been addressed at that time.</P>
        <P>There might be merit in establishing another commission on nursing to consider the changes that are being, and will be, faced by nurses in the 21st century.  Deputy Twomey itemised some of them, such as the role of nurse practitioners and the issue of prescribing.  A commission could consider these issues in conjunction with the forum on health, which the Minister has agreed, at long last, to establish.  I regret that the forum on health, which was proposed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions a year ago, was not taken up energetically by the Minister.  If it had, we might not be in the current mess.</P>
        <P>The health service needs nurses.  It cannot provide for patients without them.  The standard of care they provide is of high quality, even though the conditions in which they work can often be stressful and inadequate.  It is not fair on patients or nurses to have to continue dealing with conditions the Government has failed to address.  Overcrowding in hospitals, the extent of MRSA infection and the fact there is an insufficient number of step-down beds, which leads to beds not being appropriately occupied, are unfair to patients and to the staff looking after them.</P>
        <P>Nursing and midwifery manpower is a fundamental issue for the health service.  Over 11,000 Irish trained nurses have left the State since 1998 and we are increasingly dependent on nurses coming to this country from overseas to fill the gap.  Approximately 8,000 have done so in the last eight years.  The number of qualified nurses taking up employment in sectors other than nursing is considerable.  That is not an indication that nurses have it cushy.  These realities must be acknowledged when finding solutions to this dispute.  I greatly regret the ill-considered and aggressive criticisms of nurses that have appeared in some media.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party would support the argument that change can only come about through partnership.  We support and promote that principle.  We understand that for many nurses the idea of partnership might have a hollow ring to it but partnership for change is ultimately the only way forward.  The forum for health is about developing that partnership and, indeed, repairing much of the damage caused by this Government.  When a system is in constant crisis, partnership is hard to retain and people tend to work in an isolated way.  That has happened more frequently.  The old ways of doing things certainly have not been replaced by better and more understanding about the importance of team work as a result of the pressures within the health service being so considerable.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to consider what the INO has been saying about issues affecting its members.  This dispute is being presented as if the nurses have, out of the blue, made unrealistic and <Col N="69" />unreasonable demands and the Government is standing firm.  It is not that simple and should not be dealt with so simplistically.  In December 2005, shortly after the current Minister took office, the INO made a thoughtful pre-budget submission.  It described what had to be done to make the health system fair.  It talked about the elimination of the practice of keeping patients on trolleys for long periods in accident and emergency departments, continuous overcrowding in many acute hospitals, repeated cancellation of elective admissions, inadequate or absence of service for the mentally ill, inadequate community based services to meet the needs of those on the margins and people who live alone, and excessive workloads on frontline staff.  That was the picture of the health service in December 2005.</P>
        <P>It is now April 2007.  Has the situation improved and have the problems eased?  They are probably worse than ever.  No amount of massaging the figures by the HSE will convince people that matters have improved significantly.  In December 2005, however, the INO was itemising its issues of concern.  They included the anomaly between nurses and social care workers, the issue of the 35 hour week and the Dublin weighting issue.  The latter has not taken a central role in this dispute but it is clearly important.  The nursing shortages are most acute in the Dublin region, where nurses simply cannot afford to buy a house or afford to live.  That problem has been endemic in the system for some time.  Various means have been used to meet the needs of Dublin hospitals, including bringing nurses to this country from overseas, heavy use of agency nurses and so forth.  I hope the Taoiseach might live up to the reputation he built as one who was able to solve difficult industrial disputes.  I am not sure if this reputation is justified, but I certainly know that the perception exists that the Taoiseach has ways of sorting out difficult problems and finding consensus.  If this is so, he should be challenged to get down and start finding the consensus and the way through here.</P>
        <P>Nobody can afford to have a situation deteriorate in the way that is now opening up to us.  More than any other group of people, patients need to feel secure and know they are being cared for.  There is a presumption that nurses will care for patients and nurses have shown that they are responsible in that regard.  They have not gone on an all-out strike, have given a considerable amount of notice and have been making the case about these issues for years.  The level of frustration and low morale have now reached a point where nurses feel completely alienated by the lack of attention given to them and feel very strongly that they have not received fair treatment.  The Minister spoke about fairness, but it is all about the evidence of fairness rather than just the words used.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, McHugh, Connolly and Joe Higgins.  </P>
        <P>The Minister gave a very well-constructed and clever speech in which she highlighted patient care and fairness.  The clear implication was that, by embarking on industrial action, nurses were being unfair to patients and other professions, such as teachers.  I will return to that point because I am a former teacher.  The Minister&rsquo;s speech has not helped matters.  The speech was provocative and divisive.  The obstructionist, rejectionist, &ldquo;come on if you&rsquo;re hard enough&rdquo; approach will only further antagonise nurses.</P>
        <P>The nurses entered negotiations with an open mind and wanted creativity.  I will quote from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s letter to Liam Doran, general secretary of the INO.  When one reads this letter, one really believes that the Taoiseach, who is renowned for his negotiating skills, wants to resolve this.  In the letter, he says:</P>
        <P LI="1">As you know, I have always maintained that progress could be made without the need for industrial action, which, I know, would be resorted to with great reluctance by the nursing profession.  The care of patients has always been such a paramount value for the nursing profession as to win them the respect and admiration of the wider public.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He goes on to say:</P>
        <P LI="1">For my part, I will ensure, with my colleague, Mary Harney T.D., the Minister for Health and Children, that the Government representatives in this intensive process will be as open and creative as possible in achieving outcomes to the benefit of nurses and patients alike.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We know that those negotiations were embarked upon and that the INO-PNA entered into them in good faith.  In respect of the problem, we are talking about a two-humped camel.  We can narrow it down to two issues, namely, pay and the working week.  I genuinely believe that if we could, for example, deal with the working week, the other issue would fall into place fairly rapidly.  It can be resolved.</P>
        <P>Statements have been made about the national implementation body.  The problem with the statement by the national implementation body is that when it attempts to address the 35-hour week, there are so many caveats and conditions surrounding it that it is unacceptable to the INO.  What the INO wants is a very clear commitment, namely, a starting date.  However, there is no starting date and if there is no starting date, it will not happen in its view.  This is the difficulty.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to go back and look at this in a very different way.  The problem is that, as the Minister is aware, this will escalate and will have to be resolved at some stage.  I do not want this to escalate.  I believe, like the nurses, that <Col N="71" />patient care must be uppermost in everyone&rsquo;s mind.  I do not want to see a situation emerge where nurses are being blamed for neglect of patients because one point the Minister rightly made was that nurses enjoy a high reputation with members of the public.</P>
        <P>I take issue with the Minister on one particular point.  She says that other professions do a fantastic job.  That may be so, but I speak as a former teacher when I say that while teachers do a great job, it is not the same sort of job as that done by nurses.  In addition, teachers are recompensed with very good holidays.  Nurses do not get the same sort of holidays and are under constant stress in an overstretched hospital system.  I do not know how anybody could stay sane in our current hospital system and try to deal with a situation where one finds trolley after trolley on which patients lie in great pain.</P>
        <P>The Minister is, in some way, responsible for this situation because she has let the hospital system deteriorate to such a degree that nurses now find themselves under pressure.  I ask the Minister to try to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this opportunity to extend my support and that of Sinn F&eacute;in, as expressed at our Ard-Fheis last month, for the demand of the nurses for a 35-hour week and the resolution of outstanding pay anomalies.  It is a scandal that the INO and the PNA should have to undertake a work to rule.  This Government and the health service employers stand indicted that they have failed to resolve the key issues &mdash; issues that have been the subject of negotiation not for a few weeks or a few months past but for six years.</P>
        <P>In calling the work to rule, the INO and PNA expressed their &ldquo;extreme disappointment and frustration at the failure of Health Service Employers to agree, despite previous statements that openness and creativity would be applied, a date for the introduction of a 35-hour week for nurse and midwives and the elimination of a pay anomaly which sees a qualified nurse paid less than an unqualified social care worker&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The climate in which this work to rule is taking place was worsened significantly by the statement of the Minister last week in the context of the separate Cork University Maternity Hospital dispute.  She accused the nurses and midwives of delaying the opening of the hospital for money.  The public knows that those nurses and midwives were not motivated by greed but by concern that the new maternity hospital would be properly staffed so that mothers and babies could receive the best care.  I welcome the resolution of that dispute and the opening of the new hospital as of last Saturday but what lessons have been learned by the Minister, the Department and the HSE?</P><Col N="72" />
        <P>Nurses and midwives are clearly not prepared to tolerate any longer the understaffing and overworking which they face as front-line workers in a hospital system that is in perpetual crisis thanks to the bad policy and bad management of this Government and of the HSE.  I have no doubt this work to rule would never have arisen in a system where real reform was under way and where patients and staff knew that resources were being used in the best way to deliver care equitably and efficiently to all who need it.</P>
        <P>The mantra of benchmarking again trundled out in the Minister&rsquo;s contribution this evening has been much used and abused in this dispute.  The attitude of the nurses was expressed when they announced the escalation of their protest action in March.  They stated then: &ldquo;As each day passes, the frustration of our members nationwide increases as they hear the one line retort of &ldquo;go to benchmarking&rdquo; from management grades who obtained a pay increase without having to go to benchmarking.  The top three advisers of the HSE and the chief executive, Professor Brendan Drumm, between them were paid &euro;1 million in just 15 months up to January this year.  What benchmarking applied in their case?</P>
        <P>For the sake of patients, their families, nurses and midwives, this dispute needs to be settled soon and justly.  That is a very important point.  The Minister should intervene immediately to ensure that the dispute is resolved speedily through the granting of the shorter working week and the resolution of the outstanding pay issues.  The Taoiseach must join with the Minister in that exercise to ensure that the coalition partners of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats face up to their responsibilities in the dying days of this Administration.  Nurses and midwives previously took action in support of patients and demanded action to address the crisis in our hospital services.  The nurses and midwives deserve our support for their just demands and I wish them success in their efforts to ensure that justice in pay and working conditions is restored to them and that we have a service of which everyone can be proud.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak briefly on the nurses&rsquo; industrial action.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children effectively indicated that they were digging in their heels on this issue.  However, such a hardline approach will achieve nothing for patients, nurses or industrial relations in general.  I request the Government to adopt a more conciliatory approach to this issue.</P>
        <P>The nurses have eight demands and movement on some of those demands would break the deadlock.  The demands of a 35-hour week and a pay claim to restore parity with other health care professionals are minimalist and I urge the Government to engage with the INO and the PNA to <Col N="73" />bring about a solution.  The consequences for patients in the event of a prolonged dispute would be catastrophic.  Negotiations begun but consequently broke down.  I urge all parties to re-engage in the interests of everybody involved and everybody who will be affected by a prolonged dispute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I also take this opportunity to support the nurses&rsquo; demands.  There are seven or eight demands, but there are only three core demands, namely, the anomaly with other grades, the 35-hour week and the 10.5% pay lag behind equivalent grades.</P>
        <P>This has the hallmarks of becoming a very dirty dispute.  Officials from the HSE stated that they had contingency plans, but I believe the contingency plans were to create chaos.  On the first day of this dispute, 14 elective operations were cancelled in Cavan General Hospital, which is about one day&rsquo;s work.  That was either due to incompetence or deliberate chaos.  I believe the HSE has a plan to turn the public against the nurses.  The Government will not win against the nurses, but it might if it can create enough chaos.</P>
        <P>Most nurses now have third level qualifications after four years of training.  Many of these nurses have dual qualifications and some of them even have three or four qualifications, yet they are paid less than their colleagues.  Their colleagues deserve what they earn, such as house parents who often earn 10% more than nurses, but nurses&rsquo; salary should at least match that.  When nurses are asked to move from the hospital into the community where they are needed, those nurses have to pay their own bills.  They suffer a 20% loss in income by moving into a community setting because part of their wage is made up from night duty, weekend duty and so on.  They must also pay their bills and energy costs, which are increasing all the time.  These nurses are expected to lead the service.  The Government must sit down with nurses and get involved.</P>
        <P>Nurses are acting in very stressful situations in accident and emergency departments.  The north east has 20% of the national bed count.  Nurses expected to deal with this every day become demoralised because they cannot perform their task, yet the Government will not get serious and enter negotiations with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The refusal of the Government to award nurses a decent wage increase and a reduced working week stands in absolute contrast to how this same Government facilitates extremely privileged groups to rip off the taxpayer left, right and centre.  This same Government will not pay nurses for critical life-saving work, but it raised the fees of senior barristers at the planning tribunal from an already massive &euro;1,700 per day to &euro;2,500 per day.  That has given them, at taxpayers&rsquo; expense, as much money in <Col N="74" />three weeks as a critical care nurse earns in an entire year, yet the Government now proposes to take the moral ground with taxpayers&rsquo; funds.</P>
        <P>The Government allowed senior consultants rip off the health service to the amount of tens of millions of euro in the PPARS fiasco.  It did not raise a finger in ten years to stop its friends, namely, speculators, developers and landlords, amass obscene riches at the expense of ordinary working people through land speculation, profiteering in housing and rack-renting.  However, citizens who fall seriously ill will not want at their side a senior planning barrister nor a computer consultant, and they will certainly not want a speculator, a developer or a landlord.  They will want a kind and qualified nurse, yet the Government takes a cudgel to hammer this group&rsquo;s demand for decent wages and a reduced working week, while allowing free rein to those for whom greed is the driving force.</P>
        <P>I support nurses, the healers and the life savers, just as I detest parasite speculators and others who have enriched themselves enormously as a result of the policies of this Government.  The Minister for Health and Children really does have a brass neck.  She stated that fairness demands that we put patients first, avoiding at all costs inconvenience, distress, disturbance and delays for patients and their families.  These are the problems which the Government and the HSE visit daily on hundreds of thousands of patients and their families in many accident and emergency rooms and in many hospitals throughout the country.  It failed to honour a promise to deliver thousands of extra hospital beds that were drastically cut in the 1980s.  It failed to fund properly the health service.  The Government does not have any moral authority to lecture nurses.  It should pay nurses and cut back on some of the goodies thrown to its privileged millionaire friends at the expense of the taxpayer.</P>

	<P>I thank the Members who contributed to this debate.  It was certainly very wide-ranging and went way beyond the issue of the dispute between the health service and the PNA and INO.  Some nurses are represented by SIPTU and, as such, have signed on for the 10% pay increase through the social partnership agreement.  They have put their faith in the benchmarking process.  We went to extraordinary lengths to put in place what is generally regarded as a progressive and modern industrial relations machinery, comprising the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  The latter has adjudicated on the eight claims and has made recommendations in respect of some of them.</P>
        <P>In the time at my disposal, I cannot deal with all the issues Members have raised, but I will respond to some of them.  The current pay claim represents a 32% pay increase for nurses, com<Col N="75" />prising 10% for the national agreement, 10.6% to deal with the anomaly and 11.4% to deal with the reduction in working hours.  Members asked what the problem is in reducing hours and claimed it is not a question of pay.  That is not the case.  It is a question of 30 additional days off for nurses, representing 7.7 million days of nursing time lost.  It is a question of a pay increase of 11.6%.</P>
        <P>I have put the Government&rsquo;s position on record.  If it is the case that we can reduce working hours, as some nurses&rsquo; representatives have suggested, and that this can be done on a cost neutral basis through innovative change in rostering and work practices, I will be all for it.  We made that position clear through the National Implementation Body.  If it is the case that the same number of nurses, through changed rostering and work practices, can do in 35 hours what they currently do in 39 hours, there will not be an issue.  However, I have not been shown how that can happen.  Until that exercise is undertaken, we cannot begin the process of implementing a reduction in working time.  I cannot say we can begin to reduce working hours from 1 January 2008 without an additional cost in terms of nurses&rsquo; pay.</P>
        <P>I said in my opening comments that the average pay for nurses in 2005 was &euro;56,000, or some &euro;25,000 more than the average industrial wage of &euro;31,360.  Most people accept this is reasonable and fair when compared with the salaries of many other public sector workers.  I am a strong fan of paying people well and reducing the burden of tax on workers, including nurses, thus providing higher take home pay.  However, I cannot accept Deputy McManus&rsquo;s suggestion that we could grant the Dublin weighting allowance to nurses without this having a spin-off effect for all public servants in the Dublin area, at a cost of &euro;252 million.  One cannot say it is more expensive for nurses to live in Dublin but not for garda&iacute;, civil servants, teachers or prisoner officers.  That is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>The 10% pay increase is available over a 27 month period to all workers who sign up to the social partnership agreement.  Last December, 3% of this increase was paid, and 2% falls due on 1 June.  SIPTU has agreed to this and those nurses who belong to that union will receive the increase.  The anomaly affects some 50 nurses.  In 2003, a commitment was given to provide 50 promotional posts to deal with those nurses in that reporting situation.  This was rejected by the INO and the PNA.  It remains our position to seek to resolve that anomaly through benchmarking.  However, the nurses&rsquo; claim is that everybody should receive the 10.6% increase, not just those in that reporting situation.</P>
        <P>Deputy Twomey asked me about trust.  Almost 300,000 public servants have placed their trust in the benchmarking process.  That process is con<Col N="76" />cerned with benchmarking public sector pay against private sector norms.  Deputy Twomey asked why directors of nursing receive more than staff nurses.  The former have huge responsibilities.  The director of nursing in the Mater Hospital, for example, is responsible for ensuring, through rostering and so on, that 1,000 nurses are available where and when they are required.  I presume this is the reason the benchmarking exercise gave directors of nursing more than staff nurses.  Such differentials arise in many other areas of the public sector.  This was a matter not for me but for the benchmarking process.</P>
        <P>I hope this issue will be resolved through dialogue and discussion.  Our door remains open.  Last weekend, the national implementation body met for several hours on Saturday and Sunday.  Despite this effort and that of recent weeks, however, it was not possible to resolve the issues.  The forum to which Deputies referred is not concerned with pay.  It was suggested by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I was a strong fan of its establishment in view of the need to change the role of the different players in the health system.  In particular, we must ensure people work together in a different way.  The forum seeks to find innovative ways for health care professionals to work together at both community and hospital level.  In particular, it is about empowering nurses to do more.  I am an advocate for such change; it is the reason I provided for nurse prescribing.</P>
        <P>We have 13 nursing schools, graduate entry to nursing and eight times more applications than places.  In the last decade, nursing in Ireland has gone through a revolution.  I want to see nurses empowered in the health care system.  However, we cannot simply sign on for reduced hours unless we know the financial implications.  We cannot agree to such a reduction if it means more nurses to do the same amount of work.  If it can be done without additional costs, as we are told it can, we must be shown how that is so.  That exercise has not been completed, however, and nobody has shown me how we can achieve a 35-hour week for nurses on a cost neutral basis.  If we could be convinced on this point, there would be no difficulty between both sides.</P>

	<P el="0">The amendments before the House are largely of a technical nature and are necessitated by local law requirements.  They do not impact on the Northern Ireland order in council that was recently passed by both Houses of Parliament in Westminster.</P>
        <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 provides for an aquaculture licence regime in Ireland, although it does not apply in the Foyle area.  These amendments take account of the fact it is possible that licences may be issued in the Louth area under the 1997 Act at the same time as provisions concerning aquaculture in this legislation are commenced.  Aquaculture licences issued under the 1997 Act do not take effect for a period of one month from the date of publication of the decision to grant a licence.  This is to allow persons aggrieved by the decision to appeal.  The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to ensure this one-month period is retained so the right of an aggrieved person to appeal licensing decisions in regard to the Louth area is respected.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 2 ensures the appeals provision of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 will apply in the case of licences issued under the Act at the time of commencement of this legislation.  On commencement of this legislation, licences issued under the 1997 Act are deemed to be licences issued by the Commission under this Bill.  This amendment provides that in an instance where the one-month period for making an appeal is still ongoing after the commencement of this legislation and an appeal is made against the decision to grant the licence, the appeal shall <Col N="78" />be made in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Act.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are technical consequential amendments to take account of changes to the numbering as a result of the insertion of the new subsection (2) by amendment No. 2.</P>

The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to ensure a one-month period is retained in order to respect the right of an aggrieved person to appeal licensing decisions in regard to the Louth area.  That position was provided under the 1997 Act and this amendment seeks to ensure it is retained.</P>

	<P>In regard to legislation the last time we left it we thought we had finished with it and it came back to us again.  At the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources the cathaoirleach and one of our spokespersons was going to look at the debate in the House of Commons in the order in council process.  I am interested to know where that is at as we were trying to finish before the start of the partnership government in Northern Ireland. <Col N="80" /> Obviously the legislation is very important for the Foyle and Carlingford fisheries.

      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is great to see the Executive in Northern Ireland.  This is very important legislation which upgrades legislation which is 50 years old.  There was a huge degree of urgency in regard to the amendments which were debated here and went back to the Seanad.  I do not believe any new amendments had been tabled.  Generally speaking when the Bill was before the House previously it was considered urgent to have what was discussed agreed.  Given its ratification here it will take effect.  As Deputy Broughan has said given that the new Northern Ireland Government will commence in May, has legislation been enacted by the House of Commons prior to the appointment of the First and Deputy First Minister?</P>

        <P>I thank Deputies on both sides for their co-operation on this Bill and their recognition of the importance of its enactment in tandem with the equivalent legislation in Westminster.  I wish to put on record my appreciation of the co-operation of Deputies and Senators in getting the Bill through the Houses very quickly.  I thank also my officials for their support.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, to delete lines 22 to 32 and in page 4, to delete lines 1 and 2 and substitute the following:</P><Col N="81" />

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;3.&mdash;Section 3 of the Principal Act is amended in subsection (1)&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) by deleting &ldquo;and&rdquo; where it last occurs in paragraph (<i>c</i>) and by substituting &ldquo;public investment projects,&rdquo; for &ldquo;public investment projects.&rdquo; in paragraph (<i>d</i>), and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) by inserting the following after paragraph (<i>d</i>):</P>
        <P LI="4">&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) to enter into a public private partnership arrangement with a view to transferring the rights and obligations under such an arrangement to any State authority,</P>
        <P LI="4">(<i>f</i>) to act as agent for any State authority in connection with the entry or proposed entry by that State authority into a public private partnership arrangement, and</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am taking this amendment for Deputy Bruton who is otherwise engaged.  What he wants is to publish or cause to be published the assumptions underpinning the cost benefit analysis conducted into any public investment project before any agreement in respect of that project is finalised.  He maintains it would be an excellent discipline on projects to have to justify the underlying assumptions.  It would not cause any damage or give away any commercial secrets.  We maintain there is a need for greater transparency in the selection of projects which are to be given the go-ahead.  This would be a useful and important way of giving greater transparency in the selection of projects as well as providing strong discipline if the underlying assumptions had to be justified.  As this would lead to more transparency and openness perhaps the Minister would accept the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>My officials have not shown up with my brief but I have seen it.  In terms of the commercial sensitivity of that whole area and the discretion that is necessary it would be inappropriate to publish that particular information.  Certainly the timing could be negative in terms of the information it would give to other players in the whole process.  The intention is certainly not to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I understand the intention is that this would come into effect after the tendering process had been completed and selections had been made.  Since it would occur after the event, it should not impede the commercial sensitivities <Col N="82" />to which the Minister alluded.  From that viewpoint, the assumptions underpinning the cost-benefit analysis would be published after the event.  That means that during the event there would be far more discipline on projects and we would obtain better value for money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party is minded to support Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s amendment.  It seems reasonable that the assumptions underpinning the cost-benefit analysis should be transparent.  Our party&rsquo;s finance spokesperson, Deputy Burton, referred at length on Second Stage and Committee Stage to a draft report on this matter by the Committee of Public Accounts.  It dealt in particular with the kind of practices undertaken by other countries, including Australia and Canada.  There is tension between the issues of commercial confidentiality and transparent public accountability, but other jurisdictions have been able to address the matter.  This provision would afford the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is the guardian of our public expenditure, the fullest basis for assessing particularly important projects.  We have all been examining the development of PPP structures in education and other areas compared to State projects.  In general terms, Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s amendment is worthy of support.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems I am the only party finance spokesperson present for this debate.  If it continues after 8.30 p.m., however, perhaps other spokespersons will also have an opportunity to contribute.  I fully support Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s amendment.  The principle of the legislation has been accepted as a requirement for an oversight mechanism for the use of PPPs by the State and its agencies.  Deputy Broughan referred to the report published last week by the Committee of Public Accounts and I had the privilege of being the rapporteur.  As it was a report by the Committee of Public Accounts, I did not think it was in order to take elements directly from it and submit amendments to the Bill on Report Stage because the committee works by consensus.  I had hoped the Minister for Finance and his Department would have taken the opportunity directly to examine that report and insert a number of Government amendments to the Bill on Report Stage.  The report has addressed a number of principles concerning public accountability, confidence in using the PPP mechanism, and questions about the effectiveness and efficiency of PPPs.  On those grounds, I am disappointed that there has yet to be a formal response to the report from the Department or the Minister.  Report Stage would have presented a good opportunity to table Government amendments to the Bill, based on the report.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Broughan said, the report examined best international practice not only in Australia <Col N="83" />and Canada but also in the United Kingdom.  Difficulties are being experienced in other EU countries such as Germany as to whether the PPP is an effective mechanism and how one can publicly account for it.  The difficulty is that when public money is being used by a private sector interest, the Committee of Public Accounts has said, through this report, that it has no way of knowing whether it is being used effectively.  Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s amendment is at least an attempt to insert a mechanism in the Bill for doing so.  The legislation tries to give a particular State agency responsibility for a degree of oversight that has been lacking in the past.  Even when the Bill is passed, however, we will still have oversight mechanisms that fall short of those in other countries.  That was the purpose of the report by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I reiterate my disappointment that the opportunity was not taken to insert many of the report&rsquo;s recommendations into the legislation.  I hope the Minister of State will see fit to accept Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s amendment, at least as an interim measure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>We have all been slightly wrongfooted by the early commencement of Report Stage.  Nevertheless, I wish to record Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s opposition to the Bill and what it seeks to achieve.  There can be no doubt that it is placing the centre of expertise for public private partnerships on a statutory footing.  It seeks to improve the capacity of Departments to initiate PPP arrangements in order to progress specific capital works.  Sinn F&eacute;in is fundamentally opposed to the use of PPPs, which have a dreadful record, not only domestically but also internationally.  It is surprising that the Government is pressing ahead with the increased use of PPPs at this time, despite the problems associated with this method of financing public infrastructure.  It has already been acknowledged by the Minister himself as a complex process of procurement.  It certainly is all of that.  The Government is clearly ignoring the fundamental flaws of the PPP system.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I note that the Acting Chairman for this evening&rsquo;s deliberations is a Limerick Deputy and I would like to refer to Dr. Owen Reeves who is the director of privatisation and PPP research at the University of Limerick.  He has stated: &ldquo;It is quite astonishing that the PPP programme is expanding so rapidly, given that the experience with PPPs in Ireland has been either unfavourable or untested.&rdquo;  That is an important point.  The untested aspect of it has already been reflected upon by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report at the end of last year.  Several eminent contributions have raised real and deep concerns about what can only be described as the squandering of public money.  There is no doubt that private finance is more expensive than Govern<Col N="84" />ment debt.  There are no two ways about it.  We are paying over the odds in all the pilot or experimental PPP projects undertaken by the Government over the past decade; all the facts indicate that it has been an expensive experience for the Exchequer and for the public.  It is the Government&rsquo;s bounden duty to ensure essential public capital projects are progressed in the first instance at the most affordable rate possible, and not by falling for the temptation to extend piecemeal the return or repayment on moneys accessed through PPPs over 20 or 25 years.</P>

<P el="5" FLI="0">I seek to share time with Deputies Durkan, Naughten and Olivia Mitchell and request that <Col N="85" />the Acting Chairman tell me when I have spoken for 14 minutes.</P>
<P>This is one of the most important motions that could be before the House and the fact that it is being raised in one of Fine Gael&rsquo;s last opportunities for Private Members&rsquo; time signifies the importance of the issue to us, the country, all civilisation and the Earth.</P>
<P>The lack of progress on carbon emissions is clear when one looks back on the ten years the Government has spent in office.  While our population has grown greatly and our cities have developed in many ways, our quality of life has disimproved.  When I was first elected to the Seanad in 1997, after the Government took office, the Balbriggan bypass had not been finished nor had the motorway from the Border to Dublin, but a car journey from Drogheda to Dublin was shorter by as much as 30 to 45 minutes in the morning.  This journey will now take up to two hours due to congestion on the city streets.</P>
<P>The Government has failed because, while it has provided money for roads and such infrastructure, it has not provided money for public transport. There is currently no park and ride facility on the route I mentioned for those approaching the city from the North. A park and ride facility makes sense because it would allow people to link up with public transport for an efficient journey to the city.</P>
<P>The Government has not displayed joined-up thinking on climate change and Ireland has particularly failed to meet its responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol as its greenhouse gas emissions are twice the overall target.  Ireland is ranked 22nd of 27 EU countries when it comes to wind, wave and biomass energy generation despite having the best potential energy generation in these sectors.  Some 83% of Ireland&rsquo;s recyclable waste is exported and transport emissions are up 140% since 1990.  I heard a figure of 160% mentioned in this regard last night so we are not doing our jobs.  Only 3% of Ireland&rsquo;s primary energy supply comes from renewable sources.</P>
<P>This, frankly, is an utter disgrace that is heightened by the attitude of the Government to its failure.  The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is not contrite, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, is not apologetic and the Taoiseach, in the course of his final speech to the Fianna Fail &aacute;rd fheis, did not mention the environment once.  That is correct, 30 minutes, 53 promises, billions of euro in commitments and nothing on energy, nothing on climate change and nothing on the future of the planet.  Instead of combating the problem, the Government benches deny that there is a problem.</P><Col N="86" />
<P>Yesterday the Minister, Deputy Roche, announced the second national climate change strategy without any sense of embarrassment at how spectacularly the previous strategy had flopped.  The first climate strategy was predicated on the significant economic growth the country was experiencing.  Many European countries had to aim for emissions below their 1990 levels but we were set a level of 13% above our 1990 level.  Therefore, there was an acknowledgement of our significant economic growth at the time.  The Government has no excuse as it was given the best possible formula, yet it failed to solve the problem.</P>
<P>Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; ten years in power has seen an environmental record of broken promises and abandoned strategies, and their performance on the environment provides far more insight than the Minister&rsquo;s pronouncements.  The Government&rsquo;s true commitment to climate change was revealed when it shelved the first national climate change strategy and yesterday&rsquo;s desperate death bed conversion to the environmental agenda will fool nobody.</P>
<P>A Government that keeps its promises and leads the way on reducing emissions is needed and that is why we are using our Private Members&rsquo; time this week to outline how this can be done.  I hope the Government and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who is here tonight, will support this motion in securing the long-term future of the environment but, considering the Governments record on this issue, that seems too much to hope for.</P>
<P>I make no apology for stating the State has the power to lead by example on this issue.  According to the 2005 annual report of the Office of Public Works, &euro;55 million was spent by the central procurement service.  This includes &euro;13 million on fuels, &euro;11.5 million on vehicles, &euro;10 million on printing and &euro;5 million on stationery and office supplies.  Just imagine the difference an effective green procurement policy would make.  Imagine if, instead of buying oil, the OPW was stimulating demand for bio-fuels.  Imagine if, instead of buying cars that pollute the atmosphere, the OPW was instructed to replace the fleet with hybrid cars or cars that run completely on renewable sources of fuel.  Imagine if every scrap of paper used by the State had to be recycled paper.  Not only would this make a difference in itself but the message sent to the rest of the country would be clear.</P>
<P>Ireland is a modern, democratic, welfare state and, as such, the State plays a vital role in the lives of everyone.  People have contact with the State every day in a myriad of ways.  Imagine if every piece of correspondence they received was printed on recycled paper, if every time they saw a public service vehicle, they knew it ran on biofuel or bio-ethanol.  Imagine if all Ministers <Col N="87" />followed the example of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, by stepping out of an environmentally friendly car instead of a shiny black car?  I think the Minister has a Prius, or is it a Lexus?</P>
</Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a Lexus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Lexus is very environmentally friendly.</P>
</Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why the European Commissioner is changing to one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Our motion tonight, with which nobody can argue except on petty party political grounds, calls for a sea change in how the State does its business and treats the environment.  Fine Gael tonight calls for the setting of a target for a reduction in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions from each Department and State agency.  This would follow from a complete audit of each agency or Department&rsquo;s carbon footprint and an analysis of what can be done to reduce it.</P>
<P>I welcome very much the e-government initiative and hope it can be furthered.  I see no reason, for example, that every citizen in the State should not be allowed to join a system that would allow them to receive all correspondence from State bodies via e-mail rather than in a letter.  My experience with the county council and local authorities in County Louth in this regard has been very good and the level of effective official e-mail and Internet usage is high.  The Health Service Executive and other State bodies are also doing this and it represents the way forward.  It is particularly helpful to get a quick answer to a query that can be passed on to a constituent by e-mail.  There may be specific instances when a letter must be sent, but an e-mail could replace 90% of what we receive from the Government.</P>
<P>I recently tabled a parliamentary question on the amount the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government spends on the production of bilingual communications and found that the figure was &euro;160,000 last year.  I did not receive a breakdown of the figure in the Minister&rsquo;s letter, and I presume people must be paid to write and translate, but it seems that if &euro;160,000 is spent on bilingual publications, we should make large cutbacks in the level of printing.</P>
        <P>Now that we have an option to receive this material by e-mail, we should stop printing copies of the Order Paper and other documents.  Members&rsquo; efforts to make greater use of computers have fallen by the wayside and we must address the problem.</P>
        <P>Private industry is doing good work in the area of e-mail.  Allied Irish Bank, for example, has allowed its customers to accept e-statements for their bank and credit card accounts.  If bank <Col N="88" />customers can receive important financial information, State services must be able to find a better way to provide information.  The example of AIB may have a lesson for Eircom which sends out two bulky telephone books every year.  In an era of competitive directory inquiry services, I suspect telephone books are used with less and less frequency.  While questions may arise concerning data protection, Eircom should circulate a default CD-ROM.</P>
        <P>The motion calls on the Government to lead by example on environmental issues by adopting a policy of green procurement.  This approach is exactly as it appears in that it requires green thinking in the procurement of green cars, recycled paper and so forth.</P>
        <P>The motion also calls on the State to begin the conversion of all public buildings to green energy.  Such a policy would be of major benefit to the environment and, not least, the fledgling renewable energy sector, which needs a boost.  The motion would also compel the State to begin converting all public service vehicles to biofuels to reduce its carbon footprint.  While I acknowledge that some work has begun in these areas, what is lacking is a concerted cross-departmental approach which would move beyond incrementalism and small steps and lead to an environmental &ldquo;Great Leap Forward&rdquo; that would, in time, result in every Government agency sourcing it electricity from wind, wave or solar energies.</P>
        <P>Crucially, the Fine Gael Party is asking the House to support the introduction a new system of annual open and transparent reporting, which would ensure every Government agency is held to account every year on its progress.  On so many issues the House lacks the power to properly scrutinise what the Government does, with legislation rushed through, regulators used as an excuse to duck ministerial responsibility and so forth.  Under our proposals, the D&aacute;il and Seanad would hold the Government accountable for delivering or failing to deliver on the actions I have described.  Fine Gael envisages that an annual report would be presented and debated in the Oireachtas.  Crucially, the relevant Ministers &mdash; perhaps even the Taoiseach &mdash; would be made to answer questions on how and why they had failed and what they intended to do about it.</P>
        <P>My party wants the Government to take action on climate change by adopting a strategy that works, rather than adopting three ineffective climate change strategies, as the Government has done.  Young people are deeply concerned about the Government&rsquo;s failure to address this issue.  Fine Gael has proposed approaches that, I hope, we will soon be in a position to implement.  We will publicly, openly and transparently state what we intend to do.  We have established policy in all areas of the environment, including the vital energy issue.  My colleagues will articulate these views presently.  Tonight we are discussing pro<Col N="89" />curement.  I ask the Minister and his colleagues on the Government benches to do the decent thing and support us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd was about to ask the Government to do the decent thing and leave office.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>We could catch Deputy Durkan unawares.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is the only person who will be caught unawares.  </P>
        <P>I support the motion tabled by the Fine Gael Party.  An inhabitant of Mars who had spent the past few months in Ireland would be pardoned for concluding that the Government had led a Rip Van Winkle-like existence because, for some unknown reason, it only became aware of the need to become eco-friendly on energy, heating and transport in the past six months or thereabouts.  This has resulted in frantic Government activity as members of the public receive a daily dose of propaganda.  Almost every day, it issues a press release or holds a major exhibition, conference or other event, all of which give the impression that it has pursued an environmentally friendly policy since taking office.  Unfortunately, the truth is vastly different because, like Rip Van Winkle, it has been asleep for a long time.  When the Government finally received a rude awakening it decided to take action on this serious issue.  As a result, it is frantically peddling in all directions, using energy to beat the band and in an inefficient manner that is unlikely to benefit consumers.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, referred to broken promises.  The Government made promises in every area except the environment, which is sad.  It has, however, been making noises.  The Minister is a dab hand at making all kinds of friendly noises when it suits him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is in the presence of the master. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>He can charge up and down the country in his Lexus or Prius and proclaim to all and sundry that he travels in a truly eco-friendly manner and is about to solve our environmental problems.  The one positive step the Government has made was to adopt Fine Gael policy on energy, transport and conservation.  Although a move in the right direction, it has been obscured by the Government&rsquo;s mad rush to get consultants to make a new policy announcement every day.</P>
        <P>Environmental policies need to be developed.  In the area of energy the Government must invest in research and development rather than purchasing carbon credits.  Alternative energies must be developed because they are ecologically friendly and economically viable and make a contribution to the continuity and security of supply.  In light <Col N="90" />of the importance of employment and competitiveness, these energy sources would also make a meaningful and beneficial contribution to import substitution.  The policy is done and dusted and requires nothing more than to be implemented.  We do not need further public relations exercises such as those associated with the famous electronic voting machines.  I believe we tried to throw them in the river but they would not float.</P>
        <P>Instead of complaining and moaning, why does the Government not invest substantially more in the development of bio-crops?  Deputy Naughten will elaborate on this issue.  Why does it not increase the amount of pure plant oil which will qualify for excise relief?  Other countries have done this effectively and, in so doing, are making a contribution towards environmental protection.</P>
        <P>Everyone has a role to play on the environment.  In recent days, I have observed the relevant Departments circle each other, initially with suspicion, before becoming immersed in a debate.  The Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Transport, Finance, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Agriculture and Food have common cause and must come together and join up to provide the alternatives required.  There are those who will scoff and argue that Ireland cannot produce sufficient alternative fuels and must import them.  From where would we import them?  It is not a good or eco-friendly idea to import fuel produced in Brazil.</P>
        <P>It is not nearly as friendly as to grow it at home, where transport is reduced to a minimum and the benefits to the home economy of the associated employment operate in a way that would not happen elsewhere.</P>
        <P>There are areas where the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government could improve matters.  Methane gas is floating up to the skies out of every sewage treatment plant in the country even as we speak, boring holes in the ozone layer and creating additional global warming, but nobody says a word about it.  It is sad, but that is how it is.  Methane is escaping from landfills in my constituency to such an extent that when the machinery broke down, half the people of the countryside became ill due to the inhalation of gas.</P>
        <P>The Minister might think that is funny but those involved did not think it funny.  As it is only across the county border from the Minister&rsquo;s area, it might escape over that border and up along the hills.  One never knows, but the Minister might wake up one morning and look out, bleary eyed, into the vastness of an atmosphere that has become polluted with the same gas.  The Minister could do something about this immediately.  On numerous occasions in the past five years I have raised the issue of the methane gas in Leixlip in my constituency, where people can arrive at a particular place in the middle of the night and <Col N="91" />know where they are without rocket science or anything else.  The Minister must apply the principles that are required to his Department in a meaningful way.  He must do something, let it be beneficial to the economy, the consumer and the environment, but he cannot just keep talking around the subject and doing nothing.  It is in his hands.</P>
        <P>While my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, will deal with the area of transport, I wish to raise a constituency issue.  The use of trains is hugely beneficial to the environment and the economy in terms of efficiency and of transporting a large number of people rapidly over a large area.  Nothing compares with train transport.</P>
        <P>I will finish on my next point as my colleagues are getting restive, which is not unknown.  My wife brought the following matter to my attention.  Why are all Government and public buildings illuminated day and night, with the lights on all the time?  Noises have been made in this regard in recent days.  I suppose when all the Government heads got together, they realised: &ldquo;Ouch, why are we using these lights, because they are on all the time.&rdquo;  If the aim is to eliminate the overuse of lights, it is a simple matter.  One can use mirrors if one wants to conserve energy.  There is little difficulty with this and it has been done in many other countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Mirrors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, mirrors.  Lights on top shine on mirrors below which reflect the light back up &mdash; it is as simple as that.  It has been done before.  I know this technology has not reached the Minister just yet and that it is way above and beyond anything the modern experts in this area might consider, but it is simple and it does not involve rocket science.  The Minister might comment on the extent to which he might seek to conserve energy in public buildings, not just in this city but throughout the country, which are currently lit up all night long &mdash; I suppose they look good that way.</P>
        <P>I remember when all such lights had to be switched off by order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Every second street light in Kildare had to be switched off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.  It was in 1973 or 1974.  No rocket science is involved.  I bring this to the Minister&rsquo;s attention to lead him gently into the area where the subconscious is pricked to the extent that he will suddenly become alert to the fact that there are many simple issues he can utilise to the benefit of the economy, the environment and the consumer.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred in the past few days to energy-efficient light bulbs but I am not sure he has fully evaluated them.  He should consider the <Col N="92" />following points.  First, they are expensive, second, they do not show as much light as standard bulbs, third, they do not light up as quickly and, fourth, there might be a sting in the tail for the consumer.  The Minister should be careful with regard to these bulbs.  My point is that every energy conservation measure is good in its own way but it should also be cost-effective and the benefit to the consumer should be evaluated to ensure we always get the maximum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd on the motion he has tabled.  Before I focus on the content of the motion, I wish to deal with an issue to which Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd referred in regard to procurement and e-mailing.  I know the Minister is very efficient in his use of e-mails but it would be no harm if we could ensure the wheelbarrow loads of paper that arrive in Leinster House every week could be dealt with.  What goes on here is criminal.  We literally take two or three feet of paper from our pigeon holes, bring it up to our offices, throw it in the bins and it then comes back again.  There is no need for this and it must stop.</P>
        <P>Simple legislation which the Minister could introduce would address the issue.  Under current legislation, all Government and agency reports must be circulated to the Members of the Oireachtas.  This could be amended so they could be laid in the Oireachtas Library or circulated electronically to Members, rather than having the wheelbarrow loads of paperwork through which we must needlessly tread every week.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion because it highlights one of the key issues, namely, 3% of Ireland&rsquo;s primary energy currently comes from renewable sources.  There is a major lack of joined-up thinking by the Government on this issue.  I read in some of the Sunday newspapers of the Minister&rsquo;s proposals with regard to the national climate change strategy, which refers to &ldquo;support for combined heat and power projects&rdquo;.  Despite this, the Commission for Energy Regulation has decided to abolish the waiver for small renewable energy generators, including combined heat and power units used by businesses, mainly small businesses, whereby they can run and heat their own operations and anything additional can be connected to the national grid.  The CER is increasing the charge for small businesses to tap into the grid, which is contrary to the White Paper on Energy.  This approach shows the contradictions in Government.  One arm of the State is trying to promote something while the other arm is trying to strangle it.</P>
        <P>The same applies with regard to the issue of the use of wood-chip in our power stations.  The Minister in the document published today states: &ldquo;Biomass to contribute up to 30% of energy input at peat stations by 2015&rdquo;.  With regard to the stations at Shannonbridge and Lanesborough, how is the ESB supposed to break out of the con<Col N="93" />tracts it has already signed with Bord na M&oacute;na?  Has anyone considered this question?  It seems never to have arisen in any discussion on this issue to date.  An ideal opportunity has arisen with two new sites being made available in Lanesborough and Shannonbridge through an agreement with the CER.  That is welcome; at least the energy regulator is taking some initiative on the issue.  Unless we address the legislation with regard to the public service obligation, PSO, which currently has an in-built distortional system in place that promotes peat over other renewable energy sources, these other sources will never be used.  It is critical that decisive action is taken on the matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, issued proposals recently.  It is all very well for him, living as he does in County Meath, to have no difficulty with refuse being brought to Shannonbridge and Lanesborough to be burned.  He is not happy to have an incinerator in his area, while the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not happy to have one in Dublin.  However, to dump one on people living in the midlands and pay the ESB to burn refuse there is completely unacceptable and will not ensure we encourage a renewable energy sector.</P>
        <P>It is difficult for the Government to realise it, but there is another reason we should promote renewable energy sources, namely, the need for security of supply.  This need has gone out the window as far as the Government is concerned.  The majority of excise reliefs are for the production of biofuel outside the jurisdiction, which conflicts with and stalls the development of such an industry here.  We brought legislation before the House recently to provide for the compulsory blending of biofuels for the transport sector, but the Government blocked its introduction.  That legislation would have created an industry and demand for renewable energy supplies and biofuels here.  However, the Government was not happy to accept the proposal because it had come from the Opposition.</P>
        <P>The Government has been ten years in office, but is only now beginning to look at development of this area and getting bright ideas on it.  I disagree with Deputy Durkan on from where those ideas are coming; they have nothing to do with light bulbs.  The only reason the Government has got these bright ideas is recent opinion polls show the Green Party is making ground and Fianna F&aacute;il wants to jump on the bandwagon.</P>
        <P>I am glad to see the Government has adopted our proposal for the reform of vehicle registration tax, VRT.  Why is it, when it had ten years to do this, that it is only on the eve of the general election that it has decided to do this?  It would not entertain the idea until now and it was only when Fine Gael came up with the proposal that it <Col N="94" />decided to think about doing something on the issue.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact that our CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions per head are the highest in the world and that we are almost totally dependent on imported fossil fuels for energy suggests we have lost the right to promote the country as the clean, green land we like to see it as.  We have also lost all moral standing on the issue.  We like to see Ireland as a country that defends the future of the planet and criticise others for not making the same effort as us, but the reality is that our efforts amount to zero in the past ten years.  As a result, we have lost a significant opportunity for growth.</P>
        <P>Our transport system and emissions have been the largest contributors to greenhouse gases in recent years and the increase in our use of energy, but the Government has effected virtually no switch to public transport.  Therefore, it is to this area we must look to help cure the problem.  In terms of emissions, the transport sector is one of the main creators of the problem.  The solution will not be easy, as many opportunities to deal with the issue have been lost in the past ten years.  We must now look at a focused and forensic approach to dealing with the task and try to make the process as painless as possible.  However, make no mistake about it, there will be pain involved.</P>
        <P>If the economy is to grow and we are to sustain and grow current living standards, we must increase mobility for both people and goods and increase trade.  We could save energy if there was no growth in the economy or trade, but we want to sustain growth.  Therefore, we must use every opportunity to reduce our dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels.  We must be imaginative in what we do.  For example, my colleague spoke about the Minister&rsquo;s Lexus which is probably just a showpiece.  The reality is that thousands of public sector workers, including ourselves, are on mileage allowances which should be rebalanced to encourage the use of smaller fuel efficient cars, just as VRT is being rebalanced.  It is not being rebalanced, however, on the eve of the general election, as the change will not take effect until the following year, which makes no sense.</P>
        <P>Mobility will be crucial.  The challenge is to decouple mobility, growth in the economy and sustainability.  A significant change could be made by effecting a switch to public transport, something the Government has failed to do.  There is now greater than ever dependence on the private car, leading to huge growth in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions as a result of the congestion endemic in every city.  Fine Gael policy is to require mandatory blending of bioethanol and bio-diesel, which would reduce our fossil fuel dependence overnight, without requiring modification to cars.  A 5% change in the level of dependence on fossil fuels would be an enormous achievement.  Deputy Naughten <Col N="95" />mentioned other Fine Gael policies to encourage growth in the supply of biofuels.  The requirement for a mandatory blending of biofuels would kickstart production and create a guaranteed market, thereby reducing our dependence on a volatile and insecure oil supply.  It would also reduce emissions.  When coupled with the abolition of excise taxes on biofuels &mdash; also proposed by Fine Gael &mdash; the transition to such fuels could be painless for consumers.  The tax advantages need not cost the State anything and could eventually be removed as petrol becomes scarcer and more expensive and biofuels become more available.</P>
        <P>It is more important to encourage public enthusiasm for change than to impose carbon taxes or anything else.  Public enthusiasm needs to be harnessed.  While carbon taxes may be essential, we do not need to introduce them now.  We do not need to take that route until we have exploited all the potential incentives to change behaviour and encourage a move away from fossil fuels.  We should not let ourselves be bogged down by arguments that we cannot produce the necessary biofuels here.  I do not entirely agree with Deputy Durkan in this regard.  I see no harm in importing biofuels if we cannot produce them here.  It would be better to import biofuels than oil.  We should let those Third World countries that have a comparative advantage in the production of biofuels get on with production.  The absence of production here should not be a barrier to a switch to biofuels for our cars.</P>
        <P>There is huge enthusiasm and environmental concern for a change in our lifestyles to a more sustainable use of resources and a move to renewable energy sources.  This is an advantage for any Government which wants to change behaviour.  However, the Government must make it easy for people and lead by example.  We saw how easy it was to do this when the Government gave people the opportunity to recycle and they took to it like ducks to water.  We now recycle infinitely more than we did five years ago.  When a good public transport system was provided, the Luas, the people again took to it in the same way.  There is public enthusiasm for change, but it is up to the Government to harness it.</P>
        <P>Like many other Deputies, I plan to put a jeep on the road to carry my posters etc. around for the general election.  I looked for a source of biofuel to use in my diesel jeep for the few weeks it would be on the road and the closest place I could get it was in Athboy, County Meath.  This is a small effort on my part, but the scarcity of outlets shows how difficult it is to take even a small step and how far we are from that to which we pretend to aspire.</P>
        <P>The Government must not only make change easier for the public, it must also lead by example.  We fall down significantly in this regard.  If we are serious about changing the culture and public <Col N="96" />attitudes, the Government must practise what it preaches.  It operates huge fleets in the public service via the local authorities, hospitals, the fire brigade service, semi-State companies and public transport companies, but has no embedded green procurement policy.  There was a great fanfare about the pilot programme in Dublin Bus to switch to biofuels which turned out to be for five buses and is ongoing.  It has never been extended to the fleet and I do not know if it ever will be.  The Minister announced that he is involved in a pilot programme for one hybrid bus.  That is laughable.  Hybrid buses have been operating all over Europe for years.  It is hard to take the Government seriously when it publishes policies on this issue.</P>
        <P>Although the motion calls on the Government to take various actions, there is little advantage in that because we will not see any great change of attitude.  The next Government, which I hope will come from this side of the House, will ensure public transport procurement policies will be green.  It will be embedded in every arm of the public sector to ensure that its procurement policies are green-proofed.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;commends the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012 and the Energy White Paper, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  In recent months this issue has received more attention than most and it is welcome that we have a debate on climate change and environmental issues.  I have analysed the Opposition&rsquo;s contributions on this issue and it is interesting that it continues to make five key points, most of which are inaccurate.  Without intending to be pedantic, I wish to correct two points Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd made in a sensible speech.  The first has been made by many observers also and suggests that Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions are twice our Kyoto Protocol targets.  Our emissions in 2005 were 25% above the 1990 levels, that is, 12% above the Kyoto Protocol targets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I said above 1990&mdash;&mdash; </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Our targets are based on 1990 levels.  We can quibble about it but Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd is not the only one to make this point.  I wish to correct the record on this aspect.  Our emissions in 2005 were 25% above the 1990 levels.  During the Kyoto Protocol period, 2008 to 2012 we should be at 113% so we are 12% above where <Col N="97" />we should be.  It is a technical but important point. </P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd may have missed the fact that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s entire speech on the opening night of the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis was on the environment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The speech of the Taoiseach that was broadcast on television did not mention the environment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us keep this discussion straight. </P>
        <P>Five major myths have been peddled, the first of which is that we have missed our targets in the first national climate change strategy.  This is utter nonsense.  The commitment period for the Kyoto agreement runs from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012 so it is nonsense to suggest that targets in the future have been missed today.  It is equivalent to accusing the Irish equestrian team manager of not winning gold medals in the Olympic Games of 2012.  It makes no sense.  It is better to base our contributions in this House on issues which are important to us all, not on nonsense.</P>
        <P>The Opposition must be either misinformed or is attempting deliberately to distort the facts in suggesting that the targets have been missed.  The first national climate change strategy document proposed indicative reductions of 15.4 million tonnes over the period 2008-2012.  That is set out on page 5 of the original strategy should anybody chose to compare the figures or to test the truthfulness of the Opposition on this point.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the fact that our targets were specified for 2008 to 2012 and we are still in 2007, the new strategy shows that we will achieve emissions reductions of over 17 million tonnes per annum, almost 2 million more than the original strategy.  It is bunkum to suggest that we have not reached a target which is in the future and to suggest inaccurately that the facts are otherwise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the basis of the Government&rsquo;s current performance, it could be difficult for it to achieve that target.  </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="98" />
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The 17 million tonne reduction set out in the new strategy shows that we are well on course to meeting our Kyoto Protocol targets.  Ireland&rsquo;s emissions without the measures introduced or being put in place would be 79.8 million tonnes whereas the figure we will reach will be 63 million tonnes, slightly below the figure set in our Kyoto requirement.  It is more important for public morale than politically.  People are making significant changes and if we continue to talk down or misrepresent the real achievements made, we will do a disservice to the debate.</P>
        <P>The Opposition claims that nothing has been done to date.  It cannot have this both ways, saying that, on the one hand, nothing has been done to date and, on the other, talk as we have been tonight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Emissions have increased in the past four years. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not be talked down tonight because this is an important issue.  Deputies will have to be a little patient with me.  Since 2000 we have implemented measures that are taking almost 9 million tonnes of carbon out of the atmosphere each year, which is a significant change, and we have now set out exactly what we will do to reduce emissions by a further 5 million tonnes.  Domestic measures will reduce emissions by almost 14 million tonnes, that is, 80% of the total reduction set out in the new strategy.  The details are set out in the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012.  I commend this document because it was deliberately kept short, without frills and kept to specifics, for the first time because that is the way I like a report to be produced.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the emissions trading scheme, the greener homes and commercial bioheat schemes and the realignment of motor tax are all forms of incentive that will lead to reduced emissions in the sectors where a carbon tax would have applied.  The difference in these alternatives is that they do not penalise poor or marginalised households.  These schemes do not penalise people who have to use their cars to do their business or pensioners for heating their homes.  They do not shove up the costs of running a small business and will not drive jobs out of the country. </P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 80% of the reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions will result from domestic measures and 20% will result from the flexible mechanisms.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Money wasted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The protocol recognises that a given emissions reduction is equally beneficial in terms of combating climate change irrespective of where on the planet it is achieved.  This flexibility in the protocol allows developed countries to accept ambitious targets for cutting emissions while, at the same time, providing vital assistance to developing countries and countries in transition.  That is what the flexible mechanisms are all about.  Their importance has been strongly endorsed by Kofi Annan, Sir Nicholas Stern and Yvo de Boer, the head of the UN climate change convention and the mechanism is being widely used through the European Union, particularly in the non-nuclear member states.  The Opposition does not acknowledge that ten EU member states in the burden-sharing arrangement &mdash; Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain &mdash; will use the mechanisms and between them they will spend almost &euro;3 billion over the five-year Kyoto Protocol period buying credits.  Choosing to use the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms, rather than an act of irresponsibility, represents a sensible and balanced approach being followed by environmentally and economically responsible countries throughout Europe.  Using the flexible mechanisms to buy credits must be part of the solution, but not the entire solution, and each country needs to find the most cost effective balance, which is exactly what Ireland has done.</P>
        <P>A number of Opposition Members, who are absent, say we should go even further than we are <Col N="101" />required under our international obligations.  The Opposition wants us to pass laws imposing even deeper cuts on Irish industry than on industry elsewhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Industry is not the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>What kind of lunacy is that?  Instead of creating an incentive for Ireland to develop into a low carbon economy, the effect would be to drive jobs abroad, destroying Ireland&rsquo;s economy, without any environmental benefit at all.  The Opposition would create a desert and call it progress.  What the Government has done is perfectly balanced.  It has placed an appropriate cap on industrial emissions through the ETS that will deliver reductions of more than 3 million tonnes.</P>
        <P>The new climate change strategy shows we will meet our Kyoto Protocol target with 80% domestic effort and 20% use of mechanisms.  In doing so, we will position ourselves for the more challenging targets.  The strategy shows the existing measures will deliver even further reductions in the period beyond 2020.  It is worthwhile examining the measures in place and the impact they will have.  In the energy sector, the Government, by ensuring 15% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity supply comes from renewable sources by 2010, will reduce emissions by almost 1.5 million tonnes.  Modernisation and expansion of the natural gas network will reduce emissions by a further 60,000 tonnes per annum.  The power generation firms in the ETS will contribute 2.4 million tonnes towards Ireland&rsquo;s target.</P>
        <P>I was surprised that Deputy Olivia Mitchell stated nothing had happened in the transport area but then she correctly and properly praised Luas.  A total of 26 million people used Luas in its first year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>How many additional cars are on the road?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>These is no congestion in the Minister&rsquo;s world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The capacity of Luas is 80,000 passengers per day and DART capacity has doubled to 90,000 per day.  These improvements will clearly reduce emissions.  Through technological improvements in vehicles, we will remove almost 500,000 tonnes of emissions.  Rebalancing motor taxes and fuel economy labelling will contribute a significant reduction.  Existing investment in public transport and new investment under Transport 21 will remove approximately 800,000 tonnes.  Use of biofuels as an alternative to petrol and diesel will reduce emissions by 770,000 tonnes.</P><Col N="102" />
        <P>In the residential area, the combined effect of three previous enhancements of the energy performance requirements of the building regulations will contribute a saving of almost 500,000 tonnes.  The highly successful greener homes scheme will also make further reductions.  With regard to industry, a target of 3 million tonnes has been set under the ETS.  Improved building regulations also apply to the non-residential sector and they will reduce emissions by almost 50,000 tonnes.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Sustainable Energy Ireland programmes in the commercial and industrial fields will make a significant contribution of 500,000 tonnes during the period in question.  I put all these facts before the House because they have been conveniently overlooked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>They are hopes, not facts.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>They are aspirations, which are not rooted in reality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>They are the inconvenient truth.  In agriculture, CAP reform is contributing to a significant reduction in tonnage, as is afforestation.  Deputy Durkan referred to landfill.  Landfill gas capture is operating so efficiently that it will reduce emissions by 500,000 tonnes over the period in question.  These are the facts and figures and while Members can quibble with them, to say nothing is done is clearly untrue.  It is clear the Government has made and is continuing to make huge efforts to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s emissions, which will continue into the future.  The Government will report annually on the implementation of this strategy and will continually revise our emissions projections.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd made a number of proposals.  He first referred to public sector fleets.  Changes are under way because it is a good proposal, which is incorporated in the climate change strategy.  He stated an annual report should be published, with which I agree.  It is also provided for in the strategy, which also contains a proposition to create a high level commission, which would respond to the Taoiseach.  I am not sure about Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s suggestion regarding mirrors at night time and how they might work but I would be fascinated if he would forward further details.  The process I have outlined will be transparent and it will be clear to everybody how effective are our policies.  The EU has agreed to a minimum reduction in emissions of 20% by 2020 and the strategy deals with this.  I commend the amendment and the strategy to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity once again to <Col N="103" />brief the House on the extensive measures being undertaken by the Government to achieve a more sustainable, cleaner and greener economy.  This is the third time in the past 12 months we have debated these issues during Private Member&rsquo;s time with Fine Gael tabling two motions in this regard.  As my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, pointed out, we are delivering significant changes and a range of policies that will enable Ireland to meet its climate change commitments and provide access across the entire economy to cheaper and cleaner energy.</P>
        <P>I remind Deputies of our achievements in Government, and of our long-term commitments, which are being realised through immediate and tangible programmes and policies.  In the past month, we have published two major policy documents, which underpin these commitments, establish medium and long-term targets and build on the programmes introduced.  The White Paper, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, and the bioenergy action plan are delivering benefits across all sectors of the economy.  These policy papers deliver more than 200 clear and measurable actions and recognise that harnessing all forms of our indigenous and renewable energy resources is central to energy policy.</P>
         <P>The specific Government targets outlined in the White Paper are one third of electricity consumption to come from renewable energy sources by 2020; a minimum target of 5% market penetration of renewables in the heat market by 2010 increasing to 12% by 2020; a 5.75% biofuels market penetration by 2010, increasing to 10% by 2020; and 30% savings in energy by 2020 across the electricity, heat and transport sectors.</P>
     
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In the area of renewable electricity the 15% target for 2010 exceeds our EU target of 13.2% and has been made possible through a co-ordinated long-term policy for the development of renewable electricity.  As the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, said, the target was imposed by the European Union when I came into this job two and a half years ago.  The Opposition told us repeatedly that we had no hope of ever achieving it but it will be exceeded.  Furthermore, we will achieve 15% by 2010.  Between 2005 and 2010 we will have more than doubled the contribution from renewable energies to electricity production from 6% to 15%.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>Since my appointment to the energy portfolio I have seen rapid progress in this sector.  More than 1000 MW of renewable capacity are now connected to the national grid.  Last year I replaced the previous competitive bidding support programme with a fixed price tariff support mechanism.  This programme, REFIT, has been acknowledged and welcomed by the sector.  In the past year we have accepted a further 55 wind <Col N="104" />farms ready to proceed under REFIT, adding a further 600 MW of capacity to the system.  That level of growth is fully consistent with delivering the 15% target by 2010 and 33% by 2020.</P>
        <P>Wind will provide the majority of additional renewable electricity capacity in the medium term.  More than 60 wind farms are now operational with a combined installed capacity of more than 700 MW.  We are also encouraging other technologies.  For example, we have set a target of 500 MW of installed ocean energy capacity by 2020, which is backed up by a comprehensive ocean energy strategy.  We have also established higher tariffs for biomass electricity and targets of 30% co-firing with biomass by 2015 in the three peat stations.</P>
        <P>The focus on biomass in our electricity, heat and transport fuel policies will support the emerging market for energy from crops, agriculture and forestry residues and biodegradable waste.  The Government&rsquo;s bioenergy action plan establishes a range of policies across the three energy sectors.  The action plan was drawn up by Ministers from seven Departments and represents a whole of Government approach to developing the full potential of our indigenous biomass resources.</P>
        <P>Biomass is particularly relevant in the heat and transport sectors, where new policies and programmes introduced by this Government are already impacting very positively.  In renewable transport fuels, we have introduced two bio-fuels mineral oil tax relief schemes.  Projects under these schemes are already delivering indigenously produced biofuels to the Irish market, blends of up to 5% in petrol and diesel which are being sold at regular petrol and diesel pumps across Ireland and higher blends sold to specific customers at various locations.</P>
        <P>The scheme will allow Ireland to achieve market penetration of 2% by 2008.  Building on these programmes, in February I announced that the Government would introduce a biofuels obligation later this year.  Under the obligation, fuel suppliers will be obliged to ensure biofuels represent a certain percentage of their fuel sales annually.  This will allow Ireland to achieve the targets of 5.75% by 2010 and 10% by 2020, as established in the bioenergy action plan and the White Paper.</P>
        <P>I note the Opposition is calling for a programme to convert all public service vehicles to bio-fuels. The bioenergy action plan has already signalled this commitment from Government.  Specifically, we have committed to promoting the use of biofuels in blends of up to 5% in local authority and CIE fleets, in line with the current fuel quality directive and standard vehicle warranties.  The plan gives a further commitment that all new local authority and CIE vehicles purchased will be capable of taking biofuel blends in the range of 30% and higher.</P><Col N="105" />
        <P>We have also committed to a range of measures designed to increase market penetration of renewable energy in the heat sector.  Once again, we have clearly flagged the Government&rsquo;s intention to commence a programme to convert public buildings to renewable energy.  The OPW&rsquo;s new building programme is being developed so that bioenergy becomes the standard.  Furthermore, in the next year, the OPW will convert 20 of the State&rsquo;s large existing buildings to bioenergy and will give more favourable consideration to leased buildings which use renewable energy.  The action plan also commits to an initial target of 10% in energy savings in the OPW&rsquo;s largest buildings, through a new web-based energy monitoring programme, which will be expanded to cover 230 buildings.</P>
        <P>These public sector initiatives are one component of a larger renewable heat development programme which spans all sectors of the economy.  We have committed to targets of 5% renewable heating by 2010 and 12% by 2020.  This will be realised through programmes such as ReHeat, which I launched recently, CHP and the Greener Homes programme.  These programmes cover a wide range of sectors including the domestic, community, voluntary, public sector and commercial and business sectors.</P>
        <P>The Greener Homes programme which was introduced over a year ago has been hugely successful with almost 14,000 applications for grant aid submitted by householders across Ireland in one year alone.  In budget 2007, recognising the importance and significance of the programme, we increased its funding from &euro;27 million to &euro;47 million.</P>
        <P>Clearly, the Government has listened to the public and responded swiftly to market demand.  In the ReHeat programme, a similar process of engagement with the various sectors has resulted in an expansion of this programme.  The programme was originally designed to facilitate the installation of bioenergy heating systems in commercial and business utilities and has attracted approximately 100 applications.</P>
        <P>Last week I announced that the programme had been expanded to allow community, voluntary and school groups to apply and to broaden the range of eligible technologies to include solar and heat pumps.  The ReHeat programme will cost &euro;26 million over five years and complements an &euro;11 million CHP grants programme which I introduced last year.  Underpinning these programmes is a range of actions designed to encourage industry, business, the public sector and private consumers to reduce their energy consumption by applying energy efficiency practices and technologies.</P>
        <P>The various programmes being rolled out by Sustainable Energy Ireland are having demonstrable success in this area and, in September, I launched the &euro;10 million Power of One campaign, <Col N="106" />which is impacting on consumers the length and breadth of Ireland.  The range, proportion and scope of the various programmes being rolled out provide concrete examples of how Government policy is rapidly developing and evolving to meet emerging consumer needs.  They are also designed specifically to address the sustainability challenge including climate change objectives, security of energy supply, national and rural economic development.  These schemes have already been put in place and are delivering results ahead of initial expectations.</P>
        <P>We established clear and unambiguous targets in the White Paper, the bioenergy action plan and national climate change strategy and have produced a roadmap for the achievement of these targets.  There can be no doubt about the Government&rsquo;s commitment and I assure Deputies we will continue with our ambitious agenda for real and tangible change, to the benefit of consumers, the economy and the environment.</P>
        <P>A couple of weekends ago, and earlier last year, a proposal was made that all parties in the House come together to agree renewable energy targets for the future.  I regret very much that the only party to refuse to participate was Fine Gael.</P>

        <P>I was interested to hear the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, speaking about what he called the reheat programme and on credibility.  I will speak briefly about both and will turn to the issue of reheating first.  This is government by microwave.  As it is too late for the Government to cook up anything new&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The same old clich&eacute;s.  There is nothing specific, simply one-liners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on any area of policy one cares to mention, it digs out the old stuff, stirs it around a little, sticks it in the microwave, takes it out and pretends there is something new in it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is somewhat like the Labour Party, which is reheated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Nowhere is this more evident than in respect of the climate change document that was published yesterday.  If anything, the <Col N="108" />document published by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, is even less ambitious than that published by his predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in 2000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy read either?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I have read both.  Admittedly, three years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>They were hard to read in their entirety.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, is not the only Member who can read.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is good.  However, when listening to the Deputy&rsquo;s contributions, I sometimes wonder.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of credibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the comprehension rather than the reading that is in question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what concerns the Opposition most about the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Gilmore is entitled to speak, I will say nothing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources should not go there.</P>
        <P>There is an issue in respect of credibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>There certainly is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the Government&rsquo;s record on the old climate change strategy, producing a new one is simply not credible.  When the old climate change strategy document was produced in 2000, Ireland was 21% above the Kyoto Protocol limits.  Its objective was to reduce that figure by eight percentage points and get it down to 13%.  However, the Government only succeeded in going in the other direction and driving it up by 4%.  Ireland is now 25% or 26% above the limits, depending on whose figures one believes.</P>
        <P>I was interested to hear the speeches of both Ministers, which listed all the measures they will take.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>And have done.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike some I could mention, we are not still stuck in the past.  I refer to the command economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It has discovered it from focus groups which have obviously persuaded the party leadership that the way for the guys to go &mdash; I am sure the advisers are the sort of people who use &ldquo;guys&rdquo; frequently in their colloquial language &mdash; is to keep telling them what they are going to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il people would never say &ldquo;guys&rdquo;.  They would say &ldquo;lads&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>They have been advised to refer to the next steps forward and to make sure the people forget about the past ten years.  The advice is to delude the people into thinking that Fianna F&aacute;il has not been in Government during that time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a time warp.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is in a time warp.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I give full marks to both Ministers for producing a climate change strategy document that is a reheated version of the old document and which sets out to do things that the Government should have done already.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fine Gael and Labour Party coalition that was in office in 1982 doubled the national debt in four years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fianna F&aacute;il Government that was elected in 1997 has now plunged Ireland into a carbon debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>This constitutes a new national debt from which it may take another 20 to 30 years to escape.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Labour Party was in power, it doubled the debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy Roche&rsquo;s party was involved in both.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Instead of facing up to the imperative of the Kyoto treaty and the problems of climate change and doing something real to reduce carbon emissions, it has chosen to ignore the continuing rise in carbon emissions in Ireland and to buy its way out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The hope is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Here we go again.  The Deputy should be truthful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the mix of measure that are required.  I refer to the ETS scheme, the purchase of carbon credits and so on.  However, I do not accept the reliance on purchasing carbon on which the Government insists and which it believes it can do on the cheap.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The majority of the EU 15 will do likewise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>However, it will not be able to do so and will plunge Ireland into continuing debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>What will the Deputy do in respect of the 20% figure?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>What will the Labour Party do in respect of the 20% figure?  Fine Gael is honest <Col N="111" />and has stated that it proposes to buy carbon.  What is the Deputy&rsquo;s response?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, we will buy carbon.  It must be purchased as part of the package.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has changed his tune.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not.  The problem is that the Government relies almost exclusively on the purchase of carbon.  The sum of &euro;270 million that the Government states this will cost, while telling the people it is cheap at the price, would do much for the health service.  However, the sum of &euro;270 million that the Government claims will be sufficient to buy the carbon will be nowhere near enough.  If one examines the statistics&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>How much carbon would the Deputy buy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I would buy as little carbon as possible.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I would try to reduce the level of carbon emissions.  Had the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, succeeded in reducing carbon emissions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Government has failed to reduce emissions, which constitutes the major problem.</P>
        <P>The two areas that must be examined with regard to the reduction of carbon emissions are the two areas which have generated the biggest increase in emissions, the energy and transport sectors.  There is no point talking about industry because industry is doing its bit.  In the transport sector, the Government has failed miserably to deliver public transport.</P>

	<P>Luas is a success and it would have been a success three years earlier if the Government has not delayed its introduction.  It also delayed providing buses for Dublin city, while the Minister&rsquo;s party argued with the ideological mullahs in the Progressive Democrats about how many buses there should be in Dublin and whether those buses should be privately or publicly operated.  There were no new buses until 2005.  Only about 100 new buses were provided since 1997, at a time when the population of the greater Dublin area has increased by 250,000.  Is <Col N="113" />it any wonder there has been such a huge increase in carbon emissions from the transport sector?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for sharing time.  I also thank Fine Gael for putting this motion, which the Labour Party supports, before the House.  Although the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, says it is the third time this issue has been discussed, there is a need for this third discussion in view of the number of representations Members receive on the matter.  In recent weeks, in particular, Members are hearing on the doorsteps what people think about the problems facing them with energy and so forth.</P>
        <P>The belated publication of the Government&rsquo;s White Paper on energy is welcome but hugely disappointing in terms of the challenge facing Ireland in developing its renewable resources and addressing the critical issue of climate change.  The Labour Party opposes the break up of the ESB or the atomisation of the company and its core grid and generation assets.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="114" />
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not provoke me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is only softening up, not provocation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposal to remove the transmission system from the ESB is unnecessary for competition and threatens the long-term national interest and energy security of the people.  The introduction of the all-island electricity market later this year will greatly reduce the ESB&rsquo;s capacity to set the marginal price of electricity, and the recent agreement between the ESB and the CER will divest the ESB of significant generation capacity.  Further proposals for divestment and site sharing will result in the ESB becoming mainly a network company with some key strategic generation assets.  The Minister&rsquo;s proposal to transfer transmission assets to EirGrid opens the appalling vista of the future privatisation of the ESB, with all the attendant dangers of externally controlled generation in a small, isolated market.</P>
        <P>In the White Paper, the renewables agenda has been advanced little from the Green Paper.  A more ambitious Government might have sought, as in the Labour Party&rsquo;s White Paper submission, to have half of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity supply generated from renewables by 2020 and the bulk of our electricity based on renewables by 2030.  Most disappointingly, the White Paper contains no national targets for the overall contribution of renewable energy to the Irish fuel mix for coming decades.  It is little wonder that just under 2% of Irish energy is now sourced from renewables after ten years of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government.</P>
        <P>Amazingly, there is also nothing in the White Paper on micro-generation and little new on energy efficiency and conservation.  The common refrain of delivering a sustainable energy future for Ireland is the number of energy programmes which will be ready by the summer or autumn of this year, long after the general election.  These include the national energy efficiency plan, the sustainable transport action plan and the 2006 fuel poverty action research project.</P>
        <P>Since May 2002, the price of gas has increased by over 100% and the price of electricity has soared by 60%.  With these massive increases, the recent Government-commissioned Deloitte and Touche report on the future of the ESB unremarkably concluded that almost 20% of householders were fuel and energy poor.  The Labour Party is committed to ending fuel poverty in the lifetime of the next Government.  By contrast, the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats document merely restates the current inadequate policies and supports, which currently condemn far too many vulnerable families to living in conditions <Col N="115" />in which they cannot afford to heat and light their homes properly.</P>
        <P>The Ministers and the Deputies on the other side of the House will have seen the effect of the price increases during their canvassing.  The pressure the increases have put on senior citizens and families is unthinkable.  The Minister, Deputy Roche, said that modernisation and expansion of the natural gas network will reduce emissions by 60,000 tonnes per annum and will provide a cleaner alternative fuel to households and businesses.  However, people are not in a position to use natural gas because of the cost.  It is having a detrimental effect.  In fact, where local authorities have provided natural gas as the energy source for heating and cooking in local authority houses, the people in those houses are asking the local Society of St. Vincent de Paul or the local authority to change the system.  I am aware of housing estates where, due to the cost of gas, people are unable to use it and are suffering due to inadequate heating and being unable to use cooking facilities.</P>
        <P>The White Paper is high in aspiration but low in detail.  The document, for example, lists a series of objectives, such as amending the licensing terms and updating the rules and procedures for the exploration and production of Irish natural resources of oil and gas.  However, these are vague hopes rather than concrete proposals.  No details are provided about what type of licensing reform will be undertaken or even when and if the Indecon consultants will report on this matter before the general election.</P>
        <P>It was hoped that with all the submissions and critiques of the earlier Green Paper the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and his colleagues would have responded in a more comprehensive manner and revamped the final White Paper accordingly.  However, the central policy proposal for the future of the ESB is fundamentally flawed and must be resolutely opposed.  As this country and the world now face a critical energy watershed in the context of climate change, the White Paper is seriously deficient with regard to renewables, energy efficiency, fuel poverty and securing the national energy interest for the long term.  Anyone with an interest in creating Ireland&rsquo;s long-term energy future will welcome the fact that the Minister and his colleagues have finally produced a bioenergy plan, even as we enter the last two months of the Government&rsquo;s life.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s great potential to create this renewable energy resource has been known for over a decade and important opportunities to wean the economy away from its total dependence on imported oil and gas supplies have been lost.  Unfortunately, the biofuels and renewables <Col N="116" />strategy the Minister finally launched yesterday still fails to include a comprehensive and innovative bionenergy plan.  Many of the targets such as the biofuels target of 5.75% for road transport by 2010 are the minimum targets long recommended by the European Union.  The strategy also delays introducing a biofuels obligations scheme until 2009.  The contribution of biofuels to the transport industry is derisory.  It is amazing that the Minister has not introduced measures to redirect the public service transport fleet towards the use of bioenergy.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I will add some additional points to what I said prior to the commencement of Private Members&rsquo; business.  I made reference to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2004.  Following a cost-effectiveness assessment of the five school buildings that were constructed under PPP arrangements, he indicated that the projected cost over 25 years was 8% to 13% higher than that which would apply by procuring and running the schools using the conventional approach.  </P>
        <P>That is a significant additional burden even though it is spread out over a period of years.  I again point out that this is the main attraction for the Government, spreading it out over a longer period of time and, thereby, in some way, giving the wider populace the sense that less is being spent.  The truth is that more is being spent and more public moneys are being wasted in this PPP approach.</P>
        <P>The Government is taking a very short-term view in its approach to PPPs, primarily for its own selfish electoral reasons, and ignoring the fact that the assets and services must be paid for.  This must be repeatedly exposed and I welcome the recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I welcome and made reference earlier to the constant and continuous comment by Dr. Eoin Reeves and other commentators in respect of this approach to public project procurement, which is a very different PPP than the one we are discussing this evening.</P>
        <P>I do not believe this Bill is amendable or that it can be saved.  This Bill should be withdrawn and the Government should take up an honest position with the electorate and advise it exactly how much things actually cost under the PPP approach.  I note the intent of Deputy Bruton but do not believe any effort at ameliorating the real effect and intent of this legislation is worth pursuing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make two general points.  This Bill is amending legislation.  The basic legislative proposals for State authorities to undertake PPPs are already enacted.  This is Report Stage of a small piece of amending legislation designed to improve the capability of Departments or agencies to procure PPP projects outside the areas of transport and environmental areas.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy Boyle, the report of the Committee of Public Accounts on parliamentary scrutiny will be responded to in the normal man<Col N="118" />ner in a minute of the Minister for Finance in the first instance.</P>
        <P>A number of issues have been raised in connection with this Bill which are more appropriately dealt with under policy guidance rather than in legislation.  This amendment is yet another example in this regard.  There is a comprehensive guidance framework in place with regard to the appraisal, management and evaluation of capital projects, which is revised from time to time.  In general, decisions regarding the publication of information regarding individual project appraisal are time-sensitive in terms of the public negotiating position.  Cost-benefit analysis, like public sector benchmarks, may contain commercially sensitive information which, if published, could prejudice the State&rsquo;s capacity to get best value for money in the procurement of capital projects.  Any decision in this regard must be carefully considered and the circumstances may differ from project to project.</P>
        <P>It would not be appropriate or consistent with the management arrangements in place for capital spending to give the National Development Finance Agency a function in this regard.  Like other aspects of project appraisal and assessment, cost-benefit analysis is a matter for the sponsoring agency in the first instance, not the National Development Finance Agency.  Capital investment takes place under a framework of delegated sanction under which primary responsibility for project selection, assessment and evaluation rests with the sponsoring agency.  Projects are implemented within this framework and subject to the value for money measures.  As I said earlier, the Government will not accept this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Regardless of the fact that the Department or the Minister will respond to the report of the Committee of Public Accounts by way of a minute, there is an opportunity in this Bill to insert certain principles in respect of PPPs.</P>
        <P>The report of the Committee of Public Accounts was clear that there are three reasons that consideration should be given to using a PPP.  One would be to use it as an off-balance sheet item to avoid consideration under the Maastricht criteria in terms of infrastructure spending.  Another would be to have it as a cash efficiency measure in terms of the annual budget and spending all the money at once rather than spending small amounts each year.  The third reason to consider using a PPP would be value for money.</P>
        <P>The report of the Committee of Public Accounts is quite clear that while other countries might use PPPs on the basis of the first and second items, they are not reasons to use PPPs in Ireland because we are very low in terms of our debt-GDP ratio and our budget balance.  The <Col N="119" />only reason we would use PPPs is value for money.  Even though it is amending legislation, the Bill should have put down clear principles in this respect.</P>
        <P>Our objection to this Bill is not as strenuous as that of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  We have strong concerns about the use of PPPs and we do not accept that it is the best finance mechanism for the provision of infrastructure.  However, if we have PPPs, we need the best oversight mechanisms possible and the problem with this Bill is that it does not go far enough.  The Government&rsquo;s unwillingness to accept Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s amendment is a statement of its complacency about the type of oversight mechanisms that exist.</P>
        <P>This is a very modest amendment and only represents an interim step.  It is a long way from the type of oversight that exists in other countries.  PPPs will increase from 1.5% to 10% of infrastructural spending under the national development plan, so we need stronger measures.  That is the disappointing aspect of this Bill and it is particularly disappointing that the Minister of State is not willing to accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought I heard the Minister of State mention value for money, which sounds strange coming from a member of this Government.  There has been so much waste and so many instances where the taxpayer did not get value for money.  It is one of the issues which concerns many people.  This modest amendment tries to ensure that there is more value for taxpayers&rsquo; money, which does not belong to the Minister of State or the Government.  This could be done without compromising commercial sensitivities.</P>
        <P>It is important that we have public accountability for performance at critical gateways.  This has not been happening.  There have been a number of unconnected strategies and projects, such as decentralisation, the spatial strategy and the national development plan.  One-off housing is everywhere and there are housing estates with no infrastructure, no schools, playgrounds, parks or transport facilities.  The whole thing is a mess because there has been little or no accountability.  It is the job of the Government to ensure that there is accountability, but that has not happened.  I am disappointed that the Minister of State will not accept this, but I am not surprised because it would have meant accountability.  Therefore, I have no choice but to withdraw the amendment.</P>

	<P>I have examined this issue in the intervening period.  I have no objection to the Act being reviewed as often as is required.  However, I am not persuaded that a statutory provision is the way to do it.  It is my intention and that of the Department that the Act be kept under constant review and amended as often as necessary having regard to developments in the law.</P>
        <P>A phase two process to amend further the disciplinary provisions of the Defence Act is due to be initiated later this year.  This will provide an opportunity to review the operation of the provisions of this Bill.  The insertion of a statutory time limit within which such a review must be <Col N="121" />conducted is therefore unnecessary.  Such a provision could at some future date cause unforeseen and unnecessary difficulties.  Therefore, I reject the amendment.</P>

	<P>There is no doubt it would be useful to include an enabling provision in the legislation to allow for the review of legislation of this nature.

This amendment refers to a longer period, operating over several years.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.4- ?>
        <P>As a compromise, when the Ministers brings forward the second part of the set of proposals about which he has spoken, he might consider building in such a review mechanism.

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;14.&mdash;The Children Act 2001 is amended by the repeal of section 271.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will be brief on these amendments.  Has the Minister changed his view on this amendment since Committee Stage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I have thought about it but I have not changed my view.  First, I do not believe it would be appropriate for the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill to unilaterally amend the Children Act.  Second, and more importantly, I believe there are good reasons section 271 of the Children Act should not be repealed.  The effect of section 271 of the Children Act is that any person under 18 years of age who is an enlisted member of the Defence Forces will con<Col N="122" />tinue to be subject to military law.  The intention is that the provisions of the Children Act should not take precedence over the provisions of the Defence Acts in regard to military law as they apply to members of the Defence Forces who are under the age of 18.  </P>
        <P>In regard to the application of military law to members of the Defence Forces who are under the age of 18, first, a member of the Defence Forces may only be tried by court martial for the more serious of offences such as treason, murder, manslaughter or aggravated sexual assault if the offence was committed while on active service, which generally equates to serving on a peace support mission abroad.  A member of the Permanent Defence Force shall not be sent on any such overseas mission unless he or she is over the age of 18.  Second, with other less serious offences which are also offences punishable by ordinary law, if the offence was committed in the State by a person subject to military law under the age of 18 while a court marital might have jurisdiction to deal with those offences, in practice these offences would be dealt with by the ordinary courts and the provisions of the Children Act would apply.</P>
        <P>Third, on the issue of breaches of military discipline within the code of military discipline committed by a member of the Defence Forces who is under the age of 18, it is important and proper that these offences are dealt with under the provisions of the Defence Acts.  Many of the provisions in the Children Act would not be appropriate in these circumstances.  In reality, however, the possibility of a member of the Defence Forces under the age of 18 years being the subject of court marital proceedings is extremely remote.  It would normally take some months for the completion of an investigation into an alleged offence and for preparatory matters to be completed.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a person who joined the Defence Forces under the age of 18 and who committed an offence which was to be dealt with by court martial would be tried before his or her 18th birthday.  The danger is more apparent than real.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 16, line 21, after &ldquo;by&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or on behalf of&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will be brief because we discussed this matter at length on Committee Stage.  We should allow <Col N="123" />communication made by or on behalf of a person who is a complainant in the proceedings.  This provision is based on the Prosecution of Offences Act and it prevents certain improper communications about pending prosecutions, and rightly so.  What I am proposing is that it be slightly less restrictive by allowing contact on behalf of the person concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed amendment seeks to change the text of the Bill to reflect that communications made with the director of military prosecutions or a member of staff on behalf of a complainant in proceedings, or on behalf of a person charged with or who believes he is likely to be charged with an offence, or on behalf of a person involved in the matter personally, do not come within the scope of the offence of improper communication with the director of military prosecutions.  I argue that this matter is already catered for in this section of the Bill which, as drafted, provides that communications with the director of military prosecutions made by legal and medical advisers, social workers and other family members of a person involved in the matter do not come within the scope of the offence.  </P>
        <P>The provisions reflect the position in the ordinary criminal legislation pursuant to section 6(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974.  I, therefore, do not consider it appropriate to depart from the current position in the ordinary criminal law.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 42, line 3, after &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and in the name of&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment provides that where a direction has been given by the Director of Public Prosecutions for the trial he should be responsible for the conduct of all prosecutions at court martial.  I seek clarification in the sense that the Director of Public Prosecutions will always prosecute in the name of the people, that is, the people <i>v. </i>accused.  As a result the section does not seem clear who the DPP is prosecuting unless one inserts &ldquo;and in the name of&rdquo;.  While all prosecutions will be in his name, on behalf of whom is the prosecution taking place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Under the proposed provisions of the Bill the director of military prosecutions alone will prefer the charges under military law.  A charge would be laid as the director of military prosecutions versus the accused.  I am advised by <Col N="124" />the Parliamentary Counsel that it is not necessary, therefore, to make the amendment as proposed and I will explain the reason.  In ordinary offences on indictment the Constitution provides that they are to be prosecuted by the Attorney General at the suit of the people.  There are two parties to the prosecution, the Attorney General and the people.  The powers of the Attorney General in prosecutions was transferred to the DPP by the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974.  Therefore, there are two parties, the DPP <i>v. </i>the people.  However, as we are doing here there is only one prosecuting party, the director of military prosecutions.  Therefore, the charge will be the director of military prosecutions versus the accused.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a substantial departure from the normal procedure in the sense that if the DPP operates and prosecutes on behalf of the people, the DPP is prosecuting on behalf of nobody other than himself or herself.  What is the strength of that prosecution?  Given that it does not carry the weight of the people, what weight does it carry?  On whose behalf is the DPP prosecuting, other than on his own behalf?  It appears that is a weakness in the legislation, considering that it is supposed to embody, in so far as possible, the existing tenets of civil jurisdiction and the civil administration of justice.  It seems this is a significant departure in regard to court martial when we are trying to make them as close as possible in terms of the administration of justice within the Defence Forces.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not weaken it in any way, it is simply the way the indictment in this case is formulated.  Article 30.3 of the Constitution provides that if an ordinary criminal offence is being prosecuted on indictment it is to be done in the name of the people and at the suit of the Attorney General &mdash; that was changed to the DPP in 1974.  We have the option &mdash; this has been vetted by the Attorney General and we have legal advice on the matter &mdash; of simply stating that the director of military prosecutions will prosecute an offence under military law in his own name.  It does not lessen it in any way and it does not make any practical difference, it is simply the way the indictment is formulated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>If we have the option, so be it, but why not go along with the existing format which is the format within civil administration of justice?  It appears to depart from that would be the lesser of the more desirable options.  Is there the option?  Is it possible for the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute on behalf of the people in a court martial? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The way all prosecutions are formulated under military law is simply that it is the prosecutor versus the accused.  The only reason <Col N="125" />we do it in the rather unwieldy way for ordinary criminal charges on indictment is the Constitution states we are to do it that way, for whatever reason.  There is no legal reason it should be done that way.</P>

        <P FLI="0">We dealt with this matter in some detail on Committee Stage.  It concerns the desirability of gender proofing all our legislation.  The Minister said he would provide for this in future legislation but that it would be difficult to do so in this Bill, given the way it amends earlier legislation.  I presume that still remains the case.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 53, to delete lines 19 and 20.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment concerns any member of the Defence Forces who is a barrister or solicitor.  I am proposing that where legal qualifications are involved, they should not be excluded from sitting as members of courts-martial.  The situation is similar in the United Kingdom but solicitors and barristers are allowed to sit on juries in the civil courts and criminal cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill provides that any members of the Defence Forces who are barristers or solicitors may not be members of a court martial board.  The amendment seeks to remove this provision.  A person in the Defence Forces who is legally qualified is a potential member of the legal service.  This fact should cast doubt on his or her independence.  In the recently passed UK Armed Forces Act 2006 such persons are specifically disqualified from being members of what in this jurisdiction would be called a court martial board.  I am not disposed to change the provision.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The current provisions in the Bill are modelled on section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993.  Although I would have no objection to the general intention of the amendment, I do not consider it appropriate to depart from the current position in ordinary criminal law.  There would appear to be a practice of making it possible for a relative of the deceased to make a statement, rather than it being enshrined in law.  I am aware that there is an ongoing debate regarding the operation of these provisions in ordinary criminal law.  It would appear to be appropriate to await the outcome of that debate and reconsider the provisions at that stage, as appropriate. </P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Deputies from both sides of the House who contributed to the debate on the Bill.  Subsequent to the debate on Second Stage, I received the finalised report from the Irish Human Rights Commission detailing its observations on the proposals contained in the Bill.  The report is comprehensive.  I wish to record my appreciation of the valuable work done by the commission in considering the Bill.  The commission emphasises that it views the main thrust of the Bill as progressive and an important step towards affording clear and consistent protection of human rights.</P>
        <P>The commission makes several positive observations on the provisions of the Bill.  Specifically, it welcomes the following: structural changes in the court martial system; the introduction of an offence of improper communication with military judicial staff; amendments made to the list of persons who may not serve on a court martial board; the amendment to restrict the role of the court martial board to making findings of fact, as a jury does in the civilian courts; the establishment of an independent military prosecuting authority, the director of military prosecutions; the system for the selection of the director of military prosecutions; and safeguards to ensure his or her independence and security of tenure.  The commission raised an issue regarding the composition of the committee to select the director of military prosecutions.  I amended the Bill on Committee Stage in a manner which I am satisfied will address this valid issue.</P><Col N="127" />
        <P>In addition, the commission&rsquo;s report sets out a number of reservations regarding the replacing of the former appointment of president of a court martial with a new appointment of &ldquo;senior member&rdquo;, as well as the possibility that such an appointment could give rise to influence among members of the board.  I amended the Bill on Committee Stage to remove all references to there being a &ldquo;senior member&rdquo; of a court martial board.  I am also satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards to ensure the differences in rank of the various members of a court martial board which are both necessary and inevitable in a military force will not result in any command influence on the deliberations of the board.</P>
        <P>The commission comments on the establishment of the new office of military judge.  It views the committee involved in the selection process as appropriate.  It welcomes the safeguards provided in section 34 of the Bill as significant in guaranteeing an independent and impartial hearing.  It does suggest the exclusion of civilians as eligible military judges should be considered further.  As I stated, had we discussed amendment No. 7, for both policy and practical reasons, it was decided to opt for a uniformed military judge.  However, this new arrangement and the views of the commission will be kept under review in the light of experience.</P>
        <P>The commission suggests the provision of legal aid for a person considering whether to elect for trial by court martial where such person is charged with one of the potentially more serious disciplinary offences listed in Part II of the schedule of disciplinary offences.  I am not persuaded at this time that the provision of such legal aid is necessary, having regard to all the safeguards built into the system.</P>
        <P>In addition to the commission&rsquo;s report, I have received a submission on the Bill from PDFORRA which generally welcomes the provisions of the Bill and suggests a small number of amendments.  The PDFORRA submission will be considered in the context of the phase two process to further update the disciplinary provisions of the Defence Act.</P>
        <P>The Bill represents a major advancement for the operation of the military disciplinary system.  It represents a sensible and practical model.  It draws on the most recent developments in common law jurisdictions and will serve us well in the years ahead.  The measures included are proactive as regards human rights.  Crucially, they also provide for the effective maintenance of discipline within the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>Once again, I thank everybody for his or her constructive and supportive engagement with the Bill in the course of its passage through the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 10 to 15, inclusive, were discussed at some length.</P>
        <P>During the debate on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il an amendment was accepted to define the term &ldquo;grandfather clause&rdquo; and I have since been advised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel that the reference is inappropriate and I believe it is also politically incorrect.  This was also the feeling in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I will return to amendment No. 2 because we have discussed and agreed amendment No. 1.  Amendment No. 2 provides for an appropriate definition of &ldquo;practical experience assessment procedures&rdquo; as advised by the Parliamentary Counsel and it is relevant to sections 19, 20, 34 and 48.  It is better to deal with the technical assessment and procedures as they are in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The technical assessment board will be established under section 19 of the Bill to assess the eligibility for registration of those persons with ten or more years experience in the State performing duties commensurate with those of architect.  Section 20 of the Bill sets out the procedure for such assessment and includes a requirement that the applicant submit to the board a curriculum vitae providing details of the work carried out by the applicant in the field of architecture, information on projects from the ten year period, a file containing at least four projects for which <Col N="129" />the applicant is responsible and independent verification of all documents submitted.</P>
        <P>I hope that Deputies will accept that these provisions demonstrate that practical experience will be taken on board as an integral part of the technical assessment.  Deputy Durkan knows as well as I that some people applying the title architect to themselves should not be free to practise in public.  Moreover, I point out that the criteria set out in section 20 are clear, fair and it will be the responsibility of the technical assessment board to operate in a fair and equitable manner following enactment of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 10, 12 and 14 are technical amendments that flow from the changes made in section 2 and amendments Nos. 11, 13 and 15 are consequential numbering amendments.  The real issue here is the technical expertise assessment procedure established by the Bill which has, I think, universal support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s assessment because practical experience is an issue that has repeatedly arisen before those of us who have worked in local authorities.  Once upon a time I was told never to challenge a person on technical grounds only to discover that it is always safe to do so because by doing so one immediately hears where the practical and the technical meet &mdash; if they meet.  I do not have a problem with these well-placed amendments.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, has largely dealt with this Bill and this may not be the right time to make this point but I will proceed.  Building control guidelines are laid down in this Bill but I once read of a bridge in another country that collapsed because, as shown by a cube test, the concrete did not come up to scratch.  This was the case despite the existence of relevant regulations and controls and this made me wonder whether adequate provision has been made in this Bill for ongoing assessment regarding the application of regulations to particular structures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not apply to this legislation because it relates to the assessment of people using the title &ldquo;architect&rdquo;.  Deputy Durkan is correct that those of us who have operated in local authorities such as Kildare and Wicklow know there are extraordinary people operating.  Many gifted people who have not gone through formal training will be assisted by this legislation while charlatans will be weeded out.  It is very important that a technical assessment of people who would practise be carried out and this legislation allows for such a provision.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">New section: In page 14, before section 8, the following new section inserted:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">8.&mdash;Section 8(4) of the Act of 1990 is amended&mdash;</P>

        <P LI="3" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) require a person on whom the notice is served to pay to the building control authority the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the authority in relation to the investigation and detection of the matters, the subject of the notice, the service of the notice and the preparation and giving of any warnings before the service of the notice, including costs incurred in respect of the remuneration and other expenses of employees, consultants and advisers,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p10" /><Miles com="ix" />and, as regards the costs and expenses referred to in paragraph (<i>c</i>), in default of their payment, the authority may, subject to section 9 and without prejudice to subsection (8), recover the costs and expenses as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.&rdquo;.</P>
     
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments provide for the recoupment by the local building control authorities of costs incurred in the taking of enforcement measures when there have been breaches of the building code.  We all accept that it is wrong that the taxpayer should bear the cost of a person&rsquo;s misbehaviour, whether it relates to dumping, building or other offences.  The person who offends should carry the cost of his or her misbehaviour.  This legislation will take effect where there have been enforcement measures.</P>
        <P>The amendments arose from the debate in the D&aacute;il on Report Stage and my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, accepted them in principle and promised they would be given further consideration with appropriate text provided.  I proposed a suitable text on Committee Stage in the Seanad which I consider faithfully reflects the debate in this House heard by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I salute the fact that the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disability Federation of Ireland requested these matters be included and am happy to be in a position to propose them for inclusion in the Bill.  Like most people in the House I feel that access to buildings is of critical <Col N="131" />importance as all citizens deserve equality of access.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 3, 4, 6 and 8 provide for amendments to sections 8 and 10 of the Bill to provide for the recoupment by building control authorities of any costs or expenses reasonably incurred by the authority in respect of taking enforcement proceedings.  This also applies also when the application is made under section 9 of the 1990 Act to the District Court by a person seeking the annulment, modification or alteration of an enforcement notice served.  Additionally, it applies to costs incurred by the authorities in making applications to the Circuit Court or High Court under section 12 of the 1990 Act for an order for the removal, alteration or discontinuation of works or the making safe of any building or to prohibit or restrict the use of any building until a fire certificate, disability access certificate or regularisation certificate has been granted.</P>
        <P>It is important to point out that costs may include a variety of things including the investigation and detection of matters, the issuing of warnings prior to the service of the notice, remuneration and other expenses relating to employees, consultants and advisers involved in the process.  The cost may be recouped by a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.  This is a significant move forward that I commend to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister that defaulters do not comply with the regulations set down and cause serious danger to members of the public or whoever occupies the building or buildings.  They may not provide adequate access in the correct manner.  Now that we have arrived at this section the Minister might like to comment on my earlier query on the strength of buildings.  The relevant authority could serve a notice on a person to the effect that a building was not strengthened adequately in a particular way or that the construction was not carried out in a way that would protect people who would use the building.  How will that process be continued?  Adequate provisions are in place for carrying out checks at various stages of construction, including the pouring of foundations.  It can be difficult for local authorities to carry out inspections when a series of large building projects are under way in the area.  Will the Minister comment?</P>
        <P>In the past, the tendency was to err on the side of safety by ensuring that structures exceeded requirements.  Taking a safe bet approach was good.  Modern construction is slightly different because weights, load transfers and so forth are tested to a much finer degree than in the past.  This, too, may be good.  Are the current procedures in place adequate to achieving this task?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The recoupment of costs dealt with in the section refers to costs incurred in the taking <Col N="132" />of enforcement measures for breaches of any aspect of the building code.  I assure the Deputy that in addition to the expenses arising from people trying to dodge their responsibilities, the provision also applies to the costs incurred by the authorities in making an application to the Circuit Court or High Court for the removal, alteration and discontinuation of works in the event of problems being discovered.  It also applies to circumstances in which an authority makes a specific provision requiring the making safe of any building or to prohibit, make an order to prohibit or restrict the use of the building, specifically to do so until such time as the necessary fire certification, wheelchair access certification or regularisation certificate is issued.  The section makes clear that councils have the right to recoup costs in a wide range of circumstances.</P>

	<P>During the debate on Report Stage in this House, a commitment was made that further consideration would be given to increasing fines for breaches of the building code.  This is a matter of interest to Deputy Durkan.  Section 9 already provides for substantial increases in fines.  For example, the fine of &euro;5,000 cited in the Bill was increased from &pound;800.  I am advised that &euro;5,000 is the maximum fine for the jurisdiction of the District Court.  Accordingly, it is not within our remit to propose to increase the figure beyond &euro;5,000.  The fine will, therefore, be increased to the maximum available within the jurisdiction of the District Court.</P>
        <P>The section originally provided for an amendment to section 9 to provide for an increase in the <Col N="134" />maximum fine for conviction on indictment from &pound;10,000 to &euro;25,000.  I propose to increase the original fine further to &euro;50,000.  I hope Deputies from all parties will welcome the amendment which will act as a deterrent for those who may consider it profitable to be non-compliant with building code regulations.  When enacting legislation in this area, particularly at a time of major construction work, I want to ensure no one emerges from the back woods, cowboy fashion, believing it is possible to evade their responsibilities with impunity.  They will be caught and heavily fined, particularly if convicted on indictment.</P>
    </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the proposal.  The deterrent provided for should be sufficient to make an impact on perpetrators of breaches.  In this period of inflated values in the construction sector, the proposal is reasonable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 69(5) was amended on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il by increasing the number for a quorum at any meeting of the board or committee from four to six members.  It arose due to the increase in the membership of the professional conduct committee to 11 members.  The current amendment is necessary to require a quorum of four members for a meeting of any board or committee except for the professional conduct committees which will remain at six members.  The appeals board has five members and the chairperson.  There are also other sub-committees where the quorum of six members would not be appropriate.  The amendment proposes a relatively minor technical change to the numbers for a quorum in the board or committees.</P>

It has been a difficult exercise for all concerned and I appreciate the effort invested in the Bill.  Having agreed the amendments, I assume there is no further business to attend to, other than to make some final comments.  The Minister might avail of the opportunity, if he is in a position to do so, to indicate when he expects to bring this legislation into commission and when the public at large, and practitioners, can expect the provisions of registration and recognition to be brought into effect by the registered bodies, which will be acting, in effect, on behalf of the State in terms of the recognition of building engineer, surveyor and architect.</P>

	<P>The Bill has had one of the longest gestation periods in history.  I attended an RIAI function last week and was told that this legislation was first mooted when Gladstone was in charge of these issues.  The profession has shown commendable patience.  It is an historic occasion.</P>
        <P>I would seek to have the commencement orders made as soon as possible.  Having waited for well over 80 years since the foundation of the State, and a longer period since the time of the previous jurisdiction, we should get on with the commencement as soon as possible.

	<P>Realistically, some categories of those who are eligible to apply for registration as an architect are very anxious to secure such recognition.  Will this happen in the autumn or is it too soon for the Minister to give an indication?</P>

	<P>I do not know what timing will apply but I have already told my Department that I am anxious to proceed in this regard.  This is a legacy for this D&aacute;il.  It is an important piece of consumer legislation.  It is very important to the professions involved and more important still to people who now pay significant fees to architects.  A further point is that important changes are made in the Bill with regard to rogue building, which tended to be overlooked in some of the commentary.</P>
        <P>It is a good Bill.  I will ask my Department to fast-track the commencement arrangements to make sure there is no undue delay.  Given that the legislation is passed, whoever holds this office should get on with the job of making the regulations and doing what should have been done a long time ago.</P>
        <P>I thank Members for what was an incredibly constructive debate.  The Bill was much improved in the D&aacute;il and Seanad due to the constructive role played by Members on all sides.</P>

The amendments are along similar lines.  The Minister and his officials have had an opportunity to consider and reconsider the point very cogently made by my colleague on Committee Stage.  I am very much in the hands of the Minister and his officials as to whether he accepts the points made are valid.  To a degree, they are of a technical nature.  The position of Fine Gael is to ensure the Bill is in the best shape possible.  I will be guided on this issue by the Minister and his officials.</P>

	<P>I understand the sentiments expressed by Deputy Kehoe.  I explained on Committee Stage that while I agree with the sentiments on which these amendments rest, I do not propose to accept them on the grounds that they are, first, unnecessary and, second, they would create technical difficulties in regard to the freezing of statutes to be made publicly available.</P>
        <P>I noted in committee that the principle thrust of amendment No. 4 is already contained in section 3(3) of the Bill, which has regard to Schedule 2, while amendments Nos. 5 and 6 will be overtaken by the programme of statute law revision upon which the Government has embarked.  In addition, there are a number of technical difficulties with these amendments in that they would freeze the list of statutes to be made available at a future point in time to those statutes listed in the Schedules on the day the Bill is enacted.  However, it is important to remember that by the end of the five-year period suggested by these amendments, a great deal of the Acts currently listed for retention in Schedule 1 will have been repealed by other legislation &mdash; for example, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill will repeal approximately 10% of the Acts in Schedule 1.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage I indicated that should any Act currently listed in Schedule 1 remain on the Statute Book in five years that had not at the point in time been repealed, I would be happy to make a copy of that legislation available electronically.

        <P FLI="0">These amendments concern the insertion of 12 Acts into Schedule 1, the list of Acts to be retained.  These 12 Acts were recorded previously as repealed because one or more of the leading sources and reference texts, such as the Northern Ireland chronological tables, the HMSO chrono<Col N="140" />logical tables or Cullinan&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Statutes</i>, indicated that this was the case.  However, following recent further analysis of the purported repealing Acts it has become apparent that these 12 Acts have not been fully repealed.  In some instances, this is because of a saver clause and with each of these 12 Acts the residue has or may have some continuing effect and should therefore be retained pending further substantive law reform in the relevant areas of law.  The Companies Consolidation Act 1908 and other similar Acts are being included in Schedule 1 for the sake of clarity, even though it may not strictly be necessary to list these Acts.  It is important that I provide some details to explain this.</P>
        <P>In preparing the Schedules and the amendments today, a distinction has been drawn between those Acts that have already been repealed with the saver clause limited to past events and those Acts that have a saver clause which means that the Act has an ongoing or prospective effect.  The view has been taken that an Act that is repealed but is subject to a saver clause dealing only with past transactions is treated as not in force for our purposes.  Indeed, under the Interpretation Act 2005 and previous interpretation legislation, repeal of an Act did not interfere with certain past transactions.  Therefore, if one were to regard such a saver clause as preventing a full repeal from taking place, no Act would ever be fully repealed.</P>
        <P>By contrast, an Act that has been repealed but was subject to a saver clause with an ongoing or prospective effect has been treated for the purposes of the pre-independence project as remaining in force.  This is because it can affect future events.  The Companies Consolidation Act 1908 and other similar Acts fall into this category.  Although these Acts are repealed, certain provisions are continued for the purpose of effecting the ongoing operation of companies to which the Acts applied.  To provide the clearest possible list of Acts to be treated as &ldquo;in force&rdquo;, we decided to list these Acts in Schedule 1.  However, I emphasise that their inclusion is purely for the sake of clarity and readability, even though it may not be strictly necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Do I take it we are talking about repealing Acts, but having a saver with regard to any acts done or steps taken under those Acts while they were in operation?</P>

	<P>I suppose some Acts, such as the Slave Trade Act and the Night Poaching Act, would not be of significant relevance today.  However, I see some relevance with regard to company legislation.  Looking at the situation, I take the view we must rely on the official advice as to the best way to frame the approach for the Acts being repealed and the saver clauses or the <Col N="141" />question of anything done under the Acts when in operation.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the point made by the Deputy with regard to some of the language used.  We will refer to that later as a Fine Gael Deputy has put down an amendment on language.  We have given an assurance that we will deal with that at the appropriate time.  However, for legal certainty, some of the legislation has rather archaic language.  The Deputy mentioned the Slave Trade Act 1824.  For legal reasons we must leave that Act on the list, but we will deal with it in further work on this type of legislation in the years to come.  We will, for example, insert the Slave Trade Act 1824, into Schedule 1.  The reason is that this Act was previously treated as repealed.  However, on further analysis of the repealing provision, it has become clear that this was not a full repeal.  It is not suitable for repeal as its remaining provisions may have continuing relevancy to criminal law.</P>
        <P>That is the legal position and that is the advice I have received.  There are other similar examples.  I suggested that this area would be an interesting area for students of law and students in general.  I accept the points made by the Deputy.  It is obvious this is an ongoing piece of work that will be undertaken by others long after us.  We are getting rid of much of the deadwood.  Some Acts are being retained for legal reasons.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 27, in the fourth column, line 11, to insert &ldquo;Mental Health (Ireland) Act 1821&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My colleague, Deputy Kehoe, argued these points on Committee Stage and wanted the Minister and his officials to give further consideration to them between Committee and Report Stages.  His basic point was that the language should be less outdated than in its original presentation.  He feels the proposed amendments produce greater clarity.  I accept there may be legalities attached to the approach taken.  While I support his view on simplicity of language, I am interested in hearing the view of the Minister and the guidance of his officials as to the best way to ensure what we do is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to explain our thinking on this.  These amendments propose to insert new Short Titles with more sensitive language for certain Acts listed in Schedule 1, the Acts to be retained.  As I said on Committee Stage, I agree with the sentiments expressed in the amendments that we must work towards the use of more sensitive language in dealing with all issues, in particular with regard to mental health.  It is my intention that the issue of appropriate language will be dealt with when the legislation in question with these amendments is processed as part of the repeal and re-enactment programme.</P>
        <P>There are a number of technical reasons these amendments cannot be made at this stage.  The Acts in question are known by their existing Short Titles and as such would be referred to in other legislation or legal documents by reference to this current Short Title.  Any major change to an existing Short Title, other than adding a year or to correct an error, would have the potential to cause confusion and legal difficulty.  Furthermore, Schedule 1 has been drafted in such a way as to provide that every Act has an entry in either column 3 or column 4, but not in both.</P>
        <P>In other words, we are, so far as is possible, providing just one Short Title for each Act.  The <Col N="143" />Deputy&rsquo;s amendments, however, would leave the existing Short Title in place in column 3.  That would create an anomaly with the rest of the Schedule.  Indeed, it would also mean that the objective of the amendment would fail to be achieved in that the old Title would remain fully in force.  I hope this explains the position.  I do not propose to accept the amendments on the grounds that they are not workable as drafted.  In addition, the issue raised by them is covered by the Government&rsquo;s ongoing programme of statute law revision.  For these reasons, I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>On the basis that I can give an assurance that the next Government will continue with the good work, I am happy to withdraw the amendments.</P>

Amendments Nos. 15, 82, 83, 84, 93 and 101 propose to delete Acts which on further examination are considered to be wholly repealed on the grounds that prior to independence they were repealed as to all British territory, which at the time would have included Ireland.  Amendments Nos. 26 and 31 and the first part of amendment No. 101 update the Bill to take into account the recent commencement of repeals set out in the Children Act 2001 culminating in Statutory Instrument No. 64 of 2007 which came into effect on 1 March 2007.  The upshot of those repeals is that the three Acts referred to are now fully repealed and can be deleted from the Bill.</P>

        <P FLI="0">These amendments involve two changes in the case of the Court of Probate (Ireland) Act 1861.  Further examination of the Act suggests that it might be relevant to the appointment of members of the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests in Ireland.  Accordingly, it is proposed to retain the Act for the time being and therefore to delete it from Schedule 2 and insert it in Schedule 1.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to repeal the Poisons and Pharmacy Act 1908 in the Pharmacy Bill 2007.  In order to facilitate its repeal and replacement in that legislation it is proposed to retain the 1908 Act in this Bill by removing it from Schedule 2 and inserting it in Schedule 1.  The effect will be that the 1908 Act will not be repealed when this Bill is enacted but instead when the Pharmacy Bill 2007 is enacted and commenced.</P>

        <P FLI="0">These amendments deal with misprints.  Each amendment effects a minor change in the citation, subject matter or Short Title of certain Acts in Schedules 1 and 2.  In respect of changes to subject matter these amendments ensure more appropriate subject matter entries and either align the subject matter with the short title, correct anomalies in the wording of the subject matter or otherwise improve the wording of those entries.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos.  37, 51 and 52 concern corrections to citations, and amendments Nos. 102 and 103 correct the reference to the Short Title of the Political Offices Pension Act 1869.</P>

        <P FLI="0">These amendments insert a number of Acts into Schedule 2, the list of Acts to be repealed.  These Acts were previously recorded by one or more of the leading source reference texts such as the Northern Ireland Chronological Tables, the <Col N="151" />HMSO Chronological Tables or Cullinan&rsquo;s, <i>The Irish Statutes</i>, as either already repealed or not applicable to Ireland.  However, following recent further analysis of the purported repealing Acts, it has become apparent that these Acts apply to Ireland and have not been fully repealed and that some part, however minor or inoperative, remains in force.  However, in each case, the residue is suitable for repeal, as it is obsolete.  Attention should be drawn, in particular, to Poynings&rsquo; Act 1495 which can now be fully repealed.  It provided that all pre-1495 English statute law applied in general to Ireland.  We are taking the opportunity to repeal the Act.  I am glad to have the opportunity to commend the amendment to the House.  The repeal of Poynings&rsquo; Act will not mean the automatic repeal of any Act applied by that law that is part of the Statute Book currently.  This is made clear in the saver clause of section 9(3) of this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is time to consign Poynings&rsquo; law to the history books as no longer applicable after almost 600 years.  It is good to see we are doing this and I am delighted to be part of it.</P>
        <P>With regard to the other amendments, it is clear the statutes no longer have much application to Ireland such as the Courts Martial and Troops of the East India Company Act 1810.  Whatever about ongoing dissension within a certain political party, it would not be dealt with under this Act.  I am happy to be a party to deleting many of these redundant laws from the Statute Book.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 80 inserts an Act of 1810 relating to courts martial and troops of the East India Company into Schedule 2.  This Act was previously recorded as having been repealed by an Act of 1881.  However, on further analysis of this Act, it became apparent that a saver clause prevented it from being fully repealed.  The remaining provisions are suitable for repeal.</P>

	<P>This relates to income tax.  Does this mean the Government is abolishing income tax by repealing this Act?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The Act was believed to have been repealed by two Acts.  However, following recent further analysis of the Acts that purport to repeal this Act, it has become clear that the Long Title has not been repealed.  It is now suitable for repeal following the repeal of all sections of the Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the splurge of promises at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis, I thought the party might be going the whole hog to abolish income tax.  I see that is not so.  Income tax was first introduced at a rate of six pence in the pound as a temporary measure by William Pitt to pay for the Napoleonic war.  Sight has been lost of the temporary nature of the tax.</P>

        <P>Bill, as amended, received for final consideration.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear this process involved lengthy and careful analysis of thousands of statutes and it is appropriate to remember, now that it is heading for the Statute Book, the dedicated work of all the officials and I compliment them all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe and his colleagues in this and the other House for their participation in the debate.  It has been an enormous undertaking for the staff and is a timely reminder of the ongoing need to update our legislation and to make it user friendly, to simplify it, to modernise it, to consolidate and reform it.  It has been an enjoyable experience for me, as has working with the officials and our team of experts.</P>
        <P>This Bill is part of a broader regulatory agenda being pursued by the Taoiseach in Regulating Better.  The Bill is the biggest single statute law revision ever taken in the State and, on enactment, it will have a dramatic effect on the volume of material on the Statute Book, repealing some 3,226 statutes, far more than any other previous statute law revision measure.  In fact it is more than the entire number of public general Acts of the Oireachtas enacted since Ireland achieved independence in 1922.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the work of the team of officials in the Office of the Attorney General who <Col N="163" />engaged in detailed and considerable research to identify both the statutes for retention and those for repeal.  The research involved the identification and assessment of over 60,000 pieces of legislation.  It has been a complex task to identify those Acts that still apply to Ireland and to ascertain whether they are suitable for repeal.  Much work has been done by many people and I thank all of them.  I also thank Deputies and the Ceann Comhairle for giving the Bill the attention it deserves and for their detailed and insightful comments.</P>

	<P>I wish to speak about the urgent need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the serious delay in granting St. Mary&rsquo;s community school, Buttevant, County Cork, permission to build a new school to provide for an increase in student population after ten years delay.  This is a major issue that I have been raising for some time.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, must expedite this decision by notifying the County Cork Vocational Education Committee of her approval for the new school.  She must also make a public statement indicating that she has done so to assure increasingly disillusioned and frustrated people who have been waiting for movement on this important issue since 1997.</P>
        <P>Hitherto, when I have attempted to raise this matter by way of a D&aacute;il question or by seeking a special debate, I have been informed by the Minister that the progress of the project will be considered in the context of her Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  However, like so many other school programmes, this programme is insufficient to meet the needs of St. Mary&rsquo;s community school and full funding must be granted for the new facilities that are required.</P>
        <P>The population of north Cork in particular is growing at an astonishing rate.  Increasing pressure is being placed on all public services, but especially on our schools, our hospitals and our transport infrastructure.  It is not just Dublin and its expanding commuter belt that is experiencing such problems.  For many years the failure to provide new school buildings and school places has been a major issue for Buttevant and the surrounding area.  Buttevant already has a secondary school but, in the past ten years, it has had to make do with the existing building.  Long-promised new facilities, such as a new school for St. Mary&rsquo;s, will be insufficient to meet the needs of <Col N="164" />the local community by the time they are delivered.</P>
        <P>The Minister must act now.  I am not prepared to listen to the same old excuses and for the project to be put on the long finger once again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of underinvestment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office, this Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, funding of &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in the first and second level schools modernisation and development programme.  This unprecedented level of investment will allow us to meet the needs of a growing school population, to modernise existing school facilities and to provide for curriculum reform and innovation.</P>
        <P>Turning to the specific matter in hand, St. Mary&rsquo;s community college is the only post-primary school in Buttevant and is a co-educational provider with a current enrolment of 186 mainstream pupils.  Originally, County Cork VEC applied to the school planning section of the Department of Education and Science for funding towards the provision of a new school building on a greenfield site for St. Mary&rsquo;s community college.  The proposed new school building was to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 325 pupils and the project reached an early stage of architectural planning in 2001.  At that time, the VEC identified a site for the new school and paid a deposit.  The site acquisition was not finalised for a number of reasons and the vendors returned the deposit.</P>
        <P>In light of declining enrolments at the school, the school planning section of the Department carried out a review of second level education provision in the area in consultation with the school authority.  This review took into account factors such as enrolment trends at the school, the impact of projected housing developments and the existing school provision in the general area.  On completion of this review, the Department&rsquo;s initial decision to provide a new school on a greenfield site in Buttevant was confirmed and officials in the school planning section are currently finalising the long-term projected enrolment for this project.</P>
        <P>Approval was given to County Cork VEC to identify a suitable site for the project and a site <Col N="165" />has now been acquired for that purpose.  The building project required to deliver the new accommodation will be considered in the context of the multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>Once again, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter which allows me the opportunity to outline the position of St. Mary&rsquo;s community college.</P>

      <sTitle>Asylum Applications.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for choosing this matter for the Adjournment.  It is a request for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to expedite the asylum application of Mr. Adnan Mohammedi, an Iranian Kurd, who is a victim of torture and whose wife and child are in hiding in the Kurdish region of Iraq.  The other Deputies associated with this issue are Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh, Joe Higgins, Finian McGrath, Healy and Cowley.  If any of the aforementioned Members enter the Chamber while I am speaking, I will give way to them.</P>
        <P>The Minister should review urgently the existing procedures for processing asylum applications in order that those who have been persecuted or tortured are not obliged to wait for years to have their applications determined.  A period of two years is far too long.  While the Minister would assert the period is six months, in practice one finds that most applications take years to process and this is a case in point.</P>
        <P>Mr. Adnan Mohammedi is an Iranian Kurd who fled to Ireland a couple of years ago.  He was a member of Komala, the Iranian socialist party, and he was engaged in underground political work for the party in Iran between 1990 and 2003.  His activities brought him to the attention of Iranian agents who disclosed his whereabouts and activities and he was obliged to flee Iran to receive protection and asylum.  Similarly, his wife and child were obliged to flee to the Kurdish part of Iraq for protection, where they are now in hiding.</P>
        <P>Adnan is in a desperate state of mind.  He is beside himself with worry and concern regarding his family&rsquo;s welfare and safety and, naturally, he wishes to look for them.  The Minister of State may recall that he has gone on hunger strike a number of times and on the last occasion he had his lips sown together to prevent him from consuming water and food.  Eventually, after 15 days, he was prevailed upon to end his hunger and thirst strike.  He went on hunger strike in an effort to secure a visa to travel to Iraq to search for his wife and child there.  As I said, he is beside himself with worry and concern.</P>
        <P>There are two obvious ways in which to solve this problem.  The first is to give him a visa, which would be difficult because he lacks the requisite documents to return to Ireland.  The second solution is to expedite his application for asylum in order that he is not obliged to spend longer wait<Col N="166" />ing to get recognition and to receive refugee status.  The Minister of State should address the issue in an urgent fashion.  This is a human case in which a person who is worried about his family is suffering intensely.  Were his application to be processed and refugee status granted to him &mdash; as Members hope &mdash; he would be able to seek his wife and child and to begin his life again and to re-engage in proper family life.  This issue rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I hope the Minister of State has some good news.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that I preface my remarks by pointing out that it has been the policy of successive Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not to comment on individual asylum applications.</P>
        <P>However, it is a fundamental principle underlying the asylum process that when asylum seekers come here and seek our protection that their cases are fairly and independently examined.  The definition of a refugee is set out in section 2 of the Refugee Act 1996.  Subject to certain exceptions, including where persons may be excluded from refugee status on security related grounds, that definition is:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to return to it.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As the Deputy is aware, under the Refugee Act 1996, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications or appeals in respect of refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted.  These offices are the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>In addition, the UNHCR is given full access to the refugee determination process and can examine any case at any time to ensure that fair procedures and our obligations under the Geneva Convention are complied with.  The task, therefore, for the independent refugee determination agencies, in the case of each individual asylum seeker, is to determine whether, following investigation, he or she is deemed to come within the terms of that definition on the basis of all of the information given by or obtained in respect of the applicant.</P>
        <P>Every asylum application is considered on its own individual merits.  Every asylum applicant is <Col N="167" />guaranteed an investigation and determination of his or her claim at first instance by the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  Where it is necessary and possible, investigations are conducted with the assistance of an interpreter.  Applicants are interviewed by an authorised officer on behalf of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and such authorised officers receive full and comprehensive training in the interviewing of persons seeking a declaration as a refugee.</P>
        <P>Following each interview, an assessment is made of the core elements relating to the case.  Consideration is given to the subjective and objective elements of the application.  The subjective element of an asylum application concerns the applicant&rsquo;s individual circumstances as they are perceived and described by him or her.  The objective element of the application concerns the relevant country of origin information, which comes from a wide variety of sources including, for example, information from organisations such as the UNHCR, Amnesty International, Canadian boards of immigration and other EU member states, as well as media and Internet sources.  In addition to these periodically updated sources, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal have access to up to date news reports regarding events and developments in the countries concerned.</P>
        <P>The assessment carried out includes determining whether an applicant has a well founded fear of persecution, whether the persecution is related to a convention reason, whether the applicant is unable or unwilling to return to his or her own country, what internal protection alternative, if any, might be available within his or her own country, as well as credibility issues, which are always extremely important to consider.</P>
        <P>Every asylum applicant is guaranteed a right of appeal to a statutorily independent and separate body, namely, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Every asylum applicant is also guaranteed access to legal assistance provided by the refugee legal service.  I can inform the Deputy that a final decision on this application will be made on receipt of the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the interest he has shown in this matter and for facilitating me and Deputy Crowe again.  The reason we have raised the issue together, as neighbours in Tallaght, is because of our extreme concern regarding the manner in which this issue is now developing and the way it is being handled.  Less than 50 days remain before the general election and a great deal of politics is in the offing.  However, the people of Tallaght seek clarity in respect of the hospital&rsquo;s future.  The HSE took the decision, approved by the Government, to locate <Col N="168" />the new major children&rsquo;s hospital &mdash; some call it a &ldquo;super hospital&rdquo; &mdash; at the Mater site.  We had difficulty in accepting that but we have moved on.  Now we want to know what the future plans are for Tallaght Hospital.</P>
        <P>I was present some weeks ago when the Taoiseach visited the CDI project in Jobstown and members of the national media asked him if the children&rsquo;s hospital in Tallaght would close, as is claimed by some political posters in Tallaght and even in <i>The Echo</i> this morning.  He said the children&rsquo;s services at Tallaght Hospital are not closing.  That is the question we want answered.  I raised the matter last week in the D&aacute;il.  The Ceann Comhairle is aware that I have raised it at every opportunity at the committee on health and in the D&aacute;il in various Adjournment debates and through other procedures.  Last week the Minister said that no decision has yet been taken as far as the future delivery of services in the region is concerned.</P>
        <P><i>The Echo</i> covers local issues well.  It states in its editorial this morning:</P>
        <P LI="1">&lsquo;Medical politics&rsquo; is a very interesting phenomenon that looks set to feature strongly in the election whenever it is called.  The phrase is extremely apt in terms of our report this week on whether it is actually possible for Tallaght Hospital to co-operate with the planned new children&rsquo;s hospital at the Mater.  It seems that the charter that rules what Tallaght Hospital can and cannot do dictates that it must develop and improve the facilities at the hospital.  Obviously moving any part of the operation to the Mater ..... would conflict with this obligation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Another report that has worried people in the Tallaght region suggests that the Department of Health and Children has sent a copy of the proposed statutory instruments to the hospital.  A prominent member of the hospital board and the director of the Adelaide Hospital Society made reference to that at a political party meeting last week.  It prompted a member of the Tallaght Hospital Action Group to say: &ldquo;These statutory instruments will finally bring into law what we are all afraid of &mdash; Tallaght Hospital closing&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Minister will understand my concern and emotions on this subject.  Even if I did not live in and represent Tallaght, I would still believe that the Tallaght Hospital services must be maintained.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me make my point.  The Ceann Comhairle appointed me to the Tallaght Hospital board in 1988 and I have taken a strong interest in the project since then.  I was a member of the board that opened the hospital in 1998.  I live in the shadow of Tallaght Hospital and, like my neighbours in Tallaght, I want to know the <Col N="169" />position with regard to the future delivery of services.  We cannot create a situation where children&rsquo;s hospital services will not continue to be delivered and, indeed, developed on the Tallaght Hospital site.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State probably has a prepared script.  I hope he listens to what I and my colleague, Deputy Crowe, say on this matter and tries to get answers for us.  We simply want to know what the future holds for the children&rsquo;s hospital in Tallaght.  That is what people in the area are asking.  This is not just about the election, as I hope to be campaigning for Tallaght Hospital long after it, in whatever role I hold.  What is the position with the hospital?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the fact that this matter has been selected for discussion.  It is important for people living in the area.  People are also concerned about what is happening with regard to Crumlin hospital, Temple Street Hospital and the Mater Hospital.  The roll out of services affects children throughout the country and that is the reason we are focusing on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Major decisions are being made about children and their well-being.  The difficulty for public representatives is that the people affected by the decisions are not being told what they are.  They are not being given the full story.  Last November, I raised a matter on the Adjournment in this regard.  I spoke about the necessity for the Minister for Health and Children to respond on the proposed future development of hospital and community services in south Dublin and its hinterland.  The Minister said that no decision had been made about services to be provided at the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Tallaght in the context of the national paediatric hospital and associated urgent care centres.  Has any decision been made about the roll-out of those services?  When will these important decisions be made?  A statutory instrument has been sent to the board of Tallaght Hospital but people are still in the dark about what is proposed.</P>
        <P>A total of 32,000 children attended Tallaght Hospital last year while 30,000 children visited Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Crumlin.  The local newspaper, <i>The Echo</i>, has suggested that the board of the hospital met to discuss proposals or requests to eventually move the service to the Mater site.  According to the newspaper report, a prominent spokesperson said that the hospital will not be moving and that it is seeking to enhance the hospital&rsquo;s services, as its charter directs it to do.  The hospital intends to adhere to the charter.</P>
        <P>On 27 February 2007, the Taoiseach, when asked about the new paediatric hospital at the Mater, said that he did not envisage any changes in Tallaght Hospital, regardless of what happens.  He made similar remarks at the opening of a centre in Kilnamanagh.  However, this appears to contradict remarks attributed to the Minister for Health and Children, who spoke to representa<Col N="170" />tives of a local action group on 16 January last.  She said there would be no tertiary services at Tallaght Hospital.  These services deal with serious illnesses such as heart problems, cancer and so forth.  She also said there would be no secondary children&rsquo;s medical services at Tallaght, which cover illnesses such as tonsillitis, broken limbs, appendicitis and so forth.  The Minister further stated there would be little day surgery, no children&rsquo;s accident and emergency service and no inpatient or overnight beds for children.</P>
        <P>What children&rsquo;s services will be left in Tallaght Hospital?  The area has one of the country&rsquo;s largest youth populations but there will be no local facility for children.  As local representatives do not know and the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children do not appear to know or at least are making contradictory statements on the subject, I hope the Minister will clarify the situation and erase some of the worries shared by parents and residents of the area.  This issue affects not only them but people throughout the city.  They are concerned about where this strategy is leading.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The people in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Crumlin have said publicly that they will not move to the new Mater site.  A representative of the board of Tallaght Hospital, according to the report in the local newspaper, says it will not downgrade children&rsquo;s services at the hospital and suggests it is not moving.  There is talk of a realignment and a merger of the hospital in Crumlin with the Coombe Hospital.  What elements remain of the proposed roll-out of paediatric services in Dublin?  The boards of the various hospitals appear to be taking a different direction from that put forward in the McKinsey report.  I can quote other people on this issue.  There are many contradictions in what is being said publicly and privately.</P>
        <P>Regardless of the election, there is great concern about this issue.  People have a stake in the hospital and they want to know what will happen to it.  The hospital in Tallaght is an amalgamation of a number of hospitals, including the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  The remarks being made by different individuals seem to suggest that the<?oasys _jy ?>children&rsquo;s part of Tallaght Hospital will be removed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Harney, the Minister for Health and Children.  I thank Deputies Crowe and O&rsquo;Connor for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>In late 2005, the Health Service Executive, at the Minister&rsquo;s request, undertook a review of tertiary paediatric services.  McKinsey and Company were engaged by the HSE to advise on the future strategic organisation of tertiary paediatric services in line with best practice and in the best interests of children.</P><Col N="171" />
        <P>The resulting report, &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s Health First &mdash; International best practice in tertiary paediatric services: implications for the strategic organisation of tertiary paediatric services in Ireland&rdquo;, included a number of key recommendations.  It stated that the population and projected demands in this country can support only one world class tertiary paediatric hospital, and that this hospital should be in Dublin and should ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital, that is, should be within walking distance of such a hospital.  It should also provide all the secondary, namely, less complex, hospital needs of children in the greater Dublin area.  It should be supported by a strategically located urgent care service.</P>
        <P>A joint HSE-Department of Health and Children task group was established in February 2006 to advise on the optimum location of the proposed new hospital.  The task group recommended that the new national paediatric hospital be developed on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital.  This recommendation was endorsed by the board of the HSE in June 2006.  At its meeting on 8 June 2006, the Government strongly endorsed the recommendation of the board of the HSE, in line with the recommendation of the report of the task group, that the new national paediatric hospital be developed as an independent hospital on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital.  The Government subsequently reaffirmed this decision.</P>
        <P>The Government also mandated the HSE to move forward with the development of the new hospital and its associated urgent care centres and to explore any philanthropic proposals in respect of its development.  A joint HSE-Department of Health and Children transition group was subsequently established to advance the development of the national paediatric hospital.</P><Col N="172" />
        <P Just="Left">The current stage of the process, which is being overseen by the transition group, involves the preparation of a high level framework brief for the new hospital.  This brief is being developed for the transition group by Rawlinson Kelly &amp; Whittlestone Limited, RKW, an established UK-based health care planning company.  RKW will be advising on a range of issues which will help to inform the design of the new hospital.  For example, it will advise on the preferred model of care, the core services to be delivered at the new hospital and the additional range of services to be provided outside the main hospital through the urgent ambulatory care service, taking account of international best practice in the planning of children&rsquo;s hospital services.  Children attending an urgent care centre who need to be admitted to hospital will be transferred to the new hospital for secondary or tertiary care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report specifically stated that 85% to 90% of children presenting to accident and emergency units do not require to be admitted to hospital and, in the circumstances, it can be anticipated that children attending an urgent care centre associated with the new national paediatric hospital will continue to be treated at the centre and discharged home.</P>
        <P>To date, no decision has been taken in respect of the range of services to be provided at the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Tallaght in the context of the development of the national paediatric hospital and its associated urgent ambulatory care centres.</P>
        <P>RKW has engaged in an extensive consultation process in the course of its work, including consultations with the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Tallaght and the other children&rsquo;s hospitals in Dublin, and its report is expected to be completed this month.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Pilot programmes aimed at reducing the amount of car-based school traffic and the encouragement of walking, cycling, car-sharing, etc., have been in operation in the Greater Dublin Area for some time.  Twenty nine schools are currently participating in the current programme.  This represents the involvement of more than 10,000 students and more than 500 teachers.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 151 together.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of bus lanes is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport and the use of bus lanes is provided for in the Road Traffic (Traffic &amp; Parking) Regulations 1997 and 1998.  The regulations, which have national application, generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists also.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the role of taxis in providing an on-street immediate hire service, an exemption to the restriction relating to the use of with-flow bus lanes is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business.</P>
        <P>Many representations have been received by my Department seeking to extend access to bus lanes in relation to a wide range of other road users including hackneys.  A review of the access issue was carried out in 2001 and took account of the physical characteristics of the vehicles seeking access.  The result of that review was to maintain the existing position.</P>
        <P>Last year, the Road Safety Authority (RSA) carried out and presented to my Department some research in relation to motorcycle safety and proposed that the issue of allowing motorcyclists access to bus lanes on a pilot scheme basis be examined.</P>
        <P>Following consultation with the other relevant agencies, work is now proceeding with regard to the detailed specification of pilot schemes permitting motorcyclists in bus lanes where all aspects of the RSA proposal, including any safety implications, will be taken into account.  Subject to the evaluation of such pilot schemes, more widespread access to bus lanes for motorcyclists can be envisaged.</P>

        <P>Following a two-year comprehensive review of the Rules of the Road by my Department, which culminated in a public consultation process last Summer and the redesign and printing of the publication by the Road Safety Authority (RSA), <Col N="176" />I formally launched the new edition of Rules of the Road on 21 March 2007.</P>
        <P>The Road Safety Authority has now taken over responsibility for the Rules of the Road, as part of its overall duties. The new Rules of the Road is available on the Road Safety Authority website and a link to the publication will be available on my Department&rsquo;s website shortly.</P>
        <P>The new publication is an evolving document and will change as new initiatives come on stream.

        <P>The Integrated Ticketing Project Board has prepared a roadmap for the implementation of integrated ticketing within the Dublin area, based on smartcard technology. Subject to the formal approval of the approach by the relevant Boards of the transport operators, the Integrated Ticketing Project Board will proceed to the next phase of the project which is to go to public procurement.</P>
        <P>The Board of the Railway Procurement Agency has sought clarity on a number of issues given that it is currently the statutory body responsible for delivery of integrated ticketing.  My Department is involved in discussions with the RPA and the independent chairman of the Integrated Ticketing Project Board with a view to providing the necessary clarifications.</P>
        <P>A revised sanction for the project will also be required from the Department of Finance.  My Department is in contact with the Department of Finance to finalise this.

        <P>In the interim, there are in place a range of integrated tickets that allow transfers between Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, LUAS and Irish Rail. There are also integrated tickets available between LUAS and the private bus operator, Morton&rsquo;s Coaches.  Details of these are available from the operators.  More products are being developed in line with market need.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 69, 105 and 107 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 responsibility for matters relating to vehicle standards has passed to the Road Safety Authority.</P>
        <P>The Road Safety Authority has advised my Department that while it has not been provided with the report in question by the UK authorities it is aware of the situation relating to the performance of Irish vehicles inspected by the UK Vehicle Operating Standards Agency (VOSA) for compliance with vehicle standards requirements.</P>
        <P>Insofar as improving vehicles standards and enforcement in this State is concerned, the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 strengthens the institutional framework for improving enforcement <Col N="178" />levels for vehicle and driver legislation and for increasing cooperation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has responsibility for enforcement of road traffic law, including vehicle standards. The Road Safety Authority has now taken over responsibility for matters relating to vehicle standards, roadworthiness testing and enforcement of drivers hours, tachograph and licensing regulations. The Road Safety Authority is putting in place the necessary resources to fulfil its mandate and in that regard four (4) vehicle testers have been recruited. The addition of these testers will significantly strengthen the capacity of the Authority in relation to vehicle standards and it is the intention to provide further resources for that area. It is a priority for the Road Safety Authority in conjunction with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to increase and enhance the arrangements for enforcement of vehicle standards.</P>
        <P>In August 2006 the Road Safety Authority engaged consultants to conduct a fundamental review of the scheme of the compulsory periodic roadworthiness testing of goods vehicles and buses. My Department has been informed by the Authority that it has received the report from the consultants and that it is being examined by the Authority. I expect to receive the report and recommendations from the Road Safety Authority shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 86 and 485 together.</P>
        <P>I would like, at the outset, to extend my sympathy to the family of the person killed and to those who were injured during the incident on 27 March. Indeed, all victims of road traffic accidents and their families have our sympathy.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, driver behaviour, particularly in relation to inappropriate speeds in foggy conditions, has been suggested as one of the main contributors to the particular events of 27th March.</P>
        <P>Drivers must take responsibility for their own behaviour on our roads. Notwithstanding any <Col N="179" />maximum speed limit that may be in force on any particular public road, the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997 provide a general obligation on drivers to ensure that a vehicle is not driven at a speed exceeding that which will enable a driver to bring it to a halt within the distance which the driver can see to be clear. This includes the requirement that drivers should also maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of them so as that they can pull up safely if the vehicle in front slows down or stops suddenly.</P>
        <P>The majority of offences committed on our roads relate primarily to the behaviour of drivers. Hence, the focus of the national Road Safety Strategy (2004-2006), which has just come to an end, was on changing attitudes and behaviour on our roads through a range of measures.</P>
        <P>Significant initiatives identified in the Strategy that have been realised to date include the introduction of a new system of metric speed limits, the further extension of the operation of the penalty points and fixed charge systems from April 2006, the establishment of the Road Safety Authority and the Garda Traffic Corps. The Corps provides the basis for the achievement of the significant gains in road safety that emanate from consistent high levels of traffic law enforcement.</P>
        <P>Other major proposals identified, such as the plans to establish a system of private sector operation of speed cameras under the auspices of the Garda&iacute;, are well advanced by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Meanwhile the NRA is actively considering the deployment of ITS technology, including variable message signage, on the national roads network with a view to rolling it out on a phased basis.</P>
        <P>The Road Traffic Act 2006 enacted a number of key measures.  These include the provision to combat drink driving through enabling roadside Mandatory Alcohol Testing (MAT) and a ban on the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving. Since the commencement of the Act 30,000 MAT checkpoints are carried out monthly by the Garda&iacute; and the number of road deaths and collisions have fallen significantly.  Last year the number of road deaths was 368 &ndash; the second lowest rate in forty years. The Road Safety Authority (RSA) is currently working on developing a new road safety strategy for the period 2007-2011.</P>

It will also fund planning and design work on projects such as City Centre Resignalling, Dunboyne/Navan line (Phase 1 of which includes three new stations), the Interconnector and the electrification of the Maynooth line.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 124 together.</P>
        <P>The Aviation Action Plan, adopted by Government in May 2005 mandated the building of the second terminal at Dublin airport by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA). This decision was driven by the urgent need to provide for additional capacity at the airport in response to the significant growth in passenger numbers there in recent years.</P>
        <P>Under the DAA Capital Investment Programme, provision is made for the delivery of Terminal Two and associated pier facilities (Pier E). Fingal County Council granted planning permission for the project in October 2006 and this is now under appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. An oral hearing will be held by An Bord Plean&aacute;la into the planning permission for T2 on 16 April next. I am assured that the DAA is working to the Government deadline to have the terminal operational by 2009.</P>
        <P>The DAA are required to take full account of the capital appraisal guidelines issued by the Department of Finance and responsibility for compliance with the guidelines rests with the board of the company.</P>
        <P>I would point that, in line with the Government decision of May 2005 mandating the DAA to <Col N="183" />build Terminal Two, independent experts have since reported to me on the specification and cost of Terminal 2. The experts appointed by my Department concluded that the methodology, approach and execution of the planning objectives and considerations for passengers adopted by the DAA accords with best practice. They also found that the estimated cost of the new terminal is within industry norms for this type of project in a European capital city. The verification team report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, (www.transport.ie).  The Deputy will also be aware that the Commission for Aviation Regulation is currently reviewing Dublin Airport charges in the light of the DAA capital expenditure plans including Terminal 2.</P>

	<P>The range of measures that my Department funds through the Transport 21 Programme for the improvement of the transport infrastructure and the prioritisation of public transport apply to public service employees equally as to the general public alike.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A key recommendation of the Travel Demand Management Study that was produced in 2004 by the Dublin Transportation Office (DTO), which is an agency of my Department, was that employers should introduce measures to encourage more staff to travel to work by alternative means to the car. The study recommended that such measures should be introduced in the first <Col N="188" />instance in large public sector organisations in the Greater Dublin Area. The DTO has recently introduced a Workplace Travel Plan for DTO staff.</P>
        <P>The DTO intends to launch a sustainable transport public awareness campaign for the Greater Dublin Area in June 2007. One of the areas it will focus on is encouraging employers, particularly those in the public sector, to introduce Workplace Travel Plans that provide employees with sustainable travel information and incentives to drive less and consider car sharing, cycling, walking and public transport options.  My own Department is committed to supporting and participating in this campaign.</P>
        <P>There are already a number of provisions in place designed to facilitate and encourage the use of public transport, including its greater use by public service employees.</P>
        <P>The Annual Travel Pass Tax Saver Scheme is extensively promoted across the public service and has a high level of take-up among public service employees. There has been a substantial increase in the sale of annual and monthly commuter tickets in recent years.  Much of the growth can be attributed to the tax savings accruing to those who commit to purchasing annual tickets under the Tax Saver scheme, which comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  In 2006, for example, Dublin Bus had 1,700 employers, including employers across the Public Service, actively purchasing monthly and annual tickets directly from Dublin Bus for their employees.</P>

        <P>&lsquo;Transport Access for All&rsquo;, my Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005, along with those of five other Departments, was approved by the Oireachtas in Autumn 2006. The Department of Transport Plan addresses the accessibility needs of people with mobility, sensory and cognitive impairments across all transport modes and contains time bound targets for the progressive realisation of accessible transport <Col N="190" />in Ireland. In general, the delivery of the various elements of the Plan is aligned with the timeframe of Transport 21, the Government&rsquo;s 10-year transport investment programme launched in November 2005. The Plan includes robust monitoring arrangements to ensure timely delivery of its targets and objectives.</P>
        <P>Significant resources for accessibility are being provided under Transport 21 and the National Development Plan 2007-2013 to facilitate further progress. Accessibility is being built into new public transport infrastructure projects and funding is also being provided to continue the phased retrofit of existing infrastructure.

	<P>Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 responsibility for matters relating to vehicle standards, including vehicle testing, has passed to the Road Safety Authority.</P>
        <P>The framework at European level in relation to compulsory periodic roadworthiness testing of motor vehicles is set down in EU Directive 96/96/EC.  In accordance with that Directive, buses and taxis are required to undergo a roadworthiness test every year.  The testing of buses is carried out by authorised testers appointed by local authorities in accordance with the European Communities (Vehicle Testing) Regulations 2004.  In the case of taxis, testing is carried out by National Car Testing Service Limited in accordance with the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2003.  The items to be tested, the method of testing and the reasons for failure of the roadworthiness test for a bus or a taxi are set down in the relevant Test Manual prepared and published by the Road Safety Authority.</P>
        <P>In August 2006 the Road Safety Authority engaged consultants to conduct a fundamental review of the scheme of compulsory periodic roadworthiness testing for commercial vehicles.  My Department has been informed by the Authority that it has received the report from the consultants and that it is being examined by the Authority.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 130 together.</P>
        <P>As part of the necessary preparatory work for the separation of Cork under the State Airports Act 2004, DAA have been advised by consultants on the financial aspects mentioned. In doing so these consultants worked with Cork airport management on business planning requirements. The firm also advised on an appropriate financing proposal, which would facilitate the statutory objective of airport separation in a timely manner, consistent with the requirements of the State Airports Act 2004 and the Companies Acts. I understand that the outcome of this analysis was <Col N="192" />that Cork Airport could sustain a certain level of debt while remaining a very viable enterprise.</P>
        <P>The Cork Airport Development Project, which was completed last year, is comprised not only of a new terminal, but also a fire station, car parks, a combined utility building and new roads and pathways and associated works. As I have said before, the funding of these developments will have to take account, not only of what is commercially and financially feasible for Cork Airport, but also what is commercially and financially feasible for Dublin Airport.</P>
        <P>If the Cork Airport Authority is to achieve autonomy in the foreseeable future, it will have to accept responsibility for a reasonable portion of the outstanding debt, in return for the substantial assets to be transferred to it on separation. In deciding what level of debt is to be borne by Cork, it will have to be manifest to all concerned that it is a manageable debt burden that would not put at risk the airport&rsquo;s commercial future.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the production of the business plans rests with the authorities.  My function, under the Act, is to consider the plans, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, once they have been submitted.</P>

	<P>The Phoenix Park Tunnel is an existing railway line connecting Heuston Station with Connolly Station and North Wall Freight Yard.  I am informed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that the railway line is not used for commuter services because it would not be possible to accommodate additional peak train services into Connolly Station. The lines into and out of Connolly Station are already at full capacity and any additional capacity created in the future will be needed to cater for growth on the DART, Northern Suburban and Maynooth lines.  Connections between Heuston Station and Connolly Station are provided by LUAS and Dublin Bus services. </P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann regards the Interconnector tunnel as the best option for providing additional cross city capacity.  Approval has been granted for design development for the Interconnector alignment and its proposed station locations and layouts.  This is expected to be completed in mid 2007.</P>

	<P>The main contributory factors in road traffic fatalities and injuries are speeding, drink-driving and the non-wearing of seat belts. The influence of drugs on driving behaviour is an issue of increasing concern and has thus been given recognition in the previous Government Strategy on Road Safety.  </P>
        <P>Identification of the presence of drugs is however more complex than for alcohol.  Consequently, considerably more work is needed to develop a more detailed regulatory regime in relation to drugs and driving.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Road Traffic Acts provide that a member of the Garda Siochana may, where he or she is of the opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of that vehicle, require that person to go to a Garda station and further require that person submit to a blood test or to provide a urine sample.</P>
        <P>The Medical Bureau of Road Safety (MBRS) analyses blood and urine specimens received under the Road Traffic Acts for the presence of a drug or drugs.</P>
        <P>At a meeting of the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in July 2006, representatives from all over Europe addressed the issue of random drug testing of drivers at the roadside in the light of the most up to date developments throughout this region.</P><Col N="195" />
        <P>The MBRS and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na participated in that seminar, which concluded that there is currently no device considered to be reliable enough in order to be recommended for roadside saliva screening of drivers for drugs.

	<P>The slots held by Aer Lingus at London Heathrow Airport currently serve an important role in ensuring connectivity between Irish airports and the extensive network of international air services to and from Heathrow.</P>
        <P>In preparation for the Aer Lingus IPO last year, consideration was given to the possible need for measures to prevent the disposal of landing slots at London Heathrow.</P>
        <P>Arrangements to safeguard Heathrow slots are built into the Company&rsquo;s Memorandum and Articles of Association.  The effect of these arrangements, at present, is that any disposal of Heathrow slots can be prevented by 30.4% of the votes cast at an Extraordinary General Meeting. 25.4% of the shares in the Company are held by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the State.</P>
        <P>The Articles of Association of the Company state that I will set out the criteria by reference to which I intend to make recommendations to the Minister for Finance in relation to the exercise of his functions as a shareholder in regard to any possible disposal of Heathrow slots.  Following is my statement of 2 October 2006 which sets out these criteria.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Statement by the Minister for Transport</i></P>
      <P el="5">2 October, 2006</P>
        <P>Heathrow Airport, London serves a unique role in ensuring connectivity to/from Ireland. This connectivity is fundamental both to provide connections to and from Dublin as well as to and from the regions. This is the reason for the mechanism providing for a possible consideration of slot disposals by extraordinary general meeting as set out in the Articles of Association of Aer Lingus Group plc. The Minister for Transport will <Col N="198" />not recommend that the Minister for Finance seek to convene an extraordinary general meeting to approve a slot disposal unless the disposal would result in the slots at London Heathrow falling below the level that is critical to ensuring connectivity to and from Ireland. Such an assessment will be conducted on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the criteria set out below.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Criteria</i></P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport considers that four London Heathrow slot pairs for services to and from Cork and that four (summer season) and three (winter season) for services to and from Shannon would each be critical to ensuring connectivity to these airports because this is the minimum necessary to ensure a spread of flights throughout the day. On this basis, the Minister for Finance as a shareholder in the Company, acting on the advice of the Minister for Transport, is unlikely to support a proposed disposal of any slot pair such that there would be less than the existing London Heathrow slot pairs that relate to services between London Heathrow and Cork or Shannon and is likely to request the convening of an extraordinary general meeting, as provided for in the Articles of Association, to consider such matter. In the event of a proposed disposal of a slot pair subject to the above requirements, the Minister for Transport, when deciding how to advise the Minister for Finance, would take into account the services operated by other carriers from Cork and Shannon to London Heathrow and any evolution of services to other connecting airports from Cork and Shannon. The Minister for Transport would also take account of any relevant direct long haul flights from Cork or Shannon (as the case may be).</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport considers that the level of slots relating to Dublin that are critical to connectivity is that which ensures passengers from and to Dublin can connect throughout the course of the day with key long-haul destination flights to and from London Heathrow. The Minister for Finance, as a shareholder in the Company, acting on the advice of the Minister for Transport, is unlikely to support a proposed disposal of any slot pair relating to services between London Heathrow and Dublin that would result in the interval between air services operated using slots on this route exceeding 90 minutes (not reckoning any time between the last slot on one night and the first slot on the following day) and is likely to request the convening of an extraordinary general meeting to consider such proposal. In the event of a proposed disposal of a slot pair subject to the above requirements, the Minister for Transport, when deciding how to advise the Minister for Finance, would take into account the services operated by other carriers between Dublin and London Heathrow. The Minister for Transport would also take into account services which could be provided via <Col N="199" />other connecting airports, provided that there is relevant available capacity both from Dublin to the other airport and from that airport to key long haul destinations, and any relevant direct long haul flights from Dublin.</P>
        <P>Any new slot (not being part of a swap arrangement) that may be acquired by the Company after the Offer would only become subject to the potential constraints on disposal set out above if the Company decides that any such new slot should be included. Where the Company has decided that any new slot should not be so included then the Minister for Transport shall not have regard to any air services being provided using that slot in considering a proposed disposal of any other slot.</P>

Such extraordinary general meeting shall be convened for a date occurring within two months of receipt of the request in writing from the shareholders holding at least 20% of the Ordinary Shares. Such an extraordinary general meeting may also be convened by the Company of its own volition, provided that it is fixed for a date which is no sooner than 21 days from the giving of the notices referred to in paragraph (b).

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 88, 112 and 167 on 21 February, 2007.</P>
        <P>In relation to driver disqualification a framework for the mutual recognition of disqualifications is contained in the European Union Convention on Driving Disqualifications (98/C 216/01).  The Convention relates to disqualifications arising from a range of specified traffic offences including drink-driving, speeding and dangerous driving.  Irish legislation to support the application of the Convention is contained in the Road Traffic Act, 2002.</P>
        <P>In advance of the Convention fully coming into force and following a Ministerial meeting of the Transport Sectoral Group of the British-Irish Council on 9 February 2006, I have formally agreed with the UK Minister of State for Transport to enter into bilateral arrangements on the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications as envisaged in the EU Convention.</P>
        <P>The UK Minister for State for Transport wrote to me recently advising me that it is now likely to be later than the first half of 2007 when the UK and NI authorities will have the necessary legislative and consultative processes complete to enable mutual recognition to be put in place.  Officials continue to work to ensure that the necessary administrative arrangements are in place to enable relevant administrations to recognise and take action on driving disqualifications occurring in the other jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>In relation to lesser offences, the North South Work Programme, as agreed by the North South Ministerial Council, included a commitment to examine the mutual recognition of penalty points between the Republic of Ireland and the North.  However, in addition to the fact that separate penalty point systems operate in the two jurisdictions on this island, the system that operates in Northern Ireland differs from that applying in Great Britain.  For that reason, it was agreed that it would be more appropriate to pursue the question of mutual recognition of penalty points on the basis of the operation of the three systems and that it would also be more appropriate that it would be dealt with under the auspices of the British-Irish Council.</P>
        <P>As Northern Ireland has the lead role for transport matters in the BIC, the authorities in that jurisdiction are taking the lead in considering this issue.  It was agreed at the British-Irish Council meeting on the 9 February 2006 that officials <Col N="205" />should examine the prospects for greater co-operation in the treatment of road traffic infringements where the penalty falls short of disqualification.  Arising from work in this area I have agreed with the UK Minister for State for Transport the terms of reference proposed for a study of the feasibility of greater co-operation between us in relation to lesser road traffic infringements with a view to our officials undertaking a study on this basis.  Work on this study is ongoing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The roll-out of the penalty points system to the range of offences set out in the Schedules to the Road Traffic Act 2002 was commenced in October 2002 in respect of speeding offences.  It was progressed further in 2003 to cover driving without insurance and non-wearing of safety belt offences and extended in 2004 in respect of the offence of careless driving. </P>
        <P>The range of penalty point offences was significantly extended from 3 April 2006 with the addition of 31 new offences.  The most recent extension was in September 2006 to bring the offence of holding a mobile phone while driving within the ambit of the system.  The total number of offences to which the penalty point system now applies is 36.</P>
        <P>The focus of the roll-out of the penalty points system to date is on offences that relate primarily to the behaviour of drivers.  This reflects the fact that 86% of all road deaths can be attributed to driver behaviour in its broadest sense.</P>
        <P>The relevant support systems must be put in place to support the extension of the penalty points system, and where applicable, the fixed charge system.  Discussions are held in advance with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other agencies regarding the timing of each scheduled roll-out of new offences to ensure that the relevant interfaces are in place between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Court Services IT systems, and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who holds and administers the National Driving File.  The progressive extension of the penalty point system will continue to be pursued.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 143 together.</P>
        <P>The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) began a public consultation on five potential routes, A to E, for connecting the two existing Luas lines in November 2005.  During public consultation a new option, F, was identified.</P>
        <P>Options A and F emerged as the better options and RPA launched a second phase of public consultation in January 2007 involving an open-day, display days, newspaper notices and distribution of newsletters focusing on the selection of the best of these two route options.</P>
        <P>I also understand that the RPA engaged in dialogue with Dublin City Council, Dublin Bus and the Dublin Transportation Office in relation to the implications of the potential routes for bus services and other road users.  Arising from these discussions, Dublin City Council and the Dublin Transportation Office recommended that a traffic management plan for the city centre be initiated to facilitate light rail, bus and metro development.  Dublin City Council will undertake the necessary traffic modelling and is committed to delivery of early results from this work, by Autumn of this year.</P>
        <P>The Board of the RPA recently decided that its preferred route option for the cross-city Luas line is option F.  The RPA now plan to commence detailed design work on the project based on this option.  This will take account of the results of the City Council&rsquo;s traffic modelling results as they become available.  Following completion of this design work, and subject to a satisfactory outcome to the city centre traffic management planning work, the RPA will submit a Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The construction timescale will be dependent on the outcome of this statutory approval process.</P>
        <P>A second stage of this project will extend the line to Liffey Junction via Grangegorman and Broadstone.  The selection of an emerging preferred route for the cross-city link will facilitate the commencement of work on the route selection for the onward extension to Liffey Junction.  Subject to an enforceable Railway Order, the scheduled completion date for the overall project is 2012.</P>
        <P>It is untrue to say that funding has not been provided for the linking of the Luas lines in the 2007 Estimates.  My Department has allocated &euro;173m towards the advancement of all Luas and Metro projects, including funding for the continuing planning and design work on the cross-city link.</P>

	<P>I refer to my reply to Question Reference No. 8659/07 on 6 March, 2007:</P>
        <P>The Department of Transport has recently funded a scheme to convert 50 selected vehicles to run on pure plant oil (PPO), which is being carried out under the aegis of the German-Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce.  The cost to the Department is &euro;227,000 and provides for 75% of the cost of engine modification.</P>
        <P>Decisions about successful applications are being made in April with the view to obtaining a diverse mix of transport operators.  It is expected that this scheme will be complementary to the Minerals Oil Tax Relief (MOTR) Scheme II, which aims to place 163 million litres of biofuels on the market at a cost of &euro;200 million, and will help develop a sustainable indigenous network of localized PPO supply chains in Ireland.</P>
        <P>However, this scheme does not apply to private cars as it is targeted at hauliers or captive fleets maintained by local authorities or public organizations.  In Budget 2006, the Minister for Finance provided for a 50% VRT relief on flexi-fuelled vehicles (FFV), which are capable of operating on 85% blend, for 2006 and 2007.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (DCMNR) announced obligatory 5% fuel blending by 2009, which will help to achieve the indicative target of 5.75% set out in the Biofuels Directive 2003/30/EC.</P>

        <P>A Commencement Order in July brought a number of the provisions in the Act into effect, including the introduction of Mandatory Alcohol Testing (MAT) checkpoints, from Friday 21st July 2006.  Approximately 30,000 Mandatory Alcohol Testing checkpoints are being operated by the Gardai every month.</P>
        <P>Section 5 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 provides for the introduction of a fixed charge and disqualification for certain drink driving offences.

	<P>Regulation (EC) No. 2320/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security has been in force since January 2003.  This Regulation and a number of implementing regulations have been adopted into our National Civil Aviation Security Programme (NCASP).</P>
        <P>A common position of the Transport Council on a Regulation to replace Regulation 2320/2002 was adopted on 11 December 2006 and is currently before the European Parliament for a second reading.  The proposed new Regulation sets out to clarify, simplify and further harmonise requirements in relation to civil aviation security with the objective of enhancing overall levels of security.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the aviation security practices and procedures implemented at Irish airports conform to the highest standards set down in the European Union common rules.  These practices and procedures are subject to monitoring by my Department&rsquo;s Aviation Security Division and are also the subject of periodic reviews by international organisations, such as the EU Commission and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).</P>
        <P>It is not the practice to comment on specific security measures in place or that may be implemented at Irish airports.  However, aviation security arrangements at Irish airports are kept under continuous review by my Department and the National Civil Aviation Security Committee, which is chaired by a senior official from my Department.  The Committee comprises representatives of Government Departments, State Airports,  airlines,  the Garda Sioch&aacute;na,  the Defence Forces,  Customs and Excise,  An Post,  Irish Aviation Authority,  the Irish Airline Pilots&rsquo; Association and the Regional Airports.</P>
        <P>On 21 February last I announced that the Government had given approval for capital grant allocations amounting to &euro;86 million under a new scheme for the six regional airports.  In the case of Ireland West Airport Knock, a total of up to &euro;27.1 million is being allocated which includes &euro;9.9 million for safety and security projects.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 475 together.</P>
        <P>In line with its commitments in the Programme for Government, the Government approved the establishment of an Office of the National Taxi Regulator in November 2002 which led to the enactment of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 and the establishment of the independent Commission for Taxi Regulation.  The objectives of <Col N="212" />the Commission include to promote the development of high quality cost effective services by small public service vehicles and their drivers which meet a wide range of customer needs including those of passengers with mobility or sensory impairments, and to promote access to small public service vehicles by persons with disabilities.</P>
        <P>Since 26 September 2005, the independent Commission for Taxi Regulation has been responsible for the development and maintenance of the regulatory framework for the control and operation of taxis, hackneys and limousines, including the licensing of such vehicles under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, as amended.  The Commission for Taxi Regulation is reviewing the current wheelchair accessible taxi specification in the context of a consultation process on vehicle standards generally which took place recently.   An outline proposal from the Commission for a draft subsidy scheme to assist with the purchase of wheelchair accessible taxis and hackneys is also being examined in my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 480 together.</P>
        <P>A number of measures relating to transport are being included in the new Climate Change Strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  These include a rebalancing of motor taxes, a Mineral Oil Tax Relief for biofuels, a modal shift through Transport 21 and the achievement of a 5.75% biofuels blend in fuels by 2010.  In all the <Col N="214" />transport sector will provide up to 13% in total national emission savings under that Strategy.</P>
        <P>The completion of projects identified in Transport 21 will see public transport capacity in the Greater Dublin Area almost double over its ten-year implementation period and modelling of the impacts of Transport 21 in the Greater Dublin Area shows a reduction of 6% in fuel consumption and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions during rush hour in 2016.  This will increase to 20% with the implementation of demand side management measures.</P>
        <P>I have also announced the preparation of a Sustainable Transport Action Plan, which will support the revised National Climate Change Strategy and Energy White Paper.  This Action Plan will set out a broad suite of policies and measures to help the transport sector progress along a more sustainable trajectory and make a critical contribution to reducing emissions to 2020.</P>
        <P>The Action Plan will include consideration of measures such as:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Soft measures to reduce car use, including car sharing, flexible working, travel blending and individual or workplace travel plans with leadership being demonstrated by the public sector,</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Additional initiatives such as public awareness campaigns on eco-driving as well as support for alternative fuels and technologies for public transport, haulage and taxi fleets,</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Support for EU proposals to reduce CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions of new passenger cars to an average level of 130 g/km,</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Support for a higher biofuels target of 10% by 2020,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Transformation of the public transport fleet to a more sustainable basis by mandating that existing buses and rail engines move to a 5% biodiesel blend with new vehicles to a higher blend of 30% biofuels in as short a time-frame as possible as well as the consideration of hybrid electric buses as part of fleet replacement,</P>

        <P>This commitment has guided my Department in developing transport policy.  An integrated and sustainable approach to the development and delivery of public transport services is central to my Department&rsquo;s Mission Statement and is reflected in specific policy objectives outlined in my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 is perhaps the most striking example of the implementation of this integration policy in my Department.   Transport 21 will create a transport network which connects roads, rail, ports and airports, facilitating ease of connection for people and goods.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 will deliver a fully integrated transport network for the Greater Dublin Area, comprised of heavy and light rail, new Metro services, buses and strategically targeted park and ride facilities.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 will improve integration in the provincial cities also by expanding public transport provision and by developing traffic management and park and ride facilitates to enable ease of interchange.</P>

        <P>The OPW provides expertise, advice and maintenance services concerning energy usage and has, for example, installed its Building Management Systems in buildings occupied by my Department.

	<P>Feeder bus services to/from, and car parking facilities at, commuter rail stations are operational matters for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and bus operators.  I agree that feeder bus services are important in optimizing the use of the train service and understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and bus operators seek to develop such services where feasible.  I understand from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that feeder bus services are in operation at various stations throughout the network including, for example, at Sallins for Naas. The recently opened Docklands station is served by a city centre feeder bus operated by Dublin Bus, Dublin Bus also operate services that connect to other stations on the DART/Commuter lines. </P>
        <P>The position in relation to intra-county bus services is that Bus &Eacute;ireann and private bus operators currently provide an extensive network of bus services throughout the country linking provincial cities, towns and villages.  Transport 21 recognises the critical importance of bus services generally, including provincial bus services, as part of an integrated transport system.  In this context I approved funding of &euro;50 million in September 2006 for the purchase by Bus &Eacute;ireann of 160 new buses for deployment throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The Rural Transport Programme has also been extended.  This provides local transport for those living outside major population centres to towns throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Decisions in relation to parking charges for the use of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann car parks at railway stations are a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann having regard to the location of the car park, the demand for places, and, other factors, such as the need to ensure that the facility is reserved for different categories of rail users.</P>

	<P>The re-opening of the Mullingar to Athlone rail line was considered as part of the Strategic Rail Review. The review did not recommend inclusion of the scheme in the list of new rail schemes. On this basis the project was not included in Transport 21. I have met representatives of the Midlands Railway Action Group on a number of occasions and a report prepared by the group is under consideration in my Department and in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. I understand that the group have also discussed their proposals with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the fact that 93% of those detected for driving carelessly did not have Irish driving licences; if he has discussed this problem with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the measures he will introduce to deal with this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P Just="Left">I assume the Deputy is referring to statistics on penalty points that show that, up to the end of February, of a total of 1,396 cases where penalty points have been applied for careless driving that 1,312 have no driver number. While no driver number may indicate either a person who has no driving licence or holds a foreign driving licence it is also possible that no driver number indicates that an Irish driving licence holder did not present his or her driving licence to the Courts. I therefore do not accept that 93% of drivers prosecuted for driving carelessly are foreign drivers.</P>
        <P>Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 477 of 2006) the Road Safety Authority has responsibility for ensuring that penalty points are endorsed on a driving licence record. Data in relation to penalty points is held on the National Driver File, which is administered by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>All careless driving cases go to Court as the option of a fixed penalty payment does not apply. Notification of conviction is sent electronically by the Courts Service to the National Driver File. Where the notification includes the driver number the penalty points are applied to the appropriate driver record in the National Driver File.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the Courts Service to ensure that the driver number is included in the notification. I am not happy that in the vast majority <Col N="223" />of cases notifications sent by the Courts Service to the National Driver File, driver numbers are not included. Both my Department and the RSA have been in contact with the Courts Service with a view to ensuring that driver numbers are included in notifications. Under section 22 of the Road Traffic Act 2002 as substituted by section 21 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 a person is required to produce his or her driving licence to the Court and is guilty of an offence if they fail to produce the licence.</P>

        <P>In October 2006, the European Commission published a proposal for a directive to require existing HGVs to be retrofitted with enhanced mirrors on their passenger side to improve the lateral field of indirect vision of drivers.  At a meeting of the EU Transport Ministers in December 2006 the Transport Council reached agreement on a general approach to the draft directive.  Essentially, the approach involves requiring HGVs registered since 1 January 2000 to be retrofitted with the enhanced mirrors within three years of the directive coming into force.  Also at the Council, in response to requests from a number of Member States, including Ireland, to include in the proposals measures to address the blind spot to the front of existing HGVs, the Transport Commissioner indicated that the Euro<Col N="225" />pean Commission would undertake a study of this particular matter.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Road Safety Authority will await the outcome of the Commission&rsquo;s further consideration of this matter and that of the European Parliament in relation to the retrofitting proposals before proceeding further with the development of national measures in relation to the retrofitting of mirrors to existing HGVs. The Authority will be pressing for the Commission and the Parliament to conclude its work as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Property Registration Authority that Rules 17 and 18 of the Land Registration Rules 1972 <Col N="229" />deal with applications for registration based upon possession.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>Rule 17 makes provision for applications for registration based on possession. Rule 18 provides that every title to property the subject of an application under Rule 17 shall be examined under the supervision of the Property Registration Authority (formerly the Registrar of Titles) and the Authority shall direct such searches, advertisements, notices and enquiries as it may deem necessary. I understand that the Authority&rsquo;s standard practice is to serve notice on the registered owner or the personal representative of registered owner and immediate next of kin if the registered owner died intestate. Normally, notice will also be served on all persons in occupation at the date of death of the registered owner, or their personal representatives if deceased. Other persons may also be considered for notice, e.g. adjoining owners, tenants under an oral tenancy, occupiers of other parts of folio lands, owners of charges, depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case.</P>
        <P>I am also informed that notices are usually published in a newspaper circulating in the area where the property is situated in all cases of doubt as to the identity or whereabouts of the owner or his successors, particularly in cases where the applicant asserts that he does not know the identity or whereabouts of the persons entitled or where it appears that the information furnished is incomplete. Where it is claimed that a person has left the jurisdiction, notices are published in a national or other appropriate newspaper and in certain circumstances notices are also served on the adjoining owners.</P>

	<P>Aside from staff availing of statutory entitlements or entitlements consistent with their conditions of service as Civil Servants (annual leave, sick leave, maternity leave, parental leave, etc.), no staff in my Department are not working and in receipt of full wages.</P>
        <P>In relation to staff availing of leave entitlements for the full month of March, the position is that as the month only ended on Saturday last, it is not possible at this stage to say how many staff were absent for the entire month, while on full pay.  However, I can say that they would represent a relatively small proportion of the 1,900 staff working in my Department.</P>
        <P>Finally, it would be relatively easy to draw incorrect conclusions from the absence of staff on leave with full pay.  Take for example the case of a woman on Maternity Leave.  In Budget 2006, the Government announced the extension of Maternity Leave to 26 weeks paid and 16 weeks unpaid.  While there is a cost to the extension of this leave, the Government is firmly of the view that putting the needs of expectant and new mothers, their children and their families first is the right thing to do, both socially and economically.</P>

	<P>Foreign national parents of Irish citizen children do not have an automatic right to reside in the State solely by virtue of such parentage.  An administrative scheme for processing applications for permission to remain in the State based on parentage of Irish citizen children finished in February 2003 subsequent to the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision (23 January 2003) in the L &amp; O cases.  On 18 July 2003 I announced the Government&rsquo;s policy in regard to the applications for permission to remain which were outstanding.  The policy included a decision that there could be no presumption in favour of allowing parents granted permission to remain to be joined in the State by other family members (including other children).</P>
        <P>On 15 January 2005 I announced the revised arrangements for the processing of claims for permission to remain in the State from foreign national parents of Irish children born prior to 1 January 2005.  That scheme, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 Scheme, finished in March 2005.  All those who availed of the IBC/05 Scheme signed declarations indicating their acceptance that permission to remain granted to them under that scheme would not confer any entitlement or legitimate expectation on any other person, whether related to them or not, to enter the State.  Applications from a number of parents, other than the parents granted permission to remain, to be allowed enter and/or remain in the State under the scheme were refused on the basis that certain conditions of the scheme were not satisfied.  In November, 2006 the High Court ruled in favour of a number of those persons and quashed the decisions to refuse their applications.  The High Court decision is the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
        <P>The general policy of the Government, where requests for family reunification in this area are concerned, has been and remains that permission for the spouse to enter and/or remain in the State is considered on a case by case basis but that there is no automatic right for a spouse to enter the State to join the family in question.</P>
        <P>If the Deputy has a specific case in mind he should contact the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service who can advise on the policy and procedures in regard to the case.</P>

	<P>Section 12 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 (substituted by section 2 of the Road Traffic Act, 2003) provides that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may request the provision of a preliminary breath specimen or the provision of a blood or urine specimen from a person who the member is of the opinion has been involved in a collision.  Section 15 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 provides a power to require the provision of a blood or urine specimen from the driver of vehicle who has been admitted to hospital following a collision, where an opinion has been formed by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the driver has consumed an intoxicant.</P>
        <P>The Headquarters Directive referred to sets out the Commissioner&rsquo;s policy for the enforcement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of this legislation.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been directed that, as a matter of policy, section 12 should be exercised (i) in all instances where a Garda is of the opinion intoxicating liquor has been consumed or (ii) where a Garda is of the opinion that the person in charge of a vehicle is, or has, with the vehicle, been involved in a collision, unless that Garda is of the opinion that the person has not consumed intoxicating liquor, and unless circumstances, such as the need to render medical assistance, require otherwise.  Members <Col N="234" />of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have also been directed that section 15 should be exercised where the driver of a vehicle has been admitted to hospital following a collision and a Garda has formed the opinion that the driver has consumed an intoxicant.</P>
        <P>Section  4 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 provides for the testing of drivers, without individual suspicion that the driver has consumed alcohol.  Under the section a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who is on duty at a checkpoint established under an authorisation, may stop any mechanically propelled vehicle at the checkpoint and, without prejudice to any other powers (including the powers under section 12 of the Act of 1994) conferred on him or her by statue or at common law, may require a person in charge of the vehicle to undergo a breath test.</P>

        <P>In addition to the Garda CCTV systems already in operation, contracts for systems in Ballyfermot, Clondalkin and Tullamore have been placed and implementation will be completed in a number of weeks.  Tenders have issued for another nine locations (Castlebar, Drogheda, Ennis, Kilkenny, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght and Waterford) and requests for tender for a further five locations (Athlone, Carlow, Clonmel, Dungarvan and Kinsale) will issue in the near future.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the capital cost of providing one CCTV camera under the Garda CCTV programme is approximately &euro;35,000.  The number of cameras required to be installed in any town would vary according to the area required to be covered and the geographical layout of the town.</P>
        <P>Under the Community-based CCTV scheme financial assistance may be provided to qualifying local organisations towards the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV schemes. The Scheme offers both pre-development grants of up to &euro;5,000 to enable qualifying applicants to investigate the need for CCTV in their area and to complete a detailed proposal, and substantial grants of up to &euro;100,000 from my Department to install a CCTV system in their area.

	<P>I have asked the Office of Public Works to prepare a development plan for the site. This plan will, when finalised, include detailed proposals for the utilisation and development of the site and will also take account of issues to include heritage and historical context as well as the proper and sustainable development of the area itself.</P>
        <P>I have been advised that the Office of Public Works has appointed a multi-disciplinary team which is currently engaged in the production of a site master plan / re-zoning submission. I understand that this engagement is proceeding in conjunction with Dublin City Council&rsquo;s Local Area Plan for the Mountjoy/Phibsboro area. The planning consultants have also been appointed.</P>
        <P>Mountjoy will continue to operate as a prison until the new complex at Thornton has been completed and is fully operational, which will not be before 2009/2010. It is too early at this stage to indicate the precise means of disposal or its utilisation.  This will be dependant in part on the outcome of the multi-disciplinary team&rsquo;s deliberations and the planning process.</P>

        <P>Insofar as applicants for visas, citizenship, residency status and related immigration matters are concerned, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, which forms part of my Department, operates four separate help lines to handle their queries.  Callers to the help lines are greeted by an automated answering service with recorded information messages and a menu option which effectively asks them which of the four help lines they wish to be connected to.  When automatically put through to the help line they require, they speak to one of the staff assigned to the help line.  I can also inform the Deputy that the maximum number of calls which are queued to each of the four help lines at any given time is ten.</P>
        <P>I&rsquo;m sure the Deputy will appreciate that there is a balance to be struck between the resources allocated to giving information about these applications and dealing with such applications and I can inform hin that the allocation of resources in this regard is kept under regular review.</P>
        <P>Finally, it may also be of interest to the Deputy to note that the Department is in the process of replacing its current website with two new improved websites dealing with general Departmental matters and with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service respectively.  These websites will be introduced within the next few months and will considerably enhance the Department&rsquo;s communications with its customers and with the public generally.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that they do not approve for payment expenses that may be incurred by members of the force in connection with the use of private mobile phones. The policy of the Garda Commissioner is to promote the use of the organisation&rsquo;s radio systems as the approved communication system of the Force. I have provided the Commissioner with significant funding to both maintain the existing radio systems and to provide for a new state of the art digital radio service.  Implementation of the new digital radio service has already commenced and the preferred bidder are  now installing the service in a large area in North Dublin to demonstrate the performance of the system. This is scheduled to be completed by mid-July and thereafter, nationwide rollout will be completed within 2 years. As the rollout progresses and radio coverage is available, the garda&iacute; will be migrating onto the new service.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also provides official mobile phones to individual members as required.  In addition, mobile phones are made available to members in order to report incidents to the Garda Information Services Centre in Castlebar so that they do not have to return to their stations to enter the details onto Pulse.  These phones can also be used to contact the local station as well as emergency services as required.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that the cost of introducing mandatory drug testing along the lines described by the Deputy would be in the region of &euro;300,000, not including staff and other costs.  However costs would obviously differ depending on the frequency of testing, whether all prisoners would always be tested or whether a random or targeted testing model was to be used.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 25 April 2005 and applied for asylum. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was informed by letter dated 29 September, 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations received on his behalf for temporary leave to remain in the State. On 23 November 2005, I refused temporary leave to remain in the State and signed a deportation order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring him to present himself to the Garda National Immigration <Col N="246" />Bureau (GNIB), 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on 5 December 2005, in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State. The person concerned failed to present himself as required  and was classified as evading his deportation. He should present himself to the GNIB without any further delay.</P>
        <P>The effect of the deportation order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State.</P>
        <P>An application for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006, Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006, on behalf of the person concerned was made by his legal representatives and submitted by letter dated 29 October 2006. Said application was refused by my Department by letter dated 13 November 2006. The basis for the refusal was that the deportation order was signed by me on 23 November 2005, whereas the Regulations came into operation on 10 October 2006 and do not operate retrospectively.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of the deportation order is now an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,178 following the attestation of 273 new members on <Col N="247" />Wednesday 14 March, 2007. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258. Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Store Street, Bridewell, Fitzgibbon Street, Mountjoy and Cabra Garda Stations on 3 April, 2007 was as set out in the table hereunder:</P>

Under these new Regulations the income limits and allowances which govern eligibility for civil legal aid were all increased significantly, thereby ensuring that the scheme continues to provide effective access to legal advice and representation for persons on modest incomes.</P>
        <P>Insofar as the assessment of eligibility is concerned, the Deputy should note that the determining factor is not gross income (as reflected in the average industrial wage) but rather disposable income, which for the purpose of these Regulations is arrived at by deducting from gross income the amount of  income tax and social insurance paid as well as certain specified and generous allowances for dependants, accommodation and childcare costs.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise <Col N="251" />the Deputy that I am fully committed to giving victims of crime a central place in the criminal justice system.</P>
        <P>The Victims Charter entitled &ldquo;Victims Charter and Guide to the Criminal Justice System&rdquo; provides a written framework of rights and entitlements against which crime victims can measure the level and standard of treatment received in their dealings across all sections of the criminal justice system.  It sets out, from the victim&rsquo;s perspective: a general description of the overall criminal justice system; a concise summary of the role and functions of each of the main bodies/agencies involved; and the entitlements of the victim in terms of standards of treatment, rights and complaints procedures in each area.</P>
        <P>A guiding principle of the Victims Charter is a commitment to giving victims of crime a central place in the criminal justice system. As indicated in the Charter, victims of crime are entitled to dignity and compassion from all the services involved in supporting victims of crime.</P>
        <P>Against a background of a need to review the mechanism and services put in place by specific agencies to assist victims, in the context of the criminal justice system as a whole as set out in the Victims Charter and in the wider context of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the EU Framework Decision on the Standing of Victims of Criminal Proceeding, I established the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime, CSVC, in March 2005.  The members of the CSVC are: Mr Jim Mc Hugh, retired Assistant Commissioner, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Chairman; Ms Nora Owen, former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Mr Sean Lowry, former head of the Probation and Welfare Service; Mr Michael Whelan, Gemini Consulting; and Ms Marian Finucane, broadcaster.</P>
        <P>The CSVC has a three year remit to disburse funding for victim support measures and to develop a framework for victim services going forward.  Its remit also includes the examination of all aspects of the provision of services for victims of crime within the criminal justice system.  The CSVC is at present carrying out a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the Victims Charter as part of its work programme.</P>
        <P>In its first two years, the CSVC concentrated mainly on funding non-governmental organisations that provide front-line services to victims of crime, in order to ensure continuity of services to victims on the ground   To date, it has allocated close to &euro;1.5million in funding to organisations engaged in providing support to victims of crime.  Such funding ranges from &euro;4,000 to the smaller voluntary groups to &euro;100,000 to the large well established non-governmental organisations.</P>
        <P>As I understand it the CSVC, has recognised that one of the primary functions that an organisation supporting victims of crime can provide to a victim, is their support by way of accompaniment, <Col N="252" />where the victim has to attend Court.   Such support can make a real difference to the experience that victim has in court and of court processes.  In this regard, the CSVC prioritised the funding of activities at ground level that provide supports for victims of crime, such as court accompaniment services.</P>
        <P>In addition to the disbursement of funds to organisations that support victims of crime, the CSVC is required to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future. I am informed that the CSVC is currently actively engaged in this work.</P>
        <P>The CSVC sees ongoing communication and co-operation between the organisations its funds and the criminal justice agencies as being essential to the provision of a successful support structure for victims of crime. Respect for the dignity, autonomy and rights of every victim are core values of those organisations and agencies.  The CSVC works closely with them to ensure that the needs and concerns of victims of crime are addressed.</P>
        <P>This greater focus on the importance of the victim is also reflected in the remit of the Commission on Restorative Justice, CRJ, which I announced on 11th March last. Restorative Justice is a victim and community orientated approach to criminal justice which puts the victim at the centre of the process, requiring the perpetrator to face up to the harm he or she has caused and repair or make good the damage done. The Commission on Restorative Justice is being chaired by Judge Mary Martin, a very experienced Judge of the District Court, and will report to me on how restorative justice can best be expanded in Ireland with appropriate structures and a sound funding base. In its terms of reference I have specifically asked the CRJ to seek out the views of victims and the potential impact for victims of the various restorative justice models under consideration. The CRJ has been charged to submit an interim report to me in 6 months and a final report before end 2008.</P>
        <P>On the legislative side, I wish to inform the Deputy that Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for civil proceedings to address the anti-social behaviour by adults.  Anti-social behaviour by children is addressed in Part 13 of the Act.  This part empowers a senior officer of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply to the District Court by way of civil procedure for a &ldquo;civil order&rdquo; which would prohibit a person from behaving in an anti-social manner.  Prior to a senior officer applying for a civil order in respect of a person that individual must have been given a &ldquo;behaviour warning&rdquo; by a Member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Section 113(2) defines anti social behaviour as behaviour that is likely to cause harassment, distress, intimidation, or fear to persons who are not of the same household.  Effectively the anti-social behaviour is defined by the perspective of the victim, and it is <Col N="253" />the victim who initiates the process by complaining to the Garda&iacute;.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>Section 25 of the Criminal Justice Bill 2007 which is currently before the Oireachtas provides for a Court to make a &ldquo;crime prevention order&rdquo; on an individual.  Under 25(2)(a) that order may specify conditions that are necessary to ensure that persons who are likely to be adversely affected by the presence of the offender are protected.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill, which is at present being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, contains several provisions protecting children and other vulnerable persons from sexual abuse and exploitation. In particular, it introduces a harassment order under which the court can prohibit a person convicted of a sexual offence from doing anything, or going anywhere, which the court is satisfied would cause the victim or any other person fear, distress or alarm or which would amount to intimidation.</P>
        <P>The General Scheme of the Bill, as approved by Government for drafting, can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>The Irish Prison Service publication entitled &ldquo;The Prison Adult <Col N="256" />Literacy Survey &mdash; Results and Implications&rdquo; published in September 2003 is the most recent information available to my Department.  The major results of the survey showed that a significant number of prisoners have virtually no literacy skills &mdash; 52% of them were at Level 1 or Pre-Level 1 literacy levels.  In other words, more than twice as many prisoners are at the lowest level as compared with the population generally.</P>
        <P>The definition of illiteracy as used by the Department of Education and Science in conjunction with the Vocational Education Committee literacy schemes is: Level 1 &mdash; knows alphabet but has difficulties with reading; Level 2 &mdash; can read but has difficulties with writing, spelling or grammar; Level 3 &mdash; can read and write but needs to improve those skills for other education or work.</P>
        <P>A significant number of prisoners with literacy difficulties are at entry level (pre-level 1) and unable to read simple words but have the ability to write their names or know the alphabet. Most will have left school between the ages of 9 &mdash; 14 years and only some would have finished the junior cycle of education. This means that many of the students will already have a large deficit in general education, which often manifests itself in poor reading and writing skills.</P>
        <P>Literacy work has been a strong element of the Prison Education curriculum since the early 1980&rsquo;s. The literacy curriculum concentrates on the needs of the individual and respects the adult status of the student, his/her prior knowledge, skills and life experience. It is also concerned with improving self-esteem and building confidence. A number of significant initiatives commenced or were strengthened since 2003 which paralleled efforts to address adult literacy in the community.</P>
        <P>Among these are the fuller use of negotiated learning plans for all literacy students, introducing and supporting the new FETAC level 1 and level 2 courses, the introduction of the National Adult Literacy Agency&rsquo;s assessment framework, &ldquo;Mapping the Learning Journey&rdquo; in each Education Centre, devising and delivering the National Adult Literacy Agency and Waterford Institute of Technology 30 hour Initial Tutor Training course  for teachers new to prison education and drawing up and rolling out a national Literacy Plan for Prison Education.</P>
        <P>An Adult Basic Education Development Worker is employed by The Prison Education Service with specific responsibility for implementing and supporting developments and initiatives in the area of literacy, numeracy, English for Speakers of Other Languages and basic education. The need for such developments was highlighted in the 2002 Guidelines of Quality Literacy Work in Prisons, produced by the Prison Education Literacy Working Group, and also the findings and recommendations of the 2003 Prison Adult Literacy Survey.</P>

	<P>Following the submission to me in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, I decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, I am pleased to note that the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics for the third and fourth quarters of 2006.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 222 together.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of the law relating to drugs and public order continues to be a key element in the Government&rsquo;s policing priorities as reflected in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Policing Plan for 2007.   The Garda&iacute; continue to achieve considerable successes in reaching the drug seizure targets set down in the Government&rsquo;s National Drugs Strategy 2001 &mdash; 2008.</P>
        <P>The Garda National Drugs Unit co-ordinates large scale operations against drug dealing/trafficking and Unit personnel either <Col N="258" />investigate such cases themselves or assist local investigation teams. Additional assistance is also available from other specialised Garda support units, such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  A joint Garda National Drugs Unit/Criminal Assets Bureau initiative is now in place which targets local dealers.</P>
        <P>Since the publication of the Government&rsquo;s National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, Garda resources generally in the fight against illicit drugs have increased. This is particularly evident with the creation of Divisional Drug Units in areas of particular need.  These Drugs Units operate in Divisions throughout the country with a primary focus on local drugs activities.  The total financial resources allocated to the National Drugs Unit over the period 2002 to end of March, 2007 is as follows.</P>

        <Quest> the amount of money that has been grant aided to local communities for the provision of closed circuit television cameras in line with An Agreed Programme for Government Between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats 2002; and the number of CCTV cameras installed in each year from 2002 to date in 2007. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to extend the use of CCTV and to also to grant aid communities to fund them.  In tandem with the Garda based CCTV scheme, I launched the Community-based CCTV Scheme in June 2005, in response to a demonstrated demand from local communities across Ireland for the provision of CCTV systems.  This Scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems.  The Scheme offers both pre-development grants of up to &euro;5,000 to enable qualifying applicants to investigate the need for CCTV in their area and to complete a detailed proposal, and substantial grants of up to &euro;100,000 from my Department to install a CCTV system in their area.  In addition, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs provides successful applicants from RAPID areas with a further grant to a possible maximum of &euro;100,000.   Pobal has been engaged to administer the Scheme on behalf of this Department and it carries carry out thorough assessments of all applications received.</P>
        <P>Interest in the first round of the Scheme, which concluded in September 2005, was quite high with 24 successful groups receiving pre-development grants totalling &euro;115,665 which were paid in 2006.  A total of 13 successful groups were also <Col N="263" />approved to receive substantive grants totalling &euro;1 million, to be matched in RAPID areas by the Department of Community, Rural &amp; Gaeltacht Affairs.  Payment of these grants commenced in October 2006 and the supply, delivery and installation of cameras has recently begun and is currently in progress.</P>
        <P>Pobal invited the 24 groups who received pre-development grants to submit Stage 2 proposals by 31st January 2007.  Twenty of these groups submitted proposals and 11 groups were approved to receive grants totalling in excess of &euro;1 million, again to be matched in RAPID areas by the Department of Community, Rural &amp; Gaeltacht Affairs.  The final amounts involved will be determined subject to the finalisation of contracts.</P>
        <P>The first of the Community-based schemes to receive funding is in the Moyross area of Limerick.  To date five cameras have been delivered for this scheme; these are currently being installed and are expected to be up and running this week.  These cameras complement an earlier community CCTV scheme which has been in operation in the Moyross area for some time.</P>
        <P>In addition, a new round of funding under the Community Based CCTV Scheme was advertised in December 2006 with a closing date for receipt of applications of 28 February 2007.  Interest in this second Round of the Scheme is also very high with 50 groups applying for pre-development grants and 27 groups applying directly for substantive funding.  Pobal are currently evaluating these proposals and expect to be in a position to make their recommendations on successful pre-development applications by mid-April.  The substantive proposals will take somewhat longer to evaluate and Pobal are expected to make recommendations on these by mid-May.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 and 224 together.</P>
        <P>The Government remains resolutely committed to tackling the problem of drug misuse through our National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008.</P>
        <P>Under the Strategy, it is the Customs Service of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Cowen T.D., which  has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at importation.   The service has particular responsibility for implementing import controls at points of entry to the State, specifically, at ports, airports (including licensed airfields) and on the land frontier.</P>
        <P>In relation to my Department&rsquo;s remit and the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the area of drug supply reduction and drug law enforcement, I can advise the Deputy of the following.</P>
        <P>Given its nature, tackling drug trafficking demands local, national and international responses and is primarily intelligence led.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na invokes a number broad strategic responses in addressing the issue. These include the following; identifying, targeting and dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks which supply and distribute illegal drugs within this state; conducting intelligence driven operations focusing on all aspects of the illicit drugs trade including commodity, logistics, distribution and financing; working with other national and international law enforcement agencies on joint actions designed to reduce the availability of drugs and the proceeds derived from the drugs trade; working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs within society.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na liaises on an ongoing basis with other national and international enforcement services such as the Customs authorities (with whom there is a formal Memorandum of Understanding and Protocols in place to facilitate joint working), the Naval Service, the Air Corps, and foreign customs and police services.</P>
        <P>The benefits brought about by all of these ongoing law enforcement efforts are demonstrated by the continuing high level of drug seizures being made by both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs authorities and their continued success in bringing serious drug traffickers to book and putting them out of business.</P>
        <P>The issue of drug trafficking is one which the Government, in conjunction with our law enforcement agencies, will continue to tackle as a priority under one of the main pillar headings of our overall National Drugs Strategy.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,178 following the attestation of 273 new members on Wednesday 14 March, 2007. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258. Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006.</P>
        <P>There is a total of 331 Garda&iacute; dedicated to national and regional drugs units.  These units are also supported in their work by officers from other national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of the National Drugs Unit on 29 March, 2007, 1 June, 2006, 31 December, 2006 and on 31 December, 2005 was as set out in the table hereunder:</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Garda Authorities that Pulse, the primary IT system for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is operating very satisfactorily.  Significant investment has been made to improve the availability and response times of the system and I am advised that as a result, over the course of the past year, there has been no unplanned downtime of the system.</P>
        <P>The total development cost of the PULSE project was &euro;61.3 million and covers the period up to 2001.  The Garda authorities advise that the average annual maintenance and upgrade costs for PULSE from 2001 to the end of 2006 amounts to &euro;12.88m  This expenditure includes the cost of contract resources and there are no monthly expenditure on consultancy fees in relation to the system.</P>
        <P>By way of background, the figure above includes replacement of the Pulse hardware and major upgrades to the Pulse software as part of the Garda Pulse stabilisation programme which was completed last year. In addition, a range of upgrades and modifications have been carried out to the system to support changes arising from new legislation, additional functionality etc.  It also includes costs associated with the extension of the pulse system to new locations and to the set-up of the new Garda Information Services Centre in Castlebar and the new Vetting Unit in Thurles.  PULSE is now available in 320 locations with 79 new locations added in 2006 alone. The figure also includes various software licence fees which over the period amounted to &euro;14.25m.  The full licence costs are included for completeness although the costs relate to user-based licences which are also used for other Garda systems such as the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Fixed Charge Processing systems.</P>
        <P>Garda authorities also inform me that following the completion of PULSE stabilisation and a programme of maintenance and hardware upgrades in 2006, PULSE has now been amalgamated with the Garda National Immigration Bureau Information System, GNIB-IS, and the Fixed Charge processing System, FCPS, to form a new combined IT system referred to as the Garda Information System, GIS.  Accordingly, specific figures relating to Pulse for 2007 are not available.</P>

	<P>Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, the Commissioner became responsible for all civilians in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2006.  The Commissioner is now responsible for recruitment of all personnel to the force including civilians.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is currently a campaign underway to recruit 300 civilian support staff into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This process is well underway and interviews are currently being held by the Public Appointments Service to recruit these Clerical Officers.  Since the beginning of 2007, 93 Clerical Officers have been appointed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A further 46 have been offered a Clerical Officer post.</P>
        <P>The Garda Information Services Centre employs over 160 civilians doing work which was previously done by operational garda&iacute;.  The success of the incident reporting and data quality review facilities available at the GISC encouraged the Garda authorities to seek opportunities for the devolution of further tasks to the Centre.  One such initiative involves the reporting of the outcome of court cases to the GISC, which allows Garda&iacute; to remain operational following completion of their court attendances.  The call-taking function of Garda Traffic Watch has already transferred from six Regional Garda Communication Centres to the GISC.  Under a further initiative, the logging of driving licence and insurance particulars, a function formerly carried out by Garda&iacute; and civilian personnel in the Fixed Charge Processing System, is now undertaken at the GISC.  All of these initiatives are contributing significantly to the release of Garda resources for visible, front-line policing across our communi<Col N="268" />ties.  It is proposed to carry out a review of the GISC in the summer of 2007 and the outcome of this evaluation will inform future projects.</P>
        <P>Preparations are at an advanced stage to commence the recruitment of a civilian Chief Administration Officer in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at a grade equivalent to Deputy Commissioner.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also in the process of recruiting senior civilian managers as Directors of Communications, Strategy, Human Resources, Finance and Information Technology.  A dedicated Human Resource Directorate has been established within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to serve the needs of approximately 2,000 clerical, administrative, professional, technical and industrial civilian staff already working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to promote an extensive programme of civilianisation.</P>
        <P>Significant progress is being made on recruitment to a range of key specialised civilian posts, including: 31 posts in the Garda Telecommunications area; 28 staff for the Professional Standards Unit, comprising statisticians, analysts and administrative staff; 10 posts in the new Internal Audit Unit; 14 additional teaching / training posts in the Garda College in Templemore; and 29 posts for the new civilian Crime Analysis Service.</P>
        <P>The developments outlined above represent a major acceleration in the pace of civilianisation in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I remain committed to achieving the greatest level of civilianisation consistent with the effective and efficient functioning of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will continue to work with the Garda Commissioner to drive the civilianisation programme forward.</P>

	<P>The Garda Commissioner is proceeding with the recruitment and training of 1,500 members of the Garda Reserve.  The first group of 36 Garda Reserves completed their training and were formally attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 15 December 2006.</P>
        <P>A further 87 Reserve trainees are currently in training, some of whom will be attested next month. Recruitment and selection of trainees for the Reserve is continuing. The next group of trainees will commence training later this month.</P>
        <P>While I am satisfied generally with the progress being made in the recruitment and training of Reserve members, I consider that the process of initial recruitment can be made more efficient if it is given a local dimension.  In that context, I have asked the Garda Commissioner, and he has agreed, to involve local Garda Superintendents directly in local recruitment arrangements to <Col N="269" />attract suitable candidates from the local community.  This will assist in ensuring that the 1,500 target is reached as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner has also appointed a Chief Superintendent to oversee the Garda Reserve on a full-time basis. I will of course, in conjunction with the Commissioner, keep all procedures relating to the Garda Reserve under review to ensure that target figure of 1,500 is reached.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 to 232, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The contribution rates for the Civil Service Spouses&rsquo; and Children&rsquo;s Pensions Schemes are as follows: Scheme for Established Officers, 1.5% of Salary; Scheme for Unestablished Officers, 1.5% of net salary, i.e. salary less twice the rate of Old Age Contributory Pension, OACP.</P>
        <P>Under current arrangements appointment to a pensionable post in the Civil Service is conditional on (i) membership of a Main Superannuation Scheme which provides for the member&rsquo;s own pension benefits and (ii) membership of an associated Spouses&rsquo; and Children&rsquo;s Scheme which covers pensions for spouses and children. Compulsory membership of the Spouses&rsquo; and Children&rsquo;s scheme is on foot of negotiated agreements between the Civil Service unions and management.</P>
        <P>The Spouses&rsquo; and Children&rsquo;s Schemes effectively provide insurance for contingency benefits. The schemes are designed on a group insurance basis and the member contribution rate is structured accordingly. The total cost of the schemes is borne, on a 50/50 basis, by the employer and employees. Scheme cover continues to be provided until the member&rsquo;s death, whether that occurs before or after retirement.</P><Col N="270" />
        <P>The Commission on Public Service Pensions considered the question of compulsory membership for single people and the non-refundable nature of the contributions paid by them and decided not to recommend any change in the foregoing scheme rules.</P>
        <P>With regard to lump-sum entitlements, these benefits are paid under the main (occupational) pension schemes as opposed to the spouses&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s schemes. Generally, entitlements are calculated as 3/80th of pensionable remuneration multiplied by the number of years reckonable service. In exceptional circumstances (e.g. ill-health retirement) officers retiring before the minimum retirement age may get additional notional years added to their actual service for pension purposes. Any outstanding contributions due to the relevant spouses&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s scheme will, as a general rule,  be deducted from the retirement lump-sum.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that for capital gains tax, CGT, purposes, the time of disposal of land under a compulsory purchase order is the earlier of the time the authority enters on the land and the time at which the compensation is agreed. The CGT liability arises in the year of assessment (i.e. the calendar year) in which the disposal is treated as being made.</P>
        <P>This general rule is disapplied, however, where the disposal is under a compulsory purchase order and is for the purposes of, or ancillary to, road construction, widening or extension, the person making the disposal is engaged in farming, and immediately before the disposal, the land was used for the purposes of farming.</P>
        <P>Where these circumstances occur the CGT liability will not arise until the year of assessment in which the compensation is received.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the partition of a tenancy in common is a disposal for capital gains tax (CGT) purposes. Each party is <Col N="271" />treated as disposing of an interest in the undivided farm in exchange for an interest in a divided part. The chargeable gains are computed by reference to the respective market values of the farm at the date the father died and on partition. A family member who is aged 55 years or more might be entitled to relief from CGT (retirement relief).</P>
        <P>I am further advised that a liability to stamp duty or gift tax does not arise in the case of the equal division of a farm between existing co-owners on the partition of a tenancy in common.</P>
        <P>If the family are currently farming in partnership the income tax commencement and cessation provisions might be applicable if the partnership ceases when the farm is partitioned. These could give rise to a revision of profits for tax purposes for the final years of the ceasing farming partnership while the rules for assessing a start-up business would apply to the individuals in their new roles as sole farming traders.</P>

        <Quest> the cost to the Exchequer of reducing the standard rate of income tax from 20% to 18%, reducing the marginal rate from 41% to 40%, increasing tax credits and tax bands in line with wage inflation and doubling the credit where one <Col N="272" />spouse works in the home to care for children, the elderly or the disabled. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>By reference to the 2007 post-Budget income tax ready reckoner prepared by the Revenue Commissioners, the full year costs to the Exchequer of the Deputy&rsquo;s measures are as follows.  Reduction in the standard rate of tax from 20% to 18% is estimated at &euro;1,025 million.  Reduction in the marginal, that is, higher rate of tax from 41% to 40% is estimated at &euro;210 million.  Increasing the home carer credit from &euro;770 to &euro;1,540 is estimated at &euro;60 million.</P>
        <P>In the absence of a specific figure being provided by the Deputy for wage inflation, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the cost of increasing tax credits and tax bands in line with wages inflation.  In order to avoid setting a headline, as a general rule, my Department does not publish forecast estimates of wages growth.</P>
        <P>However, using the data in the income tax ready reckoner, each 1% increase in the value of the main personal credits (basic personal credit and employee credit) and the tax bands would cost about &euro;120 million in a full year.   If the Deputy wishes to estimate costs for future years, he could apply this indicative figure to the pay increases set out in Towards 2016 or to forecasts for wages growth published by the European Commission in its Autumn 2006 Economic Forecast or the Quarterly Economic Commentary published by the ESRI in March 2007.</P>
        <P>The costs quoted are provisional, subject to revision and estimated to the nearest &euro;5 million.  The ready reckoner is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, at <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i>.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, subject to conditions, grants exemption from Capital Acquisitions Tax in respect of a house comprised in a gift or inheritance. The conditions require that the donee or successor must occupy the house for the period of 3 years ending with the date of the gift or inheritance. Where that house has replaced other <Col N="273" />property, the beneficiary must have resided either in that house or in the other property for periods which, taken together, amounted to 3 years in the 4-year period prior to the date of the gift or inheritance. In addition, the donee or successor, if under the age of 55, must continue to occupy the house as his or her only or main residence for a further period of 6 years. However, there is provision to allow for a replacement house in that period and for situations where the individual concerned is not in occupation of the house because of work obligations abroad.</P>
        <P>The total number of claims for relief under section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 which were made in each of the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 were 553, 542 and 680 respectively. Data is not captured in the Revenue database in a manner which would enable the values of properties subject to section 86 claims to be separately identified. However, on the basis of a recent once-off survey carried out by the Revenue Commissioners, it was established that the aggregate value of the 542 properties for which claims under section 86 were made in 2005 was some &euro;140 million.</P>
        <P>Claims for relief under section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 in respect of high-value houses are verified. Amendments to section 86 are being made in the current Finance Bill, which was passed by the Seanad last week. These amendments are as a result of Revenue&rsquo;s experience in administering claims under this section, including taking issues before the Appeal Commissioners.</P>
        <P>Firstly, relief will not be available where a donee lives in the principal private residence of the donor, where that residence is gifted, unless the donor is compelled by reason of old age or infirmity to depend on the services of the donee. This is to counter, in particular, the argument that, where the donee, having until then lived in the parental home, is gifted a house by a parent, the 3 year period of occupancy of the gifted house is satisfied.</P>
        <P>The second change will require that the gifted house be owned by the donor during the 3-year period even if they were not his or her principal private residence. This is to counter a claim for relief where an individual sells his principal private residence to his parent for full value and the house is then gifted back to that individual by his parent. It also counters the use of family trusts in gifting houses to children.</P>

Any part of the running costs attributable to the private use of the vehicle would not be allowable.</P>
        <P>I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that capital allowances would be available against the capital cost of providing a vehicle which belongs to a publican and which is to be <Col N="275" />used in the provision of such a transport service for the purposes of his or her trade. The amount of expenditure qualifying for allowances is subject to an upper limit or cap. This cap which stood at &euro;23,000 for 2006 is increased to &euro;24,000 for 2007. Subject to the cap, expenditure on a vehicle may be written off over 8 years at the rate of 12.5% per annum. Where a vehicle qualifies for capital allowances and is used both for business and private purposes, the allowances are not available for the element of private use and the expenditure on the vehicle must be apportioned between the business and private uses.</P>

The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The Group&rsquo;s Report, published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.</P>
        <P>The Report also outlines a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme. Changes in relation to the appeals process have been introduced.</P>
        <P>In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Review Group on Longer-Term Lending Limits under Section 35 of the Credit Union Act, 1997, was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 2 February 2007. The Review Group was comprised of representatives from the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association, the Registrar of Credit Unions and my Department.</P>
        <P>The Report recommended that Section 35 lending limits should be increased for loans over five years from 20% to 40% and over ten years from 10% to 15%, for those credit unions approved by the Registrar as having the necessary controls and safeguards in place and which <Col N="277" />satisfy financial criteria in relation to arrears and reserves.</P>
        <P>I consider that the recommendations in the Report strike an appropriate balance between the development needs of credit unions and the protection of members&rsquo; savings and have undertaken to introduce the necessary Regulatory amendments in the coming months.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the focus of the review was on longer-term lending in general and not on any specific product type such as mortgages.  I understand however, that a number of credit unions have been approved by the Registrar of Credit Unions to provide a mortgage referral service to their members, as a result of partnership arrangements they have entered into with specific banks/building societies.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy has in mind the estimated cost of tax relief on pension contributions by employers, employees and self-employed. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest relevant figures available are in respect of the income tax year 2003. The total cost of tax relief on pensions contributions is tentatively estimated at approximately &euro;1.456 billion.  With the exception of the data on RACs and PRSAs below, the figures provided are not definitive costings and are based on various broad assumptions and parameters.  The total figure is broken down as follows both in terms of numbers where available and in terms of costs.</P><Col N="277" />

                <P FLI="0">With regard to occupational pensions, that is approved superannuation schemes set up by the employer, it should be noted that the cost figures in respect of employee and employer contri<Col N="278" />butions are available only in aggregate form on a tentative basis.  It is not possible to provide a breakdown across income categories in respect of the tax relief for pension contributions by <Col N="279" />employers and employees to occupational schemes as the relevant data are not captured in such a way as to make this possible.</P>
        <P>Provisions were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality and transparency without overburdening taxpayers or employers.  The Act includes provisions that require employers to provide data on superannuation contributions in the P35 form to be filed by employers in February 2006.  These changes will yield additional information regarding the overall cost of tax relief for pension contributions but as the returns will be aggregated at employer level they will not provide a precise basis for measuring the potential impact on the Exchequer of proposals for changes at individual level.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that work on developing the necessary technical enhancements to their computer system to enable this data to be captured is ongoing.</P>
        <P>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the only relevant information <Col N="280" />available by income category is in respect of income tax relief allowed for contributions to &ldquo;Retirement Annuity Contracts&rdquo; for the income tax year 2003, which are available to the self-employed and to employees not in occupational pension schemes. A distribution by income ranges of the number of cases, amount of deduction and reduction in tax for tax relief for Retirement Annuity Contracts is contained in the table that follows this reply.</P>
        <P>The lower aggregate figures in the latter table (compared to the slightly higher figures for RACs in the opening table) are taken directly from filed income tax returns which represent about 98 per cent of all income tax returns expected for 2003.  The higher figures in the initial table have, in accordance with normal practice, been grossed-up at aggregate level to adjust for this 2% incompleteness.  A married couple who has elected or has deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P><Col N="279" />

	<P>Built in the 1560&rsquo;s Ormonde Castle is perhaps the best example of an Elizabethan manor house in Ireland and as such is an important element in the Heritage Sites of Ireland programme presented by the Office of Public Works.  The site is generally open to the public from mid June to mid September.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives have been put in place in recent times to increase the numbers of visitors to the site.  In 2006 a decision was made to remove all admission charges to the site.  This initiative led directly to visitors to the site increasing by 26% over 2005.</P>
        <P>In January of this year my officials met with the representatives of the Carrick on Suir Tourism and Economic Development Committee.  Following on from this meeting OPW has agreed to extend the 2007 visitor season at Ormonde Castle until the end of September.  It was also agreed that should visitor numbers continue to increase that for the 2008 season consideration will be given to opening the site to visitors from early May.  The meeting with the committee also discussed issues such as car and bus parking which are of concern to OPW but are matters which can only be addressed by the local authority.</P>
        <P>I think the Deputy will accept that significant efforts have been made in recent times to increase visitor numbers to Ormonde Castle and while the efforts of OPW will continue in this regard there are no plans to provide a separate visitor centre at the site.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no plans to commission an assessment of the type referred to by the Deputy.  The Government is aware that the decentralisation programme impacts on the staff in the organisations affected, on their career choices and their expectations.  From the outset therefore, my Department has put in place a process to discuss the full range of staff issues with union representatives.  An approach based on negotiations and agreement has enabled significant progress to be made in relation to civil service general service grades on issues relating to promotion arrangements, protocols for transfer of staff and arrangements for placing staff who wish to remain in Dublin.  My Department will continue to work closely with union representatives throughout the transition phase of the Programme to ensure that these arrangements are operating effectively.  My Department will also continue to seek to make progress on issues affecting the professional &amp; technical staff and those working in State Agencies.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation Programme is a voluntary programme.  To date over 10,600 applications have been received on the Central Applications Facility (CAF) with over 2,400 staff had been assigned to decentralising posts.  Approximately 800 of these are currently in place in 17 new locations while the remainder are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available.  It is envisaged that by the end of 2007 public services will be delivered from 36 of the decentralisation towns with approximately 2,000 staff transferred.</P>
        <P>While much media coverage of the decentralisation programme has focussed on the negative impact of the Programme on staff, much less attention has been paid to the benefits of decentralisation.  Existing Civil and Public Servants seeking to leave Dublin &ndash; for example, to return to family and friends back home, or to acquire an affordable and comfortable family home within easy reach of their workplace &ndash; will have a broader range of career options.  Present and future Civil and Public Servants who aspire to senior management positions will now have options to work either in Dublin or in one of a number of regional locations.</P>

        <P>The NCIP came into effect from 1 January 2006, with an allocation of &euro;575 million for the 5 year period of 2006 to 2010.  The NCIP is a key element of the National Childcare Strategy 2006-2010, the aim of which is to deliver a more comprehensive approach to early years care and education.  Unlike the EOCP, the NCIP is completely Exchequer funded.  The NCIP is designed to deliver 50,000 additional childcare places, with a greater focus on pre-school places for 3 to 4 year olds and school age childcare.  Childcare places are provided either through community based/not for profit childcare groups or by private providers.</P>
        <P>Of the &euro;575 million total budget for the NCIP, some &euro;357 million is earmarked for capital investment and to provide for the cost of meeting the programme&rsquo;s target of 50,000 additional childcare places.  Capital grant applications under the NCIP are assessed under a number of criteria; chiefly the nature and extent of the need locally for the service proposed, the applicant&rsquo;s capacity to deliver the project proposed and value for money.  All proposals are expected to demonstrate how they will increase the supply of quality childcare, and furthermore, community projects are expected to have a focus on disadvantage.</P>

	<P>I am convinced that the co-location initiative is the most cost effective way of providing an additional 1,000 public beds for public patients in public hospitals including in the Adelaide and Meath Hospital incorporating the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Tallaght.</P>
        <P>There will be no capital cost to the Exchequer.  The State already funds the nursing and support staff employed to provide acute hospital services in these beds.  The State will have to replace the income which the public hospitals have been receiving in respect of the private and semi private beds whose activity will transfer across to the new co-located hospitals.  These private and semi private beds are currently being subsidised, for private patients, by the state.  Investors in the new co-located hospitals, like investors in all new private hospitals, may be eligible for capital allowances over a 7 years period in accordance with the provisions of the Finance Acts.</P><Col N="288" />
        <P>There will be a rigorous value for money assessment of any proposal and this will take account of the value of the public site and the cost of any tax expenditure.  Any transaction will be on a commercial basis and will fully protect the public interest.  In addition, there will be full adherence to public procurement law and best practice.</P>
        <P>The capital cost per bed for acute public hospitals differs depending on the scope of medical services provided and the consequential functional content of the hospital facility.  Direct comparison, on a cost per bed basis, with private sector hospitals could be misleading without detailed information on the services being provided, functional content and floor areas of facilities.</P>
        <P>Public acute hospitals have departments not normally provided in private facilities (A&amp;E, Post Mortem, Teaching,) which will increase the cost per bed.  The estimated average capital cost for an acute hospital bed in a major acute teaching hospital is &euro;625,000.  However, this figure does not include the cost of increasing numbers of single room accommodation being provided in public hospitals.  The costs do not include the cost of land acquisition, future inflation financing costs, or cost of underground/overground car parking facilities.</P>
        <P>The average revenue cost of an inpatient bed in a major acute teaching hospital in 2005 (the most recent year for which information is available) was approximately &euro;300,000 per annum.  This includes acute inpatient costs and inpatient activity only and excludes day cases, outpatients, longstay and psychiatric patients.  The cost also excludes capital and depreciation costs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 262 and 356 together.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to comment on and assess the costs of the general merits of universal health insurance system in Ireland.  Such a system would move insurance from being voluntary to compul<Col N="289" />sory.  Consideration of the many complex issues inherent in any such proposal would include whether a particular universal health insurance system would be more effective than present arrangements in terms of service delivery and quality and, also, whether it would lead to additional unnecessary costs.  On a simplified basis, about 52% of the population pay for health insurance voluntarily at a cost of approximately &euro;1.25 billion.  On this basis, the cost of the State providing the same benefits to 48% of the population without private health insurance would be approximately &euro;1.12 billion.  However, this does not reflect the total cost of any change to universal coverage as there are many programmes, such as general medical services which will cost about &euro;1.6 billion in 2007, that are not met by insurers.</P>
        <P>I may add that the World Health Organisation commented in April 2005 in a paper &ldquo;Social Health insurance&rdquo; that &ldquo;no specific health-financing mechanism is optimal and recommendable in all settings...  Little advantage is discernible in one financing system over another in terms of impact on health outcomes, responsiveness to patients or efficiency.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>This Government and the previous Government have provided, over the past ten years, unprecedented levels of investment for the health services.  Ireland already has universal coverage for hospital services, funded through general taxation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 and 334 together.</P>
        <P>The Dental Treatment Service Scheme (DTSS) provides for a range of dental services for adult medical card holders from participating dentists holding contracts with the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The DTSS Review Group was established in May 2006 to undertake a comprehensive review of Primary Care Oral Health Services provided under the DTSS.  Represented on the Review Group are the HSE, the Health Service Employers Agency, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Finance and the Irish Dental Association (IDA).  The Group is chaired by Mr Finbar Flood.</P>
        <P>Since the Group was established, a legal issue has arisen with regard to the Competition Act 2002 as it relates to the negotiation of professional fees.  My Department has sought legal advice from the Attorney General in this regard.  In the meantime, the management side has offered to continue discussions on the non-fee element of the review.  The IDA has not accepted this offer.</P>
        <P>I understand that the IDA has balloted its members on a proposal to withdraw the association&rsquo;s support from the DTSS and that this proposal has been carried.  The existing contractual arrangements with private dental practitioners under the DTSS for the provision of dental services to eligible patients remain in place.</P>

	<P>The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges may be levied. These regulations were signed by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children on 14 January 2005.</P>
        <P>Class 1 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;120 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;35, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>Class 2 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;90, or the weekly income of that person less &euro;55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person. The HSE issued revised guidelines for the implementation of the charges in July 2006.  The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo;. Under Section 1 (b) of the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005, the HSE can examine a person&rsquo;s overall financial situation in view of the person&rsquo;s reasonable expenditure in relation to themselves or their dependants, if any. The HSE when assessing charges takes into account only that income attributable solely to the person in care.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may be aware that the HSE  provides a range of services for children with disabilities such as home support, respite, day services, therapies, and residential services.  The funding for these services has been augmented over the last  three years through the  Multi-annual Investment Programme 2006-2009 and Multi Disciplinary funding to underpin the implementation of Part 2 of the Disability Act.</P><Col N="296" />
        <P>The HSE strives to ensure that the combination of services afforded an individual maximises support for that person, and their family, giving recognition to this Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy of providing appropriate care in the most appropriate setting to people with disabilities.  These initiatives can, and are, being targeted at children with disabilities and their families with the objective of sustaining such family units and  it is a policy of the HSE to promote such supports to this cohort of children.</P>

	<P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the <Col N="297" />GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Report on patterns of care and survival of cancer patients in Ireland between 1994 and 2001 which was published last week.  This Report, funded by my Department, adds significantly to our understanding of survival patterns of care for four major causes of cancer viz breast, colorectal, lung and prostate.</P>
        <P>This Government has invested substantially in all regions in the country to improve cancer survival.  The improvements are evidenced in the Report which shows improvements in survival for breast, colorectal and prostate cancers, but not lung cancers, at a national level in that time.  At regional level, there were improvements in all regions for breast and prostate cancers and in most regions for colorectal and lung cancers.</P>
        <P>We know there are regional variations in cancer survival rates.  The Government&rsquo;s National Cancer Control Strategy, published last year, and welcomed by stakeholders, is designed to fundamentally change this, to improve outcomes for cancer patients in each region of the country.  We are committed to investing significantly in the implementation of the Strategy.  The National Development Plan 2007-2013 includes major investment in the cancer area.  We have made available an additional &euro;20.5m this year for cancer control (screening, acute services and research).  This is an increase of 74% on the comparable 2006 investment and includes &euro;3.5m to support the initial implementation of the HSE National Cancer Control Programme.</P>
        <P>It is the my intention and that of the HSE to ensure that patients, regardless of location, have timely access to high quality, specialised care that will lead to further improvements in cancer mortality.  The HSE Cancer Control Programme will manage, organise and deliver quality assured cancer services on a whole population basis, regardless of geography.  The Service Plan for the HSE for this year sets out the detailed deliverables of the Programme.</P>

	<P>The Primary Care Strategy aims to increase health service capacity through the development of services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of occupational therapists, general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists and others.  It has been estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.</P>
        <P>The HSE received funding totalling  &euro;32m in 2006 and 2007 for the establishment of 200 Primary Care Teams, which altogether will involve the appointment of some 600 additional front-line professionals, including a significant number of Occupational Therapists.  The Government has committed under the Towards 2016 agreement to the establishment of 300 Primary Care Teams by 2008; 400 by 2009; and 500 by 2011.  A review of these targets will be undertaken in 2008.</P>

	<P>There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements are made to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on <Col N="302" />eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.</P>

	<P>At present, medical cards are granted primarily on the basis of means and individual circumstances.  Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  Persons aged seventy years and over are automatically entitled to a medical card, irrespective of means.  The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</P>
        <P>Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on low and moderate incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group as a whole.  However, my Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>
        <P>The NCIP is a key element of the National Childcare Strategy 2006-2010 and is effective from 1 January 2006.  Unlike the existing EOCP, the NCIP is entirely Exchequer funded.  The decision of the Government to create a major new 5 year investment programme immediately, rather than wait until the EOCP expired, is evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the provision of quality child care.</P>
        <P>The NCIP aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality child care. supports and services, which are grounded in an understanding of local needs.  The Programme has a budget of &euro;575 million for the 5 year period 2006-2010, with a target to create 50,000 additional child care. places with a greater focus on preschool places for 3 to 4 year olds and school age child care.  The 50,000 new places will include 10,000 preschool education places aimed at 3 to 4 year olds.  This commitment is a clear recognition by the Government of the value of preschool education, and it will assist parents to avail of the benefits of preschool education for their children.</P>
        <P>As part of the process of closing the EOCP, the final date for reaching contract stage, for Groups applying for funding under this programme, was 31 December 2006.  As the Deputy will be aware, the EOCP is co-funded by the European Union and timescales agreed with the Commission must be observed as financial penalties will accrue to the State if they are not.  The Group in question submitted their application to Pobal, which is engaged to assess EOCP and NCIP grants on behalf of my Office,  in October 2006.   Final infor<Col N="310" />mation required to complete the assessment was received by Pobal from the Group on 6 December 2006.  As it was not possible at that stage for the application to be brought through the assessment and appraisal process and to contract stage by 31 December 2006, it was recommended by the Programme Appraisal Committee that the Group&rsquo;s application under that Programme be declined and that the application be considered in the context of the forthcoming NCIP staffing grant scheme.  The Secretary General of the Department concurred with this recommendation.</P>
        <P>In certain circumstances, including where an application is linked to a previous EOCP capital grant, applications for staffing grant assistance are continuing to be considered under the EOCP and, subject to the outcome of a review in each case, the applicants will be advised of the position as soon as possible.  In the case of other Groups such as that referred to by the Deputy, which have been declined staffing grant funding under the EOCP as a result of being unable to meet the contractual deadlines of that Programme, and whose applications were not linked to a previous EOCP capital grant, the review of their applications for staffing grant funding will be undertaken as soon as the details of the new NCIP staffing grant scheme are announced.  In each case, the review will be undertaken as quickly as possible to facilitate the Group concerned.  Officials in my Office will be in contact with the Group in due course to inform them of the outcome of that review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 306 and 307 together.</P>
        <P>The number of persons aged under 18 and who have Down&rsquo;s Syndrome is not formally recorded by my Department.  However it can be estimated that there are some 1,800 to 2,000 persons in this category.  The number of persons aged  under 18 and who are on either the National Intellectual Disability Database or the National Physical Sensory  Disability Database is approximately 15,000.  The Health Service Executive is not in a position to identify within its national medical card database the number of persons with full eligibility under section 45 of the Health Act 1970 who are also in either of the above categories.</P><Col N="311" />
        <P>It should also be noted also that under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions include mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, Parkinsonism and conditions arising from thalidomide.</P>
        <P>On the basis of the average cost to the General Medical Services of general practitioner services, prescription medicines and community dental and ophthalmic services for persons aged under 18, and assuming that 70% of the persons encompassed by the Deputy&rsquo;s questions are not currently covered by a medical card, the estimated annual direct cost, at 2007 prices, of providing medical cards to persons under 18 with Down&rsquo;s syndrome is approximately &euro;0.5 million; the estimated annual direct cost, at 2007 prices, of providing medical cards to persons under 18 with a recognised disability is approximately &euro;3.8m.</P>
        <P>I wish to emphasise that the above cost estimates do not take account of a range of other factors which could influence the actual cost of implementing such arrangements.  These include potential requirements to pay increased fees to contracted providers if full eligibility were extended to particular categories of high-demand clients and that the actual costs of drugs, aids and appliances and other health services available free of charge to the holders of medical cards in these categories could be substantially higher than the average, given the pre-existing condition(s) of the patients concerned.  They also do not take into account potential costs to the health service or other areas of Government in which the holding of a medical card may be used to determine entitlement to services or benefits.</P>

Although &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; does not specifically mention gender based violence, it identifies violence as one of the risks that may lead to mental health problems.  The Report recommends a mental health system that addresses the needs of the population through a focus on the requirements of the individual and that mental health promotion programmes should particularly focus on those interventions known to enhance protective factors and decrease risk factors for developing mental health problems.   </P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that the National Strategy for Women (NWS) has been prepared by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is a wide-ranging document, covering many aspects of women&rsquo;s lives.  The Strategy, which is to be launched later this month clearly endorses the Mental Health Strategy, A Vision for Change.  The ongoing work of the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women, chaired by Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Frank Fahey, is an ongoing mechanism for addressing issues relating to gender based violence.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to the full implementation of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;  the report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy and has accepted the report as the basis for the future development of mental health services.  &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; recommends that advocacy should be available as a right to all service users in all mental health services in all parts of the country.  Implementation of the individual recommendations of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; is a matter primarily for the HSE.  The HSE established an implementation group in July 2006 to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; a reality.  </P>
        <P>In recent years significant funding has been provided to support the work of advocacy groups in the mental health area. These groups include the Irish Advocacy Network, Schizophrenia Ireland, Grow, Steer, Aware, Mental Health Ireland and Bodywhys. In recognition of the key <Col N="313" />role of advocacy related to hospital admission and detention, peer advocacy is now available at all psychiatric acute admission sites, many community service sites and the Central Mental Hospital.</P>

	<P>The Health Research Board (HRB) is the statutory body with responsibility for improving health through research and information.  My Department provides funding for mental health research to the HRB as part of its overall vote.  The Mental Health Research Division (MHRD) of the Health Research Board carries out national and international research, information gathering and the dissemination of research outcomes on mental health in Ireland.  The Division manages and reports on the National Psychiatric In-Patient Reporting System (NPIRS) and is developing COMCAR &mdash; a system which collects information on community psychiatric services.  Both databases will inform on policy and planning for mental health services nationally and regionally.  In addition, research is an integral part of the work of the Health Service Executive and the Mental Health Commission.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 came into force on 14th July 2005 and provide for two different classes of persons on whom charges may be levied. Class 1 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;120 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;35, whichever is the lesser. Class 2 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;90, or the weekly income of that person <Col N="314" />less &euro;55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo;. Under Section 1 (b) of the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005, the HSE can examine a person&rsquo;s overall financial situation in view of the person&rsquo;s reasonable expenditure in relation to themselves or their dependants, if any. The HSE when assessing charges takes into account only that income attributable solely to the person in care.  The Health (Amendment) Act 2005 and the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 enabled the HSE to recommence the raising of charges for long stay in-patient services with effect from the 14th July 2005.  The HSE established an Expert Group to develop a set of national guidelines to deal with the provisions of the legislation.</P>
        <P>The national guidelines support a standardised approach to the implementation of Health (Charges for In-Patient) Regulations 2005 and take account of the persons residing in community residences. The guidelines have been implemented with effect from 1st August 2006, retrospective to 14th July 2005 where charges had not been raised while awaiting finalisation of the guidelines.  Clients in community residences were informed in July 2005 that they might be liable for charges under the new regulations.</P>
        <P>In regard to retrospection, charges were to be raised with effect from the 1st August 2006 based on the financial assessment for each of the clients.  Arrears of charges due from 14th July 2005 were to be calculated and advised to the client.  The clients were to be given the following options:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. Pay the arrears in full or in instalments</P>
       <P LI="1">2. Deduct the arrears from any monies due under the repayment scheme where applicable.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A National Working Group on Rents and Charges in HSE Mental Health Services was established in December 2006.  The purpose of this Working Group is to develop and recommend a process for the collection of rents and charges in accordance with the statutory provisions outlined in Section 53 (2) (a) of the Health Act 1970 as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 S.I No 276 of 2005.  This process will be specific to mental health services, will safeguard both the individual and the staff member and will comply with financial probity and HSE governance requirements.  To date the National Working Group on Rents &amp; Charges has met on four occasions and I understand a draft report with specific recommendations will be presented in the near future.</P>
        <P>In relation to children, the Deputy may wish to note that, under Section 4 (b) of the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005, charges are not payable where the in-patient services concerned are provided to a person under 18 years of age.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, entitled &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, was launched in January 2006 and provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over 7 to 10 years.  It recommends the provision of two child and adolescent com<Col N="316" />munity multidisciplinary mental health teams per 100,000 of the population.</P>
        <P>In 2006, a sum of &euro;26.2 million was allocated for the development of mental health services in line with &ldquo; A Vision for Change&rdquo;.  A further sum of &euro;25 million has been allocated in 2007 to continue this development.  A significant amount of this year&rsquo;s funding, &euro;7.95 million, is for the development of child and adolescent mental health services.  This funding will bring about significant improvements in community, hospital-based and early intervention services including the development of a further eight new child and adolescent mental health teams.  The provision of additional teams will reduce waiting times for assessment and treatment.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that all emergency referrals are seen without delay. However, the HSE is currently examining non-emergency waiting lists to identify and improve the least developed services. Currently, there are 10 child and adolescent psychiatric in-patient beds in the public sector for the under 16 age group, four at St Anne&rsquo;s, Galway and six at Warrenstown House, Dublin.  A further 12 beds will be provided this year in these units, i.e. six additional beds in each unit.  Four new purpose built 20-bed units in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick are at an advanced planning stage and have secured funding through the HSE Capital Programme 2006-2010.</P>
        <P>As an interim measure pending the development of additional dedicated in-patient beds, the provision of an additional 24-32 dedicated adolescent psychiatric beds, primarily for the 16 and 17 year age group, across the four HSE administrative areas is being progressed by the HSE. Dedicated child and adolescent multidisciplinary teams will be provided for these additional beds and training will be provided for staff in the identified units.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to the full implementation of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy and has accepted the Report as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.</P>
        <P>In March 2006,  I appointed an independent monitoring group to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;.  The group will monitor and assess progress on the implementation of all the <Col N="317" />recommendations including those which fall under the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE), government departments and other relevant agencies. The Group is to submit its first annual report by mid 2007.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the individual recommendations of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; is a matter primarily for the HSE.  The HSE established an implementation group in July 2006 to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; a reality.  Both of these groups will play an important role in ensuring that the recommendations are implemented in a co-ordinated and timely manner.  I have been informed by the HSE that they plan to publish a Progress Report and outline the proposed implementation programme over the life of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; in the near future.</P>

        <Quest> if she or her Department have received correspondence from the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in D&uacute;n Laoghaire in relation to the urgent need for investment and accelerated implementation of the dementia manifesto; her plans to address this issue in early date; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has received correspondence, including a copy of the Dementia Manifesto 2007-2009, from the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  I met with the Society on 8th March 2007 to discuss, inter alia, the recommendations outlined in the Manifesto.</P>
        <P>The development of Services for Older People, including the development of services for people with dementia, is a priority for the Government.  This is reflected in the funding committed to Services for Older People in Budgets 2006 and 2007.  Last year, the Government funded the largest ever expansion in Services for Older People with a full year cost of &euro;150m.  This year a full year package of &euro;255m has been allocated for Services for Older People.  This gives a total of over &euro;400m added to services for older people over two years.</P>
        <P>Government policy in relation to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016. The Action Plan for Dementia, <Col N="318" /> published in 1999, describes a model of best practice for the provision and planning of dementia care in Ireland.</P>
        <P>There is a complementary link between Government policy in the area of the care of older people and care for people with dementia.  Both policies stress the need to provide support in dignity and independence, through the provision of appropriate services to the people concerned and their carers. The Government is fully committed to providing such support and service improvement, including the expansion of community and residential care services for people with dementia. This commitment is reflected in the additional funding of approximately &euro;109 million in Budget 2006 and  &euro;82 million in Budget 2007 which was allocated to community supports for older people, including those with dementia. These supports include Home Care Packages, the Home Help Scheme and Respite Care.</P>
        <P>The additional funding provided for Home Care Packages and the Home Help Scheme will further enhance the supports available to families caring for people with dementia at home. In 2006 a total of 2,000 extra Home Care Packages were provided at a full year cost of &euro;55 million (prior to this date only 1,100 Packages had been in operation on a pilot basis).  A similar increase in the number of Packages will be provided in 2007, benefiting some 4,000 people. An additional &euro;21 million has been provided in 2007 to fund the cost of some 780,000 additional Home Help hours in 2007.  This brings the total funding allocated to Home Helps to approximately &euro;171 million per annum.</P>
        <P>Among the areas where funding has been provided are day care and respite care which are an integral part of delivering a comprehensive community service for older people. Day care and respite care offer respite for family members and/or carers and provide social stimulation in a safe environment for older people with mild forms of dementia. The provision of an additional &euro;9 million in 2006 funded a further 1,325 additional places per week in these centres, together with additional programmes for specific needs such as activity therapy. It also means that many day care centres can increase the number of days per week they open. Additional funding of &euro;3.5 million provided in Budget 2007 will cater for a further 1,100 day places per week in day care centres.</P>
        <P>The HSE has responsibility for the planning and management of capital projects in the health sector, including the development of services for people suffering from Dementia. The HSE&rsquo;s capital plan for 2007 has recently been approved and includes an allocation of &euro;107 million for older people specific projects.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 319 and 326 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has received correspondence regarding fees for services under public com<Col N="320" />munity drug schemes from individuals and pharmacies.  As the Deputies may already be aware, my Department and the HSE have been reviewing the pharmaceutical supply chain, with a view to seeking value for money in the State&rsquo;s drugs bill in order to better fund existing and innovative therapies without compromising continuity of supply or patient safety.  The review of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland (APMI) Agreements, with the proprietary and generic supplier representative bodies, was completed in mid-2006 and the new agreements are in place.</P>
        <P>Following completion of the manufacturer agreements and in line with the process agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health, the State entered talks with the wholesaler representative body, the Pharmaceutical Distributor&rsquo;s Federation (PDF).  As wholesale margins are not addressed in the new IPHA and APMI Agreements, the State intended to negotiate, for the first time, direct formal arrangements with the wholesale sector, to address the cost of wholesale supply to hospital and community through fair, transparent and accountable cost structures.</P>
        <P>In particular, the State wished to examine the high margin, relative to the EU, for wholesale supply to community pharmacy and the wholesalers&rsquo; claim that they supply hospitals at a loss.  However, while PDF was willing to negotiate new arrangements for hospital supply, it refused to negotiate a new margin for community supply.  This refusal was based on legal advice that such negotiation would interfere with agreed trading terms of third parties, community pharmacists, and expose PDF to prosecution.</P>
        <P>Subsequent advice to the HSE indicated that the PDF position was too narrow.  As wholesalers and pharmacists are undertakings for the purposes of competition law, PDF and the IPU are associations of undertakings and collective negotiation of fees, prices or margins on behalf of their members breaches section 4.1 of the 2002 Competition Act.  The position is as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Section 4.1 prohibits all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have the object or effect of restricting or distorting competition, including agreements to fix prices, unless the agreement, decision or concerted practice meets certain conditions.  I have been advised that those conditions are not met in this case.</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Wholesalers and pharmacy contractors are undertakings.  Therefore, PDF and the IPU are associations of undertakings and come under Section 4.1 of the Act.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The coming together of wholesalers under PDF or pharmacy contractors under the <Col N="321" />IPU to negotiate prices would be a breach of Section 4.1.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Acting in contravention of Section 4.1 is a criminal offence and would expose those parties and their officials to the risk of criminal prosecution.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In light of the implications for GP and dental contract negotiations, the Department sought the Attorney General&rsquo;s views.  The Attorney General and Senior Counsel engaged by the Attorney General confirmed the HSE advice.  Given this position, it is not possible for the State to negotiate with PDF or the IPU on fees or margins and such negotiations places these bodies at risk of prosecution.</P>
        <P>As for the rest of the supply chain, the State has been examining how to improve value for money and transparency and fairness in relation to the cost of service provision in community pharmacy.  The State intended to address the review through negotiation with the IPU, as it had in the past.  This is no longer possible for fees, although contractual matters other than fees may be negotiated.  Accordingly, the negotiating team re-examined, in light of the legal position arising from the wholesaler legal advice, how best to address the review of pharmacy contractor services.</P>
        <P>The HSE wrote to all community pharmacy contractors in January, setting out the situation in detail and stating that the HSE is constrained from negotiating fees with the IPU for the reasons outlined, and the IPU was fully briefed.   A meeting was held on 21 February between the negotiating team and the IPU, to agree a procedure to examine available options for advancing contractual negotiations in compliance with Irish and EU competition law.  Following that meeting, agreement was reached on talks to examine options for contract review that would comply fully with competition law.  The talks will be chaired by Mr Bill Shipsey, SC.  Both parties met Mr Shipsey yesterday, 2 April, to begin the process.</P>
        <P>The State continues to recognise the IPU as the representative body for its members, but negotiations with the Union must comply with the law.  The legal issues that emerged during the wholesale sector review were raised by the wholesaler representatives.  Once the State became aware of these issues, it was no longer possible to continue as intended.  There is, and will continue to be, ongoing dialogue with the IPU as the representative body for pharmacists, within the constraints of the competition legislation and the negotiating team will consider, in the context of competition law and in particular the relevant Competition Authority guidelines, all available options for advancing the process agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health.  I am satisfied that the Cabinet Committee process for review of the sup<Col N="322" />ply of drugs to the State is progressing effectively, within the constraints of relevant legislation.</P>

	<P>I welcome the valuable work being undertaken by the many groups and organisations around the country who are engaged in the provision of services and programmes for young people.  I recently received correspondence from the Centre about the provision of facilities for teenagers in its locality and I will be responding over the coming days.</P>
        <P>A National Recreation Policy has been to the forefront of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving the lives of young people in Ireland.  Accordingly, it is my intention to publish the National Recreation Policy for Young People at the earliest opportunity.  One of the key aspects of the policy is the provision of more recreational facilities and in particular, the establishment of youth caf&eacute;s, identified by young people as their single biggest need.  The policy recognises that youth caf&eacute;s offer great potential for providing a wide range of developmental, educational and information programmes to young people and that the provision of such services within these settings will require a cross-departmental and inter-agency collaborative approach through a formal partnership process.</P>

	<P>My Department is aware of the international research indicating that hydrogenated fats, including trans fats, are a contributor to heart disease and that these fats should be reduced.  This recommendation is included in the Nutrition Advisory Group&rsquo;s Recommendations for a Food and Nutrition Policy for Ireland (1995) and the Report of the Cardiovascular Health Strategy Group (1999).  Most hydrogenated fats and in particular trans fats eaten in Ireland are consumed in confectionary, biscuits and cakes as well as fried foods.</P>
        <P>My Department has Healthy Eating Guidelines and these state: &ldquo;Total fat should be reduced with an emphasis on reducing saturated fats. Some saturated fats may be replaced by unsaturated fats. Current evidence suggests that there should be no increase in trans fatty acid intake&rdquo;.  My Department also has a nutrition education guidance tool, the Food Pyramid, and foods that are high in hydrogenated and trans fats are represented on the smallest shelf at the top of the Food Pyramid and are recommended only to be eaten in very small amounts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the request of my Department, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s nutrition subcommittee has been asked to review the Healthy Eating Guidelines (2006).  This review runs concurrently with an EU request to the European Food Safety Authority to draw up nutrient -based dietary guidelines for EU member states.  Once these pan European nutrient-based guidelines are available, member states can then draw up National Food-Based Dietary Guidelines as applicable to each of their specific food consump<Col N="324" />tion intake patterns and incidence of diet-related diseases.</P>

	<P>I am committed to ensuring that the BreastCheck service is rolled out to the remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible.  I have allocated additional revenue funding of &euro;8 million for this year to meet the additional costs involved and I have approved an additional 69 posts for the roll-out.  BreastCheck appointed the Clinical Directors for the South and West last November and has recently appointed three Consultant Radiologists, two Consultant Surgeons and two Consultant Histopathologists, all with a special interest in breast disease.  The recruitment of Radiographers and other staff is under way.</P>
        <P>I have also made available an additional &euro;26.7m capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of five additional mobile units and state of the art digital <Col N="326" />equipment.  The static units at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital in Cork and University College Hospital Galway are on schedule for hand-over in September followed by a three week commissioning period.  They will be operational in October.</P>
        <P>Screening in individual counties will be dictated by BreastCheck&rsquo;s management and operational considerations.  In advance of the commissioning of the static unit in the South, BreastCheck is making every effort to achieve earlier roll-out through the use of a mobile unit.  Early deployment of a mobile unit in advance of the completion of the regional screening unit gives rise to particular and unique operational and recruitment challenges for BreastCheck in the South.  At present, these challenges have not been overcome and as a result it is not possible to indicate at this stage when an early mobile unit will be deployed.  As regards the West, BreastCheck expects the roll-out to commence in April.</P>

Parts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 of the Act, which relate to the administration of the service and the registration of births, stillbirths and deaths, were commenced on 5 December 2005.</P>
        <P>The new provisions for marriage are set out in Part 6 of the 2004 Act and include universal procedures for notification, solemnisation and registration of marriages, as well as a choice of venue for civil marriage ceremonies, provided for under section 52 of the Act.  Before the provisions can be commenced by statutory instrument, a substantial body of work needs to be completed, including drafting and publication of regulations, guidelines and detailed procedures; establishment of a register of solemnisers in consultation with religious bodies; and the further development of the computer system to facilitate the administration of the new marriage provisions intro<Col N="330" />duced in the Act.  Work in all these areas is underway and is progressing well.</P>
        <P>In view of the number of complex tasks involved in preparing for the commencement of the marriage provisions, it is not possible to be definitive as regards a date for signing commencement orders.  However, an tArd Chlaraitheoir is aiming to have this work completed by July 2007.  It is intended to give as much public notice as possible and a comprehensive public information campaign will be undertaken at the appropriate time.</P>

        <Quest> her views on whether the amendments she introduced to the Pharmacy Bill are adequate to prevent inappropriate economic relationships between doctors and pharmacists in view of the recent debate on the matter; her views on prohibiting business relationships between doctors and pharmacists or introducing a ban on the location of pharmacies in health centres; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear that there has been rapid growth of the pharmacy sector in recent times with many possible interactions arising between prescribers and dispensers. It is, however, my opinion, the vast majority of professionally qualified pharmacists and medical practitioners, adhere to the highest standards in the carrying out of their professional duties. However, it would be remiss not to recognise that, occasionally, unacceptable practices may arise between different professionals.  In view of these concerns, namely the practice of  low rents for doctors and high rents for pharmacy businesses in medical centres, and other such inducements, I have included provisions in the Pharmacy Bill 2007 to deal with this matter. I would also remind the Deputy of the recommendations of the Pharmacy Review Group in this regard, namely that there should be no beneficial ownership or business interest of any kind between dispensing and prescribing.</P>
        <P>The sections of the Bill dealing with this issue are as follows: (i) Section 63 which  deals with the prohibition of certain economic relationships between pharmacists and medical practitioners, namely either party having a beneficial interest in the others practice that would be considered in excess of standard ownership arrangements, and such as would constitute an excessive beneficial interest by virtue of these relationships. This would also involve company or corporate relationships by way of preferential leasing or tenancy arrangements, and (ii) Section 64 which deals with pharmacy and medical practices using shared premises, the type of improper economic relationships which it is considered necessary to prohibit that could arise by virtue of sharing <Col N="331" />premises, and also the expectation that any recommendations by prescribers of dispensers, or visa versa, would not be beyond that which arises through normal professional practice.  I am not ruling out the co-location of pharmacies and health centres but I am prohibiting arrangements which give rise to conflicts between prescribing and dispensing.</P>
        <P>I am confident that these two sections will achieve the fairest and most proportionate response to any possible conflicting situations, having regard to the basic legal and constitutional rights of all concerned.</P>

        <Quest> the estimated cost of introducing a personal health check for all, including screening for breast, cervical and prostate cancer. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12825/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The cost of introducing a personal health check depends on a range of variables, including type and frequency of diagnostic tests, the cohort(s) of the population to be covered, the setting in which tests would be conducted and the arrangements, including possible contractual arrangements with private health service providers, put in place for the delivery of such a programme.</P>
        <P>A further and significant issue is that a personal health check programme would undoubtedly result in the earlier detection of previously unidentified disease in individuals.  This would unlock significant demand for treatment services in primary care, continuing care and the acute hospital sector to assure the prompt, appropriate and effective treatment of individuals invited for a personal health check who are identified with disease or at risk of disease.  The service and cost implications in this regard would require detailed examination if a personal health check programme were being developed.</P>
        <P>Evidence based population screening programmes are an essential element of the National Cancer Control Strategy which I published last June.  As the Deputy is aware, on 1 January this year, I established a National Cancer Screening Service Board which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme, both of which will be rolled out nationally this year.  The total allocation to the new Service in 2007 is &euro;33m.  This is a 71% increase on the 2006 allocation to the Programmes and includes an additional &euro;8m for BreastCheck and an additional &euro;5m for the Irish Cervical Screening Programme.  The Service will also advise on the implementation of a national colorectal screening programme.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Primary Care Strategy aims to develop services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive received an additional &euro;10m  in funding in 2006 to enable the establishment of up to 100 Primary Care Teams.  A further &euro;22m is being provided in 2007 to meet the full year costs of the Teams initiated in 2006 and to enable a further 100 Primary Care Teams to be established.  The Government has committed under the Towards 2016 agreement to the establishment of  300 Primary Care Teams by 2008; 400 by 2009; and 500 by 2011.  A review of these targets will be undertaken in 2008.</P>
        <P>GP out of hours co-operatives allow general practitioners to put in place arrangements to provide services  to their patients, while their surgeries are closed in the evenings, on weekends and bank holidays. The development of GP co-operatives is in line with the overall health service policy of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that to the greatest extent possible, people&rsquo;s care needs are met in the primary care setting.</P>
        <P>Out of hours co-operatives are now in place in all Health Service Executive (HSE) areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties. Between 2000 and 2006 approximately &euro;139 million was allocated to the HSE for out of hours GP co-operatives. In 2007,  the HSE Vote includes almost  &euro;34 million in baseline funding for these services and a further &euro;3 million  to meet the full year cost of co-op developments commenced in 2006. These figures do not include the fees of the participating doctors.</P>
        <P>As the development of further out-of-hours general practitioner services is a  matter for the Health Service Executive in the first instance, my Department has  requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to consider the matter of the estimated cost of ensuring that every community has access to such a service and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>In relation to the recommendations contained in the Eleventh Report of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs &mdash; &ldquo;Defining Music Therapy&rdquo; &mdash; in relation to the recognition of music therapy, the Deputy will appreciate that the development of the human resources of the health service must be dictated by service developments and strongly evidence-based decision making aligned closely to improved patient and client care.  The creation of a new health service profession should only be considered in circumstances where there is a clearly identified service requirement for the provision of a new set of skills and competencies, knowledge and expertise which cannot be provided by existing health service staff/professions.</P>
        <P>The establishment of new grades within the public health service is a human resource management matter for the Health Service Executive which, under Section 22 of the Health Act 2004, must have the approval of the Minister for Health and Children given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  My Department has advised the HSE that if it wishes to proceed with the establishment of a grade of music therapist in the health service, it must establish a business case for the introduction of the grade on the basis of service need and effective use of resources.  My Department has given the HSE some guidance as to what information should be encompassed by such a business case and a response from the HSE is awaited.</P>
        <P>The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for health and social care professionals.  The structure of the system of statutory registration comprises a registration <Col N="334" />board for each profession to be registered, a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system and a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters.</P>
        <P>Music therapists or creative arts therapists are not one of the professions to be regulated from the outset.  However, Section 4 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act provides for the inclusion by regulation of additional professions in the system of statutory registration.    This section also sets out the criteria the Minister for Health and Children must have regard to in considering the designation of further professions under the legislation.   The Deputy will appreciate that the future inclusion of any profession must be dependent upon its meeting  this criteria.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I launched the Health and Social Care Professionals Council on 26 March and the Council held its inaugural meeting on this date.  I understand that the Council intends to make a recommendation to the Minister in relation to the establishment of registration boards for the twelve professions to be registered from the outset as soon as practicable.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that the Council will need to undertake a considerable amount of work, as detailed in the legislation, before it will be in a position to recommend the establishment of registration boards.</P>

	<P>The relevant statutory regulatory body for the registration of pharmacists in Ireland is the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) and all queries regarding the specifics of the qualifications required to become registered to practice pharmacy in the State should be addressed to them.  The PSI registers non-EU\EEA pharmacists by way of its &ldquo;adjudication route of registration&rdquo;.  As you may be aware the Society has currently suspended this route.  I might add that the Society did submit amended regulations to me for approval; however, the legal advice was that there are legal difficulties with these amended regulations in the context of the current legislation and they cannot be approved.  I should also make you aware that new pharmacy legislation is currently before the Oireachtas and among the issues being addressed is that of registration of pharmacists, including non-EU\EEA pharmacists.

	<P>Tackling Healthcare-Associated Infections (HCAIs), including MRSA, is a priority for the Government and for the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Recently-published studies show that in Ireland, the overall rate of HCAIs, which includes MRSA, is lower than our UK counterparts.  However, it is generally accepted that MRSA infection rates in the UK and Ireland are higher than our European counterparts.  Excessive antibiotic prescribing is a key cause of these higher rates.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has recently developed a National Infection Control Action Plan including governance and performance management.  The plan includes a commitment to informing patients of HCAI/MRSA status and to ensuring that death certificates accurately reflect HCAI.  The plan has clear targets for all hospitals, clear hygiene and infection control standards, an improved physical environment, initiatives on reducing antibiotic consumption and education of the public and of health professionals, including the current T.V. and media campaign.</P>
        <P>Achieving these targets is a priority for the HSE so that patients can be assured that in the future their chances of contracting an infection will be reduced to the minimum level possible.  To achieve this, there must be a corporate commitment throughout the HSE and services generally.  Evidence-based guidelines, clear responsibility and accountability and the recognition that the public also has a role to play in improving HCAIs and MRSA are vital to achieving improvements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 361 and 372 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the European Commission&rsquo;s Final Report of the Energy Sector Inquiry 2005-2006, which was conducted by DG Competition and published by the Commission last January.</P>
        <P>The Inquiry comprehensively investigated the barriers currently impeding the development of a fully functioning open and competitive EU-wide energy market. It examined the situation under a number of headings in each Member State.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s findings in essence are that while there is progress, a number of further measures are needed to achieve a complete internal energy market with open competition and effective regulation across Europe.</P>
        <P>One of the areas highlighted by the Commission is the critical importance of transparency for the efficient working of wholesale electricity markets. All market players must have timely access to the information necessary to trade, particularly in relation to demand, supply and transmission network issues. This is endorsed by the European Regulators (including CER), the European Transmission System Operators and the European Electricity Industry and Trading Groups. The Inquiry found that there is still a lack of transparency in most Member States when measured against a range of information headings.</P>
        <P>It is the case that Ireland scored low in terms of the league table on the number of issues for which information is published. It is also the case that CER and EirGrid are working to steadily improve the availability of information to all market participants. Addressing the transparency of information barrier, together with the other barriers to a fully level playing field in the electricity market is a key priority. An immediate objective is to ensure that the Single Electricity Market is fully transparent in all key respects. The Regulators North and South, together with EirGrid and SONI as the Transmission System Operators are working to put this in place.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s Energy Sector Inquiry further serves to underline the crucial importance of the comprehensive policy actions, set out in the Energy Policy White Paper, which we are taking in order to create an open, fair and competitive electricity sector which works in the interests of the consumer. The Government&rsquo;s decision to transfer the ownership of the transmission assets from ESB to EirGrid by the end of next year is critical in that context. The combining of the ownership and operation of transmission in EirGrid is proportionate, will create efficiencies, and is necessary for effective competition. It will instill confidence in all market players that the <Col N="342" />transmission system is operated independently of commercial interests in a strictly non-discriminatory manner. We will also ensure the progressive reduction in ESB&rsquo;s market share in power generation to around 40% in an all-island market context by 2010 through implementation of the CER-ESB Asset Strategy Agreement. EirGrid will be working with CER to develop a landbank of ESB owned sites by 2008 to facilitate independent power generation investment up to 2020. This will complement the release of ESB sites under the CER-ESB Agreement this year and incrementally up to 2010.</P>
        <P>The White Paper also endorses the actions by CER to progressively reduce the dominance of ESB PES in competitive sectors of the retail electricity market which will see the delivery of real and effective competition in energy supply. The White Paper also commits to a comprehensive review of the Irish energy regulatory framework following the introduction of the Single Electricity Market. The review will take into account the further developments in the EU internal energy market.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 363 and 364 together.</P>
        <P>The function of the Licensing Authority for sea-fishing boats was transferred under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 to the Registrar General of Fishing Boats. The Act provides that <Col N="343" />the Licensing Authority is independent in the exercise of its functions under the Act, subject to the law for the time being in force and policy directives in relation to sea-fishing boat licensing.</P>
        <P>The Registrar General has informed me that in accordance with the provisions of the EU Common Fishery Policy a Sea-Fishing Boat Licence is required in respect of boats engaged in aquaculture activities, which include Oyster fisheries, where such activities include, at any time:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. Having on-board fishing gear as specified in Table 3 of Annex 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 26/2004 of 30 December 2003 as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1799/2006 of 6 December 2006 on the Community fishing fleet register or</P>
        <P LI="1">2. Engaging in commercial sea-fishing activities outside aquaculture areas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The entitlement to engage in any of the activities outlined above depends on the segment of the fleet in which the boat is licensed and registered. Where a boat is licensed and registered within the Aquaculture Segment of the Irish fishing fleet, it is a condition of the licence that the boat shall be used solely for the management, development and servicing of aquaculture areas.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that boats licensed and registered within the Aquaculture Segment are not subject to the entry/exit regime, whereby replacement capacity must be removed from the Irish fishing fleet register before the boat may be licensed or registered. Where it is intended that a boat may be engaged in activities other that management, development and servicing of aquaculture areas, the boat should be licensed and registered in either the Polyvalent or Specific Segment. In either case, the entry/exit regime applies and replacement capacity must be removed from the same segment of the fleet before the boat may be licensed and registered in either segment.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband by private sector companies is a matter for the companies themselves operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. </P>
        <P>It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country. In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage. These include investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in over 120 towns and cities. These MANs will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs. My Department has also provided grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme.</P>
        <P>However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there are still some parts of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. A Steering Committee comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently finalising the proposed National Broadband Scheme, which will aim to provide broadband to these unserved areas. The scheme, when it is fully rolled out, should ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in unserved areas, including rural areas, are met. Work on the design of an appropriate public tender is underway and indicative maps are being prepared to help inform the tendering process.</P>

	<P>The estimated cost of ESB&rsquo;s construction of a 430MW Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant at Aghada reflects a fundamental shift in worldwide market dynamics for CCGT plant, fuelled by rising commodity prices for speciality steels and other prefabricated materials, in addition to increasing labour costs. The availability of engineering resources is also becoming a limiting factor restricting suppliers&rsquo; ability to scale up production to meet the increasing demand. This shift is a worldwide phenomenon and is not restricted to projects in this country.</P>
        <P>Prior to granting my approval for the relevant capital expenditure on the Aghada project, I received clear assurances from ESB that it had independently validated this upward movement in commodity prices and labour costs as part of its contract negotiation process and that it had satisfied itself that the cost of the power plant in Aghada reflects current global market prices and represents the best value for money outcome in difficult power plant market circumstances.</P>
        <P>With construction commencing in December 2000 and October 2005 respectively, the cost of constructing the two Huntstown power plants was reflective of more favourable market circumstances at the time the EPC (Engineering Procurement Construction) contracts were awarded.</P>

        <P>The Conservation of and Prohibition on Sale of Coarse Fish Bye-law No. 806, 2006, which came into effect on 20 July 2006, introduced a series of controls to protect coarse fish stocks. The Conservation of Pike Bye-law No. 809, 2006, which came into effect on 3 August 2006, was primarily brought in to protect pike.</P>
        <P>The impact of these bye-laws, which were introduced as a conservation measure, is being monitored by the Regional Fisheries Boards and <Col N="349" />their application will be reviewed over time. The suggested amendments by the Deputy would presume that reduced conservation effort is necessary. It is, I understand, too soon to make such a judgement.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of any adverse impact on angling tourism for coarse fish in the area of the Great Western Lakes, which are primarily managed as a wild brown trout fishery and are, according to the fisheries board, attracting many thousands of tourist trout anglers to the West every year.</P>
        <P>The bye-laws were introduced to prevent overexploitation of coarse fish and pike in rivers, canals and lakes where there may have been excessive exploitation taking place. I have received no reports that the bag limits applying adversely affect tourism angling.</P>

	<P>The Western Regional Fisheries Board is charged with managing what I am advised are three of the top four wild brown trout fisheries in the country. Part of the Board&rsquo;s remit has been to maximise the wild brown trout populations in these lakes, which have been carefully managed over the past 50 years. </P>
        <P>This management programme has necessitated, I understand, the removal of predator and competitor species from the lakes is carried out on scientific advice so that the wild brown trout populations can be maximised. As a consequence Loughs Corrib and Mask in particular are now renowned as the top wild brown trout fisheries and are attracting many thousands of tourist trout anglers to the West every year.</P>
        <P>In addition Ireland also has a requirement to protect the indigenous species composition of these lakes under the Water Framework Directive so as a result introduced species such as pike, perch and roach are removed, on scientific advice, from the lake. I am informed that the Western Regional Fisheries Board is currently engaged in a public consultation process for the Great Western Lakes with a view to introducing conservation measures for wild brown trout.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should be advised that it is only in these three lakes and their tributaries in the Western Fisheries Region where the coarse fish numbers are controlled and there remain numerous lakes in the region where pike are available for the local and tourist anglers to catch on a catch and release basis.</P><Col N="350" />
        <P>The Conservation of Pike Bye-law No. 809, 2006, to which the Deputy has referred, was primarily brought in as a conservation measure to protect pike nationally from overexploitation in rivers, canals and lakes where excessive exploitation was taking place. I have received no reports that the bag limits applying adversely affect tourism angling.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has decided that a fundamental restructuring of the inland fisheries sector is required. Under Government policy the sector is to be reorganised <Col N="351" />by subsuming the existing central and regional fisheries boards into a single National Inland Fisheries Authority (NIFA) whose executive functions will be aligned on a regional basis with the river basin districts.</P>
        <P>Due to competing priorities for time in the Oireachtas legislative calendar, however, it has not been possible to introduce the legislation required to facilitate the establishment of the new authority, to date. In the meantime, officials from the Department are working with management of the fisheries boards to examine how the existing legislation governing the inland fisheries sector, which dates back to 1959, can be modernised and consolidated into a single statute.</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the river Laune in County Kerry.  As the Deputy is aware, the Conservation of Salmon and Sea Trout Bye-Law No. 814, 2006, which came into operation on 1 st January 2007, provides for an annual bag limit of 10 fish for 2007 subject to a season bag limit of one fish during the period 1 st March to 12th May in those rivers open for salmon fishing this year.</P>
        <P>On the recommendation of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, along with advice obtained from the Standing Scientific Committee of the National Salmon Commission following a review of the available scientific data, I amended the bye law in respect of the river Feale.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the South Western Regional Fisheries Board that, according to the available scientific data, there is a surplus of 971 spring fish available in the river Laune for 2007. However, this surplus may be over-exploited by commercial fishermen and anglers in the absence of a definite quota for spring salmon in 2007.</P>
        <P>Since the primary management objective for 2007 is the conservation of salmon stocks, the precautionary approach dictates that additional risk should not be taken. I am considering the recommendation of the regional board in the context of additional advice to be obtained independent of the board. I will make a decision on this matter as soon as possible.</P>

        <askee>Minister for <Col N="352" />Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the position in relation to the fishing quotas which were formerly associated with the Atlantic Dawn fishing vessel, which it is understood has been sold out of the Irish fishing fleet. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12937/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The MFV Atlantic Dawn has been deregistered from the Irish fleet and, I understand, sold to a foreign buyer. The vessel&rsquo;s pelagic capacity, in terms of gross tonnage and kilowatts, can be re-introduced onto the Irish register within 2 years. If the capacity is not re-introduced onto the Irish register within 2 years, the capacity will be lost to the owner and will revert to the National pool. </P>
        <P>No such 2 year grace period applies in terms of quota allocations. Any quota allocated to Atlantic Dawn Ltd that was not caught by the date of deregistration of the MFV Atlantic Dawn reverted immediately to the National pool. Atlantic Dawn Ltd was allocated some 2,927 tonnes of mackerel quota and 706 tonnes of horse mackerel quota in respect of the MFV Atlantic Dawn. Some 343 tonnes of mackerel remained uncaught at the time of the Atlantic Dawn&rsquo;s deregistration. This 343 tonnes has now reverted to the National pool. There was no horse mackerel uncaught.</P>
        <P>When a vessel is taken off the register mid-year, normal practice is, where possible, to facilitate the owners in transferring the unused allocation to any eligible replacement vessel they introduce onto the register before 7 December. If this does not happen, I will redistribute the unused quota in accordance with the usual criteria.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy Ferris&rsquo;s Question No. 79 of 27th March 2007, I made clear my policy on this matter. However, I may have caused some confusion by also inadvertently agreeing with the Deputy&rsquo;s assertion that the Atlantic Dawn&rsquo;s unused quota stays with the vessel for 2 years. I believe that I have clarified the matter today.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb Commander during the Bosnian war, was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 1995 for his role in the killing of some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He is one of a number of war crimes suspects believed to remain at large in Serbia in spite of the obligation of the Serbian Government, as a member of the United Nations, to cooperate fully with the <Col N="356" />ICTY in arresting Mladic and other suspects and transferring them to custody in The Hague to face trial. Cooperation with ICTY is a precondition for all the States of the region in pursuing talks on Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAAs) with the EU. Given Serbia&rsquo;s failure to cooperate with the ICTY, as certified by the ICTY Chief Prosecutor, the EU Commission suspended the SAA negotiations with Serbia on 3 May 2006. </P>
        <P>The EU has not resumed talks with Serbia on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. The position is that the Member States, at the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 12 February 2007, reiterated the commitment to a European perspective for Serbia and welcomed the Commission&rsquo;s readiness to resume negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with a new government in Belgrade provided it shows clear commitment to full cooperation with the ICTY and takes concrete and effective action in this regard. I hope that a new reformist Government will soon be in place in Serbia, and that it will quickly demonstrate its willingness to take the necessary steps to meet the Union&rsquo;s requirements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am satisfied that there is no basis for the allegations to which the Deputy refers.  In an overall context, the Government and our EU partners have consistently made it clear in our contacts with the Israeli authorities that we recognise Israel&rsquo;s right, and duty, to protect its citizens from attack. However, it is essential that all military operations are carried out in accordance with international humanitarian law and with full respect for the rights and welfare of Palestinian civilians. We regularly convey our concerns about the human rights implications of Israeli security policies, and have condemned various specific actions by the security forces. We continue to monitor the situation in the Occupied Territories closely. </P>
        <P>The Government remains convinced that there can be no military or unilateral solutions to the Israeli &ndash; Palestinian conflict. I believe that there is now a political opportunity to revive a credible peace process based on negotiations for a viable two-State solution. In this context, the EU has called very clearly for an end to all violence in and from the Occupied Territories. All rocket attacks on Israeli territory should cease, and Israel should end military operations in Gaza and the West Bank. The priority now should be to ensure that the ceasefire in Gaza is extended to <Col N="357" />the West Bank, and that attention can be focused firmly on the possibilities for political progress.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 253 of 1968, which imposed mandatory sanctions on the illegal regime in what was then Southern Rhodesia, new passports, or the renewal of existing ones, were not processed in the period 29 May 1968 to 21 December 1979 to Irish citizens for emigration to Southern Rhodesia nor to those of our citizens residing in Southern Rhodesia whose activities furthered or encouraged the unlawful actions of the regime. Since those restrictions were lifted, people who were affected have been able to avail of Irish passport facilities in the same way as Irish citizens generally. </P>
        <P>The Department has been unable to locate a record of any individual passport having been withdrawn from an Irish citizen in the then Rhodesia during that period. However, if the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I will be happy to have the position checked out further.</P>

        <P>The Arts Council&rsquo;s Joint Purchase Scheme operated from the mid 1950&rsquo;s up until 2004.  During this time approximately 200 organisations availed of the scheme and almost 1,800 works were jointly purchased.  The scheme was established to raise public awareness of, and exposure to, contemporary Irish Art.</P>
        <P>A detailed breakdown of these works is not currently available, other than the list available on the Great Southern Hotel Collection, which was compiled by the Arts Council on my instruction.  These works have since been returned to the State by the Dublin Airport Authority and will reside in the Crawford Gallery in Cork.</P>
        <P>The Arts Council is proposing to undertake a comprehensive audit of all works purchased under the Joint Purchase Scheme and to establish the current location of such works.  In view of the range of organisations and number of works involved, the Art Council anticipates that this work will take some time to complete.</P>
        <P>With regard to the sale of a Jack B. Yeats painting, purchased under the scheme, the Arts Council is satisfied that the painting was disposed of in accordance with the terms of the scheme under which it was originally purchased.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>During the year 2006, there were thirteen site visits to Athlone and four site visits to Mullingar.  There were no site visits to Longford.</P>
        <P>In line with the National Spatial Strategy (NSS), a key goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development.  Counties Westmeath and Longford form part of the IDA Midlands Region together with counties Laois, Offaly and Roscommon.  The locations of emphasis for IDA in this region are the NSS Gateway towns of Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar.  In addition, the Agency actively promotes the county towns of Portlaoise, Longford and Roscommon.  The region will also benefit from the ongoing investment in transport, energy and utilities set out in the new National Development Plan.</P>
        <P>At present there are 3,320 people employed in twenty six IDA companies in Counties Westmeath and Longford.  Competition for mobile FDI continues to intensify and Ireland is no longer a low labour cost environment. Companies seeking to invest in Ireland now are looking for a high quality urban environment with a critical mass in population and world-class access infrastructure. In addition, they are seeking third level educational infrastructure including Universities and Institutes of Technology that are located on, <Col N="367" />or close to, high quality Business and Technology Parks.</P>
        <P>To meet this challenge, IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions in the Region, in developing the skill-sets necessary to attract high value added employment.  IDA is also working with FAS to provide guidance in developing the skill-sets needed by those already in the workforce.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the policies and strategies in place will deliver the best results in terms of investment and jobs for the people of the Region.</P>

No. 311 of 1979) as most recently amended by the Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 630 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The purpose of the 1979 Regulations as amended is to control retail stores (petrol filling stations) and private stores for the keeping of petroleum Class 1 (petroleum-spirit) through a system of licensing, in order to prevent risk of injury to persons or property in the storage, conveying, loading and unloading, and in dispensing operations carried on in connection with the stores.  Under the Regulations, all sites storing petrol must hold a licence that is issued by a licensing authority &mdash; typically the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P>The 1979 Regulations stipulate a number of requirements that would prohibit or restrict the operation of fully automated unmanned filling stations in Ireland, including the requirement that the dispensing of petroleum must be constantly supervised and controlled by an authorised person.</P>
        <P>Petroleum Class 1 is a flammable liquid posing a much higher danger than diesel or kerosene due to its very low flash point (the temperature at which the vapour will ignite), hence the detailed and specific legislation controlling its storage and dispensing.</P>

	<P>All 78 ACP countries come under the terms of the Cotonou Agreement, which includes provision for duty free access for most goods to the EU.  Within the ACP group there are 41 Least Developed Countries (LDCs) that benefit from the European Council Regulation of 1st of March 2001. That Regulation amended the EU&rsquo;s Generalised Scheme of Preferences so as to extend duty and quota free access to all products, except arms and ammunition, originating in LDCs. This Regulation is known as the Everything But Arms Initiative. Notwithstanding this initiative, tariffs continue to be levied for the sensitive products of <Col N="369" />rice and sugar. Rice is due to be fully liberalised by September 2009 and sugar is scheduled to be fully liberalised by July 2009.  </P>
        <P>All of the statistical information required by the Deputy, including the revenue collected from the EU&rsquo;s trade with the ACP countries, is not immediately available from the European Commission.</P>
        <P>The best available information is that ACP countries exported &euro; 36,033,520 worth of goods to the EU in 2005, which represented 3.05% of the EU&rsquo;s total imports. These goods were categorised under 29 tariff lines. Nearly 97% of ACP exports to the EU do not attract tariffs.  The remaining 3% are subject to &ldquo;Most Favoured Nation&rdquo; duties.</P>

	<P>My Office has received correspondence from the Irish Travel Agents Association and a number of the Association&rsquo;s members regarding their concerns in relation to particular provisions of the Consumer Protection Bill, which recently completed its passage through the Dail.</P>
        <P>The Association is concerned that the provisions in the Bill prohibiting traders from imposing additional charges on customers by reason of the customer choosing to make payment for goods or services by one specified method over another will severely impact on the business of the Association&rsquo;s members.</P>
        <P>The provisions merely seek to prohibit differential pricing by traders based on method of payment.  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the vast majority of traders do not impose surcharges for accepting payment by particular methods and do not differentiate in price as between payment methods.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the foregoing, I am mindful of the concerns expressed by the Association and in this regard officials of my Department and my colleague Minister of State Killeen both recently met with the Association to discuss these concerns.

	<P>As the matter is in the hands of a High Court appointed liquidator I have not met with the farmers or considered any proposals to ensure that creditors will be paid.</P>
        <P>A liquidator was appointed in January 2002 and in accordance with the obligations set out in section 56(1) of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, the liquidator subsequently submitted a report to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  As relief was not granted by that Office, the liquidator, in accordance with section 56(2), made an application to the Court under section 150 of the Companies Act 1990 to have the directors restricted.</P>
        <P>The judgment of Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan was delivered on 20 July 2004 and the Court determined that all four directors should be restricted for a period of five years.  In the case of one director a stay of execution applies to the restriction order pending the outcome of his appeal to the Supreme Court which is still awaited.</P>
        <P>The appointment of a liquidator in January 2002 was preceded by the appointment of a receiver by Anglo Irish Bank PLC on 10 October 2001 who disposed of the principal assets of the company. As the company was insolvent, there were insufficient assets available to pay off all creditors. I understand that the latest liquidators report registered with the Companies Registration Office was in December 2006. I have no further information and have no function here as the matter is in the hands of a court appointed liquidator.</P>

	<P>The Health and Safety Authority in 2006, as part of its ongoing day-to-day operations, promoted the occupational safety, health and welfare management system and the audit tool <Col N="373" />for the health sector, which was developed in partnership with that sector.  During 2006 the Authority carried out inspections concentrating on health and safety management in the health services sector, following up on the 2005 campaign in accident and emergency departments of large hospitals. This programme also involved the review of procedures for ensuring better infection control in hospitals so that the health and safety of employees is protected.</P>
        <P>The inspections highlighted problems and inadequacy of procedures in most of the hospitals in the following areas: risk assessments for manual handling and for ergonomics; procedures for dealing with violence and aggression in overcrowded departments; handling of chemical and biological agents; prevention of slips, trips and falls; overcrowding and congestion; and infection control.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Authority has followed up on these inspections, where appropriate, with the Health Services Executive (HSE).</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s 2007 programme of work commits it to again targeting existing health and safety management systems and practices in the sector, through a programme of 200 inspections. These inspections will focus on worker protection in general hospitals, nursing homes and psychiatric institutions and will include risk assessments for work activities, maintenance/cleaning procedures, security/ violence procedures, manual handling and control of biological agents.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare Division of the Health Service Executive.  The objective of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of an eligible person living in private rented accommodation who is unable to provide for his or her accommodation costs from within his or her own resources and who does not have accommodation available from any other source. One of the conditions for receipt of rent supplement is that the applicant must be deemed to have a genuine housing need which cannot be met from any other source. </P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has been contacted regarding this case and has advised that it <Col N="376" />had refused payment of rent supplement to the person concerned on the grounds that she had vacated accommodation provided to her by the local housing authority.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 436 and 437 together.</P>
        <P>Approximately 76 per cent of workers pay PRSI Class A at the rate of 4 per cent. A further 11 per cent of workers pay social insurance contributions at the Class S rate. These contributions which are subject to various thresholds, allowances and ceilings, accrue entitlement to a range of benefits and pensions under various social insurance schemes. The current employee PRSI ceiling stands at &euro;48,800 per annum.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that a decrease in the employee PRSI rate from 4% to 2% would reduce Social Insurance Fund income by some &euro;720 million in a full year. The abolition of the PRSI ceiling for ordinary employees would yield some &euro;295 million in additional contribution income. A decrease in the self-employed PRSI rate (Class S) from 3% to 2% is estimated to cost approximately &euro;220 million in a full year. Of course if introduced as a package, the combination of measures could give rise to a compound effect.</P>
        <P>Revisions to PRSI rates and the employee ceiling are considered annually in a budgetary context, with changes incorporated into the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005, as required.</P>

	<P>In February 2006 as part of its reform of the Health Sector, the Government decided that the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, as well as certain other functions, will be transferred to my Department.  The transfer of functions will not change the role of the CWOs and SCWOs.  They will remain community based and, in addition to providing financial supports to individuals, will continue to provide key information, advice, advocacy and referral links between agencies.  There will be no loss of flexibility, discretion or personal service on the part of CWOs or SCWOs.   On the issue of pay, SCWOs and CWOs are paid by reference to agreed standard incremental scales of pay appropriate to their grade and these will continue to apply on their transfer to my Department.  </P>

	<P>The National Pensions Review, published in January 2006, includes recommendations from the Pensions Board designed to encourage people to continue working after normal retirement age. The measures suggested involve allowing people to defer receiving their social welfare pension at normal pension age and to grant them an actuarially enhanced payment when they claim. The Pensions Board also considered that if this was combined with allowing those with less than full entitlements to count contributions made after age 65 or 66 in order to improve their contribution record, this would complete the incentives for longer working within the social welfare pensions system. </P>
        <P>However, there are many aspects to the issue of longer working and these will need to be addressed in a comprehensive way. As the House is aware, the Government is preparing a Green Paper on pensions. This is being finalised at present and I expect to be in a position to publish it in the near future. The Green Paper will include an examination of all the issues surrounding retirement age, the barriers faced by older workers who wish to remain in employment and the incentives in this regard which can be offered through the social welfare system. Following the publication of the Green Paper, a consultation process will take place and the Government will respond to this by publishing a framework for future policy in this area.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; indicator, also referred to as the rate of relative poverty, measures all those who fall below a certain income threshold, which in the EU has been set at 60 per cent of median income, adjusted for family size. The latest comparative figures from Eurostat refer to 2005 when Ireland had an &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate of 20 per cent compared to an average of 16 per cent for the EU 25. It should be noted that these figures are calculated using a methodology that differs from the one used by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to calculate the national rate of &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo;. Using the CSO methodology shows an &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate of 18.5 per cent in 2005, down from 19.7 per cent in 2003. </P>
        <P>It has been acknowledged that the &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; indicator is not suited to making comparisons between countries at different stages of economic development. The problems inherent in using the indicator for international comparisons have been stated on a number of occasions and in various expert journals.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the indicator does not measure poverty as such, but rather the proportion of people below a certain income threshold who may be &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo;. Whether persons below the 60 per cent threshold are actually experiencing poverty will depend on a number of factors, including the degree to which income is below the relevant thresholds; the <Col N="380" />length of time on this relatively low income and the possession and use of other assets, especially one&rsquo;s own home.</P>
        <P>The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; indicator has particular limitations as a measure of poverty in the case of Ireland in recent years. It takes no account of overall living standards and fails to reflect the fact that in Ireland the 60 per cent median income threshold increased by 104 per cent between 1997 and 2005. Over the same period, prices (CPI) increased by 30.6 per cent, average industrial earnings increased by 56.4 per cent and basic social welfare payments increased by 79.1 per cent. The high levels of economic growth led to an increase in the number of women in the workforce and, consequently, in the number of two income households. Incomes in these cases outpaced the incomes of those who were not in the workforce and of some single income families. All groups in society have benefited from economic growth, therefore the main value of the indicator is in identifying particular groups which may have difficulty keeping pace with living standards generally.</P>
        <P>In order to establish the actual extent of poverty, Ireland has developed an indicator, known as consistent poverty, which identifies the proportion of people &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo;, who are also deprived of certain goods or services considered essential for a basic standard of living. The overall goal of the new National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016, published in February, is to make a decisive impact on remaining levels of consistent poverty. This is underlined by the fact that a new target has been set, using an updated set of indicators, which is more realistic and in keeping with living standards today. The new target is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty from the 2005 level of 7 per cent to between 2 per cent and 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016. I am confident that this new NAP inclusion will build on the achievements of the last decade and deliver greater social inclusion and a society in which remaining consistent poverty is eliminated.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The living alone increase is an additional payment of &euro;7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone. It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes. The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone. </P>
        <P>The policy in relation to support for pensioners has been, for many years, to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension rather than focusing on payments such as the living alone increase. This approach ensures that resources are used to improve the position of all pensioners and is subject to regular review. It was decided in the context of Budget 2007 to continue this policy with maximum increases of &euro;16 and &euro;18 per week granted on personal rates giving a maximum rate of the state pension (contributory) of &euro;209.30 per week and a maximum non-contributory pension of &euro;200 per week. Taking account of the increases in the Budget, since 1996 pensions have increased by almost 119% or about 57% in real terms.  The person concerned is in receipt of State pension (contributory) at the maximum rate along with the living alone increase and has received the full benefit of the Budget increases.</P>

The person appealed against that decision.  I am advised that the case has been considered by the Appeals <Col N="384" />Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing.  A date for the hearing will be set as possible.  Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.

	<P>Transport 21 provides for the completion of the inter-connector (and the associated electrification project) by 2015. I understand from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that it expects to have preliminary design work on the inter-connector completed in August. The work includes verifying the proposed alignment, developing station designs and layouts, carrying out geotechnical ground investigations, establishing detailed cost estimates and liaising with landowners, local authorities and other key third parties.</P>
        <P>At that stage, a detailed timetable for the further planning and design of the project and its implementation will be determined on foot of this report. I will be seeking to ensure that this project, which is critical for the development of railway services in the Dublin area is advanced to completion as quickly as possible. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have established a strong record for the implementation of projects on time and within budget. This experience will be of benefit in taking forward the inter-connector project.</P>

	<P>The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 provide that a driver shall not overtake, or attempt to overtake, unless the roadway ahead of the driver is free from approaching traffic, pedestrians and any obstruction, and is sufficiently long and wide to permit the overtaking to be completed without danger or inconvenience to other traffic or pedestrians. Such overtaking includes moving from a marked traffic lane to overtake parked vehicles.  The Regulations also provide that a driver shall not overtake, or attempt to overtake, on a stretch of roadway on which traffic sign number RRM 001 [continuous white line] has been provided on a roadway and that the parking of vehicles is prohibited on a section of roadway with less than 3 traffic lanes where traffic sign number RRM 001 has been provided. </P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The level of motor insurance premiums is measured by the CSO using as a base the costs obtaining in December 2001 which is allocated an index of 100. Using this scale the costs for motor insurance in February 2002 measured 99.6 index points. From that date, costs rose to 108 index points in April 2003.  Motor insurance costs have subsequently reduced and at February 2007 the index stood at 70.5 points, a reduction of 34.7% since April 2003.</P>
        <P>There are various factors contributing to this reduction. The introduction of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board was a major step as was the Civil Liability and Courts Act which includes penalties for giving false or misleading evidence in personal injury cases. In addition, random breath testing, increased resources to the Garda Traffic Corps and the roll-out of the penalty points system are expected to deliver better driver behaviour and reduced frequency of traffic accidents. These initiatives are having a positive effect on motor insurance premiums and I am confident that they will continue to do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 464 and 490 together. </P>
        <P>The Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) intend investing &euro;2bn in new facilities over the next decade to radically improve the passenger experience at Dublin Airport. More than &euro;1bn will be spent between now and the end of 2009. As a result a new departures facility Pier D will open this autumn, the new passenger terminal T2 is scheduled to open in 2009 and an extension to the existing terminal will be completed by Autumn 2008.</P>
        <P>The DAA is investing significantly to deliver a second parallel runway, as well as new aircraft parking stands and taxiways. DAA believe that these investments will allow Dublin Airport to comfortably handle up to 35 million passengers per year and will create a vibrant modern airport that will be an efficient gateway to the Ireland of the 21st century.</P>
        <P>From the point of view of civil aviation policy generally, my view is that Dublin Airport has considerable scope to expand to cater for growth in air traffic for many years to come. Indeed the national spatial strategy has acknowledged that the expansion of the level of air services from Dublin Airport to a wider range of destinations is essential in the interests of underpinning Ireland&rsquo;s future international competitiveness.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s objective with regard to aviation policy is to facilitate and encourage a wide a range as possible of reliable, regular and competitive commercial air services to maximise opportunities for Irish tourism, trade and industry. My Department&rsquo;s strategy is to promote, where possible, new air services and, where necessary, to put in place new or modified air transport agreements.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that EU Transport Ministers recently approved a draft Open Skies Air Transport Agreement between the EU and the US. It is now expected that the agreement will be signed at the EU US summit on 30 April 2007. The benefits for Ireland will be very significant in terms of increased tourism and economic activity. It will give the freedom to Aer Lingus and other carriers to inaugurate new services potentially to any city in the US over time.</P>
        <P>I firmly believe that the liberalisation of aviation markets across the globe generally would <Col N="390" />also have significant benefits to Ireland. My Department has recently commenced informal discussions with the Canadian authorities with a view to renegotiating a bilateral agreement with Canada on a more liberal basis.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 467 and 468 together.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 provides for the development of Metro North, Metro West and seven Luas projects over its 10-year timeframe and includes an appropriate budget provision for their implementation. The projects will be funded through a combination of direct Exchequer funding to the <Col N="391" />RPA, Public Private Partnerships, development levies and developer contributions.</P>
        <P>I have continually stated publicly that I am not in a position to release details of the costs for specific Transport 21 projects because the details are commercially sensitive from the point of view of protecting public funds and getting best value for money.  Consideration will be given to the release of information regarding the costings of the proposed Luas projects after the signing of the contracts for the projects.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that Metro North, Metro West and the Lucan Luas line will be procured as public private partnerships (PPP) with the cost of the construction and maintenance borne by the private consortium selected through a tendering process.  The PPP consortium will be paid through annual Exchequer payments over a period of approximately 26 years, which will start after commencement of services. The level of payment will be dependent on the consortium meeting service delivery standards set out in the PPP contract.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Transport I have overall responsibility for policy and funding matters in relation to national <Col N="392" />roads.  Under the Roads Act 1993 the National Roads Authority (NRA) are responsible for the detailed planning, design and implementation of the national roads programme including road scheme cost and value for money related matters.  Major progress continues to be made towards the completion of the five major inter urban (MIU) routes linking Dublin to Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and the Northern Ireland Border by 2010, in line with the targets set for the NRA in Transport 21 and the National Development Plan. </P>
        <P>The overall position at the beginning of 2007, one year into Transport 21, is that, of the 738 km of mainline route involved, approximately 70% has been completed or is under construction.  The remainder is expected to commence construction this year or in 2008. I do not intend to speculate on costs at this stage.</P>

	<P>The Ports Policy Statement, published in January 2005, states that the continued operation of the regional harbours under the outdated provisions of the Harbours Act 1946 is unsustainable on the grounds of good governance.  The Policy Statement reiterated the view that most of the these harbours would best achieve their potential through their transfer to local authority ownership or, where this was not possible, the option of sale of the harbours would be considered.  In harbours where significant commercial traffic exists, consideration would be given to bringing them under the control of a port company.</P>
        <P>With regard to Tralee and Fenit Harbour, my Department believes that the best way forward may be some form of amalgamation with Shannon Foynes Port Company.  In that regard, Shannon Foynes Port Company has been asked by my Department to carry out a due diligence process in cooperation with Tralee and Fenit Harbour Commissioners in order to progress the matter.  The precise details of an amalgamation would have to be worked out in conjunction with the various parties in due course and would not be finalised without first consulting further with local interests.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 483, 484, 486 and 492 together.</P>
        <P>The capacity and frequency of services on both the Kildare and Maynooth lines has been substantially increased in recent years.  Capacity on the Maynooth line has trebled in the last 5 years and increased by 160% on the Kildare line since <Col N="395" />2000.  Capacity will be further enhanced with the completion of the Kildare line upgrade in 2010 and the electrification of the Maynooth line in 2010.  Capacity has also been increased elsewhere throughout the railway system with the introduction of additional services on foot of infrastructure and rolling stock upgrade programmes.  This is reflected in the sustained growth in passenger numbers carried by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann from 32.7m in 1999 to 43m in 2006.  Capacity will be further enhanced with the introduction of 183 new railcars over the period 2007/2009 and the completion of major infrastructure upgrades such as the Cork/Midleton and Navan rail lines, the Railway Safety Programme and the Interconnector/electrification project in the Dublin area.  In the meantime Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will continue to optimise the operation of the current services.</P>
        <P>The day to day operation of train services is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann under the supervision of the Railway Safety Commission in so far as railway safety is concerned.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 488 and 489 together.</P>
        <P>A number of reports (the Brattle Report for the European Commission, the Report of the Tourism Policy Review Group to the Minister of Arts, Sport and Tourism, and the Air Transport Users Council (ATUC) of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland Report into Open Skies) all supported moving to open skies with the US, and emphasised the significant benefits to Ireland when this happens.</P>
        <P>The proposed Air Transport Agreement between the European Community and its Member States on the one hand and the Unites States on the other is now to be signed at the EU US Summit on 30 April.  While it will not enter into effect until 30 March, 2008, the transitional arrangements relating to Ireland are already being applied.</P>
        <P>From the perspective of air carriers the most immediate benefit is that Irish and other European carriers are permitted to launch services on three new US routes. Aer Lingus has moved quickly to avail of the new opportunities and has already announced that it proposes to commence new services to San Francisco, Orlando and Washington Dulles later this year.</P>
        <P>From 30 March, 2008 it will be possible for Irish and European carriers to provide services between Ireland and any U.S. airport.</P>
        <P>The benefits for Ireland will be very significant in terms of increased tourism and economic activity.  The opportunity for increased tourism is obvious.  The Irish Hotels Federation has estimated that the Open Skies deal could double the number of US visitors to 2 million within seven years, generating an extra &euro;1 billion for the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>From a business perspective new direct connections will open access to new markets and business linkages.  This will provide a further impetus to the close economic relations that already exist between Ireland and the US.</P>

	<P>The provision of socially-monitored alarms to older people is managed by local community and voluntary groups, with the support of my Department under the Scheme of Community Support for Older People.</P>
        <P>My Department provides a grant to community groups of up to &euro;300 per individual per alarm in respect of the costs for the once-off installation of such alarms. I understand that this amount usually covers the full cost, or most of the cost, of the installation charge. Thereafter, ongoing monitoring costs are charged by the private commercial suppliers engaged by the community groups to monitor the alarms. I understand these costs are of the order of &euro;60 to &euro;80 per annum per individual.</P>
        <P>My Department has no involvement in these ongoing monitoring costs. Given that the Scheme of Community Support for Older People has benefited as many as 100,000 older people, the cost of providing funding for such monitoring costs would be very considerable. It is my view that the available resources are better spent on continuing <Col N="399" />to improve the security of older people in their homes rather than paying for ongoing running costs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 499 and 505 together.</P>
        <P>In the first instance, I wish to refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 264 on 22 Feabhra 2000 and to previous Questions on this matter, which point out that this is a day-to-day operational matter for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, however, I have made further enquiries with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and I understand that the fishery referred to by the Deputy was bought by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s in 1992 for the benefit of the local Gaeltacht area.  Subsequently, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s granted a 35 year licence, with effect from 1 April 1993, to Comhlucht Iascaireachta Shliabh a&rsquo; Liag Teo (CISLT), a company which was formed by a local anglers&rsquo; society to manage the fishery.  I am also informed that there was a disagreement between CISLT and a number of local fishermen from the outset and that extensive efforts to reach an agreement over the years, including the appointment of a mediator, were unsuccessful.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Northern Regional Fisheries Board is charged with ensuring the observance of the Fishery Acts, Bye-Laws and Orders in the region. The fishery is also governed by the licence granted by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to CISLT and by fishing licences issued to individuals by CISLT.</P>

	<P>I am not aware of any compensation package offered to the farmers in the Keem and Dooagh walkways area in Co Mayo.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note, however, that there have been meetings with the farming organisations to discuss ways of moving forward with the implementation of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy developed by Comhairle na Tuaithe.  The Strategy defines the scope and vision for countryside recreation and sets out the broad principles under which sustainable countryside recreation can be managed into the future.</P>
        <P>What the IFA has sought is a payment for the maintenance of specific walks throughout the country and I am fully in agreement that there should be no cost burden on farmers from the maintenance of permissive ways open to the public at no charge.</P>
        <P>I have time and again made clear my view that a local community-based approach is the best way forward where issues of access to the countryside arise.  Where it is not possible to reach agreement, in a particular location, alternative routes should be explored and developed so that landowners&rsquo; rights over access to their lands are not interfered with.  I have met with the President of the IFA to progress the issue, most recently in early March.</P>

As indicated in response to various previous enquiries about this case, as a result of the investigation conducted, the records of the animals from the herd number of the person named, submitted under the 2001 and 2003 Special Beef Premium Schemes, the 2001 Suckler Cow Premium Scheme, the 2002 Slaughter Premium Scheme and the Extensification Premium Schemes for 2001 and 2003, required to be examined with a view to identifying what animals, if any, might be eligible for payment.  Eligibility under these Schemes required, inter alia, that the animals concerned comply with the relevant identification and registration requirements.  This examination has now been completed and the person named is being written to formally, outlining the results of these enquiries.  The person named will be entitled to appeal this decision, should he be dissatisfied with the outcome.</P>

	<P>The total amount of statutory levies paid by Irish farmers in 2006 was &euro;15.8m.</P>
        <P>The Bovine Disease (Levies) Act, 1979 provides for disease levies to be applied to milk delivered for processing and on bovine animals slaughtered or exported live. The levies were introduced under the 1979 Act to require the farming community to make a financial contribution towards the cost of compensation paid <Col N="408" />under the TB/Brucellosis Eradication Schemes. In view of the improvement in the incidence of both diseases in recent years the levies have been reduced by 25% in 2004, 33% in 2005 and a further 50% in 2007. The current rate of levy is  &euro;1.27 per animal slaughtered/exported live and 0.06 cent per litre of milk for processing.</P>
        <P>Section 37 of the An Bord Bia Act 1994 provides for a levy on all cattle, sheep and pigs slaughtered within the State or exported live from the State. The rates of the statutory levies are &euro;1.90, &euro;0.25 and &euro;0.25 on bovines, sheep and pigs respectively</P>

	<P>Single Payment entitlements were allocated to the person named. </P>
        <P>Entitlements were generally established for farmers who were farming during the three reference years 2000-2002 and in receipt of direct payments under one or more of the livestock and/or arable aid schemes. These Single Payment entitlements are based on the premia and/or arable aid payments made to a person during the reference years. In cases where lands were leased during the reference period, the Single Payment entitlements are payable to the person who was farming the land in the reference period.</P>
        <P>The person named submitted an application under the Force Majeure/Exceptional Circumstances measure of the Single Payment Scheme on 15 November 2004.  Having assessed the application, my Department informed her that the application was successful and that the reference year 2002 would be omitted from the calculation of Single Payment entitlements. This is the most beneficial position for the person named as the omission of other reference years or the use of the alternate reference period 1997-99 would have resulted in a decreased payment.</P>

        <Quest> the hectareage of reforestation that has taken place inside areas designated as acid sensitive since the introduction of the acidification protocol which was drawn up by COFORD, the National Council for Forest Research and Development, and the Environmental Protection Agency to prevent planting in these areas; and if she will provide an assurance that the protocol&rsquo;s safeguards are being applied to reforestation as well as initial afforestation to ensure that the mistakes of the past are not being repeated. </Quest>

	<P>The Acidification Protocol, which was drawn up by COFORD and the Environmental Protection Agency, applies to initial afforestation only, i.e. the planting of trees on land not previously used for the establishment of a forest.  The Protocol does not cover &lsquo;reforestation&rsquo;, which involves the replanting of forest-lands after felling of any trees.  The information sought by the Deputy is, therefore, not currently held by my Department in the format required. </P>

	<P>In the event of a compulsory slaughter of poultry, associated with a suspect or <?oasys _ch ?>confirmed outbreak of avian influenza, the Department has identified a preferred method of slaughter and subsequent disposal of carcasses.</P><?oasys _ic0- ?>
        <P>The method chosen for disposal of carcasses and other infective material will be in accordance with the requirements for Category 2 animal by-product laid down in Council Regulation 2002/1774/EC ie to a Category 1 (there are currently no Category 2 plants in Ireland) rendering plant followed by incineration.  There are four category 1 plants in Ireland.  The processing temperatures required for approval of category 1 plants are greatly in excess of temperatures required to inactivate AI virus, and therefore eliminate any risk to human or avian health.  The distances over which the carcasses will be transported will be determined by the location of the outbreak and the proximity of the nearest rendering plant.  Detailed guidelines are in place for the safe transport of carcasses from infected farms to rendering plants.</P>
        <P>My Department is satisfied that there is adequate rendering capacity to deal with an outbreak of avian flu in commercial poultry and arrangements have been made with the rendering <Col N="417" />plants to ensure that all appropriate public health measures are taken to protect staff in such plants who may come in contact with any untreated infected material.</P>
        <P>There will be no requirement to export carcasses for disposal, whether by incineration or otherwise.  The final product of the rendering process &mdash; meat and bonemeal and tallow &mdash; will be exported for incineration, as is the existing practice in view of the lack of incineration facilities in Ireland.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Section 14(1) of the Education Act 1998 states &ldquo;It shall be the duty of a patron, for the purposes of ensuring that a recognised school is managed in a spirit of partnership, to appoint where practicable a board of management the composition of which is agreed between patrons of schools, national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations, recognised trade unions and staff associations representing teachers and the Minister.&rdquo;  Section 16 provides that, subject to the consent of the Minister, the patron may, if satisfied that the functions of a board are not being effectively discharged, dissolve a Board of Management following the issue in writing of notice of the proposed dissolution to board members and consideration of representations, if any received from those same members within a one month period following the date of such notice.  In the specific case referred to by the Deputy, I have been advised that the Patron gave the board of management members an opportunity to present their case both orally and in writing following notification by the Patron of the proposed dissolution.  I understand that the Patron gave due consideration to the representations made by all board members in accordance with the requirements set out in the Education Act.  The Patron, having considered the representations, remained of the view that the board should be dissolved.  I wish to assure the Deputy that I gave careful consideration to the application from the Patron for my approval to dissolve the board before acceding to the request.  I am satisfied that the dissolution has been carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Act.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I approved the appointment of joint managers to manage the school.  The procedures for the selection of candidates for teaching posts are agreed by the Education Partners and the Department and are set out in Appendix D of the handbook <Col N="418" />for boards of management &ldquo;Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure&rdquo;.  This handbook issued from my Department to all boards of management at the beginning of the term of office of current boards.  Section 5(viii) of the Appendix advises that &ldquo;having interviewed such applicants as present themselves, the Selection Board shall submit a written report to the Board of Management, nominating the applicant whom it considers most suitable for appointment&rdquo;.  Section 5(x) clearly states &ldquo;The Board of Management shall appoint the teacher so nominated unless it has good and sufficient reason not to do so, in which instance the matter shall be referred to the Patron, whose decision in this matter shall be accepted by the Board&rdquo;.  The methods employed during the marking process for selected candidates is entirely a matter for the Selection Board and the Board of Management of the individual school concerned.  Section 5(xi) of Appendix D of the handbook states &ldquo;The Chairperson shall seek the approval of the Patron for the appointment&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>With regard to the composition of the independent committee appointed in this instance, this is entirely a matter for the Patron.  However, I have no reason to believe, that the committee did not act in a proper fashion.  The correspondence referred to by the Deputy was referred to my Department by the Office of An Taoiseach and a reply setting out the position has been issued to the correspondent in question.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that, in recent years, the enhancement of the safety of school transport operations has been a priority and substantial funding has been provided for that purpose.  As a consequence, the &ldquo;3 for 2&rdquo; seating arrangement has been phased out and all children travelling on buses in the school transport scheme now have a seat of their own.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has acquired additional vehicles and hired in extra private vehicles to offset the consequential capacity shortfall.  The enhancement of safety both on and in the vicinity of school buses will continue to be afforded high priority.  The allocation for school transport in 2007 is &euro;165 million, an increase of 62% on the 2003 financial outturn.  Any move as suggested by the Deputy to reduce the qualifying distance for establishing eligibility for transport will further increase operating costs.  At present, over 134,000 children are carried each day to primary and post-primary schools, including in the region of 8,000 children with special educational needs. Children with special educational needs may be eligible for transport from home to school, depending on the nature of their disability.  While I have no immediate plans to reduce the qualifying distance of 3.2 kilometres for the purpose of establishing a pupil&rsquo;s eligibility for school transport at primary level, I will keep the matter under review.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.  The prioritisation of urgent cases for assessment is a matter for the school principal in the first instance.  Currently the NEPS service is provided nationally to some 47% of Primary schools (representing 58% of pupils) and 77% of post-primary schools (and 77% of students) nationally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In respect of Co. Clare the position is that some 45% of primary schools (representing 59% of pupils) and 94% of Post-Primary schools (representing 95% of students) have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them.  In addition NEPS provides assistance to all schools and school communities that experience critical incidents, regardless of whether or not they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them.  Also, in relation to all schools, NEPS processes applications for Reasonable Accommodation in Certificate Examinations and responds to queries in relation to individual children from other sections of my Department and from the specialist agencies.  Since the establishment of the NEPS in 1999, the number of NEPS psychologists has increased from 43 to 127 at present.  I have recently been pleased to announce an increase of 31 posts in 2007 in NEPS psychologist staffing.  My Department is currently in discussions with the Public <Col N="422" />Appointments Service in an effort to recruit these individuals as soon as possible in this regard.  It is envisaged that these appointments will allow for further expansion of coverage by NEPS psychologists across all regions.  Additionally under the Towards 2016 Agreement commitments I have further announced that NEPS psychologist numbers shall expand by a further 35 posts in the following two years.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy has pointed out, my Department is currently involved in negotiations with Froebel regarding the provision of a post-graduate Diploma in Special Educational Needs.  These discussions commenced in summer 2006. A proposal outlining areas that need to be addressed was received on 19/1/07 and is currently under consideration.  A circular issued by my Department to all schools in February of this year provides details of the Combined Post-Graduate Diploma Programme of Continuous Professional Development for Teachers involved in meeting the needs of pupils requiring learning support teaching and pupils with special edu<Col N="423" />cational needs.  This course is recognised by my Department and details of the Colleges and Institutions providing it are listed in this circular which is issued annually to all Primary and Second-Level schools.  The course currently run by Froebel is a Diploma course for Resource Teachers.  It is, first and foremost the responsibility of Froebel College to make students aware, on entry to this course, that it does not have recognition from my Department as being equivalent to the Combined Course which I have referred to above.  Should my Department consider that a revised Post-Graduate Diploma  provided by Froebel warrants recognition, then those students who graduated from the Diploma for Resource Teachers may be required to undertake further studies to bring them up to level of the Combined Post-Graduate Diploma.  The requirements for such an upgrade are being discussed as part of the ongoing negotiations.</P>

The main drivers of vacancies in schools are retirements and the creation of new posts.  The expenditure in 2006 on the Colleges of Education is set out below.

Provision of accommodation to cater for these additional teachers would cost in the order of &euro;500m.  This does not include provision for the additional costs which would arise if teacher numbers increased in terms of services and training for the additional teachers in the system.  This would include the cost of additional inspectors required to carry out inspections (including probation), provision of additional in-service training and the additional administrative costs for the Department of Education and Science associated with processing payment of salary, pension etc for extra teachers.  Neither does it include the additional costs on the <Col N="425" />capital side in terms of ongoing maintenance of any additional classroom accommodation provided.  The salary cost given does not include provision for the necessary pension costs which would increase the salary cost by approximately 25%-30% per annum.

	<P Just="Left">All universities have established structures in place to ensure the discharge of their statutory obligations relating to the promotion of Irish. These generally comprise Irish committees which are set-up as sub-committees of the governing body or which report directly to the university President. Universities are autonomous institutions and I have no function in relation to their day to day operational affairs. Decisions on programme provision are made by the universities themselves. The provision of Irish studies in the university sector remains extensive. This includes a broad range of Irish language studies in UCD and a range of Irish studies qualifications in Trinity College, including an undergraduate honours degree in Early and Modern Irish. Other examples include programmes provided through the Department of Early and Medieval Irish in UCC and the very extensive range of Irish studies provided in NUI Galway.</P>
        <P>Funding, amounting to &euro;1.17 million in 2006, is provided to the universities, colleges of education and NCAD under the Irish Strategic Initiative, managed by the Higher Education Authority. The fund aims to support the teaching of subjects, other than Irish, through the medium of Irish and the development of the use of Irish by both students and staff on the university campus. This fund is distinct from the core funding provided to Universities at undergraduate and postgraduate level. Institutions are required to report to the Authority annually on the activities supported under the Initiative.</P>

	<P>My Department, through the Teacher Education Section, is fully committed to providing continuous professional development at primary and post primary level through in-service.  At primary level, the Primary Curriculum Support Programme (PCSP) provides ongoing in-service and support to teachers in schools covering the revised Primary Curriculum, which was introduced in 1999. In the academic year 2006/07, the Primary Curriculum Support Programme have organised 2 seminar days for Drama and 1 seminar day for Social, Environmental, Scientific Education (SESE). There will be 1 planning day in each of these curriculum areas as well as 1 day for consolidation of Gaeilge/SPHE. A further day to allow for School Development Planning may also be taken. Therefore, schools may close for 7 days in total with Board of Management approval. In-service at primary level is mandatory for primary teachers. There are also a range of other supports available for primary level such as support through the Regional Curriculum Support Service (RCSS). </P>
        <P>At post-primary level in-service is offered to teachers when there is a curricular change in the syllabus or when there is a high level of demand in a particular area. In-service at post primary level is not mandatory but fully supported by my Department by the provision of substitution for teachers attending in-service. The Second Level Support Service (SLSS) provides continuing support for the three senior cycle programmes (Transition Year, Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme and Leaving Certificate Applied), the senior cycle subjects English, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Home Economics, Mathematics in the Junior and Senior cycle, the Junior Certificate School Programme and Civic, Social and Political Education in the junior cycle. The intensive phase of in-service has been completed in some subjects and support is now available in a maintenance phase. Other support services outside of the SLSS include the Junior Science Support Service, Junior Cycle PE, History Support Service, Geography Support Service, T4 Technology Support Service, and the Social Personal Health Education Support Service. There is also a range of other supports available for post-primary teachers such as the National Behaviour Support Service, Junior Science Support Service and Integrate Ireland Language and Training.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 561 and 635 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The criteria for the award of incremental credit are outlined in Primary Circular 10/01 &ndash; Amendments to the Scheme for the Award of Incremental Credit, which is available from Primary Payments Section of my Department or on my Department&rsquo;s website. The scheme provides that all permanent teachers appointed or re-appointed after 1 September 1998, who have given service as substitute teachers in primary schools within the Republic of Ireland since 1 September 1985 are awarded incremental credit subject to a maximum of 2 years. Only substitute service given after the date of probation may be considered. The forum for dealing with claims for improvements to conditions of service for teachers is the Teachers Conciliation Council. I understand that a claim for improvements in the arrangements for the award of incremental credit is currently before the Council. Pending the outcome of consideration of that claim, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter.  Provision exists for the reckoning for pension purposes of substitute service given as a qualified teacher where that service reaches specific thresholds. This provision applies to substitute service given since 1991. The service may be reckoned following appointment to a permanent teaching post and is subject to the payment of appropriate pension contributions. Revised arrangements for reckoning substitute service for pension purposes, arising from recent pension reforms, are being finalised. These arrangements will apply to substitute service given at any time prior to 1 September 2001 in the case of teachers in service on or after that date.  A circular outlining the detailed arrangements is in course of preparation and it is expected that it will be issued to schools later this year.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy may be aware, the vast majority of support for child care, including preschool education, is not provided by my Department, but is now provided by the Office of the <Col N="429" />Minister for Children under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) 2000-2006 and its successor programme, the National Childcare Investment Programme. Under the EOCP programme, close to &euro;500 million has been expended on child care and places created will be in the region of 41,000 by the time the programme has been exhausted. Investment of &euro;575 million under the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 aims to create an additional 50,000 places. 10,000 of these places will be for preschool children.  My Department&rsquo;s main role in the area of early years education encompasses targeted preschool provision for children from disadvantaged areas, for Traveller children and for those with special needs.</P>
        <P>The Early Start Programme is a one-year preventative intervention scheme offered in selected schools in designated disadvantaged areas in Ireland. The objective of the programme is to tackle educational disadvantage by targeting children who are at risk of not reaching their potential within the school system.  The programme currently provides some 1,680 places in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk. Targeted early childhood education provision is a key element of the School Support Programme (SSP) under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion. The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. While there are no immediate plans to expand the Early Start programme in its current format, it is intended that the interventions in the area of early childhood education provision are subsumed into the DEIS action plan and form part of an integrated package of supports for schools identified through the Educational Research Council as experiencing a concentrated level of disadvantage.  St Patrick&rsquo;s Primary school is one of the Primary Schools identified by the ERC as experiencing a concentrated level of disadvantage and it does mean that the school is included in any additional educational supports which are available under DEIS.</P>

	<P>Primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 2.4 kilometres to travel to a pick-up point.  Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the  main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the School Transport Scheme.</P>
        <P>The family referred to by the Deputy are considered eligible for school transport and may avail of a transport service with a pick up point 2.4 kilometres from their home.

	<P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978/79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. This <Col N="435" />scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. This scheme has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the Ancillary Services grant.</P>
        <P>The standard rate of grant per pupil under the Ancillary Services scheme has been increased substantially in recent years &mdash; from &euro;102 in 2002 to &euro;145.50 from 1st January, 2007. The amount of grant paid to an individual school is determined by the enrolment in the school.</P>
        <P>The Ancillary Services grant scheme is flexible in nature, giving Boards of Management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial services are provided. The grants paid are not directly linked to any objective pay scales.  The level and extent of services provided is a matter for the school authorities who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial services as resources permit. As the secretaries are employees of individual schools, my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.  There are no proposals at present to change this position.</P>

	<P>Enrolment in individual schools is the <Col N="436" />responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools on this issue. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</P>
        <P>Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to my Department. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, my Department may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of. The existence of an appeals procedure serves to ensure that schools abide by their enrolment policies.  Details on appealing decisions on enrolment under section 29 of the Education Act are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>Alternatively, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>

In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with Section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission of a pupil to the school.</P>
        <P>Currently, under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of this Department. Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and where an appeal is upheld the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.  Otherwise, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.</P>
        <P>The Department recently conducted a survey of all primary schools in Dublin 15 to determine the number of Junior Infants who have enrolled for September 2007.  This survey indicates that there is a considerable number of children enrolled in more than one school.  This has the result of inflating the number of children apparently seeking places.  While undoubtedly there are pressure points in the Dublin 15 area, due to the unprecedented growth in housing and population, the Department is constantly liaising with school principals in the area and I am confident that because of the extent of the on-going interventions being made by the Department, all eli<Col N="438" />gible pupils seeking places for 2007 will have access to them.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 590 and 591 together.  </P>
        <P>For about 80 years prior to 1922, the administration of the primary education system was governed by a set of Rules, the Rules for National Schools made by the Commissioners.  The Commissioners of National Education in Ireland, a body corporate created by Royal Charter in<?oasys _jy ?>1845.</P>
        <P>Section 1 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 assigned the administration of the Commissioners for National Education in Ireland in the Department of Education.  By order of the Executive Council dated 16th August, 1923 (pursuant to its power under section 7 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act 1922) all the jurisdictions, powers and duties of the Commissioners of National Education in Ireland were transferred to a new board called the National Education Commissioners.  That new board, in turn, was dissolved by order of the Executive Council dated 2nd August, 1935, whereupon all the jurisdictions, powers, duties and functions formerly exercised by it were expressly transferred to the Minister for Education.</P>
        <P>A revised code of &ldquo;Rules and Regulations for National Schools under the Department of Education&rdquo; was issued in 1932. The position, accordingly, when the Constitution of Ireland came into force in December, 1937 was that primary education was directly regulated by the Minister by the revised regulatory code introduced in 1932.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of 1965 new rules entitled &ldquo;Rules for National Schools under the Department of Education&rdquo; were introduced by the Minister for Education with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance. This version of the Rules for National Schools has subsequently been <Col N="443" />updated, amended and supplemented by circular letters. The Rules for National Schools, together with Department Circulars constitute administrative measures governing the recognition operation, management and conduct of national schools.  While the Rules for National Schools and associated circulars are non-statutory they are lawful measures which have been judicially considered and accorded the imprimatur of the Irish Courts on a number of occasions.</P>
        <P>The Education Act 1998 provides the Minister with the power to make regulations relating to a range of issues concerning the provision of education by schools. Rather than engage in an exercise to revise the existing rules I favour the incremental use of those regulatory powers where appropriate to replace existing rules and circulars.</P>
        <P>The procedures for the operation of Boards of Management are agreed by the Education Partners and the Department and are set out in the handbook &ldquo;Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure&rdquo;. This handbook issued from my Department to all boards of management at the beginning of the term of office of current boards. In addition, the Catholic Primary School Management Association, which represents the management authorities of the vast majority of primary schools, has produced a handbook for the information and advice of management board members which sets out the responsibilities of boards and gives details of relevant circulars.</P>

	<P>The Transport Liaison Officer (TLO) for County Kilkenny informed my Department that the pupils referred to in the details supplied by the Deputy reside in the Goresbridge/Borris catchment area.  Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s Post Primary School Transport Scheme, a pupil is eligible for school transport if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres or more from the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which s/he resides.</P>
        <P>The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area is which they reside.  However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area &ndash; otherwise known as catchment boundary transport.  These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their own post-primary centre have been catered for.  Such children will have to make their own way either to the catchment boundary or to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.</P>
        <P>The parents of the pupils referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied should liaise with the TLO for County Kilkenny regarding eligibility for school transport to the post-primary centre mentioned in the details.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</P>
        <P>Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2005 was 134 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0023/2006), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006/07 <Col N="445" />school year is a Principal and 4 mainstream class teachers.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 138 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which will be issued to all primary schools shortly, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 4 mainstream class teachers.</P>
        <P>Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Hard copies of this circular will issue to primary schools as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that the first meeting of the Appeal Board will be held in May, 2007. Further meetings will be held in July and October, 2007. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 11 May, 22 June and 12 October respectively.  Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent Appeal Board.</P>

	<P>Significant improvements in the levels of direct funding to second level schools have <Col N="446" />been made in recent years. The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principle determinant of funding. There are however significant differences in the approaches to insurance cover. In my view it is important to consider these issues in the wider context of the equalisation of funding arrangements across the second level system.</P>
        <P>My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.  There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2007, the standard per capita grant was increased by &euro;18 per pupil and now amounts to &euro;316 per pupil.  In addition, Voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of &euro;30 per pupil in 2007 in the support services grant bringing that overall grant to &euro;189 per pupil.</P>
        <P>The cumulative increase of &euro;48 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to over &euro;500 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.  For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over &euro;290,000.  Budget allocations for schools in the VEC and C&amp;C sectors are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant.</P>
        <P>With regard to special needs resource allocation, my Department provides a range of supports to second level schools. The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, there has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>At second level, approximately 1,878 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 534 whole time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,441 whole time equivalent special needs assistants (SNA&rsquo;s) in our second level schools.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that with effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory <Col N="447" />body on the 1st October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The Council acts under the broad policy direction of the Department of Education and Science but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/ special needs.</P>
        <P>The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities/ special needs.  The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Deciding on applications for special needs assistant (SNA) hours;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Students attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>
        <P>The NCSE, through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.  I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require.</P>
        <P>With regard to pupil teacher ratios, the Deputy will be aware that significant improvements have been made in the staffing of our second level schools in recent years. In the 2001/2002 school year, there were approximately 24,477 wholetime equivalent teaching posts allocated to second level schools. For 2006/2007, the corresponding figure is 25,484 wholetime equivalent posts.  This increase in staffing has dramatically improved the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years. The pupil teacher ratio has fallen from <Col N="448" />13.9:1 in the 2001/2002 school year to 13.2:1 in the 2005/2006 school year.  And with regard to non- national students, I can assure the Deputy that it is a major priority for this Government to ensure that all children get the support that they need to do well at school. In order to ensure that children with low levels of competence in the English language can succeed at school, my Department gives additional support to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional temporary teacher posts or portions of teacher posts. Guidelines have also been produced for teachers on teaching English as an additional language and these guidelines are available on the NCCA website.</P>
        <P>The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of non-English speaking students enrolled. Each school management can decide on the structure of the support to be provided in its own school.  Between extra language support posts and grant aid, the level of support provided to schools to meet the needs of children whose first language is not English has increased dramatically in recent years. Nonetheless I am very conscious of the pressures on schools that have large numbers of non-English speaking children enrolled. I am determined to provide greater support for these schools.  To that end, provision has been made for an extra 200 language support teachers in 2007. A further 350 posts will be provided under the Towards 2016 partnership agreement between 2008 and 2009.</P>
        <P>All of the above is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools. I can assure the Deputy that resources will continue to be targeted at those areas where they are most needed.</P>

	<P>In determining the pupil teacher ratio at primary level, all teachers in primary schools are counted. In determining the average class size in primary schools, class teachers are counted. Ancillary staff are not included in either of these calculations.</P>
        <P>Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The details for the current school year (2006/2007) are currently being compiled by my <Col N="450" />Department and the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available.</P>
        <P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.</P>
        <P>There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
        <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
        <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy knows all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared with 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

        <P>The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</P>
        <P>The provision of rented accommodation provides an immediate solution to a deficit of school accommodation, and is often the only available option where extra accommodation is needed at short notice.  However, the current focus within the Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible by way of permanent accommodation. In order to reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level a new devolved initiative was launched in 2003. In this regard, I recently announced an allocation of over &euro;87m  for building projects to over 250 schools to allow these schools to deliver additional capacity in both mainstream and special education rooms.</P>

	<P>Under the Back to Education Initiative (part- time) a programme may be offered for as little as one hour per week or as much as 17 hours per week, depending on the needs and demands of the prospective learners.  It is recommended that programme duration for individual learners (class contact hours) not exceed 400 hours per annum i.e. 400 hours over a twelve month period.</P>
        <P>BTEI (Part-time) provision is offered by Co. Limerick VEC at Rathkeale Community Centre.  In 2006, Co.

	<P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  The SCPA was established, pending the expansion to all schools of the service provided by NEPS psychologists, specifically to undertake assessments with individual children and young people.  Schools are allowed annual access the scheme at a level commensurate with 2% of school enrolment.  A panel of private psychologists was established and has been refreshed annually and currently has 149 psychologists listed.  A number of applicants for inclusion on the panel is currently being considered within NEPS.</P>
        <P>Since its establishment over 20,000 assessments have been commissioned under the scheme at a cost of some &euro;6.8m.  In 2006 some 4,250 assessments were provided in this regard and to date in 2007 almost 800 assessments have been billed to NEPS, which is up to par with the same period last year.  NEPS has reviewed the operation of the scheme and schools generally have expressed a high level of satisfaction with it.  I can confirm to the Deputy that the fee paid for this service, &euro;330 per assessment has remained static since 2001 and that the level and pace of assessment has remained consistent in this time.  More recently however questions have been raised by some practitioners from the panel in relation to its level and my Department&rsquo;s NEPS service is currently examining the matter.</P>

        <P>The resource will be under the aegis of An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta (COGG), the body responsible for planning and co-ordinating the provision of textbooks and aids for learning and teaching through Irish.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will meet the cost of providing the required accommodation in Col&aacute;iste &Iacute;osag&aacute;in for the new COGG resource, in line with a specification to be provided by the Department of Education and Science.  COGG will receive an additional &euro;1 million over the next three years and four additional staff will be assigned by COGG to the Baile Bh&uacute;irne resource in Col&aacute;iste &Iacute;osag&aacute;in.</P>
        <P>The main priority of the new resource will be the coordinating and commissioning of Irish language editions of existing Leaving Certificate texts and designing new teaching and learning aids for the full range of leaving certificate subjects.</P>
        <P>Other functions under the remit of COGG to be carried out at Baile Bh&uacute;irne include, assisting with the planning and delivery of specialised teacher in-service and curriculum support relating to Irish as a first language, commissioning, analysing and disseminating research on the teaching and learning of Irish at all levels of the education system, contributing in cooperation with third level providers to the development of pre-service training opportunities for student teachers on developing their Irish language proficiency; and assisting national/regional support teams with the design of general in-service programmes for teachers in Irish.</P><Col N="459" />
        <P>It is intended that COGG and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, in addition to discharging their respective remits, will, where appropriate, collaborate with various Irish language groups and support services and this process will be supported by Foras na Gaeilge.</P>

	<P>This project referred to by the Deputy was listed on the 2005 School Building Programme to go to tender and construction for a new 10 classroom school building, when the architectural planning was completed.</P>
        <P>As this is a special school the brief for the project has evolved over time with input from the school, my Department&rsquo;s Technical staff and Inspectorate.  My Department is anxious that the facilities to be provided will be of a very high standard and suitable for use by pupils with special needs.</P>
        <P>In June 2006 a meeting was held between the Board of Management, the project&rsquo;s Design Team and officials from my Department.  The purpose of the meeting was to agree the brief for the project.  It was also decided at that meeting that once the Board and the Design Team have <Col N="460" />indicated that the stage 3 documentation was ready for examination a round table meeting will be held, the main aim of which will be to try and approve the submission.  In December 2006 the Design Team forwarded some revised drawings to my Department for review.  A reply issued to the Design team on the 18th December 2006 instructing them to proceed on the basis of their submission and incorporating the comments of my Department&rsquo;s Technical Staff.  My Department is currently awaiting a revised stage 3 submission.  When this is received a meeting will be arranged with a view to getting the submission cleared.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department&rsquo;s main role is concentrated on ensuring that the design solution presented at stage 3 meets the requirements of the brief and complies with my Department's technical documents.  Once the formal stage 3 submission is received, it will be appraised to ensure it meets these criteria and thereafter devolved approval will be given to the school authorities to deliver the project to planning permission, tender and construction.</P>

	<P>In the 2001/2002 school year, there were approximately 24,477 wholetime equivalent teaching posts allocated to second level schools.  This figure is broken down as follows: 13,571 to voluntary secondary, 3739 to community and comprehensive and 7167 to vocational schools.  The corresponding figure for 2006/2007 is 25,484 wholetime equivalent posts and is broken down as follows: 13,414 to voluntary secondary, 4,178 to community and comprehensive and 7,892 to vocational schools.</P>
        <P>As already stated this increase in staffing has dramatically improved the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years.  The pupil teacher ratio has fallen from 13.9:1 in the 2001/2002 school year to 13.2:1 in the 2005/2006 school year.</P>
        <P>The number of permanent teaching posts available in individual schools at any one time is determined in accordance with the agreed criteria relating to the application of the pupil teacher ratio.  It is a matter for the individual school authority, as employer, to determine whether any particular post when vacated may be filled on a permanent basis.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 623 to 625, inclusive, and 627 together.</P>
        <P>Section 14(1) of the Education Act 1998 states &ldquo;It shall be the duty of a patron, for the purposes of ensuring that a recognised school is managed in a spirit of partnership, to appoint where practicable a board of management the composition of which is agreed between patrons of schools, national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations, recognised trade unions and staff associations representing teachers and the Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 16 provides that, subject to the consent of the Minister, the patron may, if satisfied that the functions of a board are not being effectively discharged, dissolve a Board of Management following the issue in writing of notice of the proposed dissolution to board members and consideration of representations, if any received from those same members within a one month period following the date of such notice.</P>
        <P>In the specific case referred to by the Deputy, I have been advised that the Patron gave the board of management members an opportunity to present their case both orally and in writing following notification by the Patron of the proposed dissolution.  I understand that the Patron gave due consideration to the representations made by all board members in accordance with the requirements set out in the Education Act.  The Patron, having considered the representations, remained of the view that the board should be dissolved.</P>
        <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I gave careful consideration to the application from the Patron for my approval to dissolve the board before acceding to the request.  I am satisfied that the dissolution has been carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Act.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I approved the appointment of joint managers to manage the school.  The procedures for the selection of candidates for teaching posts are agreed by the Education Partners and the Department and are set out in Appendix D of the handbook for boards of management &ldquo;Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure&rdquo;.  This handbook issued from my Department to all boards of management at the beginning of the term of office of current boards.</P>
        <P>Section 5(viii) of the Appendix advises that &ldquo;having interviewed such applicants as present themselves, the Selection Board shall submit a <Col N="465" />written report to the Board of Management, nominating the applicant whom it considers most suitable for appointment&rdquo;.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>Section 5(x) clearly states &ldquo;The Board of Management shall appoint the teacher so nominated unless it has good and sufficient reason not to do so, in which instance the matter shall be referred to the Patron, whose decision in this matter shall be accepted by the Board&rdquo;.  The methods employed during the marking process for selected candidates is entirely a matter for the Selection Board and the Board of Management of the individual school concerned.  Section 5(xi) of Appendix D of the handbook states &ldquo;The Chairperson shall seek the approval of the Patron for the appointment&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>With regard to the composition of the independent committee appointed in this instance, this is entirely a matter for the Patron.  However, I have no reason to believe, that the committee did not act in a proper fashion.</P>

	<P>The National Development Plan 2007-2013 introduces an active case management approach that will support those on long term social welfare into education, training and employment. The target is to support 50,000 such people, including lone parents and the long term unemployed, with an overall aim of reducing by 20% the number of those whose total income is derived from long term social welfare payments by 2016. This target will be reviewed in the light of experience.</P>
        <P>Increases in the provision for Further Education have been a significant feature of every budget.  The 2007 Estimates of nearly &euro;169m for further education represents an increase in funding of 12%, over last year.  Hence, there has never been a better opportunity to return to education, be it in a part-time or full-time capacity. Any adult who wishes to return to education and/ or who wishes to further their education has the chance now to participate in the many opportunities and options that are available in the further education sector.  Education and training programmes in the Further Education sector, include part time provision e.g. Adult Literacy, Community Education and the Back to Education Initiative along with full time provision e.g. Youthreach, Senior Traveller Training, Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme and Post Leaving Certificate programmes.</P>
        <P>The NDP 2007-2013 has given as its top priorities in the Working Age Education Programme the need to address the low literacy levels of the Irish adult population and also the large numbers of Irish adults who have not completed upper second level education.  Adult literacy, has been <Col N="467" />the top priority in adult education in my Department for some years now. Great efforts have been made to promote equality of access to education, especially for people whose initial experiences may have been negative.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Report of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs  (EGFSN), &ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s Skills: Towards A National Skills Strategy&rdquo;. A senior official of my Department was a member of the sub-group that was established to prepare the report.  The EGFSN report complements and reinforces policy for upskilling not only those most removed from the labour market but also the workforce in accordance with the recommendations of a number of policy reports including  the White Paper on Adult Education, &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo; (2000), the Report of the Task Force on Lifelong Learning (2002), the OECD Report, &ldquo;Promoting Adult Learning&rdquo; (2005) and more recently Towards 2016 &mdash; Ten Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement 2006-2015, the NDP 2007-2013 and the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016. Policy on further education is based on the premise that raising the basic skills of all individuals can have a larger impact on economic growth than investing in improving the skills of a select group of high-skilled individuals.</P>
        <P>I believe that increased participation in Lifelong Learning through enhanced opportunities to access education and training, the development of new skills, the acquisition of recognised qualifications and progression to higher level qualifications equip all individuals with the skills, capacity and potential to participate fully in the knowledge-based society and progress to better quality jobs. The new contributions of Further Education, which have  been outlined in &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;  and in the National Development Plan 2007-2013, over the next 10 years will:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Prioritise adult literacy in the area of adult education, including workplace literacy. The proportion of the population aged 16-64 with restricted literacy will be reduced to between 10%-15% by 2016, from the level of 25% found in 1997. Vocational Education Committees will provide an additional 7,000 places in literacy by 2009, from the current level of 35,000 participants annually. There will be a particular focus on increasing the number of migrants receiving an English language service;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />provide an additional 1,000 Youthreach places by 2009. &euro;574 m. is being made available for Youthreach over the period 2007-2013;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />provide guidance/counselling to literacy and language learners;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />expand the Back To Education Initiative (BTEI) by 2,000 places by 2009;</P><Col N="468" />
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />maximise the opportunities for older people to participate in education, employment and other aspects of economic and social life;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />continue to invest in the post-leaving certificate sector, where a total of &euro;1 billion will be made available over the period 2007-2013. This will enable participants to acquire specific vocational skills to enhance their prospects of securing employment and support their progression to other studies;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Further Education policy will continue to work towards engaging those persons who are most removed from the labour market. Officials from my Department will continue to be in contact with other Government Departments in the promotion of this policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with other psychological services encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists <Col N="469" />to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</P>
        <P>Children who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the psychologist within that school term. Normally, principals of schools prioritise those children in need of psychological assessment in consultation with the assigned psychologist.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the assigned psychologist has arranged a schedule of assessments with the school in question for the current academic year and I would suggest that if the school in question has particular issues in this regard they should be raised in the first instance with the assigned psychologist and/or Regional Director of the NEPS North-East Region.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced the allocation of 200 extra language support posts to schools, bringing the total number of language support teachers in our schools to 1,450. These new resources are intended for schools with large numbers of pupils who do not have English as a first language. Under the revised arrangements, depending on the number of eligible pupils enrolled, schools now have between one and six language support teachers. In addition, the limit of two years&rsquo; support for an individual pupil no longer applies.</P>
        <P>The additional 200 teachers are part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment in Towards 2016 to provide an extra 550 language support teachers by 2009 and to reform the limit of two teachers per school. It is intended that a further 350 language support teachers will be provided between 2008 and 2009.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure that schools can accurately and objectively assess the language requirement of children, my Department will be sending to primary schools assessment materials which have been developed by Integrate Ireland Language and Training (IILT). The assessment materials will enable schools to ensure that the specific language requirements of children needing support are met in a targeted way. The IILT materials will also enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of the language proficiency of the child and his or her need for continued language support.  The deployment of language resource teachers <Col N="470" />will depend on the specific needs of the pupils and this is left to the discretion of the school authorities</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The SSP will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.  The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s Regional Offices and the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification and review process, 873 schools have been included under the DEIS action plan. These comprise 670 primary schools and 203 second-level schools. The school referred to by the Deputy is among the schools <Col N="471" />identified for inclusion in Band 2 of DEIS.  During the roll out of the DEIS initiative, schools included in Band 2 of the new programme will benefit from the following range of measures:</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />allocation of administrative principals on lower enrolment and staffing figures than apply in primary schools generally;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />additional non-pay/capitation allocation based on level of disadvantage;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />additional funding under school books grant scheme targeted primarily at supporting the establishment, development and ongoing operation of book loan/rental schemes;   access to the School Meals Programme;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />access to a literacy/numeracy support service and to specific literacy/numeracy measures such as Reading Recovery, Maths Recovery and First Steps;</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />access to a range of supports (both academic and non-academic, and including after-school and holiday-time supports) for young people, based on best practice identified through the School Completion Programme;</P>

     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />eligibility for teachers/principals to apply for sabbatical leave scheme.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">The Deputy will be aware that my Department implemented a General Allocation system of learning support/resource teachers to mainstream primary schools in September 2005. The system is intended to cater for children with high-incidence special education needs such as mild general learning disability and those with learning support needs.  My Department issued a comprehensive circular, SP ED 02/05 to schools which provides guidelines on the manner in which they should use the resources that have been allocated to them to best effect.</P>
        <P>Schools considered as most disadvantaged when the model was introduced were those eligible for additional staffing under the urban dimension of the Giving Children an Even Break Scheme. Those schools have a preferential pupil/teacher allocation ratio of 80:1 for their general allocation. That remains the case.  The school referred to here does not qualify for an increase in general allocation under the DEIS programme. However, as stated in my Department&rsquo;s circular 0036/2006, schools may qualify for an increase in general allocation where they have <Col N="472" />been given a developing post. I can confirm that the school in question was awarded a developing post for the current school year.  It does not appear, however, to have submitted a request for its general allocation to be reviewed on this basis.</P>
        <P>It is open to the school to submit details of its enrolment at 30th September 2006, together with a copy of my Department&rsquo;s letter granting developing status, to General Allocations Section in Athlone where the matter will be considered.</P>

In 2006 four officials at my Department attended pre-retirement courses administered by the Centre for Management &amp; Organisation Development (C.M.O.D.). The total amount of travel and subsistence expenses amounted to &euro;626 prior to July 2006. One person has attended the course since the decentralisation of CMOD to Tullamore. No expenses in respect of travel and subsistence have been received to date.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>To date 2 members of staff who transferred into my Department under the CAF scheme have transferred to a second section within my Department within 6 months of the original transfer.  In one case, this happened because a combination of circumstances made it possible to offer the officer a move to their first  preference location under the CAF in advance of the relocation of the section to which they were initially assigned. In the other case, the officer was transferred to a second section within three months of the initial transfer in response to business needs, this second assignment has now been in place for over a year.</P>

	<P>The strength of the Permanent Defence Force on 28 February 2007, the latest date for which detailed figures are available, as advised by the military authorities was 10,370. A detailed breakdown of <Col N="476" />the numbers in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps by rank are in the Tables. The Tables also provide the comparable details for the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 set out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 8,426 for the Army, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 930 for the Air Corps. It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper as required to meet military needs. The Defence Forces continue to have a proactive approach to all aspects of recruiting. The Permanent Defence Force manages recruit intakes to keep its annualised monthly average strength at or around 10,500.</P>
        <P>The strength of the Reserve Defence Force (Second Line) was 8,929 as at 28 February 2007, the last date for which figures are available. This figure comprises 8,566 in the Army Reserve and 363 in the Naval Service Reserve. In addition, there were 375 personnel in the First Line Reserve comprising 155 Officers, 31 Non-Commissioned Officers and 189 Privates.  Since May 2003, the Civil Defence Board has responsibility for the management and development of the Civil Defence organisation at national level. At local level, Civil Defence is administered by each Local/City Authority. At present there are 4,500 trained volunteers in the organisation.</P><Col N="475" />

	<P>My office has informed the person concerned that his inquiry concerning cultural regeneration would appear to be primarily a matter for the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, whose mission is, among other things, to contribute to the cultural progress of Irish society through promoting excellence in artistic achievement, and the preservation of our cultural heritage.  That Department has, I understand, received a copy of the inquiry, and has been in contact with the person concerned.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the poor condition, lack of maintenance and in particular the difficulty in accessing the neolithic portal tomb at Woodtown in south County Dublin; and if he will take steps to ensure its general environs are maintained in a way which facilitates access to interested parties. </Quest>

	<P>The portal tomb monument at Woodtown, which is listed on the statutory Record of Monuments and Places for County Dublin, is in private ownership. There are currently over 120,000 sites listed on the Record of Monuments and Places nationally. The State has direct responsibility for over 700 national <Col N="479" />monuments but the conservation and maintenance of other monuments not in State care remains a matter for their owners subject to the necessary consent and notification requirements for any proposed works to such monuments as required under the National Monuments Acts 1930-2004.</P>
        <P>Arrangements have been made for an archaeologist from my Department to inspect the Woodtown monument to assess its general condition with a view to advising the owner as to its future conservation. Public access to recorded monuments situated on private lands is at the discretion of the individual landowner.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has an excellent record in recovering and recycling packaging waste.  Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on packaging and packaging waste is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market at end-of-life.  Under the Directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005.  Practical implementation of the Directive in Ireland is organised mainly through a collective industry-based compliance scheme operated by Repak Limited which is working successfully.</P>
        <P>The EPA has reported in its National Waste Report 2005 &mdash; published in January 2007 &mdash; that packaging waste recovery increased to 59.6% in that year, indicating that Ireland exceeded its 50% end 2005 target by 10% and has, in effect, reached the new 2011 target.  This compares with a recovery rate of 14.8% in 1998.  In addition, the 2005 Report indicates that Ireland is achieving specific recovery targets for different materials used in packaging.</P>
        <P>Successful deposit and refund schemes operating internationally are generally located in those countries where there has been no break in the continuity and cultural tradition of deposit and refund arrangements.  This is not the case in Ireland and there would now quite likely be significant costs involved in re-establishing deposit <Col N="480" />and refund arrangements here.  Account would also have to be taken of the possible impact on existing compliance arrangements.  Given that these arrangements are rapidly achieving the desired result in relation to meeting the recycling targets, the introduction of deposit and refund schemes is not under consideration.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the above, the Government has adopted a range of measures to prevent and reduce littering.  The Government launched its Litter Action Plan, as the national anti-litter strategy, in February 2001.  The Plan is based on extensive consultation with the public and private sectors, and, in particular, places emphasis on broadly based local partnerships involving local authorities, businesses, commercial interests, residents associations and schools.</P>
        <P>While the primary responsibility for management of and enforcement responses to litter pollution, generally, lies with the local authorities, the Plan recognises that local authorities working alone will not solve our litter problems.  My Department funds and is actively involved in a number of anti-litter initiatives that support local authority efforts and raise awareness of the problem of litter pollution.  These initiatives include National Spring Clean, Tidy Towns, the Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL) League, and annual grants to local authorities for community based awareness measures.</P>
<P>My Department funds the National Litter Pollution Monitoring System, which measures the extent of litter pollution in each local authority area.  The data provided by the surveys further enables each local authority to assess the effectiveness of its litter management and ensure the optimum allocation of its resources to tackle litter.</P>
   
        <P>Data provided by the System shows that nationally, year-on-year since 2003, there is a slight but steady increase in litter-free areas and the number of litter black-spots is declining.  The emerging pattern is of a gradual but steady improvement in the extent of litter pollution countrywide.  This positive data is supported by the findings of the IBAL League, which shows that cleanliness levels are improving generally in the towns participating in the League.</P>

	<P>The improve<Col N="481" />ment of non-national roads in County Cork is a matter for Cork County Council to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State grants provided by my Department.</P>
        <P>The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be considered for funding under my Department&rsquo;s Specific Improvements Grant scheme is a matter for the relevant local authority.  All applications submitted by local authorities for consideration for funding under the <Col N="482" />scheme are then considered in my Department, having regard to compliance with eligibility criteria, the need to prioritise projects, competing demands from other local authorities and the funds available for the scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Contamination of drinking water by cryptosporidium is an ongoing risk in relation to which water authorities in Ireland and other countries must exercise constant precaution and vigilance.  Management of public drinking water supplies is the responsibility of the relevant local authority and information on the specific procedures put in place by Mayo County Council to safeguard against cryptosporidium in their water supplies would be available from the Council.</P>
        <P>In 1998, my Department published detailed guidelines for local authorities on Minimising the Risk of Cryptosporidium in Water Supplies.  These guidelines were prepared in consultation <Col N="486" />with the Department of Health and Children and the Environmental Protection Agency to provide clear advice to local authorities on preventing cryptosporidium getting into water supply systems.  The guidelines cover all aspects of water supply management, including source protection, monitoring, treatment processes, storage and distribution as well as responding to an outbreak.</P>
        <P>In November 2004, the National Disease Surveillance Centre published a report on waterborne cryptosporidiosis.  This was circulated to all local authorities by the EPA with the request that they update their risk assessments based on the revised methodology of the report.  Almost 400 such updated risk assessments were carried out by local authorities in response to this request.</P>
        <P>Explicit requirements in relation to monitoring of drinking water for clostridium perfringens &mdash; an indicator of possible contamination of the water by cryptosporidium &mdash; are now set out in the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2007.  My Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme provides full capital funding for improvements of the water infrastructure of local authorities. Identified deficiencies posing relatively greater risk to human health or the environment would be prioritised in this context.</P>

	<P>The administration of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme is delegated to local authorities within the framework laid down in statutory regulations; as far as is practicable, this is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility at local level.    In the light of substantially increased demand for grant assistance, the majority of local authorities have reviewed their schemes in recent years in order to streamline their operation and have introduced a variety of mechanisms to ensure that the available resources are targeted to those in most need, including medical prioritisation, means testing and/or cost control.  The issue of means testing has been considered in the context of the review of the operation of the Disabled Persons Grant scheme which has been completed within my Department.</P>
        <P>A revised scheme to be known as the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability <Col N="487" />will be introduced later this year and will assist in the provision/adaptation of accommodation to meet the needs of people with a disability.  The revised scheme is designed to ensure that available funding is targeted at lower income households and those whose need is greatest.  Prioritisation of eligibility will be on the basis of medical and financial need with 95% of the approved cost of works available to those with annual household incomes of less than &euro;30,000 tapering to 30% for those with annual incomes of &euro;54,001 to &euro;65,000.</P>
        <P>The revised scheme will come into operation during 2007 and the income bands for the purposes of means testing will be amended annually in line with the amount of wage inflation in the preceding year.  I will be issuing guidance to the local authorities on the operation of the revised scheme in due course.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 660 and 666 together.    Sections 48 and 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 set out the framework within which planning authorities must draw up a development contribution scheme in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf of the local authority that benefit development in the area.  The Act provides for three types of development contribution that can be attached as conditions to planning permissions granted under Section 34 of the 2000 Act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to the above legal framework, my Department has also issued policy guidance on development contributions to planning authorities in the form of circular letter PD 4/2003.  The advice given in the guidance relates to the different types of development contribution that can be attached as a condition to planning permissions granted, the types of public infrastructure and facilities that can be funded by this mechanism, and the level of contribution.    The <Col N="488" />legislation also requires planning authorities to base the contributions on the actual cost of providing the infrastructure in question.  On the issue of actual moneys collected and spent, local authority annual reports must contain details of monies paid or owing to it under section 50 of the Local Government Act 1991 and must indicate how such monies paid to it have been applied.  This includes charges under sections 48 and 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>
        <P>In addition, Annual Financial Statements of local authorities in respect of 2005 and future years are required to include details of opening and closing balances on the development levies account together with the extent of movement in and out of the account during the year.</P>
        <P>My Department has also established an interdepartmental committee to look at issues raised by different interests in relation to the operation of development contribution schemes.  The committee is due to complete its work shortly and it is expected that this will provide the basis for further guidance to be issued to planning authorities.</P>

I understand that the European Commission at their meeting of 21 March decided to refer to the European Court of Justice a case against Ireland that will include issues regarding protection of the Freshwater Pearl Mussel.  However, my Department has yet to receive official notification in that regard.</P>
        <P>The Guidelines to which the Question refers are being prepared by the Forestry Service, Department of Agriculture and Food.  My Department is, however, finalising a species action plan for the protection of the freshwater pearl mussel and this plan will be released for public consultation later this year.</P>
        <P>Since the 1970s, the EPA has operated a system of classification of river quality, based on biological criteria.  Under this classification system, river waters are attributed a Q score and the highest rating that may be attributed to river waters generally is Q5.  As part of work towards implementation of the Water Framework Directive, a new classification system in relation to water quality status is being developed by the EPA.  This water status classification system will cover a broad range of parameters and will apply in relation to waters generally.  Sites requiring special protection, including those inhabited by the Pearl Mussel, may require particularly high water quantity standards and consideration will be given to the appropriate standards that must be applied to such sites.</P>

When the call for proposals is made later this year, the lead local authority for the Midland gateway will be able to submit their formal proposal, on behalf of all authorities in the gateway, at that time for consideration.</P>

	<P>To address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic, designated facilities are being provided on a temporary, once-off basis by local authorities where farmers may deposit stockpiled farm film plastic and silage wrap.  These special arrangements operated on a pilot basis in the first instance in <Col N="492" />counties Clare, Galway, Mayo, Offaly and Waterford during June and July of last year.  The service was provided free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities is being made available from my Department through the Environment Fund.</P>
        <P>The collections were well supported by farmers in the counties participating in the pilot phase, leading to large quantities of plastic being deposited at designated sites.  A significant finding from the pilot scheme was that it is not possible to operate collections in a large number of counties at the same time due to capacity constraints on the part of recovery operators.  Accordingly, it was necessary to roll out the scheme to other areas on a staggered basis.  Arising from a comprehensive examination of the information available, I approved further collections of waste silage / bale wrap by Carlow, Leitrim, Longford, North Tipperary, Roscommon and Wicklow County Councils which concluded in January of this year.  It is estimated that in excess of 15,000 tonnes of plastics were recovered by the eleven local authorities that have operated collections to date.</P>
        <P>Following a review of the outcome of the second round of collections, I have recently announced that collections of waste silage / bale wrap will now be put in place in a further 18 county council areas over the next 6 months.  When the final phase is completed, collections will have taken place in all 29 county council areas.  This arrangement allows for phased collections while at the same time creating certainty in the minds of farmers as to when their backlog will be cleared.  It also allows local authorities and local farming organisations sufficient notice to agree and put in place the necessary arrangements for collections in their areas.</P>
        <P>The collections will now be rolled out as follows:</P><Col N="491" />

        <P FLI="0">Local authorities engaged in providing collections must ensure that the farm plastic collected under these arrangements is recycled.   The choice of facility is a matter for the local authority concerned and I have no function in this matter.  These materials are a sought after resource which is freely traded under EU and international law.  I understand that much of the waste recovered thus far has been recycled in facilities in the UK and the Netherlands.  The export of waste is regulated by local authorities, in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259/93 of 1 February 1993 on the supervision and control of waste within, into and out of, the European Community.</P>

	<P>Section 12 (3) of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994 provides for the protection of monuments and places listed on the statutory Record of Monu<Col N="493" />ments and Places.  Two months notification in writing of any works proposed at or in relation to a listed monument is required to be given to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Contravention of this requirement is an offence under the Act.  The penalties upon summary conviction of such an offence is a maximum fine of &euro;1,269 or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both; the penalty upon conviction on indictment is a maximum fine of &euro;63,486 or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.  Prosecutions are taken in any specific case by the Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of the State.     The monument at Gortnafolla, Co. Mayo, which is in private ownership, is listed as a ringfort in the statutory Records and Monuments and Places for Co. Mayo.  Notification of quarrying works at this location was referred to the Department by Mayo County Council in November 2006.  In 2005 the relevant landowner had commissioned archaeological test excavations at the monument.  The findings of the subsequent report were submitted to the Department in 2006.  The report concluded from the results of the excavations and from cartographic evidence that there was evidence to suggest the monument was not archaeological in nature but was instead a &ldquo;tree-ring&rdquo;, constructed in the nineteenth century within the demesne associated with nearby Turlough Park House.  In the circumstances no further action is envisaged by the Department in this matter.      </P>

	<P>In the first instance, the maintenance and improvement of public roads, including modifications to associated public footpaths, would normally be a matter for the relevant roads authority and not for private householders.</P>
        <P>Under class 6, schedule 2, Part 1 of the 2001 Regulations, the provision of a hard surface within the curtilage of a house is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission, subject to certain conditions.  Specifically, the exemption is for the provision, inter alia, to the front or side of the house of a hard surface for the parking of not more than 2 motor vehicles used for a purpose incidental to the enjoyment of the house.  The exemption is subject to the con<Col N="494" />dition that the level of the ground shall not be altered by more than 1 metre above or below the level of the adjoining ground.</P>
        <P>Works outside the above parameters relating to private roads or footpaths, or to public footpaths in the context of private development, would require planning permission.  Given the potential implications of such works for road safety, neighbouring properties or the appearance of a street, the requirements of the current Regulations, which have been endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, are considered reasonable and appropriate.</P>

	<P>In May 2005, I introduced a new initiative for the provision of skateboard facilities by local authorities.  Each City and County Council was invited to submit expressions of interest for grant assistance towards the provision of a skateboard park in its area.

A sum of &euro;1 million had initially been earmarked for the scheme in 2005 but, in light of the number and quality of submissions received, I approved all 21 projects in November 2005 and increased the funding allocation to over &euro;2 million which is expected to be spent over the two year period 2006 and 2007.  </P>

<P>In 2007, the grant allocation by my Department to Kildare County Council for the improvement and maintenance of non-national roads is &euro;23,685,337.  This is over three and a half times the funding provided when this Government came into office in 1997 and seven and a half times the 1994 State grant provision.  The 2007 allocation also represents an increase of 3% on the 2006 grant payment to the Council.</P>
        <P>When comparing the 2007 allocation to previous years, account must be taken of the special once off payments made to Kildare County Council from 2004 to 2006 to facilitate the staging of the Ryder Cup in 2006.  If these grants are discounted, the 2007 allocation represents a 16% increase on the 2006 grant payment to the Council.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that this significant level of State funding, supplemented by Kildare County Council&rsquo;s own resources, provides appropriately for the Council&rsquo;s ongoing non-national road requirements in 2007.</P>

        <Quest> the number of staff in his Department for whom <Col N="498" />two or more phone lines have been provided at their home; the number of lines provided in each case; the reason for this; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>My Department currently provides two or more phone lines to the homes of twenty-eight members of staff, all of whom operate away from the Department&rsquo;s main offices.  In the case of twenty-two of the staff concerned, two phones lines are required to provide telephone and Internet access as broadband is not available.  The other six staff concerned are provided with three phone lines: these staff regularly access the newly introduced Development Applications Tracking System, which requires high band-width connections that, in the absence of broadband in their specific areas, can only be provided by using two dedicated phone lines, in addition to the line required for telephone connection.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The provision of phone lines to staff members is reviewed regularly in the context of changing working patterns and the availability of improved communications links.</P>

        <Quest> the average amount of travel and subsistence allowances paid by his Department in respect of attendance at pre-retirement planning courses prior to the relocation of the Civil Service Training Centre to Tullamore; the average amount paid in respect of attendance at the same course since the centre was relocated; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 678 and 679 together. </P>
<P Just="Left">The Department has a number of offices outside Dublin.  Training courses are provided to staff as required and may involve travel to Dublin or to other locations.  In the period 2004-2006, a total of &euro;10,809 in travel and subsistence was paid to my Department&rsquo;s training officers.  During that time a total of 9,981.5 training days were organised.     In the three-year period from mid-2003 to mid-2006, the average amount of travel and subsistence paid in respect of attendance at pre-retirement planning courses was &euro;577.  Since July 2006, thirteen employees of the Department have attended training courses in the CMOD in <Col N="499" />Tullamore.  Of these, five attended pre-retirement planning courses.  The average amount of travel and subsistence paid in respect of attendance at pre-retirement planning courses since July 2006 was &euro;482.  The relocation of the CMOD to Tullamore has had no impact on the work of the Department&rsquo;s Training Officer.</P>

        <Quest> the number of staff who have transferred to his Department under the decentralisation CAF or DCAF schemes and who have found that they must make a further move to another section <Col N="500" />within six months of their Departmental transfer; the effect such moves have on staff morale; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No.  562 of 20 February 2007.  To date 124 people have transferred to or joined my Department to decentralise to Wexford, Waterford, New Ross and Kilkenny.  Of this group, three staff members were assigned different work duties within 6 months of joining the Department. Such reassignments are commonplace in an organisation as large and diverse as my Department and would not be expected to have any implications for staff morale.</P>
