      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>The task force on active citizenship has held seven plenary meetings since its appointment.  The last meeting took place on 30 January 2007.  In addition, the task force has set up five subgroups which meet on a regular basis and have consulted with organisations in different sectors.</P>
        <P>The task force has also engaged in a major public consultation exercise.  The written phase of the consultation process ran from July to October and more than 1,000 submissions were received.  As part of this process, the task force hosted regional consultation seminars around the coun<Col N="646"/>try.  I was pleased to attend the first of these on 14 September.</P>
        <P>The aim of these regional seminars was to explain the work of the task force and hear the views and ideas of individuals and groups on active citizenship in Ireland today.  Over 300 people attended the meeting in Dublin.  Subsequent seminars have been held in Monaghan, Sligo, Galway, Cork and Tullamore and all have been well attended.</P>
        <P>The task force&rsquo;s work programme also included specific consultation exercises to get the views of young people and a national survey has been carried out by the ESRI.  The National Forum on Europe organised a plenary session on the subject of active citizenship in mid-October.  The chairperson and members of the task force have also been meeting a range of interested individuals and groups around the country.</P>
        <P>I believe that the efforts of the task force have stimulated a wide-ranging debate on the issue of active citizenship and that this, in itself, is an important outcome.  An independent report on the consultation process covering both the written phase and the work of the sub-groups has now been published and widely circulated.  I understand the task force intends to finalise its report very shortly.  I look forward to receiving its report with its conclusions and recommendations on active citizenship in Ireland, including the many issues raised during the consultation process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for that information.  Will he tell the House if he has any idea what &ldquo;very shortly&rdquo; means in respect of the final report?  At the launch, he said that &ldquo;there is a concern that we have become more materialistic, maybe even more selfish.  And if we have, I believe many people would conclude that, for all our new wealth, we are much the poorer&rdquo;.  I invite the Taoiseach to explain the thinking behind this statement to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the report will be finished by Easter.  The task force has issued a very good document based on its travels throughout the country and, perhaps more importantly, on over 1,000 submissions.  This has now gone into a format on the task force&rsquo;s website and also into wide circulation.  In respect of the final draft, I presume it will depend on the type of feedback it gets.  The task force is working to finish the report by Easter.  </P>
        <P>I said a number of things on the day of the launch.  In respect of the particular comment mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte, I posed a question which is being explored by the task force.  I acknowledged the amount of work that takes place in this country, where probably more people are involved in active citizenship than in most countries, although the numbers have declined according to surveys by the ESRI and others in recent years.  In respect of the points I <Col N="647"/>made on that and many other occasions, I do not think anyone can argue that Ireland has not changed greatly in the past 20 years.</P>
        <P>Part of the reason the task force was established was to review the trends of civic participation and to ascertain whether the perception that many people have become more disengaged from our communities and neighbourhoods is true.  This is the point made by many groups and organisations and if it is true, it is a question of why this exists.  Obviously, there are more people at work, more people commuting and more people with young families who commute long distances.  Is this the reason people have disengaged or are there other reasons?  I was posing a question so that we can look at it and come forward with a report which examines what we can do if people have disengaged and are not connected with their localities or sports, cultural or historical clubs as they might have been in the 1950s when figures were high.  These figures have declined since the 1950s and there has never been a bounce back period in the past 50 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I was particularly interested in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s remark that &ldquo;for all our new wealth, we are much the poorer&rdquo;.  I understand where he is coming from in making that statement.  However, does he accept that the quality of the delivery of many of our public services is the reason people feel they are poorer in this new, more affluent society?  For example, does he agree that if a person is caught driving to and from work for an hour and three quarters or he or she is caught on the M50 toll bridge, he or she will not be particularly minded to train the under nines in the evening?  These bottlenecks and deficiencies in our infrastructure and in the delivery of our public services and so on are leading people to question their quality of life, despite the apparent affluence they see around them.</P>
        <P>Quality of life has suffered and we have not taken time out to think about its impact on people who are under considerable stress commuting long distances to work and who are concerned about the minding of their children and so on.  Are these not issues for Government rather than a task force?  Does the Taoiseach envisage the task force will make specific recommendations that are likely to address these big issues, which are the causes of our society being poorer, notwithstanding our greater material wealth?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are issues for everybody, including the Government.  I do not accept services are poorer.  When active citizenship was at its height, we had very few services.  Class sizes in schools numbered over 50 in most parts of the country whereas now they are under 20.  Parts of the country, mainly in Dublin and other cities, have bottlenecks but there are huge stretches of roads across the country.  Traffic jams used to <Col N="648"/>begin at the Phoenix Park when one was on the road to Galway but now one can be a long way clear of the city in an hour.  That is not the issue.  When active citizenship was at its height, central government put very little money into the community whereas &euro;300 million a year is invested in various community activities now.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy that if a person spends an hour on the M50 coming and going, he or she will not want to do too much with the under nines until the weekend, but I expect the task force to come up with reports and recommendations.  The important thing is to try to analyse the reasons.  The figures are not as good in rural communities also, even though one must acknowledge the many people involved in active citizenship in such communities, but they do not have commuting problems or problems with large class sizes, by and large.  The issue is broader than that.  More people are involved in active citizenship in the &ldquo;poorer&rdquo;, hard pressed areas than in areas where there are no difficulties.</P>
        <P>People are busier.  I was in the airport the other day and staff pointed out to me that the next busiest day of the year after Christmas Eve is next Friday and they were laughing when I did not cop on why.  Then I was told it was the mid-term break and there are more flights out of Dublin Airport than normal, which is good.  In some ways, they are the poor &mdash; I do not want to put a class on them &mdash; but I am glad they are doing that because I would not mind doing it myself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach could not fit that into his schedule.  He would not have time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows what I mean.  An analysis is needed.  However, it is a pity that every organisation must have a full-time person.  It should not be like that.  I recall that in one part of my constituency, when unemployment was high in the 1980s, we surveyed more than 400 unemployed adult males to mentor football teams but we could not get anyone to look after them.  I agree analysis needs to be carried out.  In a richer, more modern society where the pace is without doubt faster, there is a need to examine how we can encourage more people to become involved in active citizenship.  It is not that we do not have many people already involved, but more are required.  If everybody does a bit, it makes it easier.  What tends to happen in the community is that a small number of people take on huge burdens  We are very appreciative of their work.  I accept it is for the Government to help.  I hope the task force recommendations will lead to progress, as was the case with the White Paper on community activity a few years ago which led to the investment of large amounts of money into community activities and development in many areas.  This gave rise to an improvement, although it may not have brought it to a level with which we are totally satisfied.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="649"/>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>When we discussed this matter previously I did not get a clear reply from the Taoiseach to a question on the White Paper on supporting voluntary activity from 2000 and the Tipping the Balance report from 2002.  I accept a great deal of work went into those documents.  On foot of their publication, has the Taoiseach produced a written report on which recommendations represent Government policy and will be implemented?</P>
        <P>I also previously asked the Taoiseach whether he has taken on board the fact that voluntary groups, which essentially depend on voluntary input, would benefit hugely from one person being paid to do administration.  For the sake of a fairly modest investment, this would also help to prevent burnout among the one or two people in an organisation who have these necessary skills.  Has this been taken into account as a factor responsible for killing off volunteerism?  The Taoiseach stated he is putting resources into this area and I am concerned about the targeting of those resources.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is familiar with Mr. Putnam and <i>Bowling Alone</i> from Inchydoney days.  Will he indicate whether the relationship between commuting distance and community involvement has been taken into consideration by Government in any real sense, given the longer commuting distances which reflect the fact that most of Leinster is essentially a bedroom for Dublin city workers, and that there is very little community activity for this reason?  Mr. Putnam pointed out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask a question please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Taoiseach taken this point on board and how will he respond to it?  For every extra 10% in commuting distance, Mr. Putnam posits a 10% reduction in community involvement.  I appreciate the Taoiseach may not have first-hand experience of this issue given the &euro;100,000 plus bill for flying from Baldonnel Airport to Dublin Airport&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sargent should confine himself to these questions.  Other Deputies are offering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but can he relate to it from the interest he previously expressed in this topic?  Is he in a position to state whether commuting distances will reduce with proper planning and thereby result in an improvement in community involvement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In terms of the allocation of grants, I stated account should be taken of those involved in administration in the community and local development programmes.  I have been told it is currently the practice, and will continue to be so, to take account of this factor in the allocation of administrative grants for charitable organis<Col N="650"/>ations and voluntary or community groups.  F&Aacute;S does this fairly well but I accept Deputy Sargent referred to grant schemes.  l asked that this should be the case when allocating administrative grants particularly for groups with a focus on disadvantage involved in volunteering and support and facilitating communities to try to pursue economic and social regeneration.  I asked them to do that.  It is relatively small.</P>
        <P>The White Paper gave rise to many recommendations.  Some &euro;300 million is spent annually supporting communities through a number of programmes, including the dormant accounts programme, tackling economic and social disadvantage, tackling educational disadvantage and assisting those with disabilities.  Some &euro;60 million has been spent in those three categories to fund community organisations directly.  The local development and social inclusion programme, which covers the 69 partnership groups tackling poverty and disadvantage, receives approximately &euro;57 million for advice, training, job-seeking, start-up businesses, assisting the long-term unemployed, children at risk of dropping out of mainstream activities, ethnic communities and non-nationals training.  I have met a number of these groups in the past few years.  Some 500 voluntary community representatives are involved in this area, making inroads into the problems.  They provide a good service.</P>
        <P>The community services programme, formerly the social economy programme, receives over &euro;50 million.  It has been extended and co-ordinated, with more than 400 projects around the country.  All of these 900 groups are in receipt of statutory aid, as are many people working in the projects.  These include community child care services, services for the elderly, services for people with disabilities, rural transport for isolated communities, community halls facilities, rural tourism, community radio, recycling clubs, homework and breakfast clubs, services for Travellers and restoration projects for gardens, buildings and railways.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;43 million is spent on the rural social scheme, all of which came from the community support programme.  Most of these had few resources until that programme started.  The rural social scheme includes Leader programmes, some of which are run in conjunction with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, which maintain and enhance ways, walks and roads.  It also includes energy conservation, countryside enhancement, social care for the elderly, pre-school and after school care, environment maintenance groups and non-profit projects for cultural heritage areas.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;24 million is spent on the 180 community development projects that operate in disadvantaged housing estates in urban areas.  This does not include Leader programmes, the national drugs strategy, the young person services fund and RAPID.  All groups mentioned receive core funding from the State, involving thousands <Col N="651"/>of people.  This does not include resources from F&Aacute;S.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about people not having time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked me about the recommendations of the White Paper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>So the Taoiseach has not answered the last question.  I thought he was finished.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>He was giving the election information first.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding time, in my experience the busiest people are the best people to ask to do something.  In the Deputies&rsquo; areas, people are very active.  They may spend a long time in their cars but they get involved.  However, time is limited by the amount one spends travelling.  That is obvious.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Taoiseach doing about it?  What about planning issues?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The best way to address it is to invest money in transport and improve it, as we are doing.  We are spending billions of euro on improving that aspect.  That is the fastest way of moving people.  We are also trying to provide incentives for people to locate outside the city areas.  All grant schemes have a bias in favour of people outside city areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish the leader of our party in the D&aacute;il well.  He has been ill recently and we in Sinn F&eacute;in wish him a speedy recovery.  Will the task force address the need for a more democratic approach to running our schools, involving the parents and the community?  Many parents feel cut off from the schools their children attend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is moving outside the realm of the question. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to know if the task force will examine this area, as one in which many would actively participate if given the opportunity.   Surely facilitating a more central role for parents in the life of the school would be an excellent way to demonstrate active citizenship?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Government parties I wish the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in in the House, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, a quick return to full health after his heart attack and operation last Friday.  I hope he makes a full and speedy recovery.  </P><Col N="652"/>
        <P>The suggestion of involving schools and young people in active local community programmes is a good one.  The more young people are involved in such programmes, the more parents are likely to be involved.   Active citizenship has examined this area in great detail but I do not know what it will recommend.  It has considered involving young people in building on the initiatives of many national organisations specifically concerned with young people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Where do young people go when they go out?  Does the Taoiseach agree that the seed of active citizenship is best sown among young people?  Often, those between the ages of 12 and 16 have nowhere safe to go and are unfortunately more comfortable at home watching television instead of going out to socialise and form groups and clubs or getting involved in activities such as active citizenship envisages.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not require a report to show that there has been significant investment in sporting and community facilities around the country in recent years.  In towns and villages and other urban areas people work to share these facilities, by bringing committees together.  Parents of people in the age group Deputy Stanton mentioned are concerned to keep them away from the drink and drug culture.  There are many good organisations to help these people such as Eddie Kerr&rsquo;s organisation, the no-drink and no-name clubs which do a wonderful job in providing hops and discos for young people.  This is not possible everywhere and the involvement of alcohol or drugs ruins these activities.</P>
        <P>Earlier today I attended the launch of some of these programmes and I have heard and seen submissions stating that as long as they can confine themselves to simple youth activities there is no problem in scouting organisations, GAA, soccer, rugby or athletic clubs.  When programmes aim at youth alone, not in association with a club, there is a difficulty.  The point these people make is that the organisations should work together to use the infrastructure to the best of their ability so that people from various clubs and organisations can get out.  Most people say it is very hard to keep drink and drugs out of youth clubs.  The many submissions to the task force from up and down the country make this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>A few months ago Fine Gael tabled a good samaritans Bill to afford a defence to volunteers against a damages claim.  The Government unfortunately rejected the Bill due to a deliberate misinterpretation by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Will the Taoiseach ask the task force to consider recommending that the Government table a good samaritans Bill to assist volunteers?  Several hundred volunteers in Wicklow and Kildare are involved with a community first responders scheme.  Such legislation would provide these people, who are <Col N="653"/>concerned with carrying out voluntary work, with protection.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The volunteers to whom I refer received support from the ambulance service in the former Eastern Regional Health Authority area.  Such support from professionals was vital.  In the past month or two, however, the support to which I refer has been withdrawn, for reasons I cannot fathom.  Will the Taoiseach use his good offices to see if it can be re-established?  The several hundred people in question have provided valuable assistance for nothing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not familiar with the scheme but I will ask someone to investigate the position.  I am aware that a facility exists in respect of the Civil Defence, the FCA, the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the Order of Malta and other organisations.  I do not know why the group to which the Deputy refers has not been extended this facility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>On the previous occasion we discussed this matter, it was in reference to important legislation for the voluntary sector, namely, the charities Bill.  At the time, the Taoiseach stated the Bill was an absolute priority and that he hoped it would be before the House early this year.  Many voluntary groups will be interested to know if that remains the case, particularly as it is now February.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The charities Bill has proven to be extremely complex from a legal point of view and there are an enormous number of vested interests involved.  The Bill, on which a member of staff of the Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s office has been working on a full-time basis for a year, is almost ready.  It is a priority and will be published.  There has not been a great deal of charity in its preparation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 17, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am delighted that Towards 2016, the ten-year framework social partnership agreement 2006-15, received such overwhelming support from within all four social partner pillars and that we are now progressing its implementation.  The mechanisms for implementation of the new agreement are broadly the same as applied under the previous agreement and are set out in detail in chapter 4, part 1, of the new agreement.</P>
        <P>The steering group representing Government and each of the social partner pillars has been reconvened and is, as before, assuming overall responsibility for the management of the implementation of the agreement as it applies to the wider non-pay issues.  Each social partner pillar has representatives on the steering group, while the Government is represented by the Secretary General and an assistant secretary of my Department and senior officials from the Departments <Col N="655"/>of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the office for social inclusion.</P>
        <P>As heretofore, there will be quarterly plenary meetings of the social partner pillars and an annual meeting of the parties with me, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance.  The inaugural plenary meeting under Towards 2016 takes place this Thursday in Dublin Castle.  The agenda for the meeting will include updates on the recently launched National Development Plan 2007-2013 and the life cycle approach to delivery of social services envisaged under Towards 2016.  The first quarterly progress report under Towards 2016 will also be circulated at the meeting.</P>
        <P>In addition to the ongoing monitoring and reporting mechanisms which I have described, it has also been agreed that a formal review of the agreement will be undertaken during 2008.  As with all previous agreements, the Government and the social partners will keep implementation of Towards 2016 under ongoing review.  There are no plans for renegotiation.</P>
        <P>In addition to the quarterly review meetings, the national implementation body continues to meet as required to oversee delivery of the industrial peace and stability provisions in Towards 2016.  It has met on a number of occasions over recent months to assist in the resolution of industrial relations disputes.  Meetings of the body also provide opportunities for informal discussions on some of the broader issues relating to the social partnership process and the industrial relations climate generally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the recently enacted NESDO legislation, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, NCPP, are being established on a statutory basis.  Part of this process involves the reconstitution of both NESC and the NESF for a new three-year term of office from 2007 to 2009.  Once this exercise has been completed, the priority task for these bodies will be to draw up and agree a new programme of work.  As part of any new programme, NESC, the NESF and the NCPP, as constituent parts of NESDO, will participate in a learning society foresight exercise.  This was recommended by the Information Society Commission and agreed by the Government and the social partners in Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>NESC, appointed in mid-2003 for a three-year term, completed and published the following reports, as well as providing advice and information to the Government on issues of economic development and social justice: Housing in Ireland: Performance and Policy, published in December 2004; the Developmental Welfare State, published in May 2005; NESC Strategy 2006, People, Productivity and Purpose, published in December 2005; Migration Policy, published in September 2006; and Managing <Col N="656"/>Migration in Ireland: A Social and Economic Analysis, commissioned by the NESC and undertaken by the International Organisation for Migration, published in September 2006.  It is proposed that the reconstituted council build on this work by undertaking the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s first periodic social report.  This is in response to a Government request to carry out this work.</P>
        <P>During its term of office, which began with an inaugural meeting in May 2004 and ended on 31 December last, the NESF published reports on the following policy themes: early childhood care and education, care for older people and creating a more inclusive labour market.  In addition, work has been completed on a number of reports which are due to be published shortly.  These include Improving the Delivery of Quality Public Services, and the Arts, Cultural Inclusion and Social Cohesion.  The NESF is also progressing a report focusing on the area of mental health.</P>
        <P>The NESF has overseen three meetings to date of the national anti-poverty strategy social inclusion forum.  This forum is designed to give those who are not directly involved in the social partnership process an opportunity to input their views and experiences in implementing the anti-poverty strategy, identify barriers and constraints to progress and how best these can be overcome and provide suggestions on new developments and more effective policies in the future.  The official reports on the proceedings are published and circulated to all Ministers, the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, all Oireachtas Members and local authorities.</P>
        <P>The NESF prepares from time to time periodic reports on the influence and impact of its work on official policies, both at national and local levels.  The last such report covered the period 2001-03.  The NESF also hosted, in conjunction with the Geary Institute at UCD, a conference on evidence-based policy-making in February 2005.  The basic purpose of this conference was to examine both the supply and gathering of evidence and to apply this in the policy-making process and the design of practical policy solutions.  The ongoing monitoring and evaluation of policy outcomes was also an important focus of the conference.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions Nos. 6 to 17, inclusive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask the Taoiseach two questions about this matter.  Some 40,000 nurses have taken a decision to take industrial action and meetings are under way throughout the country.  The Taoiseach will be aware of the very valuable work nurses do and the considerable strain the profession is now under in hospitals throughout the country.  The nurses make the case, through the Irish Nurses Organisation, INO, and the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, that <Col N="657"/>when they lodged 14 amendments to the benchmarking process&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think those questions arise out of these particular questions, which refer to different bodies including the NESC and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Question No. 7 concerns the implementation of the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  The point they make is that a range of issues has been settled outside the benchmarking process but within the public service.  I recognise this is a complex, sensitive and emotional issue and I am aware of the Labour Court recommendation and the various stances taken by the trades unions.  Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s belief that the nurses&rsquo; outstanding claims in respect of reducing the working week from 39 to 35 hours, their pay claim and a range of other issues can be dealt with within the benchmarking process as it currently stands or is it his belief that the benchmarking process should be amended or made more flexible to allow these matters to be discussed and negotiated to whatever conclusion?  Is it his view that the door is still open, so to speak, in respect of the Labour Court being able to reach a conclusion regarding their claims for the working week to be reduced from 39 to 35 hours?  The Taoiseach will be aware that some child care workers who report to nurses earn &euro;3,000 more than them.  This has been a deep-rooted grievance with the nurses for over 20 years.  How does the Taoiseach believe this can be adjusted?</P>
        <P>Several nights ago I met former Greencore workers in Mallow.  The Labour Court made recommendations in their redundancy package case.  Does the Taoiseach agree that Greencore should pay up as per the Labour Court recommendation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The second question should be directed to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I knew you, a Cheann Comhairle, would come in at some stage.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court has called the unions and Greencore management for separate talks.  Does the Taoiseach believe this will lead to a conclusion in the case?  The workers see it as an issue of principle and believe they should get their due demands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are talks going on which I have done my utmost to assist.  The workers and Greencore management are aware of this.  I hope these talks will make some progress.  They should because it is in the interest of both parties to resolve this issue.  I hope the talks are successful and it is only right they should come to a satisfactory conclusion.  I have spoken up for the workers in this case before.  I acknowledge there is mean<Col N="658"/>ingful dialogue and I want to see it being helpfully concluded.</P>
        <P>On the nurse&rsquo;s pay issue, all matters in industrial relations are complex but I will try to keep it as simple as I can.  It is true that several smaller pay issues were taken into the tent, so to speak, during the social partnership process to resolve outstanding issues.  It is true the nurses&rsquo; organisations are aggrieved that a section of their people, because of the way it was handled, ended up at salary disadvantage to another grade.  The other categories&rsquo; pay claims were relatively small and could be included.  In the nurses&rsquo; pay claim, the category numbers 40,000 nurses and to take that inside would stretch the elastic too far.  It is not a serious way of dealing with the claim.  It was okay to address the smaller categories in the process.  It is not possible, however, to claim that 40,000 nurses is a small category.  I know the representations that have been made but I believe this is understood.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Labour Court judgment and recommendation stated the claim should be taken within the benchmarking process.  The INO and the Psychiatric Nurses Association tried to take this matter before the benchmarking body but could not get in their amendments.  I believe they have a case for that.  If they put that case to the benchmarking body, it will have to be addressed, whatever the outcome.</P>
        <P>There is the issue of the reduction of the working week from 39 hours to 35 hours.  As I stated on Leaders&rsquo; Questions last week, this issue must be addressed in the context of health service reforms.  The Labour Court and other trade unions have also stated this.  Health service reforms allow the possibility to raise working-time flexibility, productivity, changes of hours, manning levels and other issues.  If the process was used to deal with the reduction in the 39 hour working week for nurses and their pay claim, it would then have to include the other 350,000 public servants.  Neither can the full cost of the nurses&rsquo; pay claim be put on the Exchequer.  That would be the worst basis for any negotiations.  I made it clear to the nurses&rsquo; unions that this is just not possible.  No Government could ever do that and this is understood.  There are ways of dealing with it and, hopefully, some sanity will prevail around these issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s remarks that he has been involved in and helpful on the Greencore issue.  When I met the workers concerned ten days ago, however, they told me they had met the Taoiseach but were completely unaware of anything he had done for them.  What has the Taoiseach done and does he believe there will be an early settlement of this matter?</P>
        <P>The Labour Court recommendation has been interpreted, reinterpreted and interpreted again and, on each occasion, has come down on the side of the workers concerned.  Yet Greencore will not deal with the matter.  The Taoiseach obviously <Col N="659"/>has new information.  It was only last Friday week that I met the workers and they did not know anything about him having caused any progress to be made.</P>
        <P>What are the Taoiseach&rsquo;s concerns for social partnership in the wider sense in the context of the price rises we have seen in recent times, including this very week and month?  Under the new partnership agreement, workers throughout the country will receive a 10% pay increase over 27 months.  Inflation is running at 4.9%, however, and is likely at least to exceed 5.5% this month.  There has been a spate of price increases relating to gas, electricity and foodstuffs, including, as promulgated by IBEC yesterday, various products in the inflation shopping basket.  Notwithstanding the abolition of the groceries order, prices are still rising rapidly in the economy.  Is the Taoiseach concerned about the impact this will have on the modest pay provisions of the new agreement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I met the Greencore workers&rsquo; representatives two weeks ago last Friday.  They asked me to take two actions, namely, to make direct contact with both the Labour Court and the company.  I am surprised and disappointed that the workers&rsquo; representatives told Deputy Rabbitte that they were unaware of any such progress last Friday week.  I got back to them within four days to tell them precisely that we had made those direct engagements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>They did not know that last Friday week.  There may be a genuine communication problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Deputy says.  Within four or five days of our meeting, I told the representatives that I had urged the company&rsquo;s senior executive to engage with them on the terms of the Labour Court recommendation.  I have no guarantee that such engagement will resolve the matter but I made my views clear to the company management.  There is not a huge amount of money involved and the company has an obligation to negotiate.  It has agreed to re-enter those negotiations and I hope a resolution can be found.  It is unreasonable that the workers should be expected to wait until it is discovered whether moneys might be available from the EU in the future.  One of my officials has dealt directly with the workers&rsquo; representatives.  If there is a communications issue, I will ask him to convey that message to the company.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Oil prices and interest rates were the primary drivers of inflation in the past year.  If they are excluded from the latest figures, the increase last year was 2.1%.  In other words, inflation is not accounted for across an entire basket of products and services.  Rather, these two elements are accounting for half the inflation rise and both are outside domestic control.</P><Col N="660"/>
        <P>There are other areas where we have influence.  The figures being discussed yesterday and last week show the inflation rate for consumer services running at 8% in December compared to a rate of 1.2% for consumer goods.  There is unquestionably an issue about competition in the services sector and I am sure IBEC will examine that as well because it is very clear.</P>
        <P>From a positive perspective, the anti-inflation group, which has worked under social partnership and which worked very well in 2003, has been reactivated and has started a range of meetings with numerous organisations.  It will meet the Commission on Energy Regulation next month and it has met the CSO, the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  The group has been reactivated and, obviously, the Government is driving that to see where we can make changes.  Our analysis shows that consumer services are a prime example of where there have been huge price increases of over 8% as against consumer goods which have increased by 1%.  It is not the case, as some groups have said, that the increases have been in consumer goods.  The increases have been in consumer services.  The goods in the shops have risen only by 1.2%.  IBEC and others should look very carefully at consumer services and at some of the competition issues surrounding that.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>  the number of children for whom neither English nor Irish is their first language in the education system at both primary and post-primary level; the method through which language support resources are allocated to schools; the length of time for which these resources are allocated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[5208/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department estimates that there are in the region of 28,000 students in our schools whose first language is not English or Irish.  In order to meet their language needs, additional support is given to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of posts.</P>
        <P>The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled.  The additional language support to an individual pupil is generally given for a period of two years.</P>
        <P>Schools with between three and 13 eligible pupils receive grant assistance towards the cost of employing part-time teachers.  Schools with three to eight pupils receive a grant of over &euro;6,300 <Col N="661"/>while schools with between ten and 13 such pupils receive over &euro;9,500.  Some &euro;4 million is being provided for such grants in 2007.</P>
        <P>Schools with 14 or more such pupils are entitled to one or more language support teachers, the number of which has increased dramatically in recent years.  There are now approximately 1,250 language support teachers in our schools.  More than 400 of these teachers have been allocated in the current school year alone.  As I announced last November, 200 extra posts were approved by the Government for 2007, bringing to 1,450 the number of language teachers that will be working in our schools this year.  This compares with just 262 posts in the 2001-02 school year.</P>
        <P>In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitments under the Towards 2016 partnership agreement, a further 350 language support teachers will be provided between 2008 and 2009.  In allocating additional teachers, I will address, in particular, the position of those schools catering for significant numbers of such children.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive strategy is currently being finalised which will ensure that the extra investment in this area is being used to the best effect, and that it is underpinned by the right support and training for teachers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the 200 teachers which the Minister announced in November and re-announced last Friday come on stream?  Where will they be located and what level of training do they have?  Have they received training in language support teaching or just the general training all teachers receive?  The Minister will be aware of Scoil Bhr&iacute;de in Blanchardstown which has 150 international pupils and three language support teachers and Scoil Mhuire in Lucan which has 70 international pupils and two language support teachers.  This situation is replicated in schools not only in Dublin city but throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister any intention of overhauling the allocation?  She spoke about it before but she has not given a clear commitment as to whether she will change the rules she outlined in terms of the allocation of teachers.  Does she have any plans to scrap the two-year rule?  This is about ensuring children have a proper standard of English.  What one child may learn in two years, another child might take longer to learn so the rule in place is extremely unfair to some children.  What are the Minister&rsquo;s views on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>We accept children have different levels of language.  That is why a language assessment kit will be sent to every school.  It is being devised for us by Integrate Ireland Language and Training Limited to ensure teachers will be able to assess the language capability of the child.  I indicated at the conference of the Irish Primary Principals Network that the two-year rule and the <Col N="662"/>two teacher rule will no longer apply.  We are fortunate to be in a position to be able to do this due to the number of extra teachers who will go into the system.</P>
        <P>Like the schools the Deputy mentioned, there are schools with a substantial number of children with needs and they must be the priority.  Schools with large numbers of such pupils have already broken the two teacher rule, as it were, and have three teachers.  That shows our bona fides in that regard.</P>
        <P>Along with a revised allocation system, language assessment kits will be sent to schools as well as information packs for schools and parents.  The important element is training for teachers.  In the primary school, each teacher is fully qualified to teach and, obviously, has the skills and methodologies which go with that.  Most of these children are in primary schools and it is important teachers have the methodology to teach not only English but basic literacy.  It is also our intention to ensure further training for teachers, particularly in the use of the language kits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I have the utmost faith in the teachers but they are qualified to teach English speaking students.  A different degree of training is needed to teach students whose first language is not English.  I am concerned when I hear the word &ldquo;kit&rdquo;.  It is very much the &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; approach.  When will those kits be available and what will they contain?  Will teachers in schools be trained to use these kits and carry out assessments?  The Minister mentioned the word &ldquo;priority&rdquo; in regard to schools such as that in Blanchardstown.  There was a lovely new phrase in the national development plan, namely, &ldquo;accelerated priority&rdquo;.  We now have a scale of priority.  When will schools such as that in Blanchardstown see a real difference?  Will those 200 teachers be in the schools next week, next month or next term?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The teachers will be allocated this year under a new allocation process recognising the number of students in those schools.  An assessment kit &mdash; one can call it what one likes &mdash; is a method of assessment and a way in which teachers will be able to ascertain the language competency of a child.  That is being devised in conjunction with Integrate Ireland Language and Training Limited.  That group has also provided the teacher training about which the Deputy spoke.  It has held seminars for language support teachers &mdash; part-time and whole-time &mdash; has provided classroom materials and has included the European language portfolio which provides grants for teachers for language tuition for refugees etc.  Integrate Ireland Language and Training Limited is the expert in this area.  That is why we called it in and are working with it to provide the training and the assessment kits.  The allocations will be based on that.  </P>

        <Quest>  if she will provide greater access to educational psychological assessments to schools which do not have a National Educational Psychological Service, in view of the disclosure by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that a considerable amount of its budget is spent on financing such assessments; if she will reassess the requirements for a clinical diagnosis for certain special needs children before learning supports are provided; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government has given a very high priority to providing better supports for children with special needs.  This year, we will provide over &euro;820 million for special education &mdash; an increase of 30%, or &euro;180 million, on last year&rsquo;s allocation.  Among other improvements, this increased investment covers the cost of 31 extra NEPS psychologists, including our commitments under Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>The number of psychologists in the Department has increased from 43 since the establishment of NEPS in 1999 to a current figure of 127, including four psychologists assigned to the National Behavioural Support Service.  There are also a further 16 whole-time equivalent educational psychologists providing a service through the Dublin City and County VECs.  Taken together, there are currently 143 educational psychologists working in services paid for by my Department.  The expansion of the number of NEPS psychologists by a further 31 in 2007 will represent a significant increase in the numbers in NEPS and bring the total number of psychologists in the system to 174.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in line with the Government&rsquo;s Towards 2016 commitments, the number of NEPS psychologists will be increased even further in each of 2008 and 2009, to a total of 193.  At this point, including the 16 psychologists in the Dublin VEC areas, it is expected that the number of educational psychologists in the system as a whole will be 209.  Therefore, the number of schools covered directly by NEPS psychologists will increase substantially.  The number of schools served directly by NEPS is only half the picture as schools which are not covered by the service can commission private assessments paid for by NEPS.</P>
        <P Just="Left">More than 4,000 such private assessments were funded in the 2005-06 academic year.  In addition, NEPS psychologists themselves carried out 6,700 assessments.  So, in total, nearly 11,000 children had assessments paid for by my Department last year.  Given that 11,000 assessments were provided, I was concerned to hear that the Society of St. Vincent De Paul had also paid for some.  My Department has contacted the society to ascertain why this was the case.   Since the Government provided for a guaranteed allocation of resource <Col N="664"/>teaching hours to all primary schools in 2005, the majority of primary school children do not now need psychological assessments to get extra support.</P>
        <P>In common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist.  Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.  It is important that such a system be used to ensure that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</P>
        <P>It was not clear from the coverage last month whether the staged model had been followed in the cases referred to by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  As I said earlier, we have contacted the society to arrange a meeting to discuss the background to, and context for, any funding it has provided for psychological assessments.  As regards clinical diagnosis, discussions are currently under way between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children with regard to the implementation of both the Disability Act and the EPSEN Act and these discussions will incorporate discussion on assessment issues.  My Department will consider its assessment requirements in this context and as part of the normal ongoing review of policies and procedures.</P>
        <P>With the huge increases in investment in special education services in recent years, I am confident that all children with special needs can access resources in an appropriate and speedy manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply but her assessment that everything in the garden is rosy is very far from what I hear from parents, principals and people involved in disability organisations.  </P>
        <P>When does she expect to reach the target of a full complement of NEPS psychologists so that every school in the country has access to NEPS?  Will she increase the current quota, which allows for two psychological assessments per 100 children, for schools which do not have access to NEPS?  A school of 100 children might have 20 children in need of access to a psychological assessment so that they can get specific supports.  Those children might not fit into a category in the general weighting model introduced a couple of years ago.  Without an adequate allocation of psychological assessments, parents who cannot otherwise afford help must go to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact the Department of Education and Science is in discussion with the Department of Health and Children but the Minister will be aware that some families with children who have specific learning difficulties must wait <Col N="665"/>two or three years for an assessment from the Department of Health and Children, where that is more appropriate than a NEPS assessment.  They can get a letter stating the child requires certain supports but not a diagnosis.  Can the Minister address that issue?  It is a real problem, particularly at post-primary level where some children wait years for the necessary diagnosis and so go without any support at all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s first question was on when the target would be met.  The target set by the planning group was for 184 NEPS psychologists.  This year we intend to reach 174 and, in two years&rsquo; time, we will exceed that figure to reach 209, including the psychologists in the VECs. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will that cover all schools?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It certainly will.  With the extra 31 coming on board this year, we will be able to extend the direct coverage.  There have been many tragic incidents in schools recently so it is important we do not ignore the service NEPS provides to all schools on such occasions.  It plays a very valuable role and school principals very much appreciate it.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also asked about the individual allocation in schools.  Schools that have applied for further assessments in urgent cases were allowed to have them.  A number of schools do not use their full allocation and others carry their allocation forward from one year to the next.  Additional assessments have been allowed to schools based on the private scheme.  For that reason I am anxious to find out what is behind the need for funding from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  I also want to know whether the funding in question was sought as a last resort or as a first resort, given that a teacher and a school are meant to follow a staged approach prior to a psychological assessment.  Even though we have extended the number of NEPS psychologists and introduced a general allocation, meaning every school in the country now has resource teachers, the funding for privately commissioned assessments has increased.  There is no question of any cutback in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said all schools will be covered within two years.  Does that mean there will be a reasonable workload for NEPS psychologists?  Covering schools is one thing but having the capacity to carry out all the necessary psychological assessments is another and that is what schools are seeking.  The Minister said schools can get more assessments than allocated but in practice they cannot.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There may have been cases where that is the case but I can cite examples of schools which have had additional assessments.  Given that the target was set at 184 psychologists, the <Col N="666"/>fact that we will provide 209 will certainly cover the existing need.  Those numbers were indicated before the allocation of resource teachers to schools, meaning every school has those teachers as well as a NEPS psychologist for children with individual-specific needs.</P>

        <Quest>  if she will review the DEIS scheme in County Mayo and guarantee the same funding and benefits beyond 2007; the reason for the anomaly where one of two second level schools on Achill Island has been excluded, although all 11 feeder schools on the island are deemed disadvantaged by her Department and a similar situation exists in Erris; if she will take steps to guarantee beyond the current funding for disadvantage to the DEIS excluded schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[5338/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Ensuring children from the most disadvantaged communities in Mayo and elsewhere get the support they need to succeed at school is a key priority for the Government.  To this end, we have increased investment in tackling educational disadvantage significantly in recent years.  In 2007, we are providing almost &euro;730 million for targeted initiatives at all levels, an increase of almost &euro;95 million on the comparable 2006 figure.</P>
        <P>This investment supports the roll-out of additional supports under the DEIS action plan, through which 68 primary schools and eight post-primary schools in County Mayo will benefit from a comprehensive package of extra supports.  Mayo schools are very well represented on the list of DEIS schools, making up almost 20% of all the rural schools in the programme.</P>
        <P>In the case of schools that did not qualify for the new programme, it is important to note that an independent review process was available.  Additional schools were added to the programme as a result of successful review applications.  I am satisfied that all schools have been assessed on the basis of the best information available, have been ranked in terms of the right criteria and have been given a fair opportunity to appeal.  Unsuccessful schools were advised at an early stage that they would be allowed to keep the supports that they have under pre-existing schemes for the current school year.</P>
        <P>My Department is now in the process of informing these schools that they will retain additional teaching resources for the duration of the DEIS action plan.  The effectiveness of these posts will be reviewed in line with the ongoing review process in place for DEIS schools.  It will be a condition of the retention of such posts that schools comply with any reasonable requirements of the review process.</P><Col N="667"/>
        <P>Schools which currently participate in the home-school-community liaison, HSCL, scheme will not be excluded from the scheme and will, from the commencement of the 2007-08 school year, continue to avail of HSCL services for the duration of the DEIS action plan.  The level of service will be commensurate with both the size of the school and its relative level of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Many schools at present retain additional capitation from previous schemes which have now been subsumed into DEIS.  From the beginning of the 2007-08 school year, this capitation will be offset against increases in the rate of general capitation.  This process will take four years and will ensure that no school will experience a reduction in annual capitation as a result of this measure.  Changes may, of course, arise from other factors such as enrolments.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that not only has the Government provided for a major increase in supports to our most disadvantaged schools through DEIS, but it has also addressed the concerns of schools that did not qualify for the new initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply but she has engineered a crisis in Mayo.  Schools are distressed because of a situation which is equivalent to losing a teacher.  Class sizes will have to be increased and she has increased divisiveness and discrimination in Mayo.  I asked specifically about the situation on Achill Island, a deprived area in which there are 13 schools, some 11 of which are feeder schools.  They are all in DEIS and recognised as such by the Department.  However, of the two that accept children from the national school, only one is in DEIS.  The two schools are only separated by a wall but one receives an additional &euro;30,000 funding.  In that school, the pupils must achieve greater marks than the deprived children to reach third level.  Does deprivation stop at that wall?  How does this happen?  I do not understand how one of two schools that are right beside each other is not in the programme while the other is, particularly when every second child that goes to these schools is classified as deprived.  A similar situation exists in Erris.  There are 22 feeder schools to two second level schools and one of them has been left out of the programme.  It does not make sense.</P>
        <P>This process was based on a flawed system that penalises schools that have done well and retained children.  The schools would do better to expel all of their children.  The criteria for the system are out of date and do not reflect the last three to five years when we were swamped with students who speak English as a second language.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s own list refers to the transferring from primary to second level, stating that the key principle of early intervention, to identify and help children at risk of leaving school early, is a major component of DEIS, with a continuing <Col N="668"/>emphasis being placed on the development of effective transfer programmes for pupils making the transition to second level by building on the existing work of the HSCL scheme and the school completion programme.  The Minister is not even following her own criterion.  Surely the transition means that those children who are deprived at primary level are deprived at second level too.  This does not make sense and I ask the Minister to rationalise it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The criteria were devised by the Educational Research Centre and can stand up in any circumstances when examining factors in disadvantage, such as large families, unemployment, local authority accommodation, lone parenthood, Travellers, pupils eligible for free books and so on.  These characteristics would define levels of disadvantage.  Equally, at second level, hard statistical information was available for those on medical cards, retention rates and so on.  It is possible that one school in the area did not qualify because no one would say that every child in Achill is disadvantaged and this has to do with the level of disadvantage in a particular school.  It could happen that one school had a greater level of disadvantage than the other.</P>
        <P>The Deputy made points I would like to correct.  He said the school would lose a teacher but, as I indicated in my answer, that is not the case, the schools have already been informed that the teachers they have will be retained throughout the DEIS action plan.  The Deputy also said the schools would lose money but no school will experience a reduction in annual capitation as a result of this measure.  These issues were of concern to schools that were not included in DEIS so they have all been informed, as I outlined in my answer, about funding, teachers and the home-school-community liaison scheme.</P>
        <P>Another element attached to this, although it falls outside the remit of the Department of Education and Science, is the school meals scheme and that will also be continued.  We will ensure schools are not disadvantaged by being in the scheme and that the most disadvantaged will continue to gain the most.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>The second school never got free meals.  It is not equitable.  The figures the Minister used are based on school statistics for 1995, 1996 and 1997, a long time ago.  Of the schools excluded from the scheme, 25% are in Mayo.  The figures for Dublin show that 38 schools applied and 26 were accepted, with 12 being refused.  In Mayo, nine schools applied and only one was accepted.  That is hardly equitable.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the home-school-community liaison person.  That will be a shared role, the face will disappear from the school.  The teacher in St. Muiredeach&rsquo;s will not be there anymore, it will be someone else whom the pupils and staff do not know.  I ask the Minister to leave <Col N="669"/>the situation as it is beyond 2007, that is the only fair way to move forward.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said during an Adjournment debate that where there was severe socioeconomic disadvantage and the situation had not been properly evaluated, a re-evaluation could take place.  Is that the light at the end of the tunnel?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy was not listening to me.  The schools will retain their posts for the duration of the DEIS plan and continue to be part of the home-school-community liaison depending on the level of disadvantage and the size of the school.  The capitation will ensure there is no reduction in funding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>Will that continue beyond 2007?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It will continue for the duration of the disadvantage plan.  The Deputy is also confused about the figures and dates for the junior certificate.  Those were for first years who entered schools in those years, but who sat their junior certificate three years later.  We were not using figures from 1995, 1996 or 1997, we were looking at the first years in those years and their junior certificate results.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister is using retention figures, which penalises good schools.  This is not about the statistics for the national schools, where the criteria were broad, but about second level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>We were asking if children who entered school in those years finished school, whether they reached and completed junior certificate and then leaving certificate.  The information I gave today about schools that were in disadvantage schemes retaining their teaching posts, remaining part of the home-school-community liaison scheme and not losing funding should offer comfort to all schools.  The fact that 20% of the rural schools in the scheme are in Mayo identifies the way the schemes target the most disadvantaged pupils.  No one in the House would say we should spread the money so thinly that it would not reach the intended targets.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am satisfied that the Department provides an extensive range of supports for the education of deaf and hearing impaired children.  This includes three special schools and ten special classes attached to mainstream schools with a pupil-teacher ratio for these classes of 7:1.</P>
        <P>In line with the Department&rsquo;s policy that children with special educational needs access appropriate education intervention in mainstream settings where possible, many deaf and hearing impaired pupils are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level with the assistance, as necessary, of resource teaching and special needs assistant support.</P>
        <P>The Department has provided funding for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf school-going pupils to provide training in Irish sign language for these children, their siblings and parents.  In addition, the visiting teachers for the hearing impaired scheme provides a service to deaf and hearing impaired children from pre-school to third level.</P>
        <P>An enhanced capitation grant is provided to special schools and mainstream schools with special classes supporting deaf and hearing impaired pupils and grant aid is available towards the special equipment needs of these pupils.  Last November I announced increases of between 30% and 39% in the special capitation rates for these classes.  The 2007 rate for children with hearing impairment is &euro;785 per pupil, while for profoundly deaf children it is &euro;805 per pupil.  The Department also contributes to the professional development of teachers of deaf and hearing impaired children through funding courses in Irish sign language.</P>
        <P>An advisory committee for the deaf and hard of hearing was established in 2001 and it met 38 times.  In the course of the committee&rsquo;s work, however, it became apparent that there were entrenched, divergent views among representatives of deaf and hard of hearing persons and their families on approaches to the teaching of the deaf and hard of hearing and that there was little willingness to reach consensus.  One group, which comes from an oralist tradition, favours a focus on teaching deaf and hard of hearing children to speak and to understand spoken language.  Another group strongly advocates sign language as the appropriate and exclusive means of communication.  As a result of these opposing views, the committee was unable to agree a final report, despite being set several deadlines for doing so.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, and following consultations between officials and the chairperson of the committee, the Department formed the view that there was no prospect of the advisory committee reaching an agreed position in the foreseeable future.  The committee was therefore disbanded in 2004.</P>
        <P>Following the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, the Department <Col N="671"/>referred the issues that had been under consideration by the committee to the NCSE for its consideration.  The council has commissioned a researcher from the Centre for Deaf Studies to work on this.  The work is at an advanced stage and I will consider the matter further following receipt of the report from the NCSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, on his appointment and wish him well.  We do not intend that he will be in the job too long.  I am sure he will do an excellent job.  I also wish Deputy de Valera well on her impending retirement.</P>
        <P>The community who care for the deaf are concerned that the system does not adequately provide for them.  I accept some of what the Minister said in her reply.  The education system is not embracing new technology to the extent it could.  Such technology has the capacity to impact very positively on children who are deaf or hard of hearing.  I share her concern over the different viewpoints on the committee, which may have led to some difficulty.  We need to move beyond those difficulties for the sake of the children.  Will the Minister consider setting student attainment targets and timeframes within which deaf children should reach milestones?</P>
        <P>I appreciate that mainstreaming can be difficult in some areas.  There is a view that children would do better if they had access to some other deaf pupils in the school.  I know of some schools where deaf children are signing and the whole school embraces it.  All children in the school are given the opportunity to participate in signing classes to allow them to communicate with deaf students.  I know this is easier in small schools.  Has the Minister considered establishing a centre for excellence for dealing with the issue, as proposed to the original committee, or does the issue fall under the remit of the National Council for Special Education?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s disappointment that the group failed to reach consensus.  However, its members held very entrenched divergent views.  It is important that the National Council for Special Education would try to get an overview of the issue bearing in mind these differing views and the research material available.  I am not in a position to propose setting targets as each child is very different.  I am guided by what the National Council for Special Education recommends in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to see how many children are mainstreamed in schools.  The priority is to teach sign language to the deaf child and his or her siblings and parents.  The visiting teachers are doing a very good job in this regard.  As it is such a difficult and sensitive issue for the deaf community who have failed to agree, it would be best to await the report of the National Council for <Col N="672"/>Special Education.  I am certainly willing to act on whatever it recommends.</P>

        <Quest>  her Department&rsquo;s projected increase in the school-going population over the lifetime of the national development plan; the way she proposes to accelerate the purchase of sites and the construction of schools and classrooms in time to meet this projected need in order to reduce class size; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Increases in our population, including the impact of immigration, are now unquestionably the main drivers of growth in demand for school accommodation.  On foot of current and projected demographics, the Department is planning provision for a minimum increase in the national primary school-going population of 100,000 pupils by 2013.  The number of extra classrooms that will be needed will depend on such factors as the spread of the additional pupils and the capacity, or otherwise, of existing schools to meet this demand.  Nonetheless, the Government is determined to provide the extra accommodation that will be needed in line with or ahead of demand.</P>
        <P>We have dramatically increased investment in the school building programme, from just over &euro;90 million when we came into office to &euro;540 million this year.  Under the lifetime of the national development plan almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post primary schools.</P>
        <P>This year, more than &euro;300 million will be invested in large-scale school building projects concentrated mainly in the provision of school accommodation in rapidly developing areas.  This level of funding will facilitate construction work on more than 150 large scale projects which will deliver more than 15,000 additional permanent places in new schools and the extension and modernisation of facilities in existing schools for more than 45,000 pupils.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It will also enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme, again with the focus being on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.  The balance will be used to fund the other elements of the school building programme such the summer works scheme, the small schools scheme, the per<Col N="673"/>manent accommodation scheme, etc.  In total, more than 1,500 projects will be delivered in 2007.</P>
        <P>Not only are we investing far more in school buildings, but the improvements that have been made in the planning, design and delivery processes are also helping to deliver projects much more quickly.  There is now much greater forward planning, with close and regular engagement with local authorities, while a new partnership model has been developed to deliver community facilities in tandem with new schools.  To reduce red tape and allow projects to move faster, responsibility for smaller projects has been devolved to school level.  Standard designs have also been developed for eight, 12 and 16-classroom schools to facilitate speedier delivery of projects and save on design fees.</P>
        <P>Steps have been taken to reduce expenditure on the purchase of prefabs by enabling schools to build permanent accommodation instead.  While it is impossible to eradicate the need for prefabs where extra accommodation is needed at very short notice, the amount spent is kept to an absolute minimum.  Over the past five years, expenditure on temporary accommodation represented approximately 4% of the total capital expenditure on school buildings.  Last year, it was less than 1.5%.</P>
        <P>We are also doing our level best to enable new schools in developing areas to open in high quality permanent accommodation from the start.  The new primary schools for Adamstown are being delivered in this way.  Through both increased investment under the NDP and the improved planning and delivery processes that we have put in place in recent years, the Government will ensure that the need for extra school places is met.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Deputy Enright in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.  I wish him well in his job and wish Deputy de Valera all the best in her retirement.  We look forward to working with the new Minister of State, even if it is only for a short period.</P>
        <P>While I do not doubt that the Government is investing considerably into school buildings, it is running very fast to stand still with the anticipated demographic changes that will see 100,000 additional children by 2013.  At the present rate of progress does the Department feel it will be able to deliver or will it constantly need to play catch-up?  Last night in Leixlip, the INTO claimed that 85% of primary schoolchildren in north Kildare are in excessively large classes.  The Government parties have been in government for nearly ten years and these are the kinds of statistics we hear.  The figures the Minister supplied to me indicate that the number of children in classes of more than 30 is increasing rather than decreasing.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister have any radical proposals to address the issue, including, for example, implementing the recommendation of the All-<Col N="674"/>Party Committee on the Constitution to compulsorily purchase land for schools at reasonable prices?  Speaking before the Joint Committee on Education and Science a Department of Education and Science official stated that effectively under the current regime the Department of Education and Science is just another buyer in a buoyant market.  I put it to the Minister that the Government would save money if it could acquire sites under compulsory purchase order at an early stage.</P>
        <P>The Minister states that the school building process is being accelerated.  However, we are being told that in practice it takes years to go through the Department&rsquo;s architectural programme and by the time the school is operational the need may be even greater, resulting in the requirement to pay for rented prefabs, which represents money that is thrown away to rich people.  Does the Minister have any radical proposals to accelerate the process so that we will not find ourselves with exactly the same problem at the end of the timeframe of the national development plan?</P>

	<P Just="Left">With the range of options I have outlined, we are satisfied we can make quick progress in building the new schools, particularly in developing areas.  This will require us to ensure that much of our funding goes towards those areas in coming years.  Having the generic design and repeating models removes all the stages of architectural design, appointment of design teams, etc.  I have already opened two gaelscoileanna, one in County Tipperary the other in County Roscommon, which were identical on the outside, but completely different inside.  Both were very quickly delivered.  This year alone 20 such schools will commence construction.  They have removed the need for all the architectural planning which is one way of doing it quickly.  The design and build option is another one that can be used for very large schools.  We have a 16-classroom school in Griffeen Valley, a 24-classroom school in Diswellstown, and a new 16-classroom school is to be built at Adamstown.  Rather than going to the market to build one school at a time we are bundling schools together under the design and build option.  For example, the new post-primary schools for Donabate, Laytown and Phibblestown will be bundled together under one design and build contract.  This will speed up delivery and will ensure the Department is not caught up in the intricacies of design, etc.  That <Col N="675"/>we have devolved so much responsibility for all the smaller schools is one of the key successes in ensuring so many schools have got projects.  The 1,500 projects this year could not be delivered if it was all being done centrally by the Department.</P>
        <P>On the issue of sites, our biggest demand is in the County Dublin area including Kildare and Wicklow.  The Deputy started to speak about class size, I thought we were talking about classrooms.</P>

	<P>I will certainly answer in regard to class size.

        <Quest>  if she will retain some flexibility in the qualifications criteria for persons who provide home tuition for children with special needs, especially those on the autistic spectrum, and where parents are satisfied with the current provider of the service and have difficulty in finding a suitably qualified alternative; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[5095/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 96 together.</P>
        <P>The home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.</P>
        <P>The Deputies will appreciate that, as home tuition takes place outside of the normal school framework, there is need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned.  The usual requirement is for a fully qualified teacher.</P>
        <P>A recent review of a number of applications for home tuition highlighted some cause for concern regarding the qualifications of proposed tuition providers.  The review determined that most of the nominated tuition providers were suitably qualified.  However, over 130 had less than satisfactory qualifications.  For example, some did not have a leaving certificate level of education while others had no post-school qualifications.</P>
        <P>Parents and guardians who had nominated tuition providers with qualifications other than <Col N="677"/>teaching qualifications were advised that these tuition providers were being accepted for the first school term, from September to December 2006, to allow time to undertake the review.</P>
        <P>Following the review of qualifications, which took place in consultation with my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate, an extended list of qualifications acceptable under the scheme for children with autism has been published.  This list is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Aside from recognised teaching qualifications such as the Bachelor in Education and approved Montessori training, the list includes certain qualifications in autism and in applied approaches to teaching children with autism, such as ABA, PECS and TEACCH.  Third level qualifications in relevant areas such as psychology may also be appropriate depending on circumstances.</P>
        <P>As necessary, my Department wrote to the parents and guardians concerned to advise the outcome of the review.  Where the tuition providers&rsquo; qualifications did not meet the minimum requirements, parents were advised of the need to recruit a tuition provider with suitable qualifications.  However, to accommodate those who were experiencing difficulties in changing to a qualified tuition provider, they have been given until the end of the current school year to do so.</P>
        <P>It is in the interests of children to expect that home tutors funded under this scheme are appropriately qualified tuition providers.  It is for this reason that tuition providers will be required to meet the minimum qualification standard for the 2007-08 school year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>In the recent review 130 were found to be less than satisfactory.  In the review of the extended list, how many fell foul of the requirements?  On the question of providing education through the ABA system, I understand 12 schools are awaiting approval from the Department.  When does the Minister intend to make a decision in respect of those schools?  What are her views on the delivery of education through the ABA structure for children with autism and does she believe it is a good method of delivering education?  Certainly the experience of parents has been extremely positive.  I have been approached by many parents in parts of the country where it is not available who have asked if it could be rolled out in those areas.  Does the Minister intend to facilitate that request?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the review, I am not aware of the individual number of tutors who would qualify.  That is the reason parents have been given until the end of this school year to find somebody appropriate.  The range of people acceptable is quite broad.  Hopefully, those parents will be able to get somebody suitable.</P>
        <P>In regard to the education of children with autism, significant advances have been made in the provision of special classes and the mainstreaming of children, where appropriate, in our <Col N="678"/>schools.  There are 181 special classes for children with autism, 16 early intervention classes, five special classes for children on the Aspergers spectrum and 12 special ABA schools as part of the pilot project.  Of those, 20 have been funded in the past year.  Before Christmas we offered incentives to administrative principals of schools who would be willing to take on an autistic unit within their schools.  I do not know if the Deputy has visited any of the schools which are custom built.  The two classroom units are very attractive.  The staffing complement is generous in that there is one teacher for six children with at least one special needs assistant and, if necessary, there can be a special needs assistant per child.  That structure is working well.  That system is the preferred approach of the Department.  It has the advantage of enabling those children to be in a special unit that is attached to a school where their siblings may be and where they are with their peers.  There are qualified teachers who use a range of different methodologies.  We do not accept that any one exclusive intervention is appropriate for all students.  This is something that is supported by the autism task force which recognises the need for a range of resources and approaches to meet the unique needs of children on the autistic spectrum.  We are developing special classes attached to the schools.  It is a priority to encourage more schools to take them on as this structure offers the greatest opportunity for children to have their individuals needs met rather than using one particular type of method.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister has said there is a need for different types of structures but there are parents who believe the ABA structure is best for their children.  In light of that does the Minister plan to give approval to the schools awaiting such approval and to allow this system to grow?  That the Minister referred to the autism task force report is welcome as it is the first time we have heard anything about it for some time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is our intention to extend a system throughout the country which meets the needs of children but it is not our intention to run parallel systems.  Parents of children in mainstream schools also express great satisfaction and particularly parents of children in autistic units.  Obviously we have to ensure the needs of individual children are met.  Teachers are being trained in PECS, TEACCH and ABA.  We have had some good discussions with the autism groups which I met recently.  They are meeting with officials of my Department to see how we can work in conjunction with them, knowing they have the best interests of their children at heart.  I accept it is extremely difficult for parents of children with autism.  This places a considerable amount of individual and personal pressures on them, which is why I am particularly anxious to ensure we can roll out an even greater service than that which is currently available.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="679"/>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Minister is aware that it is very traumatic for parents who have found a system they feel works for their children to feel this system will be pulled from under them.  For example, a parent could be using home tuition grants for ABA.  I realise the Minister has produced a list which is relatively broad and flexible.  However, there are situations where a person may not have the right ABA or picture exchange communication system, PECS, training that fits on the Minister&rsquo;s list.</P>
        <P>Can the Minister tell me if there is any grace or space whereby somebody who has possibly been working with a child for a number of years but needs to be trained can be given the time and space to get whatever the relevant qualification might be?  For those parents, it is very traumatic to think they might have to terminate the thing that is working for them.</P>
        <P>I reiterate Deputy Enright&rsquo;s question about the applications that are already in, which the Minister did not really answer.  An application has been made by the Bluebell ABA school in my constituency, which is carrying out fabulous work but which is in danger of closing if it does not get an answer soon.  The people who have set up these ABA schools using the home tuition grant to fund them need an answer as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The home tuition grant is, after all, an education tuition grant so we feel quite strongly that it is important the people delivering this service are appropriately qualified.  This is why, following consultation with people, it was said to be fairly broad in respect of qualifications.  It would not be possible to start taking on people just because families were used to them, difficult though that may be.  In the best interests of the education of the child, it is important that they have some form of formal training or qualification.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>What if they were willing to do a correspondence course?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not even sure if a correspondence course would be acceptable.  It sets out that it must be an official certificate or diploma course ratified by a university, college or organisation.  A short course or certificate is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>We should remember that the home tuition scheme has been working for many years and people have had no difficulty in getting locally based people who are qualified.  I do not envisage that parents should have any difficulty in respect of it.  It is my aim to ensure the needs of children on the autistic spectrum throughout the country are met as far as possible within the mainstream school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister differentiate between children who are chronically ill and those who are receiving the home tuition grant <Col N="680"/>because they are not able to find suitable school accommodation?  The Educate Together school in Celbridge contains two units which have been lying vacant for the past three years.  This school is in the constituency with the highest pupil-teacher ratio so there is no shortage of children.  When are these units likely to open because they would help parents who are seeking home tuition and I am certain there would be sufficient children to fill that school, which contains 12 very precious places?</P>
        <P>The Minister said parents do not have problems locating teachers, but I hear another side of this story and I am sure other Deputies do as well.  I hear that parents are very concerned about sourcing a teacher.  They do not feel qualified to source a teacher themselves and the Department needs to have a proper database which would provide assistance in doing this.  Does the Minister agree?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister spoke about appropriately and suitable qualified teachers but many parents think the teacher they have is appropriate and suitable.  Does she not accept that this directive may, in turn, put added pressure on these parents?  I accept that it is probably coming from the background.  A Department of Education and Science inspector&rsquo;s report spoke about how 70% of teachers working with children have no autism-specific training.  Does she not accept that this new directive will put far more pressure on parents and that there is concern that children, rather than these teachers, will lose out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the autism units which are attached to mainstream schools, the ratio is six children to one teacher and two special needs assistants.  This is exactly what is on offer to the Educate Together school in Celbridge.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s annoyance as to why a purpose-built unit for children with autism in this school has not been opened, but the fault does not rest with the Department.  It is crucially important that the school opens this facility because the Deputy is right in saying there are children who would be able to benefit from it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past 15 months, I have attended 70 public meetings in various places around the country.  I am appalled, which is not too strong a word, at the complete inability of the Government to deal with the issue of crime on our streets and the fear that is present in so many areas.  People cannot walk the streets of many towns and cities in safety.</P>
        <P>Criminals in this country are now importing the most sophisticated weaponry one could imagine by the tonne.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with his hysterical rantings on an occasional basis, waves another sheet of paper containing another plan.  His last plan was produced in November 2005 and consisted of three pages of detailed measures to be implemented to deal with criminals.  Every time there is a serious issue, another plan is produced.  Every time an innocent person is gunned down, it is a watershed or the sting of a dying wasp and another plan is produced.</P>
        <P>Violent crime has surged over the past three years and the response from Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats in Government has been simply pathetic.  There is no war on crime but there should be a war on crime.  If the Taoiseach will not do it, I will.  We need action now.  In the <Col N="682"/>past 12 months in economically strong Ireland, murder has increased by 43%, gun crime has increased by 39% and rape has increased by<?oasys _jy ?>25%.  Unfortunately, there has never been a better time to be a violent criminal in this country.  The Taoiseach and the absent Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have done nothing but talk about plans, plans and more plans.  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response today in view of the fact that last year, there were 66 homicides, 26 of which were gun-related?  Gun culture in Ireland in 2007 is simply out of hand.  I assume we will get another litany of expenditure in this area when what is needed is action.  Over the past 15 months, we have pointed out serious issues to the Taoiseach which he could have addressed but did not.</P>

        <P>I intend to ask Members who continue to interrupt to leave the House.  It is grossly unfair to Deputy Kenny who submitted a Leaders&rsquo; Question if there are interruptions and then there is not time to reply to the question.

	<P>Deputy Kenny raised two issues.  He outlined figures, which I must correct.  According to the CSO census data and inter-census estimates of population, the crime rate per thousand of population dropped from 26 in 2003 to 24.5 last year.  The figures for 2004 and 2005 were 24.5 and 24.8, respectively.  The comparative crime rate per thousand a decade ago was 27.8.  The figures show a welcome decrease in the high number of burglaries, which is down 14.6%; theft from the person, down 22%; and a decrease of 34% in detection of firearms, which contributed to a reduction of 3.4% in the discharge of firearms.  I am giving the correct figures, as per the CSO.</P>

	<P>Because they are more acceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Last November the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated he would bring forward further legislative proposals because of a number of issues that had arisen relating to bail, sentencing, the right to silence and so on.  The proposals have been in draft form and have been worked out in the Department.  We also said we would prepare legislation on a DNA database.  The House called for such updating.  It has been agreed that fingerprints, like DNA samples, may be retained indefinitely and the Garda will have access to a much larger intelligence source.  Over the past two years there was condemnation that our database was behind other countries and our legislative base was not adequate.  In November when we discussed these issues, questions arose regarding detention periods, particularly the detention period associated with tiger kidnappings.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s proposals are in the criminal justice Bill.  We have introduced a large number of Bills but this legislation will update them and it will be tougher.  As Deputy Kenny said, we are dealing with more sophisticated criminals who are big into drug trafficking, firearms and other gangland activity.  That means, periodically, one must do things that, on civil libertarian grounds, one would not normally do.  The initiatives will toughen up the bail and sentencing provisions and provide for new offences.</P>
        <P>These issues were considered in drafting previous criminal justice legislation but it was considered that a tougher line than was necessary <Col N="684"/>would have resulted.  However, because of the gangland crime last year, we must take that line.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has not done that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I expected Deputy Kenny to welcome these proposals rather than question the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has been travelling around the country.  Cocaine, cannabis, heroin and ecstasy are available in every townland, parish, village and city.  Apparently, if one wants a snort or a shot of these drugs, one will have it within ten or 15 minutes anywhere.  So much for zero tolerance.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach referred to a reduction in burglary figures.  One can break into a house &mdash; many are empty during the day &mdash; and cause &euro;500,000 worth of damage but it is not a burglary unless something is stolen.  The reason burglary figures are down is they are being deliberately massaged.  It is no longer categorised as a burglary if houses are broken into and vandalised but nothing is stolen.</P>
        <P>I refer to three figures from last year &mdash; 33, 595 and 97.  The figure 33 refers to the number of people charged with homicide who were out on bail.  The figure of 595 refers to the number of people charged with assault who were out on bail and 97 refers to the number of people charged with sexual offences who were out on bail.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Every one of them stood in a court and had their applications for bail granted.  What kind of a country is the Taoiseach running?  We proposed in the House on several occasions that judges be given the right, on the advice of a garda and on the basis of Garda evidence, to electronically tag criminals where serious offences are involved.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was out of the blocks within 15 minutes saying this was rubbish and this could not be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 33 people charged with homicide, 595 charged with assault and 97 charged with sexual offences were out on bail last year.  Where is the war on crime we have been promised?  Where is the right of a judge to tag electronically if necessary or the right to earn remission in jail without a quarter of the sentence being completed before the criminal enters prison?  Where is the evidence that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government and his hysterical Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are capable of dealing with criminals?  Criminals are <Col N="685"/>not quaking in their boots.  They laugh at the inability of the Government to deal with this.</P>

It is another issue if the Deputy is asking that everybody who comes before the courts should be locked up and he can implement that.</P>

	<P>I also remind the Deputy of the principle of separation of powers.  All those who came before the courts did not look to me to ask what happened.  It is fair enough to ask me whether we should stiffen our bail laws and that is precisely what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will do in the criminal justice Bill.  These issues were examined previously but the House refused to toughen the bail laws many times because of concerns.</P>

	<P>A senior garda can give his opinion that a bail application should be refused on the grounds that it is his opinion that the person will commit serious offences if granted bail.  The applicant may be required to give a statement of his assets at home and abroad; his income and the sources of his income; his previous criminal record; and any offences committed while on bail.  Applications for serious offences will generally be heard in the Circuit Court rather than the High Court with a right to a full appeal to the High Court.  Many will believe that these proposals are too tough.</P>

	<P>Similar proposals have been examined many times previously and Members have rejected such proposals many times.</P>
        <P>On sentencing, there will be tighter controls to monitor post-release activity and enhanced penal<Col N="686"/>ties will be provided for those who re-offend within seven years of a previous serious offence.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>New offences will be created, which will be aimed at those who assist and facilitate gangland bosses.  It will be a serious offence to have cash or articles without being able to account for them and there will be changes relating to the right to silence.  The law will be updated and clarified and, as a result, a suspect will be in no doubt about the implications of not giving a full account when asked by the Garda.  On detention periods, persons arrested for a serious offence of the type associated with tiger kidnappings may be held for up to seven days, the same as is currently the case for drug trafficking.  I already referred to DNA fingerprints.</P>

	<P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the unimaginable horror that befell a working class community in north Dublin 26 years ago tonight.  As I understand it, the families of the Stardust victims will hold a vigil outside the gates of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann tonight.  This relates to their conviction that a number of legitimate questions remain unanswered about the tragedy that befell their community and about what happened on the night.  I thank the Government for the fact that the exhumation sought by the relatives has happened, although it has taken a very long time.</P>
        <P>Going back over the record of the House when my colleague, Deputy Broughan, raised this issue on so many occasions, I looked at what the <Col N="688"/>Taoiseach said in 2001.  The answers we have been getting since then are exactly the same as the Taoiseach told him in 2001.  This time last year we raised this issue in the belief that the response from the Government would be different on that occasion.  This followed on the preparation of a dossier by lawyers on behalf of the relatives of the victims and a television programme which was a particularly good example of public service broadcasting by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; which looked at the destruction of 48 young lives that night, the subsequent tribunal which found that the forensic protection of the site was inadequate and at the danger the tribunal was misled as to the layout of the premises and, therefore, possibly misled as to the cause of the fire.  The fact of whether the fire was arson or accident was fundamentally material.  The first persons compensated were the owners of the premises concerned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach committed last year, in questions since, and as recently as 14 December 2006 to my colleague, Deputy Broughan, that his response to the relatives after all these years was imminent.  They had expected that response before Christmas.  There has been no response.  I understand there was subsequent contact between the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office and lawyers on behalf of the victims&rsquo; relatives and that, as a result, they understood he was about to forward to them terms of reference for an independent, external examination.  Those terms of reference have not been forthcoming.  I do not know what is the hold-up nor do I know what kind of inquiry is proposed.  Will the Taoiseach indicate what kind of inquiry is proposed?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time is concluded.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is a prominent senior counsel or retired judicial figure going in as I requested to review the papers, the tribunal report and the dossiers submitted on behalf of the relatives and will he have the back-up of the necessary technical expertise to do his job?  Why have replies not been given to the relatives?  What kind of inquiry is the Taoiseach contemplating and when will they be replied to?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have answered questions in the House on this issue a number of times.  In fairness, Deputies Rabbitte and Broughan, and other Members of the House, have raised it with me as well, including Members on my own side.  Tonight is the anniversary of the fire of St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day of 1981 which resulted in 48 deaths and 200 people injured.  It was an overwhelming tragedy which left an enduring mark on the city and a generation and certainly on a considerable <Col N="689"/>number of people in Coolock and surrounding areas.</P>
        <P>I have tried extremely hard in recent years, particularly in the past year, to try to progress this matter which dates back a quarter of a century.  I met the Stardust Victims&rsquo; Committee.  I have had numerous contacts with it over the years through various groupings within the families affected and we discussed their concerns.  There are two main issues.  When I took up this matter last year they were to prepare a report and I was to have meetings with the group prior to the summer.  Because the report was not ready the meeting was postponed to September which was six months later.  I add this fact about when we received the documentation, for the benefit of Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
        <P>The group focused on two issues, namely, the completion of the identification of the five young men interred together at Sutton and, second, they asked that the State would undertake a further inquiry into the cause of the fire.  In close consultation with the bereaved families, we have embarked on a process which I hope will lead to the identification of the five victims following the exhumations last week and the taking of DNA samples from the victims and relatives.  I am confident we will be able to provide identification of their lost members with certainty for the families in the coming months.  This has been a difficult and protracted period.  I thank everybody involved, especially the families, for their patience and assistance in the carrying out of this process.</P>
        <P>In regard to the campaign for a new inquiry into the cause of the fire, we acknowledge the significant achievement of the families with their solicitor, Mr. Greg O&rsquo;Neill, in compiling the report &mdash; Nothing but the Truth.  It was indicated in December to the Stardust Victims&rsquo; Committee that we would be satisfied to arrange for an independent and external examination of the submission by a person with suitable legal experience.  I am not sure when, but this was an issue into which Deputy Rabbitte asked me to inquire in a debate in the House.  Officials of my Department are engaged with the solicitor of the families to bring forward an appropriate procedure and timetable for the work.</P>
        <P>If necessary, I will go into the detail of all that is involved but I do not think it is.  However, if Deputy Rabbitte wishes, I will do so.  The consideration of the submission received from the families will involve a careful examination of the several issues raised with regard to the original inquiry and the significance of certain scientific evidence that has been brought under review.  This examination calls for a specialised and professional judgment.  It is not a policy consideration.</P>
        <P>Let me be clear about my position, I remember the horror of the events of that terrible night.  I met many of the bereaved families on that night and over the years.  I was the administrator in the Mater Hospital on-call that night.  When we met <Col N="690"/>in September, I told them I would support proposals for action that would offer significant prospects for success.  This was the case with regard to the identification procedure for the five young men.  Actions have followed swiftly, a process that is under way and moving to completion.  The potential of a new inquiry was not evident to the same extent but I am satisfied enough to have the matter considered further and to offer support to the families in pursuing it.  This includes helping them through the process of making legal arrangements.</P>
        <P>I am confident that arrangements for the examination will be settled in the coming days.  This will be followed quickly by the appointment of an examiner.  I suggested an eminent person but this person was not satisfactory.  We can reach agreement on this and on terms of reference.  I am conscious of the anniversary of the tragedy and the intention to hold a vigil outside Leinster House tonight to remind us of the loss and the enduring concerns.  I acknowledge that and sympathise with the families.  We extend our deepest sympathies to those who suffered as a result of the Stardust disaster.</P>
        <P>Some 26 years later, I do not wish to publish terms of reference that have not been agreed by the legal representatives.  The terms of reference must concern the issues raised by the families and their interpretation of what happened.  There is no new evidence, just a new interpretation.</P>

I am trying to get agreement so there can be closure.  Otherwise, it will go on forever.

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said that he received the dossier in September.  I have a copy of the letter, dated 6 July 2006, that accompanied the dossier.  While I do not seek to make an issue of it, this dossier was compiled in the first half of the year and submitted on 6 July, but the families still do not have a reply.</P>
        <P>I am trying to tease out what kind of inquiry the Taoiseach envisages.  When will the terms of reference, which have been promised to the lawyers for the group in question but have not materialised, be made available?  I do not wish to create expectations that cannot deliver some comfort to the relatives of the victims.  I do not know the judgment on the dossier submitted.</P>
        <P>However, some of the people concerned believe the Taoiseach has committed in principle to an inquiry.  I am trying to find out what kind of inquiry.  This time last year I suggested appointing a senior judicial person or a senior counsel to review the papers, the tribunal report and the forensic knowledge about fires now available.  That person should have technical international expertise available to him or her in preparing a report for the Minister concerned.</P>
        <P>People will camp out tonight who have suffered for very many years in the belief that they did not receive justice at the time.  What does &ldquo;independent and external investigation&rdquo; mean?  When will the Department deliver the terms of reference of the proposed independent external investigation to the lawyers acting on behalf of the relatives of the 48 young people who lost their lives in this tragedy in 1981?</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>My officials have already suggested an eminent legal person and terms of reference to the families and their representatives.  We seek agreement on both.  The person we suggested has carried out a number of inquiries for the State but the families will not accept that person.  My officials have had the terms of reference <Col N="692"/>ready for some considerable time but will not publish them until discussion with Mr. Greg O&rsquo;Neill, the individual we have been dealing with for the past few years.  A senior official told me he hopes to conclude this shortly.  There is no blame on either side but it is a matter of seeking agreement.</P>
        <P>While the submission was given to me in July, legal representatives were not available until after the summer break.  The submission has received careful consideration.  It raised several matters regarding the original inquiry and the significance of scientific evidence that has been reviewed.  The examination concerns specialised professional judgments on forensic and engineering issues.  A forensic scientist attended the examination.  This is not a policy matter; it is a matter of specialised professional judgment.  For better or for worse, a full tribunal was held on this matter at the time.  I am not in a position to judge but the expert opinion is that there is nothing new in what was presented by the families.  There is a different interpretation of events and specialists are examining it.</P>
        <P>The independent inquiry would, in the first instance, consider the evidence presented by the families and their legal representatives to see if they are correct in their judgments.  If they are, perhaps a full inquiry would be required.  If they are wrong, the original report would stand.  The person who examines the papers would have to be a legal person, either a senior counsel or a retired judge.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="3" />
        <P>The person I recommended is an eminent senior counsel who has done a considerable amount of other examinations and investigations and has much knowledge of the area and the circumstances.  I continue to regard that person as suitable but if that is not the case we will await another consideration and see what comes forward in that examination.</P>
        <P>If the individual who examines these issues wants to look further I have no problem with that.  I am advised that in the first place it should be an examination of the case put forward by the families and their legal representatives on the issues they have raised, as against what was considered at the time in the full inquiry.  If there is another issue to examine I will not rule it out because I do not want anybody to say I ruled everything out.  I am trying to be as open as possible and to find terms of reference that can allow that to happen.  Then we can make real progress in this matter.  I appreciate the fact that the House is endeavouring to convince the people involved that this marks considerable progress on what has happened over 26 years and that it could be concluded calmly.  I understand the hurt involved but if we could deal with it calmly we could tie this down quickly and leave it to take its course.</P>

	<P>Currently many primary school teachers are clearing up after a hectic day trying to teach in overcrowded classrooms.  The Taoiseach may have heard the appalling reports from INTO teachers involved in the large meetings about the number of children in primary school classrooms around the country.  In Wicklow for example, 29% of children in primary schools are in classes of over 30, in Meath the figure is 31%, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire the figure is<?oasys _jy ?>34%, in Kildare it is 34%, in Kilkenny it is 30%, in Louth it is 30% and in my area it is a disgraceful 37%.  The INTO has worked out that involves eight minutes teacher time per day for each junior infant.  The Minister for Education and Science is sitting beside the Taoiseach giving him as many details hopefully as he needs.  He said in the programme for Government five years ago that over the following five years his Government would &ldquo;ensure that the average class size of classes for children under 9 will be below the international best-practice guideline of 20:1&rdquo;.  There is a hell of a difference between 20:1 and over 30:1.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The situation is worse in reality because there are waiting lists in many schools, for example, in my area a parent told me there are 116 on the list to which she was invited to add her child&rsquo;s name, for nine places.  I heard of another list of 180 for 80 places, a list of 100 names for 54 places, and in a secondary school of 400 of a list for 280 places.  Classroom size is part of a much bigger failure by the Government.  As we approach the end of this Government&rsquo;s term in office will the Taoiseach accept the reality that his Government has failed to implement the promise made in the programme for Government and apologise?  Will he leave us to judge the Government on that or will the Government put the money aside to employ the teachers, fund the colleges and erect the new buildings required to meet a basic commitment in the programme for Government?  The measurement included there is not impressive by international standards.  Will the Taoiseach keep his promise?</P>

	<P>Children who need extra help get more support than ever.  Deputy Sargent knows that the majority of the extra teachers hired in recent years have, rightly, been aimed at support for children with special needs, those in disadvantaged areas and those who need help with English.  We could have taken teachers across the board and reduced the pupil teacher ratio but we have employed teachers for those with special needs or in disadvantaged areas to make sure all our children in all our schools have these teachers.</P>

	<P>If we had put the 7,000 teachers into the classrooms that would have caused a significant drop in the pupil teacher ratio.  However, we did not do that but aimed overwhelmingly to help people with special needs and disabilities.  We would not have been able to put the necessary resources into special education, disadvantaged children and language support.  Now that these priorities have been largely addressed extra teachers have been provided in the current year to reduce class sizes and provision is being made for a further 800 primary teachers in the next academic year.  The average class size nationally has been reduced from 27 to 24.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Where there are large class sizes such as the Deputy mentioned it is because a decision has been taken at local level to use <Col N="695"/>the teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes, which I understand.  A school might have one class of 35 and another of 21.  Many schools have opted to do that.</P>

	<P>I still do not have an answer. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I think Deputy Sargent would acknowledge that the building programme, which was very small and is now over &euro;500 million a year, is making a significant improvement with new schools, renovation work and extensions across the country.  He must also acknowledge that the 7,000 extra teachers have made a significant difference to the lives of people with special needs and disabilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a priority for the Green Party but is clearly not one for the Government.  The Government wrote in the programme for Government that it would ensure average class sizes for children under nine would be below 20:1 by the time it left office.  It will not do that.  I suppose that is the best we can hope for in the way of a straight answer.</P>
        <P>Disadvantaged children also suffer.  The Taoiseach cannot hide behind them as a reason for his failure here.  They get one to one attention for half an hour and are then abandoned back into a class.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Education and Science can nod and tut-tut all she likes but Ireland is the only country in Europe where teachers must cope with more than 30 pupils in a classroom.  That is a disgrace when compared with Greece which has an average of 18; Portugal, 16; Latvia, 17; Lithuania, 15, and in impoverished Sri Lanka, where our charities send money, there are only 20 pupils to a class and we regard the people there as needing our help.</P>
        <P>Here, in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s country, the Government has a surplus of over &euro;2 billion.  We have costed the price of an extra 1,000 teachers which would reduce classes to 20 pupils, at &euro;39 million.  That amounts to 20 cent per day per pupil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>If the 4,000 teachers to whom I referred had, since 2002, been placed into mainstream classes, the ratio would have been reduced to 20:1.  The case was well made that disadvantaged children and those with disabilities should be placed in smaller classes.  Many such classes contain 15 or fewer pupils.  Was it right to give people with fewer chances &mdash; namely, those who are disadvantaged, those who have difficulties at home or those with disabilities or learning difficulties &mdash; access to a better ratio than the norm?  The judgment of the Government was that it would be better to place virtually all of the teachers to whom I refer, over a number of years, into classes for disabled and disadvantaged children, thereby reducing the ratio to 12:1, 13:1, 14:1 and 15:1 and leaving that ratio relating to mainstream classes at a higher level.  I make no apologies for doing that.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>When we achieved the target ratio in respect of disadvantaged and special needs teachers and provided thousands of classroom assistants last <Col N="697"/>year, we then decided to put in place 1,200 additional teachers &mdash; 800 in primary schools and 400 in secondary schools &mdash; to reduce class sizes and teach languages.  That was the right way to proceed.  Next year, a further 800 will be appointed to reduce the ratio further.  To do it the other way around would have made the figures look good.  I am sure Deputies would accuse me of massaging the figures.</P>

	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of urgent public concern, namely, that the Government recognise the chaos in the health service and the fact that the HSE has acknowledged that conditions are so bad by stating that it is a testament to staff that no fatalities have resulted to date at the accident and emergency <Col N="700"/>unit in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.

It is over nine years since the acquisition of a site for the rescue service was deemed to be a priority.  Since that time, unfortunately, many lives have been lost in the area and large-scale search and rescue exercises have been undertaken, with no proper changing facilities or a proper base for co-ordinating exercises available to the rescue service.

The lives of all members of the service are constantly put at risk by the inaction of the Ministers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask the Taoiseach three questions.  First, it is a number of months since the Taoiseach made his announcement about holding a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  As I pointed out previously, there is no dispute or difference of political opinion about the zone of absolute defence and the requirement to deal with that.  The other four proposals are, to put it mildly, a cause of discussion.  The Taoiseach will agree that in dealing with matters of the Constitution the public should have a right of proper, thorough and comprehensive consultation.  We have not yet seen the draft terms of reference, nor have we seen any wording.  What is the intention now in respect of that referendum in view of the serious tightness of the programme before the general election?</P>
        <P>Second, I have had a number of reports of the barbaric crime of genital mutilation having been carried out in this city on a number of occasions.  I cannot verify that but human trafficking is not a crime in Ireland.  The Bill is listed for publication, at No. 38 or No. 39, under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Will the Taoiseach give an indication if he is aware of any references to such barbaric practices and if it is intended to publish the Bill sooner to deal with that issue?</P>
        <P>Third, in respect of No. 42 on the list, the Employment Agency Bill, when does the Taoiseach expect that to be published?  The Taoiseach said publication is expected some time in 2007.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>At the Cabinet meeting this morning the Government approved the wording of the amendment we propose to put to the people on the place of children in our Constitution.  We will publish the referendum Bill next week.  The final wording for the amendment follows extensive consultation with the Opposition parties, voluntary organisations that work with children and other interested organisations, faith groups and the Ombudsman for Children.  We will circulate our proposals and if people have comments to put to the Minister they should do so.</P>
        <P>The trafficking Bill will be published in early summer.  The Deputy raised that matter with me previously.  The heads of the Bill are ready.  It is a question of drafting to try to get it moving as soon as possible but it will be published.</P>
        <P>The Employment Agency Bill will be published later this year.  I do not have the exact date but it will be later on in the year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 72:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 20, lines 19 and 20, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;including&rdquo; in line 19 down to and including &ldquo;State&rdquo; in line 20 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;taking particular account of the necessity of holding sufficient stocks within the jurisdiction of the state&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to holding contracts between the agency which will be put on a statutory basis, and another person, by which that person undertakes to hold an agreed volume of oil stocks.  In previous debates on Report Stage, it was argued it was necessary that Ireland should hold above the minimum amount of stocks &mdash; 90 days.  The Minister recently reported stock levels stood at 107 days.  I advocate that Ireland should hold at least 120 days of stocks.</P>
        <P>Another concern is that in a time of an international political emergency, such as at the time of the Iraq invasion, there could be a massive increase in oil prices.  The Minister explained that Ireland has tickets for stocks in Wales and elsewhere.  The question arises then as to how this stock would become available to keep the economy running in times of emergency.  The provision proposed in this amendment would be a useful addition to the Bill.  My previous amendment stated &ldquo;a sufficient internal-external holding ratio so as to ensure there are enough stocks physically held within the jurisdiction of the state if a crisis situation arises.&rdquo;  Amendment No. 72 is to ensure Ireland will have sufficient stocks to keep the economy performing if a political emergency arose.  This is a useful amendment to section 33 and I urge the Minister of State to accept it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment, in respect of which Deputy Broughan makes a valid point.  It is one matter to make available to the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, a variety of locations and sources necessary to meet our supply needs for 90, 100 or 120 days, but it is important that those sources be accessible to the State.  Events over which we have no control, which might be political, environmental, or the result of a disaster at sea, for example, could prevent access to oil stocks by the authorities.  The Bill would be strengthened by a provision that those stocks must be held within the State where they are accessible and can be protected and where there is direct responsibility for them in so far as the institutions of state are concerned.</P>
        <P>In the parlance associated with issues of energy supply, we have all come to know that security of supply is a major factor.  A wide range of issues can affect security of supply.  An outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East or elsewhere or a security threat, for example, might set in motion procedures that make it impossible to access storage facilities.  In such circumstances, it might not be possible for NORA to carry out its functions in ensuring access to the stockpiled fuel supplies necessary to run the utilities of the nation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>At the end of December 2006, Ireland held 113 days of stocks, 75 of which were held within the State.  Subsection (4) of section 33, as agreed on Committee Stage, makes specific provision for circumstances which, in the Minister&rsquo;s view, may warrant a need for specific volumes of particular categories of oil stocks to be held in the State.  Examples of particular categories of stocks include petrol and diesel.</P>
        <P>Taking account of our island status, I am strongly of the view that the powers provided for in section 33(4) are justified and warranted in the event of a possible oil supply disruption.  The text of the Bill as it stands is more specific than the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.  I am not disposed to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I note that the Bill makes provision for particular categories.  However, the internal-external balance could be even higher.  The Minister of State will claim that 75 days is sufficient to meet most short-term emergencies given that if one such emergency developed seriously enough, there would have to be some type of rationing.  However, it might be more helpful to NORA, as it sets out as a statutory body on its particular mission, to have a specific requirement that there be sufficient stocks within the State to meet any emergencies.  Perhaps there might be a rule that 90 days of stocks should be held within the State.</P><Col N="709"/>

	<P>I move amendment No. 73:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 20, line 40, after &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;and in accordance with the terms of the national emergency contingency plan&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to the role of NORA in releasing oil stocks in cases of particular urgency.  Section 35 refers to the Minister&rsquo;s ability, after consulting the agency, to issue directions for the release of stocks to particular sectors and in accordance with basic procedures.  The amendment proposes that this should be done in accordance with the national emergency contingency plan.  If the nation were faced with an external shock, whether from geopolitical difficulties, war or any other emergency, one assumes the national emergency contingency plan would take precedence and the Minister would act in accordance with it in releasing oil stocks.  I am interested in the Minister of State&rsquo;s view on this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision, as drafted, provides for the release of strategic reserves by NORA in emergency situations.  To meet its obligations to the International Energy Agency, IEA, and the EU, for instance, Ireland may be required to release oil reserves to avoid a supply disruption.  A second example would be a local shortage of a specific product.  In the case of NORA, the release of stocks would follow a direction from the Minister.  I am satisfied that the text as it stands adequately provides for the release of stocks in emergency situations.  I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment relates to the functions of NORA in the event of a national or international emergency.  There have been no emergencies in the fuel area since the 1970s, when everybody became an expert on the issue.  The immediate questions at that time were how quickly we could gain access to stocks, how quickly they could be released onto the markets and to what extent they might affect supply at the petrol pumps.  It was only when people were pushing their cars to petrol station forecourts and forming long queues that there was a recognition of the degree to which it is necessary for State institutions to be able to procure and provide the necessary supplies to run the country.</P>
        <P>Some people claim that such provision will happen in the natural order of things.  We discovered in the 1970s that this was not the case.  We learned something of the complexity of oil stocks and markets, and recent experience has reminded us of this.  Prices can be puffed up to <Col N="710"/>suit the market and supplies can rise and fall in accordance with necessity, as perceived by those in the area of investment.  I am concerned about hardship for any group in society but I have a sneaking suspicion that oil magnates are not the most fraught.  They seem to be able, at a blip on the screen, to add another billion or two to their resources.</P>
        <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Broughan is useful.  Something we did not discuss but which is relevant to the issue of supply within the State is the quality of the product.  This is not provided for as it could be, and the Minister should consider that in the context of this amendment.  I have heard complaints from people who claim that the quality of some of the supplies imported into the State is below par.</P>
        <P>In some areas, large scale refitting had to take place to diesel engines.  The supply is coming from Russia.  I raised this question but it was disallowed because the Minister has no responsibility for it.  I am surprised he does not have responsibility because the question of supply is governed by this legislation and NORA will have responsibility for supply in emergency situations and in similar ones.  The quality of that supply will have a serious bearing on the degree to which these provisions will be available for the public&rsquo;s benefit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is merit in that formulation in terms of the national emergency contingency plan.  It is not really clear from the legislation why there is no link between the release of oil stocks in an emergency and, for example, the wider emergency plan which the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and other Departments would have in place if there was a national emergency.  Why is there no reference to the possibility of a national emergency given the vital role of fuel?  If oil stocks were released for whatever reason, would that necessitate a wider review of our oil strategy at that particular time?</P>
        <P>It is not clear from section 35 whether the Minister must consult our EU partners before any emergency stocks are released.  For example, could a situation emerge as in the United States where the President and the Government decided to release some strategic reserves to combat escalating prices and to try to bring stability to the market?  Should those issues have been teased out?  Could the Minister go ahead unilaterally if there was an emergency?  Would he adhere to the overall national emergency plan?</P>

        <P>The Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts 1971 and 1982 were put in place to safeguard the supply and distribution of oil in an emergency.  They provide for significant State intervention in the market in the event of a major oil supply crisis.  Under this legislation, the Government may make an order authorising the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to intervene where the Government is of the opinion that the exigencies of the common good necessitate the regulation or control by the Minister on behalf of the State of the acquisition, supply, distribution or marketing of fuels held by private sector oil companies.</P>
        <P>Once the Government order is made, the Minister is empowered to make an order or orders in respect of certain fuel or fuels.  This means that, in effect, the stocks held by the oil companies in the Whitegate refinery in Cork become part of the totality of the emergency stocks under the Minister&rsquo;s control and direction.  Detailed provisions in the order give the Minister, for example, powers to regulate the sale of individual products so as to prevent hoarding or unnecessary topping up of fuel tanks by setting out minimum and probably maximum sales of particular products, especially petrol.  Other provisions in the legislation include the imposition of demand restraints such as restricted opening hours for filling stations and restrictions on non-essential motoring &mdash; for example, a ban on Sunday driving.</P>
        <P>In regard to Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s question on the EU, as a member of the IEA, Ireland would participate in and benefit from the IEA mechanisms designed to deal solely with physical shortages.  In the first instance, if there was to be disruption in supplies, the IEA has an initial response plan originally developed in the wake of 11 September 2001 to provide for a limited and co-ordinated release of emergency stocks.  If launched, this plan could be rapidly implemented in Ireland by means of joint action involving NORA and the industry.  If the situation were to deteriorate, more intensive activity, stock and-or demand restraint would come into play while a 7% reduction in global oil supplies would trigger, for the first time ever, the implementation of the full panoply of the IEA measures, including the sharing of any available stocks according to an agreed formula.  The theory underlining the IEA approach is that the emergency reserves would be eked out over an extended period to supplement supplies which would be available in the normal course even in emergency situations.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 73<i>a</i>:</P><Col N="712"/>
        <P LI="1">In page 22, to delete line 28 and substitute the following:</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment arises as a consequence of proposed amendments to section 62.  It will provide for consideration by the Minister of applications by oil consumers for exemptions from levy payment on the basis of a contract being in place between an oil consumer and a third party for the storage by the third party of specific volumes of oil owned by the oil consumer.  While it is accepted that oil consumers will generally have adequate storage facilities for volumes of oil to allow them to claim exemption from levy payment on an ongoing basis, nevertheless I acknowledge that storage problems may arise from time to time where, for example, a company must temporarily decommission storage tanks to allow for refurbishment.  The provision will facilitate oil consumers who find themselves in such a situation and will strengthen the Minister&rsquo;s powers in regard to the assessment of applications by oil consumers for exemption from the levy payment.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 22, line 30, before &ldquo;were&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;(within the meaning assigned by<i> section 62</i>)&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The House will be aware that, on Committee Stage, I moved an amendment to provide for the Minister&rsquo;s prior approval for certain stockholding contracts.  Subsequent consultations with the Office of the Attorney General established that the provisions of the sanction, as agreed on Committee Stage, if enacted, would result in unintended commercial restrictions on commercial activities of oil companies and oil consumers beyond the stockholding contracts.  Accordingly, amendment No. 77<i>a</i> proposes that section 62 be amended.</P>
        <P>The amendment will provide that the Minister&rsquo;s approval will be required in the case of contracts between an oil company, an oil consumer and a third party, other than NORA, to hold bilateral oil stocks in Ireland on behalf of another EU member state.  Prior to an oil company entering into such a contract, the company will be <Col N="713"/>statutorily obliged to submit details of the contract proposals to the Minister for approval.  Information to be provided to the Minister on the contract proposals is set out in subsection (5).</P>
        <P>The opportunity has also been taken to include a new provision in subsection (4).  This subsection provides that in regard to stockholding contracts between NORA and an oil company, where the oil company contracts to store oil in the State on NORA&rsquo;s behalf, such stocks may be drawn upon or replenished only by NORA or with the prior consent of NORA.  Amendment No. 75<i>a</i> proposes that an offence provision be created under section 50 in the event of the failure of a party to a NORA stockholding contract to comply with the provisions of section 62.</P>
        <P>As a consequence of the proposed amendments to section 62, amendments to section 38 are proposed as follows.  Amendment No. 73<i>b</i> defines contract proposals required under section 38 as having the meaning assigned by section 62.  Amendment No. 73 proposes to remove the obligation imposed on the Minister in section 38(2)(<i>b</i>), as agreed on Committee Stage, to approve oil storage contract proposals between companies.  It is not appropriate that the Minister should be involved in the approval of commercial contracts between private companies.  I am satisfied these amendments will strengthen and improve the Bill and will provide Ireland with a better structure in the future in terms of ensuring robust security of national strategic stocks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State did not respond to my last question on this matter so perhaps he might do so in the context of these amendments.  I wish to raise the issue of quality control.  During consideration of the amendments on Committee Stage, I was not aware of certain matters which have been subsequently brought to my attention, such as the alleged poor quality of some of the oil supplies.  A great deal of emphasis has been placed on the need to ensure an accessible supply is retained and this amendment attempts to enhance the security of that supply.  Will the Minister of State comment on the quality of the supply?  If the quality is not adequate it does not make sense to have it.  The necessary supply will not be maintained because it will be of inferior quality.  To preserve the objective of the Bill and ensure that NORA can do its job the Minister should consider to what extent he or his Department can control the quality, as it is imperative that we can.  It is an important issue and I do not know whether, in today&rsquo;s avaricious world, people are aware of the need to ensure quality is of the highest standard.  However, quality and quantity are of equal importance in this case and I suggest the Minister clarifies the issue with regard to stocks held in this country, which is the subject of a forthcoming amendment in Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s name.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="714"/>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment fundamentally amends section 62 to clarify the position relating to the possibility of a person incurring a levy.  It puts in place a wide-ranging mechanism for ministerial approval of contracts where one of the parties arranges to hold certain supplies.  The new section refers to identified oil but is that simply oil for which there have been returns?  Should &ldquo;identified oil&rdquo; have been included in the definitions at the top of the Bill?  The Minister of State also referred to a specific amount of non-identified oil.  Does that mean there might be oil in the market for which the Department did not have returns?  Is the reference to 75 days of indigenous oil stocks held in the country all-embracing?  Could there be stocks of which we are not aware?  How does the Minister define identified and non-identified oil?  </P>
        <P>As I said at the start of the debate, one of the weaknesses of the Bill is the fact that we are establishing NORA on a statutory basis but have very little power over the oil market.  We are price takers and victims of the big companies, as in the famous case of the petrol station on the Dublin quays where it costs &euro;1.36 or &euro;1.38 per litre.  A mile away on the north side it costs &euro;1 per litre.  CER has no control over such matters, although the Competition Authority has recently sought to bring people to justice for arranging cartels, among other things.  Given that we do not appear to have much control over this area, does this amendment begin to give us the resources to get a full picture of the oil market?</P>
        <P>Deputy Durkan and I were present at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources when the head of the Competition Authority complained about the lack of competition in broadcasting.  This was the head of an organisation which had failed to invigilate the Topaz takeover of Statoil in Ireland by missing a deadline, an incredible error for a State agency.</P>
        <P>This is an area in which we need much more State invigilation but in which the Minister has been fearful of treading, or at any rate treads gingerly.  Oil is just another energy source.  We all believe it is a depleting source and that it will run out at some stage, whether it be in five or 25 years&rsquo; time.  Accordingly, it must be managed very carefully.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State introduced this amendment at the 11th hour.  I feel, and I am sure the other Opposition parties &mdash; the Labour Party, Fine Gael, the Green Party and Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash; will agree that it is very difficult to respond to an amendment we only received a day or two ago.  Most of us thought we had completed Report Stage and we had forgotten that a few amendments remained, including one very important amendment which has not yet been dealt with.  Can the Minister of State say whether the distinc<Col N="715"/>tion between identified and non-identified will stand the test of time?</P>

	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s function is to approve stockholding contracts.  The object of the amendment agreed on Committee Stage was to strengthen the Department&rsquo;s position with regard to the approval of stockholding contracts.  Subsequent consultations with the Office of the Attorney General established that the provisions of the section, as agreed on Committee Stage, would result in unintended restrictions on the commercial activities of oil companies and oil consumers, resulting in oil companies and consumers being obliged to submit to the Minister for approval details of commercial contract proposals that fell outside the stockholding contracts.  Accordingly, on the advice of the Attorney General, the section has been amended to restrict the Minister&rsquo;s powers to approve stockholding contracts relating to the holding of bilateral oil stocks in Ireland on behalf of another EU member state.   </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am somewhat alarmed by the Minister of State&rsquo;s statement to the effect that it was not NORA&rsquo;s role to control quality.  We might wake up one morning in the future and find ourselves in a serious situation, with 2 million litres of poor quality material which cannot be disposed of and will be of no benefit to anybody.  The Minister should consider introducing regulations or statutory instruments to deal with such a situation.  If he does not, the purpose of the Bill will be undermined.  Without it, the lowest common denominator will apply and, if one supplier gets away with supplying poor quality fuel from the reserve, they all will.  We could have followed the Minister of State and waited to submit more amendments on Report Stage but it does not work that way.

      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>If a person agreed that PPPs are always a good thing, he would find little fault with this Bill.  My problem is that some PPPs have been the equivalent of a winning lottery ticket for certain private interests.  The M50 is an example of how public private partnerships do not always work in the best interests of the public.  It is important to have a means to scrutinise and micromanage projects carried out under the PPP system but this double wraps the projects and ensures they remain protected from the scrutiny I would like to see.</P>
        <P Just="Left">PPP sounds like a good idea until we look at projects such as the M4 toll road to Kilcock, which cost substantially more to build than the section of the motorway that was not built under the PPP system.  Not only was it more expensive, but the location chosen had maximum impact on the daily commuter.</P><Col N="717"/>
        <P>During the planning stages, many of these projects go through local authorities.  I was a member of Kildare County Council when the M4 was being planned and when we asked about tolls, we were told the council had no function in the area.  When I raised the matter with the Minister for Transport, I was told it was a matter for the National Roads Authority.  These projects are always one step away from accountability.</P>
        <P>The selection of projects is a concern.  The M50 project was not scrutinised.  There are still some who say the operators of the toll bridge took a massive risk but the three largest population centres in west Dublin had been planned years earlier in the Myles Wright plan so there would always be a substantial number using this road.  It has become a distributor road for people travelling to different parts of the city instead of a national primary route.  How can we ensure that is not repeated?  We are pushing projects further away from scrutiny.</P>
        <P>The only locations where tolls are considered are in the commuter belt.  Those who pay tolls on the M50 twice a day, five days a week for 50 weeks a year must pay &euro;950, often substantially more than the cost of motor tax and insurance combined.  Public private partnership projects cherry-pick, with only routes that will produce a major return being selected.  It is just like knowing the winning lottery numbers before the draw takes place.</P>
        <P>The M4 is tolled to Kilcock, then the road is constructed from Kilcock to Galway using taxpayers&rsquo; money, then in Galway it is tolled again by a private operator.  This is not an equitable way to raise money to finance a road.  The sections that were subject to public private partnership were substantially more expensive to build.  I cannot see how the person subject to tolls gets value for money under this system.  There is no equity in the PPP system as it has been applied so far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill before us indicates the extent to which the Government believes the debate on public private partnerships has finished and that it has become an acceptable method of financing public infrastructural projects.  We have never had an adequate debate on why it is happening.  Experience has shown that it is a flawed funding mechanism.  Many projects have gone over budget and cost more than they would have through conventional funding and delivery means.</P>
        <P>The strongest argument in favour of PPPs is that on the surface in most cases they seem to provide the infrastructure more quickly.  However, it could be that our systems for deciding on public infrastructural projects are flawed and need to be reviewed.  The Green Party has always argued for caution in the use of PPPs.  They have become very much the fashion as a means of subverting proper accountability of public moneys in that they can be treated as cur<Col N="718"/>rent expenditure rather than capital expenditure taken over a significant time period.  The ability of the political system to ask questions properly as to how public money is accounted for is severely compromised.  On these grounds we need a wider debate on what PPPs are, why we are making so much use of them and why insufficient questions are asked about why they seem to fail in terms of cost to the public purse and the infrastructure they are meant to deliver.</P>
        <P>This argument does not seem to ring true with the Government.  While the rate of increase in their use does not seem as great as it was under the previous Minister for Finance, a significant amount of money is allocated in this way in the Government&rsquo;s development plan.  I am slow to call it a national development plan, as I do not see the extent to which the nation has been involved in creating it and will benefit from it ultimately.  Many elements of the plan need to be revisited.  Approximately &euro;16 billion of the &euro;184 billion is designated to come from private sector finance sources, which is close to 10% of the total package.  The people should be aware that the Government has embarked on somewhat of a gamble in asking that significant public infrastructure should be provided in this way.</P>
        <P>We have seen various failures in PPPs, including cost overruns in several roads projects.  A significant portion of the overspend that went from &euro;5.8 billion to &euro;18 billion in the national roads programme in the previous national development plan can be attributed to PPPs.  What had been seen as solely public social service provision is now increasingly proposed to be provided through the PPP mechanism, including the group school projects and the use of public land for private hospitals.  It is society&rsquo;s loss that we are increasingly going down this road.</P>
        <P>Some people are starting to ask questions.  It may be that we have insufficient experience of using this mechanism to know what its real effects are.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has already carried out several value for money reports on specific PPPs, including the group schools project.  Several chapters of his annual report outline some of the more obvious effects.  One chapter several years ago referred to the difficulties arising in my constituency regarding a long-awaited facility, the Cork School of Music, which thankfully is approaching completion and will be opened in the near future.  After an analysis by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the end-use cost to the taxpayer after a 25-year contract, will be &euro;200 million.  That figure has astounded many.  Many of us believe the same facility could have been provided at a cheaper cost and certainly with quicker delivery except for the difficulties that arose with that project.  The history of that project was informed by the insolvency of the original contracting company, Jarvis, a company that has made its living on the back of what are referred to as PFI projects in the United Kingdom.  It has had a very poor record of <Col N="719"/>delivering such projects on behalf of the British Government and yet was the chosen contractor for the group schools project and the Cork School of Music project.  I have yet to see evidence that those lessons have been fully learnt to date.</P>
        <P>In other areas the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General shows that PPPs cost more than conventional financing of these projects.  A question of political accountability arises when public money could be better spent if the resource was better directed and targeted.  On the surface the Bill before us tries to introduce some form of regulation and control where none exists at the moment.  However, it does so in a way that recognises the permanence of PPPs as a funding mechanism, which is to be regretted.  The National Development Finance Agency and its parent organisation, the National Treasury Management Agency have both done good work in ensuring that the country pays back as little as possible of its external debt and the management of public finances are carried out to extremely high standards by both agencies.  This could be done more effectively if we had more public public partnerships and fewer public private partnerships.  The Bill does not address that issue.</P>
        <P>There are ways in which State agencies can combine together.  The remit of the National Treasury Management Agency permits the use of the National Pensions Reserve Fund in providing funding for public infrastructure projects, but the Government has never taken this route.  Why do we need to approach the private sector for funding infrastructure projects, when we have a pension fund available to provide finance and get a return on it having provided the infrastructure?  While this course seems logical, logic seems to defeat the Government.  I suspect the Minister inherited the policy from his predecessor.  However, if he feels there are difficulties with public private partnerships he should have had the courage of his convictions in challenging their continued use and not just slowed down the rate of increase in their use but defined a timeframe for their elimination.</P>
        <P>The Committee of Public Accounts, of which Deputy Fleming and I are members, has asked questions about accountability in the use of public money by private sector companies in public private partnerships.  The Bill might go some way to introduce State control.  However, for the sake of wider accountability we need to have as much information as possible available to the public so that when projects go wrong they can be seen to be addressed in the right public forum.  The Committee of Public Accounts has addressed these concerns to the Department of Finance and as yet the Department is not willing to accept the need to introduce new mechanisms.  As a result the committee has drafted a report on which I am <i>rapporteur</i>.  The committee will review it in coming weeks and I hope it will be published with the committee&rsquo;s agreement.  In other areas <Col N="720"/>where PPPs, PFI projects or PFPs &mdash; as they tend to be called in other countries &mdash; are used, they are accompanied by a more detailed state system of accountability.  Examples in the UK, Australia and Canada show that our system of accountability for PPPs is lacking.  Notwithstanding the ability of the National Development Finance Agency, accountability as provided for in the Bill is still deficient.</P>
        <P>I have already made the substantive point on my feelings on PPPs and whether this Bill sufficiently addresses their regulatory control.  However, the fact that shadow directors have been appointed prior to a Bill being discussed and voted on in this House is a practice that happens far too frequently.  The whole area of public appointments is discredited as a result.  I appeal to the Government not to treat the House with such disrespect, even though the individuals involved have ability and will do a good job.  One of the more disappointing aspects is the assumption that something will happen before it is provided for.  That is not something that should accompany any legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in will oppose this legislation which places the centre of expertise for public private partnership procurement, already established in the National Development Finance Agency, on a statutory footing and which seeks to improve the capacity of Departments or agencies to undertake public private partnerships.  Sinn F&eacute;in is fundamentally opposed to the use of PPP, which has an atrocious track record to date.  We therefore cannot support any legislation which is designed to promote its increased use.</P>
        <P>It is surprising that the Government is pressing ahead at this time with the increased use of PPP despite the problems associated with this method of financing public infrastructure and the complex process of procurement referred to by the Minister in his contribution on Second Stage in the Seanad.  For example, the use of PPPs is recognised as a key factor in delaying the roll out of the cancer strategy.  It is accepted that the aim of the Minister for Health and Children to improve radiotherapy services throughout the State by 2011 by way of public private partnership cannot be met.  It has emerged that a HSE board meeting was told in December that the plan would not be in place until 2013 or 2014 if delivered by PPP.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A progress report on the delivery of the State plan for radiation oncology sent by the Health Service Executive to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, in July 2006 stated that even the Minister&rsquo;s plans to make interim improvements to radiotherapy services by 2008 could not happen by way of PPP until 2012.  It advised that interim improvements could be made by 2009 if radiotherapy machines were provided outside the PPP model.  The Minister had to accept this and two extra radiotherapy machines for St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals <Col N="721"/>in Dublin are being sourced at a cost of &euro;45 million.</P>
        <P>Is the Government blind to the fundamental faults of PPPs, to international experience and to our own experience to date?  While the Government has sought to stress that lessons have been learnt and improvements have been incorporated into the PPP procurement process, there is little evidence of this.  Those who have examined the PPP process have found that the economic case for PPP is highly questionable.  This makes sense when one considers that private finance is more expensive than Government debt.</P>
        <P>There is a considerable body of international evidence that demonstrates the difficulties in executing successful procurement under PPP.  Experts such as Dr. Eoin Reeves, director of privatisation and PPP research group at the University of Limerick, has noted, &ldquo;It is quite astonishing that the PPP programme is expanding so rapidly given that the experience with PPP in Ireland has been either unfavourable or untested.&rdquo;  Dr. Reeves went on to advise, correctly in Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s view, &ldquo;Given the widespread concern about poor value for money from Government expenditure, the Government would be well advised to conduct rigorous ex post analysis of other PPP projects before committing to what is still an unproven model of procurement.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Notorious examples of PPPs include the case of the Cork School of Music and the grouped schools project.  In 2004 the Comptroller and Auditor General published a value for money report into the use of public private partnership for the construction of five second level schools and for the maintenance and running of the school buildings over a 25-year contract period.  That report raised concerns in regard to the ultimate costs of those PPPs to the State and suggested that the costs and benefits of adopting the PPP approach should be assessed relative to the performance of a comparable group of schools procured conventionally.  It estimated that the projected cost of the PPP deal was 8% to 13% higher than the projected cost of procuring and running the schools using the conventional approach.  The Government is telling us that education is one of the main areas where the State will use PPPs in the future.  Given the experience to date of PPPs for schools, this is totally unacceptable.</P>
        <P>It has been stated by the Minister for Education and Science that one of the advantages of the PPP model is that payment for schools would be phased over the contract period, approximately 25 years.  What this actually means is that PPP is more attractive to Government because it has a lesser impact on annual Exchequer balances compared to conventional procurement where the bulk of the capital investment is accounted for in one year.  Let us make no mistake about it &mdash; PPPs are being adopted because they are useful in terms of the optics of the public finances. <Col N="722"/> The Government is taking a short-term view, primarily for its own selfish electoral reasons, that ignores the fact that the assets and services must still be paid for.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in was particularly disappointed that the recently published national development plan proposed to continue and expand the use of the discredited system of PPPs.  This is despite the fact that the ESRI mid-term review of the previous National Development Plan 2000-2006 stated that public private partnerships should only be used where they bring efficiency gains.  They are likely to be an expensive means of financing new investment.  Yet under the new plan 39% of the spending on public transport is to be by way of public private partnerships.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has called for the Comptroller and Auditor General to take a comprehensive look at the use of PPPs across all Departments.  I reiterate that demand.  In 2004 the Comptroller and Auditor General published a value for money report into the use of public private partnerships for the construction of five second level schools and for the maintenance and running of the school buildings over a 25-year contract period.  That report raised many concerns in regard to the ultimate costs of those PPPs to the State and suggested that the costs and benefits of adopting the PPP approach should be assessed relative to the performance of a comparable group of schools procured conventionally.  There is<b> </b>a need before the Government takes us any further down the PPP road to carry out a thorough evaluation of the true costs to the State of the range of PPPs embarked upon to date.  From the experience in other states there is every reason to suspect that PPPs will prove the biggest misuse and waste of public money.</P>
        <P>The Government has argued that the PPP approach can provide value for money and the timely delivery of infrastructure.  That is the opposite of our experience to date.  Projects have ended up more expensive and have not been completed within the envisaged timeframes.  PPPs are never the optimal means of financing public capital investment projects within the State sector.  It is time to call a halt to this madness.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in will oppose this legislation.  It is not in the public interest.  It is a case of knowing the cost of everything but the value of nothing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the National Development Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill 2006 because it will have immediate and practical benefits for many projects around schools, especially some in my home town of Portlaoise.  I look forward to the enactment of the legislation as quickly as possible. </P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish a centre of excellence in the National Development Finance Agency.  It is important to recognise that the National Development Finance Agency has the function of advising Departments and agencies <Col N="723"/>on all major capital investment projects over &euro;20 million.  The centre of excellence has the specific function of advising on the procurement of public private partnership projects.  Section 3 will enable the National Development Finance Agency to carry out two new functions: to enter into public private partnerships with a view to transferring the rights and obligations under any such arrangement to any State authority, and to act as an agent for any State authority in entering into a public private partnership arrangement.  It is expected and envisaged that in most cases, the National Development Finance Agency will act as an agent for the State authority.  In reality, we all expect it to happen this way.  Line Departments, such as the Departments of Education and Science or Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will have particular projects and when they bring them to a particular point, they will be handed over the National Development Finance Agency for onward procurement through the PPP process.</P>
        <P>Section 6 of this Bill deals with the appointment of three additional board members to the board of the National Development Finance Agency, which is very important given the increase in activity as a result of the additional PPP projects and other activities in the agency.</P>
        <P>I am also pleased to see that under section 8 of the Bill, there is provision to allow the National Development Finance Agency to disclose confidential information to the appropriate Minister, as well as the Minister for Finance.  This is important because since the agency is effectively part of the overall National Treasury Management Agency, there has been a tendency for the reporting structure to go directly to the Minister for Finance.  As we are now entering these new PPP projects, the National Development Finance Agency will effectively be acting as an agent in respect of several Departments and it is important the relevant and appropriate Minister receives information from the agency in respect of confidential commercial matters such that he or she can be fully informed and satisfied as well as the Minister for Finance, who, obviously, has an overarching role in respect of this issue.</P>
        <P>So far, it has been mentioned that there has not been sufficient debate on the role of PPPs and the reason we are introducing legislation to deal with this matter.  I genuinely believe people are getting hung up on issues that are not very important.  We should take a pragmatic view on all these matters.  I have no problem with a project being delivered by the public or private sector or by a combination of both once the project is delivered effectively and efficiently and carries out the function it was meant to achieve on behalf of the people in an efficient manner.</P>
        <P>There are people who wish to have endless ideological debates on which bank the Government has dealings with.  People should bear in mind that Governments must borrow from year <Col N="724"/>to year to finance their capital expenditure on many occasions, especially if they are not operating with a major surplus.  They go on the international market to borrow money.  We do this through the National Treasury Management Agency.  Governments borrow money from international banks and institutions so, in many cases, the private sector is advancing loans and finance directly to the Government which then commits money to the capital projects about which we are talking.  Therefore, it is no great shakes for the project itself to borrow directly from these large international financial institutions and, in some cases, bypass the middle man in terms of going into the Exchequer, coming through the Vote through the House and the same money being wheeled out to pay for the project in the first place.  It was never envisaged that PPPs would be a massive portion of our activity.  It is envisaged that they will encompass a small percentage of expenditure under the national development plan.</P>
        <P>So far, there has been considerable debate here on schools constructed under the PPP scheme.  I am pleased that some time ago, the Government prioritised a number of areas for expenditure under the PPP projects and the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform were among the Departments highlighted.  A total of 21 projects were approved by the Department of Education and Science as being suitable for the PPP approach to public procurement.  I am very pleased that of the first bundle of those projects, four are in my constituency.  There are two new schools in Portlaoise, both secondary schools on Borris Road catering for boys and girls, respectively, and two schools in Offaly.  They went to tender on 30 September 2006.  I watched the project intimately and closely.  I examined how it integrated with the local authority, planning and schools; the planning of the project; how it deals with the Department at local level; and, in particular, how it is operated at national level.  I had discussions, particularly in respect of those projects, throughout last year to ensure they met their deadlines with everybody from local to national level.</P>
        <P>The essence of the project was to transfer the risk from the public sector to the private sector.  This was achieved, as it is in most of these situations, in that outline planning permission was obtained by the line Department in the first instance so that when the project goes to tender under the PPP scheme, there is certainty that it will qualify for planning permission.  If the people who were tendering could not be sure of obtaining planning permission for the project, they certainly could not build it and would face enormous risk.</P>
        <P>I will explain to the House how these contracts work because they are some of the first projects under the new PPP arrangement out of the traps.  I am sure the legislation will be enacted and by the time the contracts come to be finalised and <Col N="725"/>contractors appointed, it will all be under this new legislation.  The tender is for final design so the successful tender must then submit a final application for full planning permission on the basis of the outline planning permission already granted.  I have seen how the State can be very intelligent in minimising the risk to itself and exposure and making the contract more straightforward and certain for the people who are tendering for it.</P>
        <P>In respect of the particular case to which I referred, these types of problems happen everywhere.  It will happen in respect of the new prison at Thornton Hall and these schools.  There will be issues directly affecting the project in terms of the delivery of services, water and other public services and amenities to service a particular project.  There might be boundary issues in respect of Portlaoise, or roads issues.  The Department has cleverly taken all aspects of the project outside the site boundary out of the contract and if there is any difficulty in terms of access, roads or services from the local authority to the site, the Department will pay for that separately and directly in the normal manner that it would have always used and the PPP contract will only deal with that element within the site boundary that will be within the control of the contractor once he or she gets the job.</P>
        <P>I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and was surprised to hear such misquoting of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s value for money report on the five school projects to date.  Everyone said they were excessively expensive, which I do not think is a full and fair assessment of the report.  The Committee of Public Accounts issued a report on the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s value for money report.  It felt that some of the report did not give a fair overall view of everything involved in those five school projects.</P>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report was generally positive.  He stated that he believed the cost was higher by 7% or 8% than the cost of using a traditional method.  There is a major caveat here which I will revisit.  The project provided for a larger school than would have been provided under the traditional method.  The corridors and circulating and recreation areas for people to move about within the school were 15% higher than the normal Department specification so those five schools have got better projects and school buildings than would have been the case traditionally.</P>
        <P>It is important that we objectively examine the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Some Members of this House quote him as though he was infallible.  However, he knows he is not infallible and so do we and he is happy when we have constructive comments to make.  One thing he ignored in his report and which must be a factor is that these schools were delivered earlier than they would otherwise have been.  There was an educational advantage to all the <Col N="726"/>students in the schools because they occupied the new schools earlier than they would otherwise have done.  It is almost impossible to put a cost-benefit analysis on that type of issue, but it is a relevant factor to be taken into account when one is comparing the PPP project to the traditional, slightly slower method.  No attempt was made to examine that aspect of it.</P>
        <P>Another matter ignored by the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report was that one has a contractor who will be responsible for the final design, build and operation of the school.  These are what I call practical school issues, rather than pure book-keeping and accounting issues.  The operator will be responsible if the electricity goes, if there is a leak, if a door is broken or if the padlock on the shed is broken and the company will, therefore, be responsible for the maintenance and operation of the school.  This issue was ignored by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  However, this would free up the school principal to do what he or she should do, that is, look after the educational needs of his or her students.  All principals spend much of their time overseeing minor Mickey Mouse maintenance issues such as broken windows, leaks, heating breakdowns and so on.  The five proposed PPP school projects offer major advantages whereby the principal will be freed from such duties and this has been ignored by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Those factors must be taken into account and not only the cost inputs.</P>
        <P>Above all, the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted this was a contract for the operation and maintenance of the school over 25 years.  It is clear the cost of the whole life project of a school is not available in the Department of Education and Science so a comparison can be made between the cost of a PPP and the cost of maintaining a traditional school over 25 years.  That is not a criticism of the Department because it could not been expected 25 years ago to anticipate the need to compile annual maintenance costs on a school by school basis.  When the Comptroller and Auditor General attempted to compare the whole life costs of a PPP project with a school built under the traditional model, the costs were not accurately available within the Department for understandable reasons.  One of his key findings is it is not possible to give an absolute, accurate assessment of the costs under the two models because of the gap in the information.  People conveniently forget this when they debate this issue.</P>
        <P>I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and we believe there is a lack of transparency because of commercial sensitivities and, ultimately, there is a lack of accountability to the House regarding commercial contracts.  The committee, which never divides on a party political basis, has suggested an all-party committee should have access to all the necessary confidential information.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and relevant Ministers are entitled to <Col N="727"/>this information and perhaps the Committee of Public Accounts could report to the House that it has examined the matter<i> in camera</i>, without disclosing confidential information.  At least then the public would be satisfied that 12 Members examined the commercially sensitive aspects of a project and reached a conclusion.  A mechanism could be developed whereby that could happen without breaching commercial sensitives.  This would generate confidence and address the criticism regarding the vacuum in information.</P>
        <P>A number of myths are associated with PPPs.  The strangest aspect of the debate is that one would almost think PPPs are being invented under this legislation.  However, they have been in existence for as long as I can remember.  Local authorities and Government agencies have availed of such projects on the ground for years.  However, they are being formalised in legislation and perhaps it is necessary because of our commitments to the EU and EUROSTAT to adopt a formal legal approach regarding such projects.  For example, the Midlands Prison in Portlaoise in my constituency was an extensive project commissioned in 1997.  It was designed and built by the successful contractor, Henry O&rsquo;Rourke, and financed by Barclays Banks, which still owns it.  The prison is built on State land but the Government will lease it for the remaining 25 years.  That was a PPP in every respect.  In addition, the Department of Agriculture and Food&rsquo;s office in Portlaoise were leased by a major company to the Government for a number of years but the Government felt it opportune five or six years ago to buy out the lease and the building is fully in State ownership.  Throughout Dublin and every other county, there are several examples of the public and private sectors working together successfully on major projects.  While such projects did not have the fancy title, they were more or less PPPs in practice.  We are giving them their official title, yet some people think they are only coming into being.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed PPPs have not been implemented more speedily in recent years.  Reference has been made to the Cork School of Music, which will cost &euro;200 million, but that amount relates to maintenance and operation over 25 years.  While that is much higher than the original estimate, a number of Members are comparing both figures and saying the ultimate cost is expensive.  That is not necessarily the case.  The tragedy is figures are not available to verify either side of the argument but the conclusions drawn by certain Members cannot be drawn.  One of the reasons the project was held up at EUROSTAT level was its query on how to account for the debt-GDP ratio in the context of the ongoing costs given the State would enter into a financial commitment from day one for expenditure over 25 years, notwithstanding that the liabilities would not mature over the period.  Nevertheless, <Col N="728"/>a legal contractual arrangement will be in place from the outset.</P>
        <P>Generally, the NDFA and the National Treasury Management Agency should be used more.  This legislation is important but I ask the Minister to enhance the role of both agencies to deal with complex commercial contracts in which many Departments and agencies are involved.  The job of the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children, and Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to deliver the services required of them.  It is not the function of their senior personnel to be engaged in commercial contracts.  Major capital projects only come before a Department on an intermittent basis and, therefore, a cadre of experienced people who have been through the process is not built up.  When such projects are negotiated at departmental level, the Department of Finance will stand off from the negotiations, having issued guidelines and provided funding under the relevant Vote.  That is not the best way for the State to ultimately ensure value for money.  Expertise in PPPs should be developed through the NDFA because the public sector needs to deploy staff in one agency who can match the expertise of those they negotiate with from the private sector.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation and I hope it is passed quickly.  When it is enacted, the school projects in Portlaoise and County Offaly will be among the first to be undertaken.  They are at a tender stage and I look forward to the NDFA signing the contracts on behalf of the Department of Education and Science soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I concur with much of Deputy Fleming&rsquo;s contribution and I do not share the view of many ordinary people who think that because PPP projects are not as transparent as they might be for many reasons, they could not be right.  However, they have a role.  I sat on the Committee of Public Accounts for years and we discussed this issue at great length on several occasions.  It is a major flaw there is not more transparency.  This House should have more of an overview of how an aspect of State funding is employed.  I am fully aware of the commercial sensitivities involved.  Many people in the private sector said they would not be interested in becoming involved in a project if their private business were put up in neon lights.  That is not good enough.  The Minister for Finance will be the first to appreciate the only reason for the private sector to become involved in public private partnerships is that there is money in it for them and it makes good commercial sense for them.  The private sector is not composed of organisations like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The good news for the State is that it also benefits.</P>
        <P>Individuals deeply involved in such matters have outlined to me examples of when the State did not come out well.  What happened to the <Col N="729"/>NRA, especially in the early years, may relate to uneven competition between the best brains available on the private side with the highest possible level of expertise.  They were dealing with people who were very well intentioned and had every reason to want to make a good deal on behalf of the State but they did not have the expertise.  For that reason I commend the Minister, Deputy Cowen, on the Bill.</P>
        <P>Everyone understands the role of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  Members on all sides of the House acknowledge it handled its remit extremely well.  I was impressed with how the agency conducted itself in the Committee of Public Accounts and with what it proposes to do.  The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, is under the aegis of the NTMA.  I would like to think the expertise involved in the NDFA would be at a similar level to that provided by the parent body, and that it would be able to draw on all available experience and expertise.  When dealing in billions of euros it is important for partner organisations to work together on an equal basis because this business is so competitive.  The expertise available to this group suggests we are unlikely to see anything untoward happening in the future.  I do not cast aspersions on anybody but the expertise may not have been available previously.</P>
        <P>Having read the proposed legislation I am unclear as to the role of the Minister for Finance.  Some people hold the view that the further one keeps the Department of Finance from a project the quicker and better it will be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Heresy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not subscribe to that view.  Although it is not explicit in the Bill, the provision of an over-arching role to the Minister for Finance of the day would benefit the democratic process.</P>
        <P>An economy that is going as well as ours and for so many years has many positive aspects.  However, other aspects have not keep abreast of play.  Numerous references have been made to the inability to provide an adequate road network.  We all call to mind projects with which we are familiar.  I was convinced the N6 would arrive in Galway city in 2006 but it will not be operational until 2010.  Many other inter-urban road projects are gaining momentum but they will not be finished for up to six years after the completion dates envisaged in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
        <P>Only two or three ways exist to tackle large scale public projects.  When one considers the current state of the economy and the credit rating we possess on international financial markets, one could suggest access to private funding was more important in the past than it is currently.  On the other hand, if a partnership arrangement means a project can be completed faster and with greater efficiency and at better value than could <Col N="730"/>be provided by the State then that is the best option.  That is the nub of this debate.  Regardless of the chosen method, we must provide for the infrastructural projects that are required to improve competitiveness, enhance job creation and provide the social fabric that will enhance each individual&rsquo;s lifestyle.</P>
        <P>In so far as PPPs are concerned, the model available has not worked well on several occasions.  Design, build and operate projects are first cousins to PPPs.  I accept they are best suited to smaller projects but in terms of a county&rsquo;s expenditure the projects in question are considerable in nature.  Some projects have finished up in a mess and offered poor value for money because it took so long for them to be completed.  I refer, for example, to a sewerage project in Galway.  It was decided to amalgamate the villages of Kilkerrin, Dunmore and Leenane in Connemara for a design, build and operate sewerage project.  The money was made available in 2000 and the service pipes were laid in the ground in 2006.  Something has gone wrong with the contract to dig the treatment plants in each village and they have yet to go out to tender.  We can rest assured that whatever amount of money was earmarked for those projects in 2000, by the time they are completed in another year or two, sewerage schemes could have been provided to two other villages in County Galway for the difference between the contract price in 2000 and what will be the eventual price.  I hope the Bill will ensure the necessary expertise is made available.  That will be a great step forward.</P>
        <P>I wish to examine other aspects of the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Olivia Mitchell, Connaughton and Hayes.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Our current use of energy is unsustainable.  The oil era is coming to an end and we have not developed sustainable alternatives that can meet our energy needs in the next century.  In 2003 the price of a barrel of oil stood at around $35.  In 2006, it reached $70 and economists warn that the days of $100 per barrel of oil may not be far away.</P>
        <P>Coupled with this price pressure, there are repercussions from Ireland&rsquo;s failure to meet its commitments under the Kyoto Agreement.  Under the agreement, to which Ireland is a signatory, this country undertook to limit the increase of these emissions by 2008-12 to only 13% based on the level of emissions in 1990.  The recently leaked EPA report revealed that Ireland has the <Col N="731"/>highest level of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions per head of population in the world which means we have reached a crisis in terms of the damage to our environment.  The current Government has failed to treat this area as an urgent priority and it is time for new thinking and clear policies that will deliver.</P>
        <P>The latest report, which is for 2005, is likely to show that the latest rise has been driven by a major increase in emissions from the transport sector, which grew by about 8%.  This is significantly higher than the modest 2% rise for transport predicted in the Government&rsquo;s emissions trading report of last March.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill proposes a mandatory bio-fuel component for all motor fuels.  Our proposal would force fuel distributors to include a 5% bio-fuel mix in all petrol and diesel.  This would not cost motorists as it would not require car engine modification.  It would be mandatory that both petrol and diesel, used as vehicle fuel, be blended with ethanol and rape seed oil respectively.  The transport sector has been identified as one of the largest offenders in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
        <P>Another benefit is that blending motor vehicle fuels with bio-fuels would kick-start the process of reducing our dependency on oil.  Our blending proposals would tackle our unacceptably high level of carbon emissions and create a viable alternative enterprise for farmers.  This would help Ireland meet its Kyoto targets and reduce environmental emissions from the transport sector.  It would also stimulate a market for farmers to produce bio-fuel crops and make Ireland more self-sufficient in meeting future energy needs.  This Bill would give the bio-fuel industry the kick-start it so badly needs to become a viable, developing industry with the capacity to provide a long-term alternative to oil.</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government has consistently failed to develop a comprehensive policy on the development and promotion of bio-fuel.  It has done little more than tinker.  We have heard much talk from the current Government but have seen very little action on climate change.  As my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on agriculture, I have consistently urged the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, to stop stalling on this issue and persuade the Minister for Finance that we must kick-start mandatory blending and give wider support to rural communities to develop alternative energy generating projects.  Rural communities and farmers are positively disposed to playing their part in tackling Ireland&rsquo;s energy crisis and in producing cleaner, greener energy.  All that is missing is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing this growing crisis.</P>
        <P>There is no point encouraging farmers to grow renewable energy or bio-fuel crops, as the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government pretend to be committed to, when there is <Col N="732"/>no market for them.  The policy vacuum at the heart of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government is exposed by its failures in this area.  There are no plans to legislate to ensure blended bio-fuels replace petrol and diesel, no proposals for the extension of the removal of excise duty on bio-fuels, no plans to open a public competition for capital start-up grants for bio-fuel processing plants, no plans to require public transport and other public service vehicles to convert to bio-fuels where feasible and no proposals to make a major capital allocation to bio-fuels instead of wasting money buying carbon credits.</P>
        <P>There is significant support for bio-fuels throughout Europe.  Commercial fuel is subject to mandatory blending of bio-fuel in Austria.  Germany produces one third of bio-fuels in the EU.  Ireland has stuck its head in the sand and has done nothing to introduce bio-fuels.</P>
        <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, showed a belated recognition by this Government of the importance of bio-fuels, which Fine Gael has highlighted repeatedly.  The Minister did not propose any legislation, nor did he make it mandatory to produce bio-fuels, displaying a major lack of commitment to the future of our energy supply.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the energy crop scheme announced by the Minister for Agriculture and Food last week has many weaknesses, most notably the exclusion of REPS farmers from the scheme and the exclusion of lands in receipt of disadvantaged area payments.  Under the Minister&rsquo;s proposals for a new bio-energy scheme, farmers will receive grants to establish miscanthus and willow.  However, if in receipt of this grant, they will not be able to draw down their REPS payments or their disadvantaged area payment on lands used to produce bio-mass crops.  This could amount to a reduction of &euro;12,000 on 100 acres used for renewable energy crops.  It seems incredible that a scheme supposed to protect and promote the environment is excluding farmers from producing bio-fuels that could have a very positive effect on Ireland meeting its Kyoto targets.  There is a clear conflict between the grants of which farmers can avail, cancelling any incentive for farmers to engage in bio-fuel production.</P>
        <P>The structure of the scheme puts farmers in poorer parts of the country, especially in the BMW region, at a disadvantage.  These farmers receive an acreage payment know as the disadvantaged compensatory allowance.  However, under the Minister&rsquo;s proposals, farmers cannot collect this payment while participating in the new scheme.  Growing miscanthus and willow is the only way forward despite a ready market.  Unfortunately, farmers in poorer parts of the country who could provide willow and miscanthus will not be able to take advantage of it because of the major structural disadvantage.  One arm of the State is contradicting the other arm of the State.</P><Col N="733"/>
        <P>Consumers pay a levy on electricity bills to support Bord na M&oacute;na for its peat production.  Peat cannot compete with oil and coal so this levy makes up the shortfall.  It is a commendable proposal because it supports an indigenous energy source.  It is vital to extend it to other indigenous energy sources, such as renewable energy crops.  However, renewable energy crops are now at a disadvantage as they are not receiving the support available to peat producers.</P>
        <P>The Government has a track record of facilitating and supporting the production of bio-fuels outside the country and foreign imports.  The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources granted relief on excise duty to two companies, namely, the Goodman group and One51.  Neither company intends to produce here.  The Goodman group has a site in Pembrokeshire in the UK, and One51 also intends to import bio-fuel.  Under the current scheme some 90% of bio-fuel will be imported.  Those who made an investment and supported the development of a micro industry have had support withdrawn.  This was done in favour of major players importing bio-fuels.  Government policy serves only to support countries cutting down rainforests to generate renewable fuels.  This will not benefit the environment in the medium or long term and will certainly not benefit the development of an industry in Ireland or support Irish agriculture.  It is difficult for European companies to justify investing in renewable energy products in Ireland rather than in better supported neighbouring countries in the European Union, or even in the United States.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael&rsquo;s blending proposal is a &ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo;.  There is nothing to prevent the establishment of a blending regime here.  The proposal represents a win-win situation for our environment and our farming community.  Moving to bio-fuels in the wake of the sugar beet industry wipe-out will give farmers new markets, new opportunities and allow Ireland to live up to its responsibilities to its people and to the planet.  The Government must not continue the actions it took to wipe out the sugar industry and prevent the creation of a renewable energy sector in its place.  It chose to ensure that Greencore would develop the sugar factory sites in Carlow and Mallow for residential and other purposes, rather than use the closure of the industry to kick-start the bio-fuel industry.  Ireland&rsquo;s production of bio-fuels remains low by European standards and it is playing catch-up.  Many farmers, however, will not change over to bio-fuel production unless they are confident there is a market for their product and that it has a long-term future.</P>
        <P>It is hypocritical of the Government to give farmers less than one month in which to decide whether to avail of the scheme that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources announced last week.  The Government knows that without a market in place and leaving such a small window of opportunity for <Col N="734"/>farmers to avail of the scheme is a political ploy to wrap the green flag around itself before the general election to say it is as green as any other party.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>This Government is trying to pull the wool over people&rsquo;s eyes on this issue.  Fine Gael has solid proposals that will stimulate a market for farmers and encourage consumers to make the switch to bio-fuels, while reassuring farmers of the future security of the industry.  We call on the Government to create a market for bio-fuels by legislating to provide that all motor fuels must include a blend of fuel from renewable sources.  Such legislation will mandate that all petrol sold at filling stations will include a 5% bio-ethanol mix and all diesels will contain a 5% bio-diesel mix.  It should remove all excise duty on bio-fuels produced from renewable energy crops and provide establishment grants for producer groups that would consist of up to 50% of the costs of setting up the group, subject to a maximum of &euro;300,000 per group, in order that farmers can benefit directly from market returns.</P>
        <P>There is little point in establishing a market unless we ensure that farmers get a share of the profits out of that manufacturing process which is not the case in many other areas of agriculture today.  I urge Members to support Fine Gael&rsquo;s Bill.  Climate change is a major global problem facing all of us.  Global meltdown is a reality and urgent action is required.  Developing practical and feasible solutions to climate change presents a serious challenge to all policy-makers and legislators.  Tackling climate change is so important, so vital and urgent that it must go beyond petty political squabbling.</P>
        <P>I urge Members and the Minister to think globally, act locally.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal is a step in the right direction.  It is a straightforward measure that can have an immediate significant impact.  I am not aware of any reason fuel blending cannot be introduced here.  If the Government has any concerns over the working of this proposal, my party colleagues and I are more than willing to sit down and iron them out, after tonight, on Committee Stage.  Tonight it is vital to accept the broad principle of this Bill.  The Government can act now, support this Bill and kick-start the cleaning and greening of our environment.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister does not respond by saying that his statement yesterday is one of intent because the Government parties have had ten years to deal with this issue.  They have had the past three years to deal with the fall-out from the closure of the sugar industry and have done nothing about that.  The Government can allow political rivalries to kill this worthwhile proposal and wait until the EU forces Ireland to act on the issue.  Stalling in the face of irreversible climate change and environmental pollution is no longer an option.  I urge the Minister and his colleagues <Col N="735"/>to accept the principle of the Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy in this Bill is not new because Fine Gael published it last April but it is apposite to discuss it in the aftermath of the figures announced last week by the UN committee on climate change.  Those figures proved that the time has come for Ireland to take its head out of the sand on climate change and accept personal and national responsibility for what it has contributed to climate change, and to mend that for the future.  It is time for us to take seriously all the issue surrounding climate change.  </P>
        <P>On this Government&rsquo;s watch Ireland has lost all right to promote itself as a green and clean land.  Our CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions per head are the highest in the world.  We have lost all moral standing and authority when it comes to the environment and the future of the planet.  We can begin again, if not to reduce emissions, to reduce the growth in them but this is a monumental task.  The challenge is not just to reduce emissions but to do so without damaging growth in the economy but encouraging and sustaining it.</P>
        <P>The failure to tackle any of the parameters on energy use has made this a difficult task.  Energy production is highly inefficient and totally dependent on carbon fuels, 90% of which must be imported.  The Government has stood by and watched wasteful and inefficient production.  It has also ignored consumption.  Last year we built 80,000 new homes, and over the past ten years close to 500,000 new homes, but no attempt was made to increase their insulation standard or to maximise the use of renewable or improved heating fuels.  Short-term commercial interests were put before those of purchasers or of the planet.</P>
        <P>Our transport emissions have made the greatest contribution to greenhouse gases in recent years.  This is caused by growth not only in numbers of cars but in congestion, an almost entirely urban phenomenon that the Government has ignored.  We must look in turn for the greatest reductions from this sector.  This requires a focused and forensic consideration of how to set about the task which will be painful and challenging.  If the economy is to grow and if we are to improve our quality of life and sustain living standards we must improve and increase, not reduce, mobility.  That is the challenge.</P>
        <P>Being an island Ireland needs a strong aviation sector and cannot consider major carbon taxes to prevent planes flying in and out of the country.  We need this sector to get our goods to market and to sustain our transport industry.  We could, however, consider the foods we import.  There is no reason to bring sugar snap beans from South Africa.  We can live without them and grow cabbage instead.  Spinach jumps out of the ground here.</P>
        <P>Rail freight has become almost extinct, simply because CIE says it is uneconomic.  The Govern<Col N="736"/>ment does not seem to have a view but it must take the long and broad view of rail freight and consider the external factors that exist for this versus road haulage.  There are major costs in road haulage that are not considered when CIE decides that rail freight is uneconomic and cannot be sustained.  It may be that rail freight is not appropriate for all goods.  I accept that.  Rail cannot achieve the kind of penetration enjoyed by road haulage.  However, we cannot ignore the fact that the latter industry is responsible for huge emissions.  At the very minimum we must consider stopping the destruction of rail infrastructure and the selling off of existing rolling stock.</P>
        <P>When it comes to road transport, there is no denying the car.  The population outside Dublin is extremely dispersed and people will always depend on cars.  It is crucial, therefore, that we begin to concentrate on ensuring that we can decouple their mobility from CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  Mobility is crucial to quality of life and we must ensure the people retain the latter.</P>
        <P>The use of bio-fuels, which the Bill proposes, is clearly the way to proceed.  Engine improvements and modifications will come in time.  What we can do now, without inconveniencing anyone, making any effort or introducing carbon taxes, is demand, as Fine Gael suggests, the introduction of a 5% bio-mix for petrol and a 2% mix for diesel.  The Bill is not prescriptive in this regard.  Overnight, what we are suggesting would lead to a 5% reduction in fossil fuel use, make us less dependent on volatile and insecure oil supplies, reduce our CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and kick-start home production of bio-fuels by creating a guaranteed market.  In short and as my colleague stated, it is &ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo;.  I am delighted the Minister, although late in the day, is of the same view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>He has undergone a late conversion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>When coupled with the abolition of excise tax on the bio-fuel element, which is also proposed by Fine Gael, the transition to a more sustainable fuel will be painless for the consumer.  The Minister for Finance might be interested to hear that in other countries where this has happened, the tax advantage has become unnecessary.  This is because petrol supplies will diminish and become more expensive and bio-fuel will become established internationally.</P>
        <P>What is important is to encourage public enthusiasm for the change.  Carbon taxes may become essential in the future to limit the use of fossil fuels.  Before we go down that road, however, we must first exploit all the potential incentives to change behaviour and encourage a move away from fossil fuel.</P>
        <P>The Bill deliberately avoids prescribing a fixed percentage of bio-fuel blending.  Initially, we anticipate the 5% bio-ethanol mix for petrol because this would require no change to the average car.  Over time, however, it will rest with the <Col N="737"/>Minister to increase this quantity in line perhaps with EU requirements, the development of the European and Irish markets for bio-fuel production and improvements in car technology.  I hope the recent announcement by the Commission of recommendations on average car emissions will drive the development of the industry.</P>
        <P>There are always gainsayers who oppose every suggested change from our old ways.  For example, it has been stated that the capacity to produce bio-fuel in the quantities required for higher levels of blending just does not exist in Ireland or even, perhaps, in Europe.  That may be the case in light of current technology.  However, the position will change.  Even if the capacity does not exist, it would be better to import bio-fuel that to import oil.  I ignore the gainsayers who state that we cannot make changes of this kind.</P>
        <P>There is huge public enthusiasm to limit our wasteful use of resources and to make the switch to using renewable energy sources.  Improvements in our recycling rates came about simply as a result of providing people with facilities at which to recycle.  The position is similar with Luas, which has been extremely successful and to which I am a convert.  It is a myth that people love their cars.  If they are given the opportunity to commute on a reliable and frequent public transport service, they will grab it.  Luas is one example of this, as is Aircoach.  If one offers members of the public frequency and convenience, they are quite willing to leave their cars at home.</P>
        <P>Without doubt, the single biggest way to reduce CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions is to get the members of the commuting public in our cities out of their cars and on to public transport.  At the same time, this would help reduce congestion.  Rail-based solutions will come about in time but action is needed now.  The only immediate action we can take in respect of public transport is to provide buses.  Fine Gael strongly believes a competitive market best serves the public&rsquo;s interest.  We are committed to increasing the choice available to the public by encouraging private sector interests to tender for new and existing routes in our cities.  It is only with frequent and reliable services that we will tempt members of the public out of their cars.  The emissions reduction brought about by people switching from cars to buses is enormous.  An average bus carrying 60 people offers a scenario that is 12 times cleaner than one in which those 60 people drove their cars instead.  Again, it is &ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Naughten on introducing the Bill, which makes great sense on four or five different fronts.  We are not discussing anything that has not been mentioned in the House on several occasions during the past two years.  The problem previously was that the Government was not listening.  Some of the efforts it has made, however welcome, are not good enough to tilt the balance to encourage <Col N="738"/>people to do what they should do in so far as the environment is concerned.</P>
        <P>If this debate was taking place in the context of a barrel of oil being priced at $90, people&rsquo;s reaction would be amazing.  If it were taking place in the context that there would never be a shortage of diesel or petrol, it would be difficult to encourage people to speak about the most important aspect of this matter, namely, a cleaner environment.  This comes down to people&rsquo;s psychological make-up.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Olivia Mitchell stated and in so far as the transport element is concerned, recent figures from the car manufacturers show that by 2018 or 2019 the number of cars on our roads will have doubled.  Imagine the queues with which we will be faced unless there is a huge sea change in our attitudes in respect of all the actions that must be taken.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment upon a matter in respect of which the Government has been lacking and to which the Minister has referred on several occasions in the context of the various incentives that have been introduced to encourage people to grow alternative crops.  It does not make a goddamn bit of difference what one gives them if members of the farming community have, for very good reasons, decided not to catch on.  The reason they have not caught on is that they do not believe the Government has thought matters through and because they are of the view that when the crops have been grown, there will be no one to whom they can be sold.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>It must be recognised that there are no guaranteed outlets.</P>
        <P>There are 9 million acres of relatively good land here.  On foot of European Union constraints and restraints of every description, our national herd is declining, there are fewer sheep and cattle and less tillage.  As a result, a great deal of land is lying idle.  The best land in the entire country has been set aside.  In recent months, the Minister decided to provide X amount of money per hectare to encourage people to grow the relevant alternative crops.  He is now wondering why farmers decided not to grow more of these crops than has proven to be the case.  As Deputy Naughten stated, the Minister gave them a month or two to decide whether to opt to grow these crops.  The Minister is here long enough to know that no group in society will make an overnight switch regarding something in respect of which no research was carried out.  Years ago the Agricultural Research Institute did research into any proposed actions by farmers and tried them out in practice to ensure they would work at farm level.</P>

	<P>Some research is being done at Oak Park and a number of other locations but it is only beginning.  If the Minister pays the piper, the tune will be called.  </P>
        <P>When 2,500 eminent scientists throughout the world say we have a problem with climate change, we must take it seriously.  If it turns out that, because of the way the Government decided to kick-start this process and encourage the growing of alternative crops, it got out of hand, there would be no problem putting a ceiling on it through taxation but the Minister did not provide for such a position.  The proposal before the House is simple and doable, and I believe the public will react favourably to it.  There is no magic in the concept of blending.  We would have the biofuels suitable to do this provided we convince farmers to grow the crops.</P>
        <P>Another aspect worth mentioning is the proposed removal of excise duty on biofuel.  Many young people tell me they want to build their houses and use the wood pellet system to heat them.  I tell them they will have no trouble getting the grant to put in the burner, which was a good move by the Government, but I then ask them from where they will get the wood pellets because wood pellets for a house in Ballinasloe might have to come from County Tyrone, Kildare or elsewhere.  If someone&rsquo;s fire has gone out and they are waiting on the supplier to cross the country with a supply of wood pellets, they can be assured they would have a great deal of trouble in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend my Fine Gael colleagues for bringing this Bill before the House.  Climate change is a major problem facing the world but we have not been serious about addressing it.  The recent rise in the cost of crude oil, petrol and diesel on the world market and increased costs here brought home to many people the real difficulties facing them on a daily basis in that regard.  It stemmed the debate on the potential of biofuel, the cost and so on but the closure of the sugar beet industry late last year reignited the debate and brought home to many people, particularly those living in rural areas who are dependent on the land, the changes taking place and the whole issue of alternative farming.  There is a real lack of leadership in that regard.  Deputy Connaughton touched on that aspect when he spoke about the lack of research in this area.</P><Col N="740"/>
        <P>There is a crying need among farmers, be they big or small, to stay on the land and make a living on it.  The potential for growing alternative crops that could produce energy was never more wanting.  I have never had as many people coming to clinics or meetings inquiring about the possibility of growing alternative crops.  However, when a farmer tries to size up the possibility of growing some of those crops, the obstacles one can come across are amazing.  For example, people involved in the rural environment protection scheme cannot grow alternative crops while claiming the REPS grant.  It is a disgrace that people who went out of their way to get involved in a rural environment protection scheme and have been compliant with it cannot use some of their land to grow alternative crops.  That is one example I can give the Minister.  There are many other examples of issues that are prohibiting people from getting involved in the growing of alternative crops.</P>
        <P>The Government is keeping this issue at bay.  People have a decision to make about their future but it is also about the future of rural Ireland and the alternatives that could be available in rural Ireland.  A sea change is happening in agriculture and there is potential for an alternative industry, but we are not grappling with it or offering people the alternative they deserve.</P>

	<P>The Green Paper states &ldquo;It should be noted that mandates &mdash; where fuel suppliers are required to produce a percentage of bio-fuel in each litre of fuel sold &mdash; are not currently permitted under EU law&rdquo;.  Should the Opposition be in any doubt, the public consultation document on the bio-fuels directive, published by the EU Commission in April 2006 notes that bio-fuels obligations and excise relief programmes are the chosen bio-fuel policy instruments of many member states.  On the question of a mandate in the form proposed by the Fine Gael Party, the Commission stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">A third approach would be to require each litre of petrol or diesel sold to contain a given proportion of bio-fuel.  This mandate system has been used in Brazil and elsewhere.  In Europe, however, it would contravene the EU fuel quality directive as presently drafted.  In addition, without EU wide harmonisation of the minimum proportion per litre, such an obligation would constitute a serious internal market barrier.</P>

	<P>We wondered why it was announced yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies should read the Green Paper.  Unlike the mandate system proposed by Fine Gael, the bio-fuels obligation will require fuel supply companies to ensure bio-fuels represent certain percentages of their fuel sales on an annual basis.  By 2009 this will be 5.75%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>They will import the bio-fuels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Companies will have to account for their fuel mix on an annual basis and if they do not reach the obligated limit, they will have to pay a fixed amount penalty per litre for the amount of the target not achieved.</P>
        <P>The obligation will allow Ireland to achieve the EU bio-fuels directive target a year in advance of the 2010 deadline.  The establishment of a further target for 2020 is in line with EU thinking on bio-fuels policy.  Critically, it provides long-term market certainty that will allow market players to develop economically viable scales into their projects.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s bio-fuels obligation will be introduced in 2009 and I intend to embark on extensive consultations with relevant sectors over the coming months about its implementation.  The details of the measure must be carefully drafted to maximise the benefit to the economy and the environment.  The public consultation will, therefore, include discussions with the traditional fuel and emerging bio-fuel sectors, as well as discussions with the farming and waste-processing sectors.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the bio-fuels obligation is one of the principal decisions of the seven Ministers who participated in the ministerial bio-energy task force, which I established in July 2006.  It is the culmination of several months of discussion and analysis and is part of the Government&rsquo;s approach to the development of the bio-energy sector.  It was also signalled strongly in the Green Paper on energy and I intend to publish the report of the White Paper over the coming weeks.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of the obligation follows the successful roll-out of two bio-fuels mineral oil tax relief schemes in 2005 and 2006.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Both of which are oversubscribed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Under these schemes, almost &euro;220 million in excise relief is being provided over six years for a range of bio-fuel projects.  The projects range in size and structure and include bio-diesel, bio-ethanol and pure plant oil projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is supporting foreign industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Eight projects were successful in the first scheme, and 16 were selected under the second scheme.  Significant volumes of bio-fuels are already coming on stream in the fuel market.  For example, ConocoPhillips at the Whitegate refinery, has already commenced distribution of bio-fuel complying with the diesel standard.  Diesel pumps throughout Munster are selling diesel, a percentage of which has been made from vegetable oils.</P>
        <P>Another successful applicant under both schemes is selling petrol containing 5% ethanol at 85 service stations, and selling ethanol in blends of 85% in 13 service stations.  Flexi-fuel vehicles can use the 85% blend of ethanol in <Col N="745"/>petrol.  High blends of bioethanol, offer significant potential in terms of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> reductions and greater market penetration.</P>
        <P>Recognising this, the Government introduced a 50% reduction on vehicle registration tax for flexi-fuel vehicles in the 2006 Finance Act.  Two leading car manufacturers have already introduced these vehicles in the market and 200 flexi-fuel vehicles have been purchased to date.  In addition, some 1,500 vehicles have been purchased under the 50% VRT relief scheme available for hybrid electric vehicles.  The Government is now embarking on a review of VRT to link tax rates with CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.  This is further evidence of the integrated approach being taken by Government on sustainable energy policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Bio-fuels offer significant potential for rural development and I have been working closely with the Minister for Agriculture and Food to ensure the appropriate measures are in place to support the farming sector in participating in the emerging bio-fuels market.  In the budget, the Minister for Finance announced three critical agriculture measures which complement the renewable energy measures being implemented by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Of particular relevance to the bio-fuels sector is the introduction of a top-up of &euro;80 per hectare on the current energy crop payment.  This will bring the payment to &euro;125 per hectare and offers a significant incentive to farmers to grow energy crops.  Further incentives are being offered to assist farmers to grow and harvest energy crops for the renewable heat and electricity markets.</P>
        <P>It would have been helpful if Deputy Naughten had done some research before making claims in regard to REPS.  I note that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, today confirmed that REPS farmers are not excluded from the new bio-energy scheme for willow and miscanthus&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>

	<P>This scheme was announced last week.  Fine Gael, without doing its research on the issue, ran with a newspaper article which claimed that REPS farmers were excluded from the scheme.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="746"/>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>They are excluded.  Those receiving disadvantaged area payments are also excluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, confirmed that farmers participating in REPS can obtain the energy crop premium and the establishment grants for areas planted with either willow or miscanthus.  The remainder of the land continues to be eligible for REPS payment.  The Minister is reviewing the overall position in the context of preparations for the introduction of REPS 4.  The new REP scheme is part of the rural development programme 2007-13 which is currently with the European Commission for approval.</P>
        <P>The development of Ireland&rsquo;s bio-fuels sector is part of a comprehensive strategy to increase deployment of renewable energy across the three energy sectors &mdash; transport, heat and electricity.  In the last two years alone, I have announced a range of support programmes for these sectors.  The greener homes domestic renewable heat grants programme provides grants for householders for the purpose of installing renewable heating, including wood biomass boilers and stoves, solar panels and heat pumps.  The overall funding available for this scheme over the five-year period to 2010 is now &euro;47 million, which includes the additional &euro;20 million I secured in budget 2007.  Grants of up to &euro;6,500 are available to members of the public under this programme.</P>
        <P>The scheme has been hugely successful, with almost 13,000 applications received since it was launched last March.  Irish people have strongly embraced the renewable energy imperative and are keen to play their part in creating a cleaner environment.  The Government is supporting this public enthusiasm through a targeted grants package that allows householders access to cheaper and cleaner energy.</P>
        <P>The bioheat grants programme provides grants for commercial scale wood biomass boilers aimed at the business and services sectors.  Almost 100 applications have already been received for grant aid under this scheme.  A sum of &euro;22 million was originally made available for this scheme to 2010.  In budget 2007, a further &euro;4 million was added to the programme.  In response to early feedback from the public, we are now expanding this programme to allow community and voluntary groups, schools and other public entities to avail of the grants and to include solar and other renewable technologies.</P>
        <P>The &euro;11 million combined heat and power, CHP, grants programme provides funding for the commercial sector to switch to more efficient electricity and heat generation.  Eighteen applications for funding have been received since this programme was launched in July, and a call for proposals for biomass CHP will take place in coming months.  In June 2006, I launched the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff, REFIT, which provides a fixed feed-in-tariff for renewable elec<Col N="747"/>tricity over a 15-year period.  This programme will see Ireland achieve a target of 15% of electricity consumed from renewable sources by 2010.</P>
        <P>The two excise relief programmes for bio-fuels, which I outlined earlier, are costing in the region of &euro;220 million in excise foregone&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and are positioning Irish market players to participate in the longer-term market that we are creating through the implementation of a bio-fuels obligation.</P>

	<P>The overall new investment being facilitated by the Government amounts to more than &euro;400 million and is a clear indication of its commitment to the development of a vibrant renewable energy sector in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In tandem with our initiatives to support renewable energy deployment, the Government is encouraging consumers to think about energy usage.  Deputies are undoubtedly familiar with my Department&rsquo;s Power of One campaign, which was launched last year and will continue into the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

	<P>It has been hugely successful to date.  The dedicated website has been visited by more than 35,000 people, and 25,000 information packs have already been despatched from our mailing centre.  We will shortly extend that campaign into a Power of One Street campaign.</P>
        <P>The Government has clearly had significant success to date in the area of bio-fuels.  While I appreciate Fine Gael&rsquo;s intention in introducing this Bill to the House, its provisions cannot be introduced without incurring a serious breach of EU legislation.  I urge the Opposition not to support this Bill but to participate in the forthcoming debate on the structure and roll-out of the bio-fuels obligation which I announced on Monday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="748"/>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has been receiving telephone calls with queries about his whereabouts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to address the House on this Bill.  The development of a bio-fuels market is important from several perspectives.  From an energy perspective, bio-fuels offer one of the few options available to governments to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector.</P>
        <P>Unlike the heat and electricity sectors, the transport sector in Ireland has been growing exponentially in recent years.  Final energy use in this sector grew by 151% in the 15-year period between 1990 and 2005, and road transport accounts for 65% of fuel consumption in the sector.  The Government is fully aware of the need to reduce emissions from this growing sector and has taken a series of important steps towards replacing polluting fossil fuels with more sustainable renewable fuels.  The bio-fuels obligation announced by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, will have the effect of taking the equivalent of 200,000 cars off the road.  This is more than the number of new cars registered in 2006.</P>
        <P>The bio-fuels obligation also provides a long-term framework, to 2020, for the development of a bio-fuels sector and will allow Ireland to reduce its dependence on imported fuels.  Ireland currently imports more than 99% of its transport fuels.  Two thirds of these are imported fully refined and a further one third are refined at the Whitegate facility in Cork.  It is clear, therefore, that the new bio-fuels strategy will not only contribute to our environmental objectives but will also lessen our dependence on imported fuels.</P>
        <P>The bio-fuels obligation, coupled with the projects that are already emerging from the Government&rsquo;s bio-fuels excise relief programmes, also offers significant potential for rural development and the farming community.  It is estimated that 75,000 hectares of land would be required to support 2% market penetration of bio-fuels, if those bio-fuels were to be produced from energy crops alone.  Obviously, waste products such as recovered vegetable oil and tallow will be part of the overall mix in our bio-fuels sector, but waste supplies are limited and there is enormous potential for the farming community arising from a 5.75% target by 2010 and a 10% target by 2020.</P>
        <P>In formulating its renewable energy strategies, the Government has been constantly mindful of the opportunities which renewable energy presents in terms of rural development.  The benefit is three-fold because it also replaces imported energy and contributes to environmental objectives.  Recognising the potential role of the farming and forestry sector in renewable energy generation, the Government has already introduced a range of initiatives.</P>
        <P>The &euro;26 million bioheat programme provides a new and growing market for wood chip products. <Col N="749"/> Through this programme and the &euro;47 million greener homes programme, we are developing a new market for wood energy products.  The Green Paper on energy policy estimates that renewable biomass heating will account for 5% of Ireland&rsquo;s heating needs within three years.  The establishment of targets for the renewable heat sector, ahead of any EU initiative in this area, is a welcome move for Ireland and for biomass producers in Ireland.</P>
        <P>To encourage farmers and foresters to take advantage of the new demand for renewable heat products, which has been created through these programmes, the Minister for Agriculture and Food recently announced an &euro;8 million scheme to provide establishment grants of up to 50% for farmers planting miscanthus and willow on set-aside land and on areas that have been subject to an aid for the EU energy crop premium.  The scheme is being piloted this year and will allow up to 1,400 hectares of willow and miscanthus to be grant-aided in the first year.  I am glad to note the Minister for Agriculture and Food&rsquo;s clarification today that REPS farmers are not excluded from the new bioenergy scheme for willow and miscanthus.  The remainder of their land continues to be eligible for REPS payment.  The Minister said she was reviewing the overall position in the context of preparations for the introduction of REPS 4.</P>
        <P>In his budget 2007 speech, the Minister for Finance also announced that funding would be available for specialised biomass harvesting machinery.  This will assist farmers and foresters to add value to their forestry plantations by providing new markets for waste wood products.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>A key feature of the Government&rsquo;s strategy for renewable energy and, in particular, bioenergy, is the introduction of a top-up to the energy crop payment.  While farmers have begun to diversify into the growing of energy crops, the &euro;45 per hectare European energy crop payment has not been sufficient to attract large numbers of farmers into the energy sector.  Last week, as part of the Government&rsquo;s bioenergy crops scheme, the Minister announced that the Government would provide an &euro;80 per hectare top-up to the payment allowing farmers to avail of a payment of &euro;125 per hectare.</P>
        <P>This is a significant increase and is timed to coincide with the new market demand measures introduced by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  It is part of the joined up Government approach which is central to renewable energy policy in Ireland.  In July, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, established a bioenergy ministerial task force.  Ministers from seven Departments were represented on the task force, including the Ministers for Agriculture and Food; Finance; Environment, Heritage and Local Government; and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The combined initiatives announced in the three months by the Minister for Agriculture and <Col N="750"/>Food and Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources were firmly rooted in the work of the task force and were fully backed by the Minister for Finance.  These initiatives are designed to deploy renewable energy in a manner which maximises all of the opportunities for Ireland, including benefits for the environment, security of energy supply and rural economic development.</P>
        <P>The new measures also build on the success of previous programmes.  The two bio-fuels mineral oil tax relief schemes launched in 2005 and 2006 have demonstrated that there is a strong appetite in Ireland for the development of an indigenous bio-fuels sector.  While EU state aids rules do not allow the Government to provide tax relief to fuels only produced in Ireland, a range of projects have emerged from these two schemes, which will see new facilities being developed on the island using feedstocks which include Irish energy crops and waste products.</P>
        <P>Eight projects were approved under the first scheme and 16 have been successful under the second scheme announced in November.  The projects range in size from smaller pure plant oil facilities to producers of high blends of biodiesel made from recovered vegetable oil and oil seed rape, for use in captive fleets, and to largescale production of bioethanol and biodiesel that is already being blended and sold in regular fuel pumps.  The move to a bio-fuels obligation will provide a serious new opportunity for the farming community to diversify into energy crops.</P>
        <P>I note that ten member states are now opting for bio-fuels obligations as the preferred policy options.  Member states which initially had difficulty kick-starting their bio-fuels markets are now rising to the challenge and I have no doubt there will be increasing opportunities for Irish growers and producers not just in Ireland but in the wider European market.  This is particularly relevant when we consider that Ireland is committed to a target of 10% by 2020 and that this target is in line with proposals currently being considered at EU level.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has already alluded to the fact the Bill, as presented, cannot be accepted because it would contravene existing EU legislation.  The measures announced by him this week provide a workable and more ambitious solution to developing a bio-fuels market in Ireland and I strongly commend the Government for its ongoing initiatives to support this growing sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the energy report of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources of June 2006 which contained 38 recommendations.  A Green Paper followed from that in October and we await the White Paper on Energy.  We are making much progress in regard to energy.  Since coming into office, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has very much focused on the energy sector and on <Col N="751"/>the difficulties facing not only Ireland but the world.  We commend him for so doing.  Over the past year or two, for the first time ever, the people have begun to focus on security of supply and on whether fossil fuel is finite.  They are also looking at ways to save energy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The success of grants introduced by the Department and administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland for renewable energy, whether solar panels, geothermal pumps or wood pellets, has been phenomenal.  People are concerned about their energy needs and are looking at ways to reduce them and save energy.  I would like all new builds to have solar panels on their roofs to avail of energy generated by the sun when it shines.  It would not be very expensive to put solar panels on roofs to help meet the energy needs of households.  I hope the policymakers will consider that suggestion and other alternative sources of energy which could be built into new builds.  I note a number of companies offer different specifications to do that.  I hope we move towards keypad metering and that the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is move towards this so people would be aware of their energy consumption and would do something to reduce it.</P>
        <P>As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I fully appreciate the importance of building a more sustainable transport future.  As the Minister outlined, this Bill, in its approach to encourage bio-fuel development, is flawed.  I am surprised at Deputy Durkan because he contributed to the 38 recommendations made by the joint committee.  Indeed, his fingerprints are on a number of the recommendations here which are already in place and where the policies are being developed by the Minister and the Department.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to introduce an obligation on fuel supply companies to have an average of 5.75% bio-fuels in their overall annual transport fuel sales by 2009.  He is giving us enough time to do that.  Those who manufacture vehicles and engines must convert engines to ensure we can use bio-fuels.</P>
        <P>Representatives of Cork City Council appeared before the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  Indeed, members of the joint committee went to see Cork City Council&rsquo;s fleet of vehicles.  It is interesting to note that 5% of the transport fleet of Cork City Council is run on alternative fuels, including<?oasys _jy ?>rapeseed oil etc.  Perhaps the Minister and his Government colleagues might look at the transport fleet of companies, local authorities and Government bodies to see if vehicles could be converted to run on bio-fuel.  We should encourage other local authorities to follow the example of Cork City Council.  Perhaps other local authorities have done so but there is an opportunity for us to lead the way and to seek the conversion of all vehicles in the ownership of the State or statutory bodies to run 100% on bio-fuels.</P><Col N="752"/>
        <P>As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have presided over a number of important debates on renewal energy policy not only in the transport sector but in the renewable heat and electricity sectors.  The pace of development and the scale of achievement have been very positive and encouraging.  In addition to the successful bio-fuels mineral oil tax relief schemes and the newly announced bio-fuels obligation, we have introduced several innovative support schemes for the renewable heat and electricity sectors.  The renewal energy feed in tariff programme has been extremely successful.  The &euro;47 million greener homes domestic renewable heat grants programme has been very successful with over 13,000 grant applications.  I am thinking of getting a solar panel to see if it will help save on my energy use.</P>

	<P>I thought the Deputy had one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The &euro;26 million grant aid package for commercial scale biomass boilers will allow businesses to avail of lower cost heating and will facilitate the development of a biomass sector in Ireland.  The Minister launched the &euro;11 million combined heat and power grants.  We are delivering an ocean energy strategy.   University College Cork is developing an ocean wave strategy and mechanisms which, hopefully, will be successful and will help in the area of renewal energy.</P>
        <P>The power of one is an important first step but the power of two involves everybody saving energy and being conscious of the necessity to do so.  I commend the Minister, his Department and the Government on the initiatives they are taking.  A very important first step has been taken in recent years, which will result in a successful outcome for this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Upton.  I commend Deputies Naughten, Durkan, Bruton, O&rsquo;Dowd, Olivia Mitchell and their Fine Gael colleagues on bringing forward the Biofuels (Blended Motor Fuels) Bill 2007 and highlighting the critical importance of developing a vibrant Irish bio-fuels industry.  </P>
        <P>The transport sector across the world is heavily dependent on oil, with approximately 90% of world transport being oil-dependent, and it consumes a vast proportion of global energy resources.  Because we are now increasingly facing the challenges of peak oil, climate change and the development of a low-carbon and sustainable economy it is critical that we encourage a viable and significant bio-fuels sector.</P>
        <P>There are enormous benefits to bio-fuels and they provide a unique mechanism for reducing the present over-dependence on oil in transport.  Given that bio-fuels are so similar to fuel produced from fossil fuels it is possible to incorporate them into the supply systems that already exist at petrol stations.  In recent years we have <Col N="753"/>seen the success of Brazil, Canada, the United States and others in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At present almost 100% of Irish transport is dependent on imported oil, with a requirement for 200,000 barrels per day, and there is a need for the rapid deployment of cleaner fuel sources, particularly those derived from our own native agricultural resources.  This Bill aims to ensure that all motor fuels comprising mineral oils will at least partly be made up of bio-fuels.  It provides an interesting first legislative step for advancing bio-fuels and it is telling that it was not brought forward by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn, Deputy Peter Kelly or any of their colleagues, who have provided few initiatives or incentives for bio-fuel development during the term of the outgoing Government.</P>
        <P>Last year I remember Deputies Naughten and Upton being very upset as the sugar factories in Mallow and Carlow were closed down, causing devastation in those two local communities.  The Government refused even to consider the possibility of transforming those two factories into bio-fuel centres.  We were all contacted by people on that issue, particularly in Mallow, where many believed the refinery in the town could easily have been adapted to bio-fuels.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn mentioned the work done by Cork City Council, about which I heard at the recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  I recently congratulated Dublin&rsquo;s Lord Mayor, Vincent &ldquo;Ballyfermot&rdquo;  Jackson, on introducing in a fleet of bio-fuel cars.  The new 18 Ford Focus flexi-fuel environmentally friendly vehicles run on any mixture of conventional petrol and E85 bioethanol.  They will constitute 10% of the council&rsquo;s car fleet and will be used by staff from a number of departments.  However, as with other major developments in this area, it has been left to local government to introduce innovative developments.  For example, Dublin City Council, on which I once sat, has brought froward a Wi-Fi broadband zone.  Why can the national Government not introduce such initiatives?</P>
        <P>I have watched with interest the new series of media advertisements for the Power of One energy efficiency campaign and I strongly support its awareness-raising objectives.  People have noted it but the power of one should have started with one Minister.  The refusal of 15 out of 17 senior Ministers, as recently confirmed by a report in the <i>Irish Independent, </i>to opt for greener, more fuel-efficient ministerial Mercedes or Volvos is a terrible example to the rest of the country.  The Minister must start with himself because this refusal flies directly in the face of the message of personal energy responsibility he has sent to the public.</P><Col N="754"/>
        <P>The Bill before us does not include any actual targets.  Although setting targets can be very useful for achieving real advances in renewable energy resources, I note that the intention behind the absence of targets is to allow flexibility for the Government of the day, hopefully a new Government, to increase the proportion of bio-fuel as much as possible.  Almost two years ago, on behalf of the Labour Party, I called for a mandatory bio-fuel obligation, as has been proposed in the Bill, so that we would meet the 5.75% target.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Government&rsquo;s record on developing renewable energy sources is, despite what the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources said, absolutely dire and this is even more true when it comes to bio-fuels.  Deputy Peter Kelly will remember that when I raised the issue of senior citizens in this city looking for an insulation grant in March 2006 we discovered that the HSE budget for the city was totally exhausted.  That showed this Government&rsquo;s commitment to renewable energy to be non-existent.</P>
        <P>In late January the EU released figures showing that bio-fuels contributed just 0.05% of the Irish fuel mix in 2005.  As a fellow member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Peter Kelly will be interested to note that, in 2004, the proportion was 0.00002%.  Such was the commitment of the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen.  The Government&rsquo;s national indicative target, which the EU belatedly gave us, of 0.06% was not even approached.  Instead the Government chose to establish an even more meagre target.  We were supposed to have reached a target of 2% bio-fuel by the end of 2005, another of the many missed targets of the outgoing Government, following decentralisation, education and health.</P>
        <P>The 2002 programme for Government, which I know Deputies read for entertainment, is a work of fiction worthy of submission for the Booker prize.  Most of its targets were not met.</P>
        <P>Until yesterday the main mechanism through which bio-fuels were encouraged was a limited bio-fuels tax relief programme.  In August 2005, the bio-fuels mineral oil tax relief scheme was introduced, which allowed for &euro;3 million per annum in excise to be forgone on bio-fuels.  Many of our EU partner states were zooming ahead with fiscal measures at that stage.  Finally, in budget 2006, an excise relief package for bio-fuels of &euro;200 million over a five-year period, from 2006-10, was announced.  I note that, of the &euro;200 million in tax relief, &euro;150 million will be spent by the next Government.  If the Labour Party gets the opportunity, we will be delighted to do so and will increase the figure.</P>
        <P>In February 2006 the EU presented a new bio-fuels strategy to encourage member states to take <Col N="755"/>more action to reach the 2010 target.  A number of measures were proposed, including seven policy axes including possible mandatory targets, which we need at every pump and in every forecourt.  They also include the promotion of second generation bio-fuels, for example biomass and wood, and appropriate environmental standards.  It is a useful programme which we should adopt.</P>
        <P>Due to the present cost differential with traditional fossil fuels many EU governments have also intervened to promote bio-fuels, often in the form of a remission on excise duties.  One of the best studies I have read, by a group of UCD-based economists, found that to encourage bio-fuels the exemption from excise duties is the instrument that incurs the least transaction costs.  The report is entitled Stimulating the Use of Biofuels in the European Union: Implications for Climate Change Policy, and is authored by<i> </i>Ryan, Conway and Feirreira, UCD 2004.  For the past few years the UK has set the excise duty for bioethanol at 20p below the excise duty of ultra-low sulphur petrol and sulphur-free fuel.  Spain, Finland, Germany, the Czech Republic and Sweden have all taken decisive action on excise exemption.</P>
        <P>Allied to the lack of development in the bio-fuels sector has been the stagnation of biomass.  I used to be my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on forestry, when it was in the same portfolio as communications and natural resources, although it is now with agriculture &mdash; probably correctly, given land use strategies.  The European Commission, at the end of 2005, presented a biomass action plan that aimed to double the use of bioenergy sources in the EU&rsquo;s energy mix by 2010.  At the moment, approximately 4% of the EU&rsquo;s energy needs are met through biomass.  The  European action plan advances 31 measures to promote the use of biomass in heating, cooling, electricity  production, transport etc.  Germany, the UK and the Netherlands already have, or are currently preparing, national biomass action plans.  The European Commission has long urged a rapid adoption of the EU plan by all states.  The adoption of a national plan by our country should be a priority, even before the Government leaves office.  It is coming up with legislation and plans as we head into the general election so it would be better to do this late rather than never.</P>
        <P>This Government&rsquo;s record should make Deputies on that side of the House hang their heads in shame.  It is more than a coincidence that in the week we were supposed to discuss this Bill, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources underwent a Damascene conversion on the benefits of bio-fuels and proposed the introduction of a bio-fuels obligation.  I studied his press release because I am not sure of his intentions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  Does it mean that 5.74% of Ireland&rsquo;s transport market will be supplied by bio-fuels by 2009?  In urban areas we are concerned about the way garage forecourts have been sold off for residential development.  If the Government was serious about bio-fuels, it would ensure a good network of petrol stations exists because the public will only be able to benefit from this idea if fuel is available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy probably wants to nationalise them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Not now that he is in the low tax party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need to do that but we should change the planning laws to state that each significant area should have a petrol forecourt &mdash; there is nothing wrong with that &mdash; and it should have a hotel as well.  Perhaps the Minister of State has not noticed what his Government is doing in this city and other areas but it is taking away some of the services we need.  I support the provision of services in Tullamore and other areas of Laois and Offaly but we also need them here in Dublin.</P>
        <P>I broadly welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s suggestion yesterday.  I have long asked him to look at the renewable transport fuels obligation introduced by my colleagues in the British Labour Party, Chancellor Gordon Brown and Prime Minister Tony Blair, that will require 5% of all fuels sold at the pumps by 2010 to be bio-fuels.  We should follow the trails that have been blazed in Brazil, America and Canada.  When I read the Minister&rsquo;s statement yesterday, however, I still could not see any details of how this will operate or when it will be implemented.</P>
        <P>Some farmers are upset because they cannot avail of the benefits that might come from switching to bio-fuel production.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>They do not get paid.  It is black and white and the Minister of State knows it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course they can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the situation and the Minister accepted that today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is my reading of the situation and, in spite of my slight Dublin accent, I am from a rural background so I was concerned <Col N="757"/>about the bad situation in which many farmers found themselves.</P>
        <P>Why does the Minister not mandate some of his officials to develop a clear plan to implement a bio-fuels obligation?  He spoke about a long period of consultation but it is too late for that.  Perhaps the next Government can embark on consultation.  The Minister strongly condemned the Private Members&rsquo; Bill yesterday but he has brought forward no initiatives on bio-fuels.  It has been left to Opposition spokespersons, such as our Fine Gael colleagues and us in the Labour Party, to hound the Minister in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to establish concrete measures for advancing bio-fuels and other forms of renewable energy.  I cannot see why he is criticising this Bill and why it could not be adopted in principle.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also heard on radio concerns being raised about vehicles.  The Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is an expert on the area but there were interesting reports on problems faced by motorists who wish to convert their cars to run on bio-fuels and the problems with warranties when buying a car.  I do not know if the Minister held any talks with car makers.  If not, he should do so.  Certainly, the Minister for Transport never talks to them.</P>
        <P>I compliment Fine Gael and Deputy Naughten on introducing this Bill and I hope it will be a first step on the road to a more comprehensive legislative framework for the development of bio-fuels which, hopefully, we will be involved in during the next D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill and compliment Deputy Naughten on introducing it.  Mankind faces two equally great challenges &mdash; climate change and peak oil.  Managing our reactions to all the consequences these challenges throw up will impact on the future course of mankind.</P>
        <P>Local challenges are also being faced in Ireland on a daily basis by farmers.  There are challenges in making a living from the land in the face of the running down of agricultural supports from the EU, competition from the south and finding alternative crops to sugar beet.  Introducing mandatory blending of all motor fuels is an essential step we must take if we are to rise to the challenges we face due to climate change and peak oil.  We must also try to solve the problems faced by Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>Biomass is the only renewable energy source that can replace fossil fuels directly, either completely in small-scale applications or by blending solid, liquid or gaseous biomass fossil fuels in large-scale applications.  Thus, co-utilisation of biomass fuels with fossil fuels or bio-fuels is a quick and relatively reliable way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, preserve natural resources and cope with excess agricultural production capacity.</P>
        <P>Together, German, French and Italian bio-fuel production is 18 times greater than that of the <Col N="758"/>USA.  Europe is the global leader in biodiesel production and between 2003 and 2004, European bio-fuel production increased by 26.6%.  Voting in favour of this Bill will not lead to motor fuel shortages.  It will, due to increasing demand for bio-fuels, increase Ireland and the EU&rsquo;s energy security.</P>
        <P>Bioenergy is often said to be carbon neutral, on the basis that the carbon released on burning the fuel is equal to the carbon removed from the atmosphere when the crop is growing.  There are, however, limits to the extent to which conventional biodiesel or bioethanol can be combined with fossil fuels without requiring alterations to the current distribution infrastructure or engine requirements.  In accordance with this Bill, the proportion by volume that is blended with the motor fuel should be subject to review.</P>
        <P>The British Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders states that while commercial bio-fuels, such as bioethanol, can reduce well to wheel emissions by between 7% and 77%, second generation bio-fuels that will become available within the next five years can exceed these carbon savings.  This is endorsed by the Biosciences Federation and British Royal Society for Chemistry, which maintain that although first generation bio-fuels are necessary in the short to medium term, greater carbon savings can be achieved from second generation bio-fuels produced from biomass.</P>
        <P>The use of biobutanol represents a possible first step between existing first generation bioethanol and more advanced bio-fuels that are still in pre-commercial development.  Biobutanol exhibits distinct advantages over conventional bioethanol such as greater energy density and greater compatibility with existing infrastructure and distribution networks.  Produced from the same feedstocks as bioethanol, such as wheat and sugar beet, biobutanol can also be blended with petrol at levels of up to 10% by volume without requiring vehicle modification or the invalidation of warranties.</P>
        <P>Using anaerobic digestion to generate energy from organic waste provides the opportunity to use wet biomass, such as livestock slurry, sewage sludge and food waste.  Anaerobic digestion is the breakdown of organic matter by micro-organisms to produce biogas, comprising 40% carbon dioxide and 60% methane, as well as liquid and solid bioproducts.  Biomethane is equally suitable as a vehicle fuel, a source of heating or to create electricity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some experts have suggested that a large-scale transfer from using rapeseed oil for food to using it for fuel might disrupt world commodity markets.  In this context, it is interesting to note that, in general, food crops are no more than 50% efficient.  For every tonne of food produced, a further tonne of potential biomass is produced.  A second generation bio-fuel such as lignocelulosic ethanol and biomass liquid transport fuels, that use organic waste material such as straw and <Col N="759"/>woody waste, would have a less disruptive influence on world commodity markets for food than first generation bio-fuels.  Large amounts of wood waste go to landfill at present and this could easily be used to generate bio-fuels for transport.</P>
        <P>Despite genuine concerns about its impact on biodiversity, it is clear that Ireland has the agricultural experience, capacity and land to grow the bio-fuels necessary if we are to fulfil our obligation to meet the long-established EU target of 5.7% of the EU&rsquo;s fuel mix to comprise bio-fuels by 2010.  We have begun in Ireland with a variety of fiscal measures but there is much more to do.  We can do considerably more by introducing a mandatory blending of all transport fossil fuels with biofuels, which would at the same time stimulate demand and supply of biofuels in Ireland.  The need for research and development has been mentioned.  As research takes some time, we need to invest much more significantly in that area to bring about proposals for the appropriate mix with a view towards development particularly in the agriculture area.</P>
        <P>As my colleagues have done, I draw attention to the disallowing of the REP scheme and the growing of alternative crops, which makes no sense.  Farmers have rightly had grave concerns about how the closure of the beet industry was handled.  It has been a huge disappointment that sugar beet was not considered an alternative fuel crop as could and should have been done.  Making mandatory the blending of all motor fuels will not on its own conquer the challenges we all face as a result of climate change, peak oil and the end of supports for Irish agriculture.  The time when we will need to introduce mandatory blending of all energy sources, not just motor fuels, may not be as far away as we might hope and think.  The one thing we can do today to delay that time is to vote in favour of the Bill.  It would assist in overcoming the challenges of peak oil, climate change and the phasing out of agricultural supports.</P>

        <P><i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their welcome for the legislation and their contribution to the debate.  As I said in my opening speech, this is amending legislation with a clear focus.  Its purpose is to extend the functions of the National Development Finance Agency in order to allow it to undertake the procurement and delivery stage of public private <Col N="760"/>partnership projects and to provide for connected matters.  This is to build on the skills and capacity essential for successful public private partnership procurement.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In my opening speech I addressed a number of the broad range of issues raised in Deputies&rsquo; contributions relating to capital investment, public private partnerships generally and the national development plan.  In my response to the debate I will, therefore, concentrate on the issues raised on the subject matter of the Bill.  However, I would like to recap on the overall strategy reflected in the approach taken in the Bill, which was raised in some of the contributions to the debate, before addressing some of the individual points made.  The context for the Bill is the Government decision in 2005 to establish a centre of expertise to undertake the procurement phase of public private partnership projects funded by a stream of annual payments from the Votes of Departments and agencies.  That decision does not apply in cases where specialised agencies already exist to undertake the procurement of public private partnership projects, such as the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency.  As Deputies are aware transport represents a major investment area under the national development plan.</P>
        <P>Accountability for individual projects and the role of the Department of Finance was a theme that arose in the debate.  Departments and agencies operate under a system of delegated sanction for capital expenditure.  Responsibility for individual projects rests with the Minister concerned.  The choice of projects to be procured by means of a public private partnership is a matter for the individual Ministers concerned.  Even in the case of projects referred to the centre of expertise for procurement, the project sponsor remains responsible for all aspects of the assessment and evaluation of projects, including the decision to procure by means of a public private partnership.  After the project parameters are set the project is handed over to the centre of expertise in the National Development Finance Agency.  The centre is then responsible and accountable for the procurement of the project to turnkey stage within the parameters set by the sponsoring Department or agency.</P>
        <P>Much of the debate concerned broad Government policy on capital investment including public private partnerships.  A number of issues raised are appropriate to guidelines rather than particular to the Bill before the House.  It was suggested the role of my Department should go beyond issuing guidelines.  The Department of Finance sets the broad framework for capital investment and also sets out the principles that should be applied to capital appraisal, project management and evaluation.  Sponsoring Departments and agencies are and should be accountable for projects.  On a number of occasions, I have outlined the architecture being introduced <Col N="761"/>under which management in Departments must take an active role in overseeing compliance with the relevant guidelines.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A specific requirement of PPP projects is the appointment of a process auditor behalf of the Accounting Officer whose role is to check on compliance with the proper procedures and processes for all projects over &euro;20 million.  More generally, for all capital investment, including PPPs, there is a requirement on Departments to put in place a system of spot checks for compliance with the value for money frameworks and to report annually on the findings of these spot checks to my Department.</P>
        <P>I have recently established the central expenditure evaluation unit in my Department which will review these spot check reports from Departments and will directly undertake a series of spot checks of individual capital projects.</P>
        <P>Deputies mentioned their concerns about the need for public scrutiny of PPP deals.  Public private partnerships are complex and, in addition, the Comptroller and Auditor General noted that ultimately the full value for money of these projects can only be judged over the lifetime of the project.  We need to address the challenges of the complexity of PPP procurement on a variety of levels.  First, the Government wants to see specialised skills and expertise applied at the up-front stage of deals.  Second, the basic principles of clear accountability for decisions and robust project management must be applied throughout the project.  Third, reliance has to be placed on the institutional structures, including the facility for the National Development Finance Agency, to provide expert financial advice to State authorities on the financial components of bids and on the general requirements for assessing value for money set out in guidance.  There are constraints on making commercially sensitive information public.  The need for the private sector to protect commercially sensitive material is recognised in a number of legal contexts such as the Freedom of Information legislation.</P>
        <P>There are also practical considerations for State authorities in protecting their negotiating position in further contracts and maintaining competitive tension in bidding situations.  It should be borne in mind overall that the National Development Finance Agency and the Comptroller and Auditor General have been provided with access to the financial components of deals.</P>
        <P>It has been observed that the PPP route can be slower at the up-front stage.  I have said on several occasions that typically it will take at least 18 months to two years to reach construction stage in a PPP project but overall delivery times for projects have been impressive, for example, in the five schools projects and in the roads area.  Once the lines are cleared, accelerated delivery is a real prospect but PPP projects are not immune to the factors that can cause delay in any large capital project.</P><Col N="762"/>
        <P>Deputy Bruton mentioned the need to build confidence in public private partnerships and in the ability of the public sector to manage them.  We are much further along that road than when the public private partnership programme was launched in 1999.  A major suite of guidance specific to the PPP process has been put in place by my Department and is fully up to date.  The Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledged in the value for money study of the five schools in 2004 that even then lessons learned from the early projects had been incorporated into the guidance.  This process has continued.</P>
        <P>Where expert agencies are put in place to procure and negotiate projects, I expect the practitioners to apply lessons learned, project on project.  In providing procurement powers to the centre of expertise the Bill provides a further measure to strengthen the capacity of the public sector to manage public private partnerships.</P>
        <P>I turn to some of the specific points raised by Deputies.  A number of the general concerns addressed earlier were raised by Deputy Bruton.  He asked about the use of special purpose companies for financing purposes under the principal Act.  I am advised that there has been no need to draw on the agency&rsquo;s financing functions for those projects referred to the agency to date.  However, preparatory work has been taken by the agency to facilitate the exercise of financing functions should the need arise.</P>
        <P>The provision under the principal Act that the chairperson and chief executive officer of the agency when appearing before committees of the House cannot comment on the merits or otherwise of Government policy is a common legislative provision.  As the Deputy is aware it also applies to civil servants when they appear before Oireachtas committees.  The National Development Finance Agency reports directly to me.  I assure the Deputy I will take note if the agency should express any general concerns about the public private partnership process in that context.</P>
        <P>Deputy Burton commented on the time that has elapsed between the announcement of the centre of expertise in July 2005 and the legislation.  The Government noted from the outset that the new functions would commence on an interim non-statutory basis and that the necessary legislation would be introduced in due course.  Statutory provision is urgent to allow the National Development Finance Agency to sign contracts in the education area in the coming months.  The Bill passed all Stages in the Seanad last November.</P>
        <P>Deputy Burton mentioned the need to justify the extra cost of private finance.  One of the drivers behind setting up the National Development Finance Agency in the first place was to have access to advice as to whether the use of private finance is justified for particular projects.  That is an important point.  What we learned from that was the need to move beyond an advisory role for the National Development Finance Agency in <Col N="763"/>the context of PPPs and given that there was not a uniform level of expertise within Departments as to how one would proceed, should a PPP be deemed appropriate by the Minister, that we should try to bring together all that expertise in a centre of expertise under the National Development Finance Agency.  Heretofore the agency simply had an advisory role as to how one would proceed in terms of the best financial arrangement or instrument that should be used to get best value for money for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Burton asked me to clarify the role of the central public private partnership unit in my Department.  The role of that unit, to which six staff are assigned, is to facilitate the public private partnership process centrally by developing the general policy framework including, where necessary, the legal framework, within which public private partnerships operate and by providing central policy guidance to Departments and other State authorities in that context.  That is an important development and a practical response by us to ensure the PPP process works effectively given that not every Department would necessarily have acquired the level of expertise necessary should a PPP project be deemed appropriate within a Department.  Putting that expertise together and allowing the Department of Finance to have a co-ordinating role in terms of the guidance that should apply and how one should proceed with a project and move it to the NDFA, as a delivery agency, provides the right balance, which this amending legislation seeks to achieve, between accumulating the necessary level of expertise within the one area and maintaining accountability by sponsoring Departments and Ministers for their decisions in proceeding along a PPP route.  This ensures there is no break in the accountability mechanism at the expense of efficiency and <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
        <P>The role of the unit is to facilitate the PPP process by developing the general policy framework.  It also provides the secretariat to the interdepartmental group on PPPs and the informal advisory group on public private partnerships at which relevant social partners are represented along with Departments and agencies.  The evolution of how PPPs should be dealt with has arisen as a result of that social partnership process.  I have arranged for an increase in the number of directors who will be part of the National Development Finance Agency, including trade union membership, to ensure the social partnership ethos is maintained as we try to develop PPPs and that we do not do anything that would be opposed to the ethos the public private partnership has engendered.  My Department has the same role in respect of PPP projects as it does in capital investment projects generally in terms of setting the overall capital investment framework and the basic principles to be observed for appraisal, assessment, procurement and evaluation of projects.  This is also an important point.</P><Col N="764"/>
        <P>The Department of Finance has a co-ordinating role.  I do not seek to micromanage line Departments or Ministers in respect of the projects for which they have responsibility, be they in education, health or environment.  The line Minister is the person who makes the decision with the advice of his or her civil servants as to how they should proceed.  Once they go the PPP route, rather than trying to develop expertise within every line Department, it is best to transfer it to an implementing agency where, as Deputy Connaughton rightly said, there is the ability under the structure of the National Treasury Management Agency-National Development Finance Agency, NTMA-NDFA, process to buy in and obtain that expertise in a more flexible manner than might be available by traditional public sector recruitment methods and to ensure we have that level playing pitch in terms of expertise and the bidding tension that is necessary to get the best value for money.</P>
        <P>The point made by Deputy Connaughton is a fair one.  From 2000 to 2006, the lesson we have learned in the last national development plan is that, to be frank, we did not have developments plans up to then.  We had maintenance programmes because no Government had the resources to be ambitious enough to develop capital programmes to the extent that we are now in a position to do.  For example, under the present development plan that was recently announced, more than  &euro;100 billion in capital investment is envisaged over that six or seven-year period.  Up to &euro;25 billion per year will be invested in terms of developing the productive capacity of the economy which is necessary to meet the historical deficits that have built up over the years through no fault of any Government but simply as a matter of resources being available or unavailable, as the case may be.</P>
        <P>We now recognise that the PPP idea or concept can be part of this.  It does not in any way supersede traditional capital investment processes.  In fact, the PPPs are part of this and, thus far, we have been unable to exploit its potential sufficiently.  At least through this amending legislation, we are putting in place a structure which best equips us to identify those projects that could be done by a PPP process.  In this way the Oireachtas could be satisfied that the necessary accountability mechanisms in terms of line Ministers and the necessary expertise being available through the NDFA centre of expertise can enable us with confidence to see the PPP process develops using taxpayers&rsquo; money to best effect.</P>
        <P>Deputy Catherine Murphy outlined reservations about toll roads.  Obviously, there has been some controversy about this in respect of some bypasses in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency or in Cork.  Individual projects in this area are a matter for the Minister for Transport and the National Roads Authority.  However, it must be said that the PPP roads programme has been impressive in its delivery.  It has been on or ahead of time and <Col N="765"/>on budget and I do not think it is really contested by anybody, given the roll-out we are seeing, that the NRA will be able to provide us with the full national motorway programme by 2010, as envisaged.</P>
        <P>As was said earlier, there was a hope that we might be able to get this done by 2006.  The process has been a learning curve for everybody in this respect.  It is clear that land acquisition costs were far higher than anticipated.  We saw subsequent deals with farmer organisations to deal with that matter within the social partnership context.  Construction inflation in the early years of the programme from 2000 to 2002 was significant, of the order of 12% in the first year and 9% in the second year.  Thankfully, due to the expertise that has been built into the NRA and the fact that there are international consortia in the construction industry partnering Irish firms in respect of many of these major road projects, not just national companies with expertise, construction inflation in the last few years of the outgoing plan was 3% to 4% per annum, which is very much in line with normal inflationary costs.  There has been a growing confidence that the NRA and the RPA have developed the necessary ability to negotiate and create a competitive situation whereby people who have acquired expertise in this area have come to our shores and are partnered with existing indigenous building construction companies to do a job of which we can all be proud.</P>
        <P>My Department and the public administration generally are now far more acquainted with the full impact costs of these major proposals.  There has been far more heat than light in our debates regarding the fact that at the end of the day, the cost of the job is not what we might have thought it was in 2000.  The cost of any job is the best tender price available on the day on which we sought the job to be done.  The real litmus test is not about making political points about an original concept which will subsequently have developed into a much bigger job of far greater complexity.  We are undermining confidence in our own system by suggesting that we so far out of line with project costs that it borders on incompetence.  That is not the case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When one analyses the situation, one finds there have been considerable developments from the concept price of a particular project to the detailed design which, in many cases, subsequently expanded.  The port tunnel and the Luas system are examples.  I recall when I was Minister for Transport that it was suggested in 1992 that one could build the Luas system for &euro;250 million.  I do not know if one could ever have done it for &euro;250 million but there was certainly no tender price whereby it could be done for &euro;250 million.  It was done for the price it was done for, although there might have been a slight overrun which was not of great measure.  Our electors are entitled to know that, as a result of the learning curve having improved and the gain<Col N="766"/>ing of experience from the early years, these large projects are being completed on time and within budget, based on the tender price at the time.</P>
        <P>I will bring this down to the ordinary person&rsquo;s language.  I built a house 12 years ago for a price for which I would be unable to build it now.  It is a normal house, but the point I am making in order to make the situation understandable to everyone is that we all know the price of building the same house now would be far higher.  Some 12 years ago, it was a certain price but were I to build it now, it would be a different price.  The idea that we are in some way lax or incompetent for not being able to complete a project for a 1992 figure is nonsense.</P>
        <P>We must acknowledge that the learning curve has been steep but that our implementing agencies are delivering and the PPPs, through the centre of expertise idea, are delivering and will continue to do so.  Deputy Fleming was very fair and accurate in terms of his contribution as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to outline precisely the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s attitude to the pilot schools initiative.  A rather exaggerated negative view was taken of this report until Deputy Fleming put it in its proper context.  We can now look forward to PPPs in the education area making a contribution, which means that many projects will come on stream more quickly than was the case with the traditional procurement method for reasons of which Deputies of all persuasions will be aware in terms of the stages it goes through, the number of these stages and the level of delay involved.  It is far better to try to get expertise up front&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It is much better to deal with the design issues up front before the private sector develops the project and, as Deputy Fleming said, takes on the responsibility of the operational costs over the lifetime of the project.  Risk transfer is an important criterion in deciding whether a project is appropriate for a PPP so that we do not take all the risk up front.  If there are possibilities through contractual arrangements to spread the risk, it is clearly in the interest of the taxpayer to do so.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s call for a debate on PPPs.  The Bill is amending legislation and the basic legislative framework for using PPPs was put in place by the Oireachtas in the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Act 2002 and the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002.  The use of such partnerships was supported by the social partners in the national framework agreement on PPPs in 2001.</P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights and, therefore, I have an interest in the legislation.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley.  A number of weeks ago, I visited the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, following an initiative by Newstalk106.  Along with a number of others, I had debated the issues raised in the report of the Mental Health Commission the previous week on the radio station with the director of the Central Mental Hospital.  I suggested that a number of us should visit the hospital and examine its facilities.  I had visited the hospital in a previous life as a member of the Eastern Health Board and as founding chairman of the south western area health board.  The issue of whether the facilities at this institution represent a hospital or a prison environment has always been debated.  The siting of the proposed new mental hospital is also a political issue.  However, I found the visit a profound experience.  The Minister of State has an interest in this area but those of us who also have an interest would like him to be aware of the issues and concerns at the facility.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for matters relating to prisons and prisoners.  The Bill addresses a number of issues, including the possibility of certain prisoner escort services being contracted out by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; revised prisoner disciplinary procedures, including the establishment of appeal tribunals; planning provisions for the construction of new prisons and extensions to existing prisons; the establishment of the office of the inspector of prisons; the participation of prisoners in certain applications to court by <Col N="768"/>means of a live television link from prison; and charging prisoners for certain optional services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Prisoner escort services are an essential part of daily prison life and they put a great deal of pressure on prison guards and others who are prevented from carrying out other duties during their working day.  Many people, therefore, will welcome the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to use contractors to provide prisoner escort services.  The new proposal will apply to custody officers so that full-time prison staff will be afforded more time to carry out other important duties.  However, I refer to the importance of ensuring the safety of prisoners and staff who have the responsibility of looking after them.  There is a need to ensure the right people of good character and good social skills are appointed to these roles in the Prison Service.  The Minister has made a similar point regarding the Garda Reserve and I have raised this with him on a number of occasions.  It is important that we support him.</P>
        <P>Colleagues raised the issue of the acceptability of using prison to address crime issues.  I attended a positive meeting in Brookfield parish in Tallaght last night where a strong campaign has been mounted to lobby the Minister to fund a Garda diversion project.  Garda&iacute;, parents and youth workers from the Tallaght Youth Service pointed out that efforts must always be made to find alternative ways to deal with people responsible for crime other than locking them up.  There will always be a case for imprisoning certain offenders and this is the subject of political debate but alternatives should be provided.  I have always strongly supported Garda youth diversion projects, particularly the KEY project in Tallaght and the STAY project in St. Aengus&rsquo;s parish in Tymon North.  A strong campaign has been launched regarding the Brookfield project.  I hope the Minister of State will support my efforts to lobby the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in that regard.  The Minister has always been open to suggestions regarding the youth diversion programme.  Prison must be the ultimate sanction.  I have often involved myself in cases of people sentenced to prison because they defaulted on their debts.  While I do not condone law breaking, in a civilised society there should be sanctions for people who break the law other than locking them up.  We should not stand over putting the wrong people in prison.</P>
        <P>I refer to the restorative justice programme, of which I am strong advocate.  Two programmes were implemented in Tallaght and Nenagh.  I was the founding chairman of the Tallaght mediation bureau and I was involved at the commencement of the Tallaght restorative justice programme, which worked.</P>
        <P>Restorative justice has been the subject of a report that was launched recently by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, of which I am a member.  Under the chairmanship of Deputy Ardagh and with great work by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, the Fine <Col N="769"/>Gael spokesperson on justice, we prepared a detailed report which is on the Minister&rsquo;s desk.</P>
        <P>Restorative justice was established in 1999 and is funded by the probation and welfare service and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Since then, it has developed a strong working relationship with the probation and welfare service, victim advocates, the Garda and the courts.  Restorative justice has been to the forefront in promoting and practising the principles and philosophy of restorative justice in Ireland.  Restorative justice provides a number of programmes to the courts, notably offender reparation and victim-offender mediation.  It is a founding member of the European Forum for Victim-Offender Mediation and Restorative Justice and a member of the criminal justice alliance, which has consultative status at the United Nations and its working group on restorative justice.</P>
        <P>Restorative justice recognises that crime hurts victims, the offender and the wider community, and that all parties who are affected should be part of the response.  It acknowledges that the victim&rsquo;s perspective is central to deciding how to repair the harm and that accountability means the offender accepting responsibility for his or her behaviour and acting to repair the harm which has been done.</P>
        <P>Restorative justice is not an alternative but it is about changing how we view crime and its effects.  I do not view restorative justice as a soft option.  We must have a clear understanding that one of the fundamental objectives of restorative justice is to provide a voice for victims of crime.  It is about victims being heard and telling their story.  It provides the opportunity for victims to ask questions of the offender, seek reassurances, vent some of their anger and frustration and seek apology and reparation.</P>
        <P>Another fundamental objective of restorative justice is offender accountability which relates to offenders being personally accountable, taking personal responsibility, raising their awareness and learning about the effect of their behaviour on victims, victims&rsquo; families, their communities, themselves and their own families.  Restorative justice models and programmes have a certain flexibility.  They can be adapted and utilised pre-court, pre-sentence and post-sentence.  In this regard we should fully explore the positive contribution restorative justice could provide at all stages of the criminal justice system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The working group on restorative justice, which is to be established by the T&aacute;naiste in the near future, has an opportunity to ensure we maximise the potential benefits this approach could bring to our criminal justice system and, most importantly, the people in our communities who are directly affected by crime.  I believe my colleagues in Tallaght are in a position to make a significant contribution to the work of this committee.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, to convey my views to the T&aacute;naiste.</P><Col N="770"/>
        <P>The 2005 annual report of the Prison Service provides a number of interesting facts.  The annual cost of keeping a prisoner in custody is &euro;90,900, almost a 10% increase over the previous year&rsquo;s figure of &euro;83,800.  A total of 85% of all committals in 2005 were for non-violent offences.  Of the total number of women committed to prison in 2005, some 90% were incarcerated for non-violent offences.  A total of 78% of all committals under sentence in 2005 were for 12 months or less.  A total of 89% of women committed to prison in 2005 were for sentences of 12 months or less.  A total of 39% of all committals under sentence in 2005 were for three months or less.  A total of 55% of women committed to prison in 2005 were for sentences of three months or less.</P>
        <P>Over the next 100 days prior to the general election many views will be expressed about crime and issues relating to justice.  From listening to colleagues contribute to this debate, the general consensus that is emerging is that courts should be tough on real criminals who should be dealt with severely and while prison is important as a deterrent, it is not always the answer.  I make no apology for stating that it is not right for the Garda to take people to prison for television licence offences or similar matters.  I accept crime must be dealt with, but a different way must be found to address certain offences.  It is time we seriously examined this issue.</P>
        <P>Other colleagues may have more experience of prison visits but I have visited prisons on occasion for humanitarian reasons for family members of constituents.  Regardless of how comfortable or modern some of our prison facilities are, I am always struck by the feeling that I do not want to be there.  I visited a prison before Christmas and I got a sense from prisoners that they very much wish to be in a drugs-free environment.  People say there is a serious drug problem in all prisons.  This is not just an Irish phenomenon.  Many prisoners, some of whom are serving long sentences, do not wish to get involved in drugs and they have tried hard in this regard with the support of staff and families.  I get a clear sense that such people wish to remain in a drugs-free environment.  It is important such people get the support they need.  There will always be difficulties in that regard as people develop more innovative ways of beating the system.</P>
        <P>A colleague referred today to the siting of new prisons.  I was involved recently in a campaign that developed on foot of a proposal to site a new prison on the edge of my constituency.  Such a development gives rise to many issues.  Politicians are told not to be parochial and to look at the national picture.</P>

	<P>We need these institutions and I wished to add that point to the debate.  In the minute that remains I wish to stress the importance of legislation, which is difficult during a late sitting when the Chamber is somewhat empty.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has fans and critics but there is general agreement on this Bill.  Colleagues are entitled to make their points but we must deal with issues that concern people.  As we approach May, there will be many distractions but we must continue to pass legislation.  I would be just as happy if I was in Tallaght but the job must be done.</P>

	<P>People have elected us to do something.  I was quoted in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, a newspaper that does not quote me very often.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case Deputy O&rsquo;Connor should sit down or go back to Tallaght.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy O&rsquo;Connor was speaking about the forthcoming election I might remind him of what happened in Dublin West during the last election.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s vanity project was to build a stadium, sports complex and swimming pool on a lovely site in Abbotstown.  I supported the sports complex and swimming pool but the Progressive Democrat candidate was opposed to the whole plan.  The current T&aacute;naiste supported his opposition and likened the Taoiseach to Ceaucescu with regard to the Abbotstown project.  The candidate for Dublin West, who has since moved to Dublin North, sported badges suggesting flushing the Abbotstown project down the toilet as befits a Ceaucescu project.</P>
        <P>In that context it is ironic that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform spent &euro;30 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money on his vanity trip that would do justice to Ceaucescu.  It may be on the <Col N="772"/>scale of a Romanian prison in the communist era or an American farm prison.  It was acquired at an extraordinary price, far higher than land values in the area.  History repeats itself first as tragedy and then as farce.  The same Minister is presiding over a project that he would compare to a Ceaucescu project if he was in Opposition.  Now that he is the man in command, the rules of engagement have changed.</P>
        <P>A section of the Bill gives the Minister power to plug the planning defects in the Thornton Hall prison site retrospectively, which is deeply inappropriate and should be examined in detail and opposed.  Regarding Part 4, the Minister proposes to replace the Planning and Development Act with a new structure that makes the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the planning agent for any prison development in the country.  Planning arrangements have traditionally have been made through local authorities, followed by appropriate observations and appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la retains a key role regarding strategic infrastructure.  Why should the Minister become his own planning agent?</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for a pseudo consultation process, with a rapporteur who is to receive submissions on prison development.  What will the rapporteur do with the submissions?  Perhaps he will decorate his living room with them or file them in the Minister&rsquo;s office.  The Minister may be minded to glance at them on a light weekend but is under no requirement to take cognisance of them.  It is an extraordinary development in Irish planning law.</P>
        <P>When the Minister acquired the site at Thornton Hall the provision by which he claimed total exemption from planning law on security grounds was defective in respect of constitutional rights of those with legitimate queries about the prison.  It was also defective under EU law, which has detailed strictures on environmental areas and habitat directives.  Although he has embarked on a complex process for developing the prison, I am not sure the Minister signed a contract.  He might enlighten us on progress on this matter.  He is now attempting to pass legislation with retrospective effect and if the issue is challenged in European courts he can claim that he plugged the hole afterwards.</P>
        <P>Roscommon County Council learned about the Minister&rsquo;s reputation for planning to its considerable cost.  In this case the Minister seeks to take all powers in respect of planning matters.  It is an extraordinary, bad precedent to set in this House.  The Minister may argue that he will use these powers for the proposed prison in Cork, which is on State land.  I understand there are as yet no serious local objections but to deny the normal process of local input is anti-democratic.  When will the tenders close?  I understand that one party tendering for the prison contract has withdrawn.  Who will evaluate the tendering process?  Is the Minister the sole authority on all matters concerning prisons?</P><Col N="773"/>
        <P>Serious difficulties have been acknowledged after the fact about road access to the Thornton site.  The existing R130 has become problematic.  It appears the Minister may need to buy separate land to provide for a new road.  Does the Department have an estimate of what that is likely to cost?  There have been various suggestions of relative costs attaching to land acquisition for the road.  The original assessment does not seem to have taken account of the school on the road to the prison, Kilcoskan.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report indicates, the prison site was scored relative to several other potential sites but it appears that it was introduced very late, after the procedure was completed and did not meet the criteria which the Minister and the Department had set out in assessing the prison site.</P>
        <P>The local residents who have worked hard to make their observations on the prison site known and to have dialogue about this have been continually frustrated in their attempts to get information under the Freedom of Information Act.  They have also approached the Committee of Public Accounts where I have seen some of their correspondence, including some from a person with wide experience in land dealing in that part of north county Dublin, who made expert comments on the extraordinary price the Minister paid for an unserviced site.  The Department in some instances compared serviced to unserviced sites and in north and west county Dublin, the price differential between the two is significant.</P>
        <P>Many women Deputies in this and previous D&aacute;ileanna campaigned for the D&oacute;chas centre as a humane location for women prisoners to access, or be with, their young children.  The centre has worked well and been favourably reported on, but it is to be swept away and transferred to the new prison.  The Minister also plans to transfer the Central Mental Hospital to the site.  This will create an American-style super-prison located on the edge of Dublin with poor transport and road links.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many Members who represent towns with ready road and rail access would be interested in a project such as a large prison because it would bring secure and anchoring employment to their area.  The prison in Portlaoise is a major employer in that area.  When the development of the prison in Castlerea was delayed, there were signs in the town stating &ldquo;build our prison now&rdquo;.  The location in north county Dublin chosen by the Minister is very different.  Although it is on the northern fringe of the M50, it is in quite a remote location with a valuable local heritage of archaeology, flora and fauna.</P>
        <P>The area is close to the airport and constantly faces serious difficulties in the face of different forms and proposals for development.  It will serve a significant population from Dublin city centre for whom it would be easier to access the prison in Portlaoise, which is on a railway line, or one in any significant town in the greater Dublin <Col N="774"/>region.  Many of those towns would welcome such a project.</P>
        <P>While the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is moving the prison from Mountjoy to Thornton, his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, is arguing that the national children&rsquo;s hospital to serve children from around the country should move back into Dublin city centre where there are traffic problems.  One might expect that the land on the old prison site would be used for the children&rsquo;s hospital.  The children who attend Crumlin and Tallaght hospitals, on the outskirts of the city, are to move into the city centre where there is limited parking.  There has been a good children&rsquo;s hospital in Temple Street serving the needs of a particular section of the northside community and a limited number of national specialties.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to know how joined-up government operates in this framework.  Why did the hospital not go out to the Thornton site?  It has easy access for parents driving from areas such as Portlaoise, compared to the difficulty of reaching the Mater Hospital site.  Are there any Ministers on the Government benches, either within one or other party or between them, who are capable of joined-up Government and action?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Elements of the Bill are good.  The Department and the Minister have promised for a long time to improve video-conferencing facilities and it is good to see it happening here.  The statutory basis for the Inspector of Prisons is good, although the Minister generally rubbishes the work of the distinguished inspector.  The Minister, the man who knows everything, must explain to the House how it is that there are now significant amounts of drugs in prisons which were relatively drug-free when this Government took office.  This is true, for example, of Wheatfield, a state-of-the-art, modern prison.  What happened in the Minister&rsquo;s governance of the prison system?  Something is going seriously wrong.  One of the significant and appropriate fears of parents whose children are sentenced to prison is that if their child does not already have a drug problem, he or she will have one by the time they are released.</P>
        <P>There are also statistics relating to the number of people incarcerated, briefly, for the most part, for the non-payment of fines.  The cost relating to processing such individuals for short stays in prison is really damaging.  It is often poorer, working class people who, by and large, opt to go to jail for the non-payment of fines.  It may seem easier to them to serve four days, two weeks or whatever in custody than to get together the money to pay fines of &euro;500 or &euro;600.  These people do not appreciate that when they are incarcerated, they acquire, for however brief a period, prison records.  Statistics show that many people who were originally imprisoned for the non-payment of fines, subsequently end up being reincarcerated for similar or other offences.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For ten years, we have been promised that a fines Bill would be enacted in order to allow fines <Col N="775"/>to be deducted at source.  In the past two weeks, the T&aacute;naiste announced that it will be introduced.  He did so after serving as Attorney General for five years and as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for another five.  One of the key reasons that certain types of people, particularly working class individuals, end up with prison records is because there is no system in place in respect of the payment of fines.  In the dying days of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government, which has been in office for almost ten years, this matter will, apparently, finally be addressed.</P>
        <P>Like much of the other legislation introduced by the T&aacute;naiste, this Bill has undergone an extraordinarily long gestation period.  We sometimes hear about Bills for many years and then, at the last minute, they are hurriedly introduced with hundreds of amendments.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that the proposal in this Bill to make the Minister a planning authority is an unusual development in Irish law.  It is also wrong.  The position of rapporteur to receive submissions in respect of the planning process represents phony consultation of the worst kind and, ultimately, it will be challenged in the courts.  I expect that the courts will see through it and probably throw it out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Prisons Bill 2006.</P>
        <P>Before commenting on the detail of the legislation, I must deal with two points raised by Deputy Burton.  The first of these was her statement that she is surprised that the T&aacute;naiste has taken upon himself the power of a planning authority to grant planning permission in respect of large prison developments.  That is not my reading of the legislation.  As I understand it, a resolution will be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas and an Act of the latter will be required.  In such circumstances, the Oireachtas and not the Minister of the day will be the planning authority.  It might suit the Deputy to personalise matters in respect of the T&aacute;naiste but everyone knows that she is not being accurate and that she is being somewhat mischievous.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has also blown out of the water all credibility regarding objections to Thornton Hall by local residents.  I was amazed by her comments in this regard.  She actually stated that it would have been better to build the children&rsquo;s hospital rather than the prison at Thornton Hall.  Let us analyse the logic of her comments.  The Deputy is stating that people would have been happy with the children&rsquo;s hospital.  In such circumstances, the arguments they made regarding consultation and the assessment, price, zoning and usage of sites would be of no relevance if such a hospital were built on the site.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Such a development would have to go through the planning process.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="776"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy effectively stated that there would be no difficulty if the Government had done everything it did in respect of Thornton Hall and then built a hospital on the site.  She is actually saying that the residents have no objections to the entire procedure to date and that they just do not want a prison built near their area.  They have no difficulty with sick children but they do not want prisoners.  The Deputy has shown up the residents&rsquo; objections to this development as being shallow.  I am stunned that she stated that they would have no problem with the Government locating a large institution at Thornton Hall as long as it is not a prison.</P>
        <P>I incurred the wrath of residents from the area in question by being forthright in my statements about this matter at the Committee of Public Accounts.  I speak with some authority on this matter because I come from Portlaoise town, in which two prisons are situated.  The Deputy indicated that Portlaoise would be a suitable site for another prison.  We already have two prisons and have no difficulty in that regard.  The residents&rsquo; fears regarding the prison at Thornton Hall are unfounded.  It now transpires that they have no real objections to the procedure, the price, etc., they just do not want prisoners in their area.</P>
        <P>I am amazed that the Deputy has blown the cover of the objectors.  I have always said that it is simply a case of &ldquo;not in my back yard&rdquo; but down in your back yard in Portlaoise would be all right.  We do not mind that.  I would respect the objectors far more if they came to us, made their submissions and stated, in an honest manner, that they do not want a prison at Thornton Hall.  They have not done so and instead have come up with convoluted arguments regarding the process, the price, etc.  We now know that they have no objections in respect of the latter and that their only real objection is to the use of the facility as a prison.  The Deputy has blown the objectors&rsquo; cover, undermined and damaged their case and weakened any argument they might have had in respect of this issue.</P>
        <P>On planning matters, the Deputy referred to the right of members of the public to object.  There are far more rights contained in this legislation in respect of public participation than there are under the existing planning legislation relating to prisons.  I am familiar with what happened in Portlaoise in recent years.  One can go to the local Garda station and look at a little sketch to see what the outer wall of the prison looks like.  That is about as much as one can do under the existing arrangements.  We are now putting in place a plethora of procedures such that the system will comply with the highest EU standards.  I am sure that the environmental impact statements, etc., will comply fully with what is required under such standards, which is not the case at present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Burton also stated that the legislation is unconstitutional because people will not have the right to take their concerns to An Bord <Col N="777"/>Plean&aacute;la.  She is again talking nonsense.  The Deputy was a member of a local authority that on many occasions, under what is now Part 8, approved projects and housing and other local authority developments.  Our colleagues on local authorities throughout the country continue to grant such approvals and there is no right of appeal on the part of members of the public to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of planning decisions made under that process.</P>
        <P>It is a normal feature of local planning matters that once a local authority makes a decision on a project it is sponsoring, there is no right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I agree with the Deputy that this is not right but it is not correct to state that it is a new development being introduced in the legislation before us.  The fact that it is being discussed in the national Parliament will make the planning process far more rigid than would be the case if it if was being done through a local authority.</P>
        <P>Prisons are not matters for local authorities because there are bigger issues involved.  The new prison under discussion will serve the greater Dublin area and, in that context, the decision in respect of it should not be left to a local planning officer.  I am pleased that responsibility in this regard is being bestowed upon the House.  They are just a few observations regarding some of the comments made in recent minutes.</P>
        <P>I am happy to discuss certain aspects of the Bill.  I have reservations in respect of some of them, however, especially the contracting out by the Minister of the prisoner escort service.  I have a fundamental problem with that.  The section dealing with financial implications states that in the light of the Prison Officers Association&rsquo;s acceptance of the proposal for changes in work practices last year, it is not intended to outsource prison escort services in the foreseeable future.  It further states that, nevertheless, the provision is being made in the event that it is done.  It states that the financial implications cannot be quantified at this stage because there are so many variables that may arise when the time comes.</P>
        <P>The only variable I want to see when the time comes is the actual cost of providing this service versus the cost of a well-managed prisoner escort service run by the Prison Service.  I have no doubt that if the Prison Service ran the prison escort service in an efficient manner, there is no reason it cannot be as cost effective as a contracted out service.  If a Minister wants to go down that road, which I hope will not happen, I and other Deputies, if we are still Members, will hold the Minister to account to prove the financial case for outsourcing that service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Outsourcing may appear cheaper but will it be better?  There may be more escapes and more risk to the public.  The cash in transit industry has shown itself not to be capable of dealing with these issues.  The number of raids recently involving the transport of cash appears to indicate that that industry is less than capable of dealing with <Col N="778"/>the transport of prisoners.  If, for argument&rsquo;s sake, we had a bloody-minded Minister who only wanted the cheapest possible option regardless of the outcome, I would say we should examine what it would cost the Prison Service to determine if proper management changes could produce a more efficient service internally.</P>
        <P>There is no good reason this service should be outsourced.  It is not a matter of principle.  It should be a straightforward matter of pragmatism.  I spoke earlier on the National Development Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill, the public private partnership Bill, and I see Thornton Hall may come under that process as well.  It is not a question of ideology; it is pragmatism.  I have no problem with the public or the private sector doing something or a combination of both.  Whatever delivers the best service for what is required in the circumstances in an efficient and effective manner to the taxpayer should be the guiding principle.</P>
        <P>Other aspects of the Bill concern the establishment of an office of the inspector of prisons, prisoners to participate in certain television links between prisons and courts, disciplinary procedures and the issue of planning provision for the construction of new prisons and extensions to existing prisons.  I do not have a problem with that section in the legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Prison officers have a tough job and I would like to make a case on behalf of retired prison officers.  I am chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service which has been dealing with the case of retired prison officers who are requesting pensionability of their rent allowance.  They have put their case to the Department of Finance, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and our committee.  They will put a submission before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service again tomorrow on that issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The case they make is that their rent allowance was more akin to their salary; it was not an allowance.  The Department of Finance deliberately muddied the water and did not deal with the specific case in any correspondence between the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and the Department.  It broadened the issue to the generality of allowances in the public service, which is not the issue.  We have asked the Department to deal with the specific issue of rent allowance.  Retired prison officers have made the case to our committee that the rent allowance paid to them was more akin to their basic salary in that it was paid regardless of whether they turned up for work, worked away from or near to home, did or did not pay rent, worked overtime or weekends, or were on sick leave, suspension or whatever.  They got the rent allowance once they got their basic pay.</P>
        <P>That separates that issue from the broad range of allowances we know were not pensionable prior to allowances generally being made pensionable in the public service.  One had to work <Col N="779"/>special hours to achieve all the other allowances.  This particular allowance came as of right with one&rsquo;s salary.  That is a specific case and it should be examined on that basis.</P>
        <P>Regarding the Thornton Hall issue, I ask the officials to check in detail the matter I am about to raise when reviewing the legislation.  I have mentioned it already to senior officials in the Department.  I have not checked the detail but the officials can check them, and once the Minister is fully aware of it, I would like it to be dealt with because I would not like a loophole in the legislation.</P>
        <P>I presume the planning process we are talking about will cover all services necessary for the provision of the development, for example, water, sewerage, electricity and communications by the local authority.  I understand from discussions with Fingal County Council to date that the council has established the size of the pipes needed to service the prison, which will be laid on public roadways.  I understand they will not have to cross many private lands but Fingal County Council has indicated that for the overall development of the area, it would wish larger pipes and a larger infrastructure to be installed at this stage to encompass the specific services to the prison and other services in the area.</P>
        <P>It is important to ensure other services required by the local authority but not strictly necessary for this development are not caught up in a planning dispute.  It is also important to avoid a situation where one is unable to make the case that some of the water pipes to the prison, while not necessary for the provision of the prison services, are being provided for the upgrade of water facilities in the region.  It may be necessary to lay a separate dedicated pipe specifically to serve the prison rather than have it incorporated in the local authority&rsquo;s piping network because I do not know how it will be separated otherwise.</P>
        <P>If this project is to be done under a public private partnership, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I ask that everything outside the perimeter of the site be excluded from the PPP contract because there are risks attached to that when dealing with a public road.  The PPP people will have a vested interest and financial rights over the prison for the number of years it is leased out.  The private company or international bank that finances this should not have any rights over the services in the Fingal area or north Dublin region in terms of water and sewerage or the provision of those services generally in the area.  I ask that a separate contract, as is the case in the normal tendering process, be agreed to deal with services outside the site.</P>
        <P>We had a PPP process in Portlaoise recently for schools and the Department of Education and Science rightly said that the contractors who tendered were only responsible for matters within the boundary of the site and any other services required would be provided by the Department <Col N="780"/>and the local authority in the normal manner.  I ask that to be done in this case as well.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I welcome the establishment of the office of the inspector of prisons but that should not undermine the excellent work being carried out by the excellent visiting committees in all prisons.  Most of the members of those committees are close to the prisons.  They have a good understanding, background and competence and have increased their experience.  The visiting committees do much work and I would like to see the inspector&rsquo;s reports being made available for discussion in a proper manner by the visiting committees.  I am aware these reports will be provided to the Minister who will be required to lay them before the D&aacute;il.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past ten years, Ireland has seen dramatic changes.  In the 1980s up to 50,000 of our best people emigrated every year.  Today our society enjoys strong economic growth and prosperity but, as a result, it also faces other challenges.  To address them, we must see them as opportunities.  As one who supports an open and inclusive society, stretching out to Europe and beyond, I believe the immigration issue must be addressed in a positive way.</P>
        <P>Establishing a forum on immigration would be a positive step in this regard.  I propose the Government establishes a forum on immigration in which all the varying interested parties &mdash; political parties, trade unions, employers, the ESRI, voluntary groups which support immigrant communities and those with other views &mdash; can discuss the issue in a calm, rational and intelligent manner and frame public opinion and policy.  The Government and Opposition parties can draw up the forum&rsquo;s terms of reference along the lines of the Forum for Europe.</P>
        <P>The opportunity exists for such a forum to be inclusive and embracing and to address any problems in the undercurrent of public opinion.  When immigration is raised at election time, elements can use it emotively for electoral purposes.  An individual may have genuine concerns about immigration but not have the confidence to express them.  These must be listened to because we cannot put our heads in the sand only to find societal problems with the issue in the next generation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Irish people have travelled throughout the world seeking employment and new opportunities.  Many of them have been the victims of racism and were not accepted by their adopted societies.  The Irish in England faced many diffi<Col N="781"/>culties for many years.  That same treatment must not be afforded to those who come to our shores.  If there is a downturn in the economy, some sinister elements will exploit this emotive issue for political gain or other motives.  It is important to foster a climate of respect for Irish citizens.  Equally, it is important that immigrant communities contribute and know how policy decisions are made to help them fit in.</P>
        <P>There is an onus on the Government to establish such a forum.  Society must grasp the opportunity in accepting the strong feeling of goodwill towards immigrant communities and embrace them.  More importantly, a positive policy must be forged to ensure all immigrants are welcomed and can make themselves feel at home.  We must ensure immigration is not exploited by sinister forces.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, welcomes Deputy Kelleher&rsquo;s contribution to the immigration debate.  A debate on the issue has been going on for some time and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform wants to take the opportunity to illustrate to those who may not have been engaged in it so far, the various ways in which it has been proceeding.</P>
        <P>In April 2005, the T&aacute;naiste launched a public consultation process on the subject of immigration.  The vehicle for this consultation process was a policy document, Immigration and Residence in Ireland, which he published outlining the Government&rsquo;s proposals for addressing the immigration system in a comprehensive and holistic way.  In addition to dealing with the individual areas of the immigration system from initial visa application to long-term residence, the document also set out the core principles underpinning an immigration policy.  These included the following: maintaining the safety and security of the State and its residents, promoting the common good, managing migration in an orderly fashion to serve the economic and social needs of the State and its residents, protecting human rights, protecting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s international relations, ensuring fair treatment of persons, achieving reasonable standards of transparency and providing satisfactory standards of service.</P>
        <P>More than 120 organisations and individuals made submissions as part of the process, reflecting a wide range of concerns and interests in the immigration system.  Following on from this, new legislation is being drafted that will overhaul existing legislation in this area, replacing six Acts going back as far as 1935.  Last September, the T&aacute;naiste obtained the Government&rsquo;s approval to publish the outline scheme for the new legislation.  He invited interested parties to make contributions on the legislation&rsquo;s contents.  The T&aacute;naiste also forwarded the scheme of <Col N="782"/>the Bill to the Human Rights Commission for its comments.  It is intended that the immigration residence and protection Bill will be published shortly.</P>
        <P>In the past month there were two notable and successful public events regarding immigration.  On 27 January, the T&aacute;naiste outlined to a conference organised by the Law Society of Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s approach on immigration, residence and protection.  The conference, New Rules for the New Irish, was open to the public and was oversubscribed.  It featured contributions, not only from the T&aacute;naiste, but also from a wide range of contributors from the platform and the floor.  The T&aacute;naiste also arranged for some of his officials to make presentations and to take questions from the public.</P>
        <P>On 1 February, another public conference on the related matter of integration was held in Dublin Castle.  This was co-organised by the UNHCR and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform through its refugee integration agency.  Attendance was broadly based and included academics, churches, intergovernmental organisations, NGOs in the immigration area, various interest groups, civil servants and migrants.  It also included speakers from the administrations of Denmark and the Netherlands who shared their countries&rsquo; experiences in this important area.  Interactive workshops were organised where groups of participants exchanged views in an informal setting.  The T&aacute;naiste is amenable to the Department continuing to participate in and organise such events.</P>
        <P>The debate is also carried on, locally and nationally, on television, radio and through newspapers.  Deputy Kelleher referred to providing an environment for organisations, including political parties, to express their views on immigration.  The Houses of the Oireachtas represent one element of that environment as far as political parties are concerned.  The new legislation will help provide a real opportunity to have a wide-ranging discussion on the subject.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste does not see the need for a new structure to facilitate a debate on immigration.  The debate is already taking place and there are many opportunities to participate in it.  It is important all groups involved in this area and others take the opportunity to engage in that process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important subject.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who is directly responsible for this matter.  I hope he will be able to provide an answer to a straightforward question.  When will the Minister for Finance approve funding for the Clonmel flood alleviation scheme?  There is great frustration and anger in Clonmel because of the way this issue was handled, particularly in the <Col N="783"/>last 12 months.  We were promised that work would begin last September and when this did not happen, we were told it would start in the spring.  Spring has come but there is still no sign of approval for the funding and commencement of the scheme.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will confirm that the Minister has approved the funding and that the scheme will commence as early as possible and not later than this spring.  In other words, construction must begin either this month or next.  The Minister of State is aware that the flooding situation in Clonmel is absolutely horrendous.  It was 12 years last Friday since approval was sought for this scheme.  I was mayor of the town when I chaired a public meeting on 9 February 1995 to consider a proposal to close the local Kickham Barracks.  We emerged from this meeting to discover the town had been flooded in the course of some 90 minutes.  I live on the far side of the town, in the Old Bridge area, and was only able to return home with the help of the Army, members of which have done Trojan work in this area over the years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been floods in Clonmel, to a greater or lesser extent, every year since 1995.  The quays were flooded again this year and damage amounting to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of euro was done to homes and businesses.  As the Minister of State well knows, it is not possible to obtain insurance cover in parts of Clonmel that are prone to flooding, including the Old Bridge area, O&rsquo;Connell Terrace, the quays, Irishtown and Parnell Street, where significant numbers of homes and businesses have been flooded over the years.  Residents and businesses in these areas have no way to secure insurance having been refused by all the insurance companies.  They had to rely time and again on moneys from the Red Cross &mdash; assistance that was welcome although not enough to cover the losses they suffered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We were promised construction of this scheme would commence last September.  In reply to a parliamentary question late last year, the Minister of State told me that this commencement date had not been possible but that work would definitely commence in the spring.  No moneys have been provided for this purpose, however.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment that the funding will be provided and that the scheme will commence this spring, that is, this month or next at the latest?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for the opportunity to update the House on progress.  The Office of Public Works has worked with the local authorities in Clonmel in recent years in developing proposals that would lead to the alleviation of the severe flooding which has existed there for a long time.  Deputy Healy outlined the problem in great detail. <Col N="784"/> However, I do not recall any flood incident this year.</P>

	<P>I am not exaggerating; the quays were impassable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>In May 2005, the OPW exhibited a set of proposals for dealing with the flooding problem in Clonmel.  These proposals included the construction of new walls, embankments and surface water systems, bridge replacements and new supporting walls to accept demountable flood barriers.  The entire project is broken into three separate schemes.  As there will be extensive use of demountable barriers in these schemes, the OPW commenced the design of an early flood warning system in 2005 in order to have a system in place which the local authority would have confidence in when the first scheme is completed.  The system is still undergoing development but has already proven consistent.</P>
        <P>The first scheme for implementation is the Clonmel west scheme.  Before construction can commence on the scheme, the proposals must be confirmed by the Minister for Finance, as required by the Arterial Drainage Acts.  The documents relating to the confirmation of the scheme were forwarded to the Department of Finance and are being considered.  The Clonmel west scheme is estimated to cost approximately &euro;16 million, and provision has been made for this within the OPW&rsquo;s budget for flood relief activities.  Tenders have already been received for the embankment elements of the west scheme and once the scheme is confirmed, the OPW expects to commence those works within a matter of weeks thereafter.  The main Clonmel west contract would then be expected to commence in the third quarter of 2007 and last for 18 months.</P>
        <P>When construction on the Clonmel west scheme is under way, detailed design will commence on the Clonmel north scheme.  It is anticipated that construction of that scheme will commence on completion of the west scheme.  Similarly, detailed design of the Clonmel east scheme is intended to commence once construction of the north scheme is under way.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be pleased to learn that I have also agreed to fund a separate contract to be carried out by Clonmel Borough Council for the removal of trees along the channel.  I understand the necessary surveys are being carried out with a view to undertaking these works later this year during the next environmental window.</P>

      <sTitle>Job Losses.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me once again to raise the matter of the haemorrhage of job losses throughout Donegal.  I refer in particular to losses in Donegal town and south Donegal.  It is almost two years since Hospira in Donegal town announced its intention to cease production with a loss of 560 jobs.  In February last year, Magee, one of the flagship companies of the Donegal textile industry, established there for more than 100 years, announced that 60 workers would be made redundant in its production sector.  These two announcements dealt a body blow not only to the economy of Donegal town and south Donegal but to the confidence of the entire community, particularly the business community.</P>
        <P>These job losses in Donegal town are only the tip of the iceberg that is the long litany of losses throughout County Donegal in the ten years since this Government and its predecessor took office.  A conservative estimate is that during these ten years, 12,000 jobs were lost throughout the county.  This leaves Donegal with four to five times the national unemployment rate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of the job losses include 3,500 at Fruit of the Loom, 700 at Unifi in Letterkenny, 200 at Comerama in my parish, 70 at the Donegal Shirt Company, 120 at Jaybees, 140 at Nenagh Models in Castlefin, 66 at Herdman&rsquo;s in Ballbofey, 115 at Dianorm in Gweedore, 300 at Ruib&eacute;ar Motair Teoranta, 50 at Europlas, 280 at Qualtron, 120 at BMR and 55 at Donegal Parian China in Ballyshannon.  The list goes on.  In 1998, a task force report called for the creation of 9,000 jobs by the end of 2005.  In 2007, however, only 1,000 jobs have been created.  That is the record of the Government.  That is why I continuously raise it in the House.</P>
        
        <P>Over three years ago Donegal town was designated as a decentralisation location for 200 staff of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  These jobs were to have been decentralised to Donegal town by the end of last year.  It is now 2007 and not one job has been relocated to Donegal town.  What has happened to those 200 jobs?  Is there a town in Ireland which deserves to be given a higher priority than a town which has lost 700 or 800 jobs in the past two years?  No wonder the town and its hinterland feel forgotten, ignored and overlooked.  We regularly hear of multinationals deciding to locate in other parts of this country, and good luck to them.  Time and again, Donegal, particularly Donegal town, seem to be overlooked.</P>
        <P>There have been task force reports and interdepartmental committees but we are still waiting for some concrete results on the jobs front.  Donegal has so much to offer interested industries.  It has a highly skilled workforce, excellent industrial relations and two first rate IT centres in the north west &mdash; one in Letterkenny and one in Sligo.  Unfortunately, 90% or more of the <Col N="786"/>graduates from Letterkenny IT have had to leave the county to use their skills elsewhere.  The price of housing is among the most competitive in the country.  The environment is pleasant and the roads are improving yet we are still unable to attract these jobs.</P>
        <P>An innovative solution which I advocated in the House as recently as last week is to apply a tax exemption which is already operational in the upper and mid-Shannon basins.  There is no reason it should not be extended to County Donegal.  It is already available in County Leitrim, the only county in the Republic with which we have a land border.  It would be natural and practical to extend it to County Donegal.  If that was done, it would generate much inward investment and activity and would create badly needed jobs in Donegal and in the tourism industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appeal to the Minister to get in touch with the agencies and address the crying need for employment in the area.  In many families the sole bread winner has been employed in one of these factories &mdash; in Hospira or Magee.  Many of them have financial demands such as mortgages and the cost of educating their children.  The constituency has two Ministers but it has been overlooked, ignored and taken for granted.  I ask the Minister of State to outline what he, his Department and the Government are doing to redress this unemployment imbalance in Donegal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy McGinley for raising this matter.  I can empathise with him as my own town of Youghal has lost over 760 jobs in the past two to three years so I understand the problems facing him.  My sympathies lie with the workers who lost their jobs with Hospira and Magee.  However, I am pleased to say that since Hospira made its announcement in respect of its Donegal plant, IDA Ireland has been working closely with the company to secure a replacement for the facility and has been very successful in this regard.</P>
        <P>In March 2006, Abbott, one of the world&rsquo;s largest health care companies, announced that it was acquiring the facility from Hospira and that it planned to make a &euro;36 million investment with the support of IDA Ireland to establish a manufacturing facility for its diabetes care products in Donegal town.  This new investment will create 155 high quality jobs at full production.  Abbott has now taken possession of the plant and the recruitment of key executives is under way along with the redevelopment of the site to meet the requirements of the new company.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The role of F&Aacute;S, the industrial training agency, is of particular importance in providing assistance and the agency&rsquo;s full range of services are made available to workers facing redundancy.  F&Aacute;S has conducted on-site interviews with the staff of both Hospira and Magee.  A total of 322 staff were interviewed from both companies, of which <Col N="787"/>150 are currently on F&Aacute;S training courses and a further 50 are on customised training.  F&Aacute;S continues to make its full range of services available to all those made redundant.</P>
        <P>As regards employment generally in Donegal, in July 2006 the Minister, Deputy Martin, published the report of the interdepartmental group on Donegal.  This group was established at the request of the Government following a number of major job losses in the county in recent years.  The group was asked to focus on the progress being made on infrastructural requirements to make Donegal a more attractive location for enterprise creation, particularly as it makes the transition from traditional to more modern and higher value-added industries.</P>
        <P>The report showed that Donegal has no shortage of advantages and opportunities in so far as the promise of a brighter future for its inhabitants is concerned.  There is a dynamic combination of State development agencies active in Donegal which are committed to enhancing the attractiveness of the county for business.  These agencies have demonstrated the ability to provide a clear vision and focus for future economic development.  IDA Ireland aims to pursue more knowledge-based greenfield foreign direct investment for Donegal and to convince existing IDA clients to transform their current operations into higher-value activities.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland will encourage and assist more innovative, technology-led companies and promote a greater level of start-up activity.  These actions are in response to the challenges facing traditional industry in the county which is under pressure for competitiveness reasons and both agencies, as well as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, are endeavouring to meet these challenges.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has also been very active in supporting the development of community enterprise centres in the north-west region which are critical to continued enterprise development in rural areas and to the development of an entrepreneurial culture.  Nine community enterprise centres in County Donegal have received funding of approximately &euro;2 million under the community enterprise centre scheme to date.  In the 2006 scheme, four applications were received from Donegal and funding was approved for two new centres.  Donegal town community chamber received approval for &euro;350,000 for the development of an 8,000 sq. ft. enterprise centre which is currently at the planning stage.  This centre will act as a key resource in nurturing business start-ups and in enhancing the environment for the incubation of new business ideas.  Approval was also given for funding of &euro;300,000 for the development of a 10,000<?oasys _jy ?>sq. ft. community enterprise centre in Carndonagh.</P>
        <P>Also at Donegal town, IDA Ireland has commissioned architects to design a 1,000 sq. m. office building at Lurganbuoy.  IDA has applied for <Col N="788"/>planning for the building and a decision from Donegal County Council is imminent.  It is planned to enter discussion with the private sector regarding the construction and provision of this building as soon as planning is received and I am confident that a substantial number of new jobs will arise from this initiative.</P>
        <P>In Ballyshannon, IDA Ireland has undertaken a significant amount of site development work on the industrial estate and this work is now complete.  The county enterprise board will continue to provide existing and new supports to micro-enterprises complementing the work of both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>The provision of much needed infrastructure has been highlighted as an obstacle to job creation in Donegal over a number of years.  I was pleased the interdepartmental report highlighted several developments under way or planned in the areas of roads and air transport, water supply and treatment, broadband, energy and education.  These have been solidified and strengthened in the recently launched National Development Plan 2007-2013.  Particular emphasis has also been placed in the national development plan on North-South co-operation and developments which will be a direct benefit to Donegal.  An important study on the development of the all-island economy has recently been completed and this sets out a clear and strong economic rationale for all-island economic activity.</P>
        <P>InterTradeIreland, the all-island trade and business development body set up under the Good Friday Agreement, is supporting the development of key business networks on the island of Ireland, including the North West Science and Technology Partnership.  This partnership between industry, academia and other key stakeholders is focused on strengthening science and technology-based innovation and business in the north west.  I am confident we will see major advantages for Donegal flowing from continuing progress to follow the re-establishment of the political institutions in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The north-west region is a priority area for IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland as the agencies continue to market this region strongly for new investment.  The job creation achieved over the past year is largely as a result of the ongoing commitment to Donegal by the State development agencies which will continue this commitment into the future.  The Deputy will be aware that there have been significant employment developments for Donegal recently.  In addition to the Abbott announcement, recent major job announcements include SITA, ZEUS, PowerBoard and AssetCo.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I assure the Deputy that the Government and the State development agencies are fully committed to fostering the environment for job creation in Donegal.</P>

     <sTitle>Special Educational Needs. </sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise a simple but urgent matter.  The matter I raise affects only one child and one family but it does so in a most profound way.  I do not often seek to raise a matter on the Adjournment and while I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for trade, it is disquieting that the only Adjournment matter which will not be responded to by the line Minister concerns autism and the fundamental needs of a child and a family.  That speaks volumes.  Autism is one of the most profoundly troubling issues facing families across the country and creates enormous and relentless difficulties.  It behoves us as a society to give every possible support to families who want to engage with autistic children and provide them with the best possible start because evidence has shown the importance of giving them the right support at the earliest stage of their lives.</P>
        <P>I will not mention the name of the family whom I wish to highlight.  They found a suitable home tutor for their child in September 2005.  The tutor was sourced with the help of the Cottage Autism Network in Wexford, an extremely reputable and well-respected network supporting families with autistic children.  The tutor in question also assists other children.</P>
        <P>It is obvious that time is required for autistic children to get used to a tutor.  The family is absolutely satisfied with the child&rsquo;s tutor and the remarkable and real progress the child has made since September 2005.  The mother of the child wrote a letter to me to say her child had made huge progress since she started with the tutor.  Previously she had suffered from many behavioural problems but, with the right treatment, they had disappeared.  The tutor was helping her to label everything, which had allowed the child to ask for food, a great relief for the family.</P>
        <P>The tutor showed the mother how to teach her daughter.  While it took a long time to trust somebody coming into her home to get to know her child, remarkable progress was being made until the Department of Education and Science intervened.  Sanction was given to keep the tutor only until 27 July 2007, the problem being the tutor&rsquo;s qualifications.  The Department has determined that the tutor&rsquo;s qualifications do not tick the boxes it requires.  The Department has no regard for the real progress the child is making and for the bond that has taken some time to establish.  It said it would continue to fund a tutor but that the family must find someone else.</P>
        <P>I have the testimonials and qualifications for the tutor in question, from eminent psychologists and experts in child intervention and learning processes and programmes.  Such people know the work of the tutor in question and assert the tutor&rsquo;s merit and value.  Apparently this is insuf<Col N="790"/>ficient for the Department of Education and Science.  The parents have been told to find somebody else by 27 July.  They have no knowledge even of how to access somebody else and they have absolutely no wish to do so.  They want their child to continue to progress, to use the bond with an existing tutor who is well regarded within the autistic community, is well-qualified and is doing the job.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to pass on the details of the case to the Minister for Education and Science and her Department.  I had hoped she or one of her Ministers of State might have been present for this debate.  The Department should relent and consider the substance of this case.  It should allow this practical solution to continue, so real help can continue to be given to this real child and real family.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the position of the Department of Education and Science on the qualifications of home tuition providers under the home tuition scheme.</P>
        <P>The home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as home tuition takes place outside of the normal school framework, there is need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned.  The usual requirement is for a fully-qualified teacher.</P>
        <P>A recent review of a number of applications for home tuition highlighted some cause for concern regarding the qualifications of proposed tuition providers.  The review determined that most of the nominated tuition providers were suitably qualified but over 130 had less than satisfactory qualifications.  For example, some did not have a leaving certificate level of education while others had no post-school qualifications.</P>
        <P>Parents and guardians who had nominated tuition providers with qualifications other than teaching qualifications were advised that these tuition providers were being accepted for the first school term, from September to December 2006, to allow time to undertake the review.  Following the review of qualifications, which took place in consultation with the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate, an extended list of qualifications acceptable under the scheme for children with autism was published.  This list is available on the Department of Education and Science website.</P>
        <P>Aside from recognised teaching qualifications such as the bachelor in education and approved Montessori training, the list includes certain qualifications in autism and in applied approaches to teaching children with autism, such <Col N="791"/>as ABA, PECS and TEACCH.  Third level qualifications in relevant areas such as psychology may also be appropriate depending on circumstances.  The tutor referred to by the Deputy is not a qualified teacher and does not have a qualification acceptable under the scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>So there is no flexibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore the parent of the pupil concerned was advised of the need to recruit a tuition provider with suitable qualifications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>From where?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Please do.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="792"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>However, in order to accommodate difficulties anticipated in sourcing a qualified tuition provider, an extension of sanction with the current tutor was given until the end of this school year.  It is in the interests of children that home tutors funded under this scheme be appropriately qualified tuition providers.  It is for this reason tuition providers will be required to meet the minimum qualification standard for the 2007-08 school year.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position of the Department of Education and Science.  I will consider the points he has made and raise them with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin.</P>

        <Quest> the number of children in Cork city in classes of more than 35; if she plans to reduce same; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[4883/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the number of children in classes of 35 or more in Cork city has been slashed by this Government from nearly 3,000 in 1997 to less than 300 in the last school year. It should be noted that where there are large classes in a school, this is usually because a decision has been made at local level to have small numbers in other classes. For example, one school in Cork city had a class of 36 and a class of 11, while another had a class of 36 and a class of 14.</P>
        <P>Since we came into office, this Government has hired 770 extra teachers in Cork as a whole. Huge progress has also been made in school staffing around the country. There are now no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002 and approximately 7,000 more than there were in 1997. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
        <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school. Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of <Col N="794"/>free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>

        <P>As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased <Col N="795"/>resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P><Col N="795"/>

	<P>My Department is to the forefront of design with respect to energy efficiency in school buildings. However, the length of the school day and school holiday periods generally impact on <Col N="798"/>the suitability of alternative energy options in school buildings. My Department&rsquo;s design guidelines set the benchmark for low energy design in schools and are clearly focused on energy efficiency and are based on solid energy research projects.</P>
        <P>It has been demonstrated that all schools designed and built to these standards can have an energy performance that is 2.3 times more efficient than International best practice and nearly five times more efficient than schools built in the late 80&rsquo;s.  My Department&rsquo;s policy is supported by a strong research programme with over twenty research projects at various stages currently in hand.</P>
        <P>A hybrid approach is taken with respect to low energy design in schools based on maximising natural resources and energy efficient technologies. Schools are positioned to maximise gain from the sun during the day for passive solar heating and natural daylight. Passive solar design saves 20 % of early morning heating period and adequate natural daylight when combined with automated lighting systems in the classrooms can eliminate the need for electrical light for up to 80% of the schools teaching hours.</P>
        <P>Energy efficient boilers and individual room temperature controls combined with a strong emphasis on air tight testing and high insulation levels minimise heat requirements. Water usage is minimised through automatic shut off taps and dual flush toilets, while local water blending valves are provided to prevent scalding. All of the above design features are included in the Department&rsquo;s Generic Repeat Design schools. My Department has developed a number of carbon neutral schools as part of research projects involving both geothermal and wood pellet installations and further projects are currently being assessed in respect of their suitability for wider rollout.</P>
        <P>The performance of my Department in the area of low energy design has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> her views on whether the cost of child care represents a considerable barrier to lower income students in participating in third level education; and if she will ensure that the maintenance grant system, through reform, will recognise same. </Quest>
        <QRef>[5048/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of initiatives funded by my Department, as well as by other government departments and agencies, which acknowledge the additional costs encountered by lower income students, including those with chil<Col N="799"/>dren, and support their participation in higher education.</P>
        <P>Major improvements have been made by this Government in both the income limits for eligibility and the actual grant levels for third level student support.  This includes the introduction of the special rate of maintenance grant.  The higher rate of this grant is now at a record level of nearly &euro;6,000 for the 2006/07 academic year &mdash; compared with just over &euro;2,000 in 1996/97.</P>
        <P>The childcare costs of a number of students are also supported under the ESF-aided Student Assistance Fund, which is resourced by my Department and allocated directly to students by their higher education institutions. In a 2005 review of access funding by the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education, some institutions reported that up to 60% of their students drawing on the Student Assistance Fund, did so to support childcare costs incurred while they were in higher education. Additional support to meet the needs of lower income students, including those with children, is made available by my Department under the Millennium Partnership Fund, an access measure provided through the community structures supported by Pobal.</P>
        <P>Greater affordability of childcare, linked to the creation of additional childcare places, has been a key principle in both the previous and current National Development Plans. This Government has provided unprecedented levels of funding for childcare in recent years. &euro;499.3 million was allocated to the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) 2000-2006 and some 41,000 places will have been created by the time the programme finishes.</P>
        <P>Going forward, childcare provision will continue to attract substantial investment under the new National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010. &euro;575m has been allocated to the new programme, which will be administered by the Office of the Minister for Children and aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality childcare services by supporting the creation of an additional 50,000 places. This Government also introduced the Early Childhood Supplement of &euro;1000 per child under six to help parents with childcare costs.</P>
        <P>The National Childcare Investment Sub-Programme of the NDP will be an important element in the Government&rsquo;s efforts to remove barriers to employment, education or training and to tackle educational disadvantage.  This sub-programme will see &euro;1.3 billion invested over the period of the current NDP.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may already be aware, I will shortly be introducing a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students in higher education which will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administrative system.  The new scheme will facilitate consistency of application, <Col N="800"/>improved client accessibility and ensure the timely delivery of grants to those who need them most. This, together with my commitment to ongoing improvements in the student support schemes including increasing the rates of grant and the income limits for eligibility as resources permit, will continue to build on our success in this area.</P>
        <P>There are clear indications that the increased investment of resources in this area over the last decade and more is now paying dividends and that targets for participation in higher education that were set in the 2001 Report of the Action Group on Access to Higher Education and the last National Development Plan 2000-2006 have been reached. For example, participation by mature entrants to full-time higher education has grown from 4.5% in 1998 to almost 10% in 2006.</P>
        <P>Surveys conducted by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) also indicate that access to higher education by young people from under-represented socioeconomic groups continues to improve. For example, in 2004, between 33% and 40% of young people nationally from the semi-skilled and unskilled socioeconomic groups went on to study in higher education compared to only 23% in 1998. New targets for participation will be developed in 2007, particularly as linked to the implementation of the new National Development Plan 2007-2013.</P>

	<P>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, including organising the holding of examinations and issuing the results of examinations. In view of this I have forwarded your query in relation to the statistics to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you.</P>
        <P>In the interim, although the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available for each of the past 10 years, I can provide the following information gleaned from my Departments Annual Statistical Reports for the years 2001 to 2005 inclusive. In 2001, of a total female Leaving Certificate school candidature of 27,167, there were 2,930 girls who took the higher paper in Chemistry giving a percentage of 10.79%.</P>
        <P>In 2002, of a total female Leaving Certificate school candidature of 26,119, there were 3,147 girls who took the higher paper in Chemistry giving a percentage of 12.05%.  In 2003, of a total female Leaving Certificate school candidature of 26,410, there were 3,248 girls who took the higher paper in Chemistry giving a percentage of<?oasys _jy ?><Col N="801"/>12.30%.  In 2004, of a total female Leaving Certificate school candidature of 26,119, there were 3,597 girls who took the higher paper in Chemistry giving a percentage of 13.77%.  In 2005, of a total female Leaving Certificate school candidature of 25,887, there were 3,488 girls who took the higher paper in Chemistry giving a percentage of 13.47%.</P>
        <P>A study on Who Chooses Sciences -- Subject Take-up in Second Level Schools was published by the ESRI in 2002. It identifies a range of factors which impact on subject take up and indicates positive research from other countries that a hands-on approach to science can encourage subject take-up.  The revised Junior Certificate Science syllabus was introduced in 2003 and was examined for the first time in 2006. The syllabus represents a significant change in the way science is taught at Junior Cycle including in the area of teaching methodology and assessment, reflecting international trends towards a more investigative approach to science education.  In particular, the syllabus provides for a move towards more practical and project work, with 30 practical experiments and investigations which can be carried out at different times over the period of the programme and presented for assessment as one of the components of the final examination.</P>
        <P>The Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2007 to 2013 sets out a range of measures to further strengthen science teaching and learning. It provides for reform of Physics and Chemistry in senior cycle, ensuring a continuum from Junior Cycle with the emphasis on project based hands-on investigative approaches and assessment of these as part of the overall examinations, allied with the embedding of key skills, a more applied focus and an emphasis on the inter-disciplinary nature of science in society forms part of the approach. Advice on reform of the science subjects in senior cycle is expected later this year from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment as part of Phase 1 of the reconfiguration of senior cycle.</P>

        <Quest> if she is satisfied that schools have adequate training and support to implement and maintain an effective anti-bullying regime in the context of growing evidence that children are being bullied in a variety of ways including the use of technology; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that any child would feel upset in school because of bullying &mdash; be it physical, verbal or what is being termed &ldquo;cyberbullying&rdquo; and I assure her that supports are in place to enable schools both to prevent bullying and to deal with cases that may arise.</P><Col N="802"/>
        <P>For a start, each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school Code of Behaviour and Discipline. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</P>
        <P>My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.</P>
        <P>My Department, through the National Centre for Technology in Education has also developed Policy Guidelines and Advisory Notes for schools and parents which deal with the issues of internet and mobile phone bullying.  I wish to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that I recently launched the &ldquo;think b4 u click&rdquo; new internet safety campaign. This new campaign seeks to raise awareness and promote safe, responsible practice by young people when on-line.</P>
        <P>The key messages of the campaign are:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be creative </P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />be yourself</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />but be in control.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The campaign has a strong peer-to-peer perspective and centres on an interactive on-line service, www.watchyourspace.ie developed by the National Centre Technology in Education (NCTE). This site offers practical tips and advice and supports teenagers who use the web. A key feature is the advice given from teenagers to teenagers on how to cope with the fall-out from abuses and misuse of social networking and picture-sharing websites.</P>
        <P>This new initiative perfectly compliments the other NCTE safety activities that are already up and running successfully such as Webwise, SAFT and the Once projects. If you encounter cyber-bullying the site offers invaluable help:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />DO NOT respond to the message as this will only make things worse</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />DO keep a record of the message so that the problem can be dealt with properly</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />DO block the sender and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />DO talk to someone in authority about what has happened.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Watch Your Space has presentations of the key findings from studies of teenagers&rsquo; use of the Internet by other teenagers. It is also integrated with an on-line helpline service from Childline. <Col N="803"/>The website will be promoted through a poster campaign in schools and supported by an educational and informational pack being sent to all schools.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is at present developing further guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour, as provided for under section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. Work on the guidelines is at an advanced stage and will be informed by broad consultation. It is envisaged that implementation will commence in the next school year.</P>
        <P>Once the NEWB Guidelines are in place, my Department will through the normal consultation process with the education partners ensure that the guidelines available to schools on countering bullying are revised to fully reflect the work done by the NEWB. Through the combined work of the Department, the NCTE and the NEWB schools will have available to them extensive guidance to enable them fulfil their responsibilities in relation to this issue.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also be interested to know that dealing with bullying has also been incorporated in training for principals through the Leadership Development for Schools programme. I have also stressed to the teacher unions the importance of not just having a written policy on bullying but also ensuring a climate in which it is not tolerated in any form and in which children know that if they make a teacher aware of bullying that it will be dealt with.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. Responsibility for tackling bullying naturally falls to the level of the individual school as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established. I am, however, anxious to support schools in tackling bullying and it is for that reason that so many supports have been put in place in recent years.</P>

        <P>The Physical Education Programme in senior cycle is set out in the Rules and Programme for Second Level Schools, and is constructed across 5 areas:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />that students be given the opportunity for students to follow programmes in an optional area,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to specialise in a PE area which has been taken at junior cycle,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />to undertake new activities</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />and to receive training in sports Leadership.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The time recommended for both programmes is two hours per week.</P>
        <P>Physical education is an integral part of the Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) programme. All LCA students must take two modules&mdash;Leisure Studies and Health Related Fitness&mdash;and there are four additional modules from which they can make further choices.</P>
        <P>Apart from the formal curricula, schools can take a range of measures to encourage physical activity among students during the school day and many provide extensive, broad-based programmes of co-curricular physical activities that are highly rewarding for both pupils and teachers alike. In particular, schools play a major role in nurturing and promoting the involvement of students in sporting activities in the wider community. Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland, the Football Association of Ireland provide extensive opportunities for such participation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 194 together.</P>
        <P>On the 1 February 2006 the Minister for Health and Children and I published the report of the Fottrell Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training. As part of these reforms I am increasing the annual number of undergraduate places for Irish and EU students from 305 to 485. I am also introducing a separate graduate entry stream which will provide 240 additional places per annum. These increases will increase the annual number of medical places from 305 to 725.</P>
        <P>The provision of a graduate entry stream is an important development in reducing pressures on aspiring medical students who until now have effectively had one chance of entry, based on their Leaving Certificate performance. Graduate entry, which will be open to second class honours, grade one graduates of all disciplines, will allow students to make a decision to enter medicine at a more mature age and should result in a more diverse range of entrants into the profession.</P>
        <P>The Higher Education Authority issued a competitive call for proposals to provide the new graduate entry programme on 24th November 2006, with a view to the additional places being provided on this programme in 2007. The closing date for receipt of the proposals was 31st January 2007. These proposals will now be examined by an independent panel of experts. It is expected that recommendations on the location or locations of the new programme will be made to my Department in March 2007.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, details of the applications and selection procedure for entry to the new programme have recently been publicised.   The applications process will be managed by the Central Applications Office (CAO), with a closing date of 1 March 2007.   Entry to the new programmes is open to candidates who hold, or expect to hold by July 2007, a minimum II:1 (second class honours, grade one) result in their honours bachelor degree (NFQ Level 8) or equivalent.</P>
        <P>Candidates will be asked to undertake a separate admissions test, known as GAMSAT (Graduate Medical Schools Admission Test &mdash; Ireland), which will be used to select students for the programme.   The GAMSAT test will take place on 24 March and on-line applications to sit this must also be made by 1 March 2007 to the Australian Council for Educational Research.   Once decisions on the location of the new places have been finalised, those who have already applied for graduate medicine will be asked by the CAO to amend their course choice by indicating their institution of preference.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 120 together.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan contains a provision of &euro;252m for ICT in schools, the essential purpose of which is to advance the embedding of an e-Learning culture in teaching and learning in our schools.  I intend to publish a new ICT strategy this year covering the period of the National Development Plan to 2013. I am putting in place a Strategy Planning Group to advise on the most appropriate prioritisation of measures and their phasing over the timescale of the National Development Plan.</P>
        <P>As part of the development of this comprehensive new strategy, it will be necessary to consider and address a wide range of issues including teacher education, teacher professional development, curriculum developments, the maintenance of the national broadband network for schools, the upgrading and renewal of hardware and the provision of software and digital content for learning.  The planned investment will also address maintenance and support requirements.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan emphasises that schools will be required to prepare and implement an e-Learning strategy for the school as an integral part of whole school planning and development.  The school&rsquo;s e-Learning plan must be persuasive as regards the potential usage levels arising as a result of the investment and must clearly indicate how value for money will be achieved by addressing the expected outcomes and achievements for students along with indications as to how these outcomes and achievements will be measured.  In that regard, evaluation of e-Learning outcomes will be integral to the school self-evaluation commitments required from schools and teachers under the Towards 2016 agreement.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to now build on recent investment in the provision of networking grants to schools and the Schools Broadband Access Programme in developing the new ICT Strategy, based on the investments outlined in the NDP.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The census for the current school year (2006/2007) is currently being worked on.</P>
        <P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.  Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
        <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06. The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.</P>
        <P>But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes. I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further <Col N="808"/>improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism, receive an education appropriate to their needs, through the primary, special and post primary schools system.</P>
        <P>My Department provides a wide range of supports and additional resources to support children with special educational needs, including autism.  These services include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />additional teaching support where a child is fully integrated into a mainstream school</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reduced pupil-teacher-ratios where the child is in a special class attached to a mainstream school or a special school</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />special needs assistant support for a child who has care needs</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />assistive technology where this is recommended</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />specialist equipment such as modified desks and chairs as required, and &mdash; specially adapted school buildings where necessary.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As a further support, many smaller schools where autism units are approved by the National Council for Special Education can now have an administrative principal to assist with the establishment and running of specialist intervention locally.  In addition enhanced levels of capitation are available to special schools and mainstream schools with special classes.</P>
        <P>Children on the autistic spectrum may, depending on their individual needs, attend mainstream school on a fully or partially integrated basis or attend special autism-specific classes or units in mainstream schools or special schools.  The staffing complement in special classes for children with autism is one teacher and a minimum of two SNAs to each class of six pupils.</P>
        <P>Additional SNA support may be provided on the basis of the assessed needs of individual pupils.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is now oper<Col N="809"/>ational. A specific function of the NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is to identify appropriate educational placement for all children with special educational needs. The SENO is a focal point of contact for parents and schools. It is open to parents to contact the SENOs directly regarding their children&rsquo;s needs.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the National Council for Special Education authorises the appropriate levels of staffing to ensure the continued roll-out of autism provision.  This can be clearly seen from the number of special classes already in place:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />181 special classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />5 special classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />16 pre-school classes to provide early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />14 Stand Alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology on a pilot basis, 2 of these facilities have yet to be established.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Additional training supports for staff engaged in the education provision for children with autism can be accessed through the Special Education Support Service (SESS). The service will, as appropriate, consolidate, co-ordinate, develop and deliver a range of professional development initiatives and support structures to the relevant staff.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The new plan is the outcome of the first full review of all programmes for tackling educational disadvantage that have been put in place over the past twenty years.</P>
        <P>The new action plan represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multi-faceted and more integrated approach. This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for 3-18 year olds in this country.</P>
        <P>Under the new NDP, some &euro;361m is being made available under the DEIS and Early Edu<Col N="810"/>cation Sub Programme to combat disadvantage in primary and secondary schools serving communities with concentrated levels of disadvantage. The DEIS provision is in addition to existing annual educational disadvantage funding for primary and second-level schools of some &euro;140m.</P>
        <P>The key principle of early intervention underpins the early childhood education measure, the literacy and numeracy measures and those to tackle early school leaving being adopted under the new action plan.  Also central to the success of the action plan will be an increased emphasis on planning at school and school cluster level, target-setting and measurement of progress and outcomes to ensure that the increased investment is matched by an improvement in educational outcomes for the children and young people concerned.</P>
        <P>There is a need to ensure that schools participating in DEIS can continue to attract and retain well qualified personnel to positions of leadership and teaching on an ongoing basis. While all the supports, both human and financial, which are being provided under the action plan will contribute to achieving this objective,  a number of specific measures are being implemented on a phased basis in support of it. Targeted class size reductions of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes has been implemented in all 190 urban/town primary schools in DEIS. In addition, administrative principals have been allocated to all 338 urban/town primary schools in DEIS on lower enrolment and staffing figures than apply in primary schools generally.</P>
        <P>A sabbatical leave scheme is also being introduced to create opportunities for principals and teachers, who have served for a defined period in a school participating in DEIS, to apply to undertake a period of development to enhance their own learning and effectiveness, and bring subsequent benefits to their students and their school.  Access to this scheme will be extended to all DEIS schools on a phased basis and will provide for around 50 sabbaticals annually.</P>
        <P>Principals, teachers and other personnel in schools participating in DEIS will require professional development support to enable them to effectively implement the new approaches required and to make optimum use of the supplementary resources made available under the DEIS action plan. Consequently, a new initiative on pre-service and in-service professional development will be designed and implemented on a phased basis.</P>
        <P>Professional development for principals in schools participating in DEIS, including programmes supporting the development of skills in the areas of strategic leadership and change management, with the assistance of the Leadership Development in Schools programme. I believe that the inclusive, proactive approach being adopted under the DEIS action plan and the specific measures that I have outlined will ensure <Col N="811"/>that there will be no shortage of committed and motivated staff.</P>

	<P>I have no plans to introduce information and communications technology (ICT) as a discrete subject for the junior certificate. Recent thinking on ICT in schools is that the best way to learn ICT skills is to apply them in a meaningful context. Based on this, the focus in Ireland is on developing and promoting the use of ICT as a tool for teaching and learning across the curriculum. A national evaluation of the implementation of ICT in teaching and learning in primary and post primary level schools has been completed, and the report will be available later this year.</P>

This will focus on meeting the demands of a growing school population, with an anticipated 100,000 additional primary places over the next seven years. It will address the need for curriculum reform and innovation, the need to support ongoing teacher professional development and will provide for modernised and enhanced facilities throughout the school system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A total of 7,800 individual school building projects were delivered for the &euro;2.6 billion investment under the 2000--2006 period of the last NDP. The completion of building projects under the &euro;4.5 billion investment in the new NDP will benefit from recent innovations in delivery mechanisms that have allowed for fast tracking of priority school developments. Schools are seeing that activity under the new Plan is already under <Col N="813"/>way, with 1,500 school building projects due to be delivered in 2007.</P>
        <P>The number of building projects under consideration can change on a day to day basis as new applications are received and existing applications are progressed in my Department.  These projects are assessed and prioritised in accordance with the prioritisation criteria agreed with the Education Partners. In this regard, it should be noted that a project&rsquo;s banding, or classification, can be subject to reassessment having regard to demographic developments in the area served by the school and also, for example, if on foot of a technical examination of the school it was found that the proposed project put forward by the school was not an appropriate design solution to meet the accommodation requirements.</P>

        <Quest> if the cap on the number of extra teachers allocated to schools to teach English to those whose native language is neither English nor Irish has been lifted; the way schools with large numbers of such children are being assisted; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>In order to ensure that children whose first language is not English can succeed at school, my Department gives additional support to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional temporary teacher posts or portions of teacher posts.  Guidelines have also been produced for teachers on teaching English as an additional language, and these are available on the NCCA website.</P>
        <P>The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of non-English speaking students enrolled. Each school management can decide on the structure of the support to be provided in its own school. An allocation of 2 years&rsquo; language support for each pupil is provided by my Department.</P>
        <P>Recent years have seen a significant rise in the number of language support posts being provided by my Department. In the current school year, there are more than 1,250 such teachers in our schools.  This compares with approximately 820 language support teachers last year and just 260 in the 2001/2002 school year.  Hence there has been more than a four-fold increase in language support posts over the past few years.  In addition to the full-time posts approved, grants towards the cost of employing part-time teachers are paid to primary schools with between 3 and 13 eligible non national pupils.  In the 2005/06 school year, 409 schools sought grant aid under this provision.</P>
        <P>Between extra language support posts and grant aid, the level of support provided to schools to meet the needs of children whose first langu<Col N="814"/>age is not English has increased dramatically in recent years. Nonetheless I am very conscious of the pressures on schools that have large numbers of non-English speaking children enrolled. I am determined to provide greater support for these schools. To that end, provision has been made in the 2007 Estimates for an extra 200 language support teachers in 2007. A further 350 posts will be provided under the Towards 2016 partnership agreement between 2008 and 2009. I can assure the Deputy that the additional resources will be targeted at those areas where they are most needed.</P>

	<P>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, including organising the holding of examinations and issuing the results of examinations. In view of this I have forwarded your query in relation to the statistics to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you. In the interim, although the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available for each of the past 10 years, I can provide the following information gleaned from my Departments Annual Statistical Reports for the years 2001 to 2005 inclusive.</P>
        <P>In 2001, of a total female Leaving Certificate school candidature of 27,167, there were 1,696 girls who took the higher paper in Physics giving a percentage of 6.24%. In 2002, of a total female Leaving Certificate school candidature of 26,119, there were 1,769 girls who took the higher paper in Physics giving a percentage of 6.77%. In 2003, of a total female Leaving Certificate school candidature of 26,410, there were 1783 girls who took the higher paper in Physics giving a percentage of 6.75%. In 2004, of a total female Leaving Certificate school candidature of 26,119, there were 1,670 girls who took the higher paper in Physics giving a percentage of 6.39%. In 2005, of a total female Leaving Certificate school candidature of 25,887, there were 1,691 girls who took the higher paper in Physics giving a percentage of 6.53%.</P>
        <P>A study on Who Chooses Sciences -- Subject Take-up in Second Level Schools was published by the ESRI in 2002. It identifies a range of factors which impact on subject take up and indicates positive research from other countries that a hands-on approach to science can encourage subject take-up.  The revised Junior Certificate Science syllabus was introduced in 2003 and was examined for the first time in 2006. The syllabus represents a significant change in the way science <Col N="815"/>is taught at Junior Cycle including in the area of teaching methodology and assessment, reflecting international trends towards a more investigative approach to science education.  In particular, the syllabus provides for a move towards more practical and project work, with 30 practical experiments and investigations which can be carried out at different times over the period of the programme and presented for assessment as one of the components of the final examination.</P>
        <P>The Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2007 to 2013 sets out a range of measures to further strengthen science teaching and learning. It provides for reform of Physics and Chemistry in senior cycle, ensuring a continuum from Junior Cycle with the emphasis on project based hands-on investigative approaches and assessment of these as part of the overall examinations, allied with the embedding of key skills, a more applied focus and an emphasis on the inter-disciplinary nature of science in society forms part of the approach. Advice on reform of the science subjects in senior cycle is expected later this year from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment as part of Phase 1 of the reconfiguration of senior cycle.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that the annual statistical returns in respect of 2006/07 academic year will be submitted to my Department when the academic year is completed and all payments finalised. This is to allow for a complete picture in a full academic year and will into take account late applications for a grant.

        <P>In relation to the number of students receiving financial assistance under the student support schemes, the most recent figures show that over 57,000 students benefited under the schemes in 2005/06, of which approximately 12,500 benefited from the special rate of maintenance grant (sometimes known as the &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; grant) in addition to the basic maintenance grant. The top-up grant was introduced by this Government to provide greater assistance to the most disadvantaged students, and in this regard it should be <Col N="816"/>noted that the maximum amount of grant support available this year is &euro;5,970 (including the special rate of maintenance grant) compared to just &euro;2,032 in 1996/97.</P>

        <P>Arrangements have been made for the introduction of a new subject Technology in the Leaving Certificate, as a progression option from junior cycle, with effect from September 2007. In addition, a revised syllabus in Leaving certificate Design and Communication Graphics (previously known as Technical Drawing) will be implemented. Both subjects will be examined for the first time in 2009. These changes are being supported by a major programme of investment in professional development for teachers, and a &euro;40m investment in equipment renewal and upgrading for the technology subjects. These developments are an important step in ensuring that our students are prepared for further education and the world of work in an economy that will be increasingly driven by technological change.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has submitted proposals in relation to future directions in Mathematics and Irish in December.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 126 and 218 together.</P>
        <P>The position is that teaching practice is an integral part of the curriculum for the training of both primary and post-primary teachers and, as such, my Department does not provide special financial assistance for students towards costs associated with teaching practice.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that teacher education programmes provided in approved third level institutions are also approved courses for the purposes of the Higher Education Grants Scheme. Under the terms of the Scheme, grant holders who are required to participate in off-campus placement as part of their course of study may have their grant entitlement paid in the normal manner. Accordingly, student teachers who are eligible for grant assistance continue to receive their entitlements while undertaking teaching practice.</P>
        <P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students which are administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees. The Higher Education Grant Scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
        <P>An approved third level course for the purpose of the HEG and the VEC Scholarship Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year&rsquo;s duration pursued in an approved institution. The Schemes outline their respective courses which are approved for grant purposes. Any student who is eligible to receive a maintenance grant under these Schemes continues to have the grant paid to them during their teaching practice.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department allocates funding each year to third level institutions under the Student Assistance Fund. This fund is available in order to assist students who may be experiencing <Col N="818"/>difficulties in continuing their studies because of financial hardship. In the academic year 2004/05 the allocation to this fund was &euro;206,897 and in the academic year 2005/06 it was &euro;215,637. The disbursement of this funding is a matter for individual institutions in line with guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
        <P>My Department has no plans to introduce an additional scheme of financial assistance, over and above the current provision, in relation to the training of teachers.</P>

	<P>The EC (2001) Communication on Lifelong Learning defines three types of learning: formal, non-formal and informal learning. Non-formal learning is defined as learning that is not provided by an education or training institution and typically does not lead to certification.  It is, however, structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support).  Non-formal learning is intentional from the learner&rsquo;s perspective.</P>
        <P>There is no formal structure for the funding of the non-formal education sector. However, my department through the Community Education Programme funds the type of education outlined in the definition of non-formal education for adults. The Community Education Programme is one of a suite of adult education programmes designed to provide those adults who want to return to education with a second chance. The nature of the funding provided is at the discretion of the VEC. One form of regular support is through the provision of tutor hours to local groups.</P>
        <P>Funds for Community Education services are provided by my Department to the Vocational Education Committees. The disbursement of these funds is a matter for each VEC, which, subject to its budget, decides the nature of the Community Education service to be provided in its area and the manner in which the funds should be spent. It is open to the groups involved in the non-formal education sector to submit applications to their local VECs for funding for their activities.</P>
        <P>The Back To Education Initiative (BTEI) Programme, Community Strand element, is another programme in the suite of adult education programmes mentioned previously that provides funding to community groups for non-formal education to adults. The non-formal education activities in the Community Education Programme and the BTEI Community strand programme include outreach activities, personal <Col N="819"/>development and confidence building work, basic tuition and literacy learning, parenting courses, pre-development, taster courses to encourage people to return to education, other hobby and leisure type courses.</P>

	<P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One is the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. The 1978 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.</P>
        <P>The 1978 scheme has been superseded by a more extensive school support grant scheme towards the funding of ancillary services in schools including secretarial services. The scheme is flexible in nature giving Boards of Management and schools discretion as to the manner in which these services are provided. The terms and conditions of employment are matters for agreement between the employee and the authorities of each school. The Department does not stipulate any rules concerning how the secretarial services are to be obtained by schools. Accordingly the arrangements are suited to local needs and are not standard across the sector.</P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for primary and voluntary secondary schools. I wish to draw the attention of the Deputy to my announcement of further significant increases in the context of the 2007 estimates. From 1 January 2007 the standard per capita grant for secondary schools was increased by a further &euro;18 to &euro;316 per pupil. In addition, the support services grant was increased by a further &euro;30 for voluntary secondary schools, which includes a further equalisation measure, to &euro;189 per pupil. For such schools this cumulative increase of &euro;48 per pupil brings the aggregate grant to over &euro;500 per pupil from 1 January 2007. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example, in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this will bring annual grants towards <Col N="820"/>general expenses and support service to over &euro;290,000.</P>
        <P>At primary level, the basic rate of capitation was increase by &euro;18 per pupil to a level of &euro;163.58 per pupil from 1 January 2007. The ancillary services grant was also increase by &euro;6.50 to &euro;145.50 per pupil. Taken together, these increases mean that primary schools eligible for the full ancillary services grant will get &euro;24.50 extra per pupil to cover their day to day running costs in 2007, with a primary school of 300 pupils getting nearly &euro;7,400 extra. In fact, this 300 pupil school will get approximately &euro;93,000 from my Department in 2007 to meet such costs.</P>
        <P>The provision that I have made, in the context of the 2007 estimates, for these significant increases in the funding of primary and voluntary secondary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government has shown an unrivalled commitment to ensuring that children and young people with special needs get the extra support they need in order to reach their full potential at school. We have dramatically expanded investment in special education in recent years and we have improved access to the state examinations for young people with special needs.</P>
        <P>Annotations on certificates only apply in situations where a core area of a subject is not assessed, or where the mode of assessment used has the same effect. This is used to ensure fairness and integrity vis a vis other students who have been assessed in these components, and in order not to mislead the end user of the certificate. The scheme was introduced following the report of an expert advisory group, and the introduction enabled opportunities to be provided for exemptions where a candidate was not in a position to demonstrate achievement in a core area of assessment.</P><Col N="821"/>
        <P>The recent findings of the Equality Tribunal on the issue have been appealed to the Circuit Court. I have also asked the State Examinations Commission to re-examine policy and practice in this area. It is important that our system continues to evolve in line with best practice, promoting high standards of quality and integrity while ensuring access, participation and benefit for all our students. I do not anticipate that changes will be made to practice in this area in advance of the outcome of the review and the findings in regard to the appeal.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 178 together.</P>
        <P>The Trustees of the school referred to have confirmed their intention to close the school and have recently reaffirmed to the Department that the closure will be on a phased basis and will commence in September 2007, with all students in junior cycle being given the option of proceeding to senior cycle, including the opportunity to avail of a transition year.  The Trustees have also confirmed that the current site will not be available for the provision of post-primary education once the school closes.</P>
        <P>Having considered the immediate implications of the decision by the Sisters of Mercy, I can confirm that the Department will facilitate the enrolment in Gort Community School of students from the Kinvara area  by changing the existing catchment area.  The Department will be meeting with the school authorities to discuss the matter.</P>

	<P>The process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places. Liaison with existing schools is also an important part of the process, as the school authorities would usually alert the Department where, in their view, the need for additional accommodation is anticipated. In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision, or that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity or provide new infrastructure where necessary.</P>
        <P>In addition, Local Authorities are obliged by statute to refer draft local area  development plans to the Department for observation and comment so that lands can be zoned for future education use. There are numerous sites reserved for education purposes particularly in the rapidly developing areas so as to ensure that there will be sufficient land set aside and available for the future development of education infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Over and above the statutory consultation provisions in relation to local authority draft area development plans, the Department has in recent years worked to strengthen contacts with local authorities to enable informed decisions to be made in planning future educational provision.</P>

	<P>The Road Safety Authority has already commenced work on a number of key areas including the development of a Road Safety programme for use in Transition Year. This work is <Col N="823"/>being undertaken in co-operation with my Department and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>
        <P>I believe that schools have a role to play both in teaching students about road safety issues and in helping them to develop the attitudes necessary to promote safe behaviour on the roads. The Social Personal and Health Education programme, which is mandatory in primary schools and at junior cycle level, provides a framework under which the generic values and skills which underpin responsible decision-making, and respect for the rights and safety of others can be developed and promoted among students. SPHE has a specific personal safety strand within the programme, and this provides a mechanism through which road safety issues for all can be best dealt with in an age appropriate way.</P>
        <P>Specific materials for teaching young people about road safety have also been given to schools. At the start of the 2001/02 school year the National Safety Council, with assistance from my Department, distributed copies of Staying Alive &mdash; a road safety resource for Transition Year and the Senior Cycle &mdash; to all second level schools. This pack contained a wide range of learning opportunities and activities on topics such as personal responsibility and decision-making, environmental issues and risks and rules for road users. A CD-ROM with additional material downloaded from the Internet was included in the pack along with copies of the Rules of the Road. In the preparation of the Staying Alive resources material, views were sought from a range of organisations with interests in the promotion of road safety. Prior to its issue to second level schools, the material was piloted in 20 schools and the response from teachers in those schools was very positive. This is also supplemented by Garda visits to primary and second level schools during which the themes of crime, road safety, personal safety and substance abuse are explored as part of the SPHE programme. There were some 1900 school visits in 2005.</P>
        <P>So, not only is there a curricular framework in place already in which the importance of road safety can be taught to our young people, but this is supplemented by specific teaching materials and by a comprehensive programme of Garda visits to schools. My Department will continue to work with the Road Safety Authority to strengthen the role of schools in promoting road safety even further.</P>

	<P>The information regarding the number of home tuition grants applied for, approved and drawn down each year since 2000 to date in 2006 is not readily available in my Department.  However, officials in my Department have recently revised its record keeping arrangements and this information will be available in due course for the 2006/2007 school year.</P>
        <P>The home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as home tuition takes place outside of the normal school framework, there is need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned. The usual requirement is for a fully qualified teacher.</P>
        <P>A recent review of a number of applications for home tuition highlighted some cause for concern regarding the qualifications of proposed tuition providers. Parents/guardians who had nominated tuition providers with qualifications other than teaching qualifications were advised that these tuition providers were being accepted for the first school term, from September to December 2006, to allow time to undertake the review. A review of the qualifications supplied has taken place in consultation with my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, resulting in an extended list of qualifications acceptable under the scheme for children with autism. My officials will send details of these qualifications to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>As necessary, my Department wrote to the parents/guardians concerned to advise the outcome of the review. In some cases, where tuition providers&rsquo; qualifications were acceptable, letters of sanction issued to the end of the school year. In other cases, where the tuition providers&rsquo; qualifications did not meet the minimum requirements, the applicants were advised of the need to recruit a tuition provider with suitable qualifications. However my Department built flexibility into this arrangement to accommodate parents/guardians who were experiencing difficulties in changing to a qualified tuition provider by extending the sanction with the current tuition provider until the end of the school year 2006/07 to facilitate the recruitment process.</P>
        <P>It is in the interests of children to expect that home tutors funded under this scheme are appropriately qualified tuition providers. It is for this <Col N="825"/>reason that tuition providers will be required to meet the minimum qualification standard for the 2007/2008 school year.</P>

	<P>My Department is to the forefront of design with respect to energy efficiency in school buildings. However, the length of the school day and school holiday periods generally impact on the suitability of alternative energy options in school buildings. My Department&rsquo;s design guidelines set the benchmark for low energy design in schools and are clearly focused on energy efficiency and are based on solid energy research projects. It has been demonstrated that all schools designed and built to these standards can have an energy performance that is 2.3 times more efficient than International best practice and nearly five times more efficient than schools built in the late 80&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy is supported by a strong research programme with over twenty research projects at various stages currently in hand. A hybrid approach is taken with respect to low energy design in schools based on maximising natural resources and energy efficient technologies. Schools are positioned to maximise gain from the sun during the day for passive solar heating and natural daylight. Passive solar design saves 20% of early morning heating period and adequate natural daylight when combined with automated lighting systems in the classrooms can eliminate the need for electrical light for up to 80% of the school&rsquo;s teaching hours.</P>
        <P>Energy efficient boilers and individual room temperature controls combined with a strong emphasis on air tight testing and high insulation levels minimise heat requirements. Water usage is minimised through automatic shut off taps and dual flush toilets, while local water blending valves are provided to prevent scalding. All of the above design features are included in the Department&rsquo;s Generic Repeat Design schools.  My Department has developed a number of carbon neutral schools as part of research projects involving both geothermal and wood pellet installations and further projects are currently being assessed in respect of their suitability for wider rollout.</P>
        <P>The performance of my Department in the area of low energy design has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.</P>

        <P>Breakfast clubs provide a caring and supportive environment where young people can engage with their peers and discuss things in a social setting.  This also provides an opportunity to prepare for the school day.  Parents are also encouraged to become involved in running breakfast clubs, many of which are also supported by charitable agencies which bring with them expertise such as family support.</P>
        <P>The School Meals Programme aims to supplement the nutritional intake of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds in order to allow them to fulfil their potential within the educational system and also to reduce the risk of early school leaving.  In 2006, it is estimated that 69,903 children benefited in 1,008 schools under the local projects scheme and the urban scheme provided support for more than 386 primary schools, with 55,000 pupils.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs is providing funding of &euro;16.6 million for the programme in 2007- an increase of almost 60% on the 2006 provision of &euro;10.4 million.</P>
        <P>My Department has been working in close co-operation with the Department of Social and Family Affairs to ensure that the resources available for school meals are used to best effect and to further expand school meals provision in schools serving disadvantaged communities.  Each of the 873 schools participating in the new School Support Programme under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion will have access to the School Meals Programme.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;18 million has been made available to my Department from the Dormant Accounts Fund and the RAPID Leverage Fund to fund projects that aim to counteract educational disadvantage.  One of the measures under this scheme <Col N="831"/>provides for the enhancement of school dining areas via either the upgrading of existing facilities or the development of new dining areas.  The Measure also provides for small grants for schools participating or proposing to participate in the Department of Social and Family Affairs&rsquo; School Meals Schemes.  The provision of breakfast clubs will continue to be a priority for the Government in tackling educational disadvantage.</P>

	<P>The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.  The scheme contains a third level option.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14- ?><P>The number of participants availing of the Back to Education Allowance Scheme (Third Level Option) has grown since the scheme was first introduced in September 1990, from 67 to 4,310 in the 2005/2006 academic year.  Over the period since the scheme was first established, in excess of 10,000 people have been helped to attain third level qualifications in a range of skills and programmes thereby enhancing their employment prospects.  The eligibility criteria for participation in the scheme are considered reasonable and necessary by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in order to ensure that resources are targeted at those who are most in need, bearing in mind that the objective of the scheme is to assist people who have been claiming a social welfare payment on a long-term basis.</P><?oasys _dc0- ?>

Last April, I launched a <Col N="832"/>wide package of measures to promote Irish in primary schools.  These include the employment of cuiditheoir&iacute; at primary level to provide a programme of supports and in-service training for primary teachers and the delivery of a course in teaching Drama tr&iacute; Ghaeilge to primary teachers.  Other measures included the funding of Summer courses for 10-14 year olds in their own area, with an emphasis on sport and games through Irish.</P>
        <P>Proposals are also being developed for changes in how Irish is taught and examined at second level.  I have made clear my intentions to focus on improving students&rsquo; competence in the spoken language and making learning Irish more enjoyable.  Other issues, such as the appropriate emphasis to be placed on literature and culture, are also being considered.  I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on the matter shortly.</P>

	<P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school permanently excludes a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.  Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to re-admit a pupil.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently published the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  The Bill will give effect to the recommendations of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools and set out criteria to be taken into account in the section 29 appeal process.  These will include consideration of the right of the individual student to an inclusive education as well as the right of the general body of students and the whole school community to the maintenance of a school and classroom environment which is conducive to learning.</P>
        <P>The changes to Section 29 contained in the Bill will not alter the basic right of parents to appeal a decision to exclude their child from a school.  There is no evidence to suggest that the number of students excluded from schools will be significantly greater after the enactment of the Bill.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who <Col N="833"/>are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The Welfare Board has indicated that it will treat children for whom an appeal under Section 29 has been unsuccessful as priority cases in offering such assistance.</P>

	<P>In order to meet the language needs of the students in our schools whose first language is not English or Irish, additional support is given to the schools concerned which can take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of posts.  The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled.  The additional language support to an individual pupil is generally given for a period of two years.</P><Col N="834"/>
        <P>Schools with between 3 and 13 eligible pupils receive grant assistance towards the cost of employing part-time teachers.  Schools with 3 to 8 such pupils receive a grant of over &euro;6,300, while schools with between 10 and 13 such pupils receive over &euro;9,500. Over &euro;4 million is being provided for such grants in 2007.  Schools with 14 or more such pupils are entitled to one or more language support teachers, the number of which has increased dramatically in recent years.  There are now approximately 1,250 language support teachers in our schools.  More than 400 of these teachers have been allocated in the current school year alone.  As I announced last November, 200 extra posts were approved by the Government for 2007, bringing to 1,450 the number of language teachers that will be working in our schools this year.  This compares with just 262 posts in the 2001/02 school year.</P>
        <P>In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitments under the &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo; partnership agreement, a further 350 language support teachers will be provided between 2008 and 2009.  In allocating additional teachers, I will be addressing in particular the position of those schools catering for significant numbers of such children.</P>
        <P>Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive strategy is currently being finalised which will ensure that the extra investment in this area is being used to the best effect, and that it is underpinned by the right support and training for teachers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school Code of Behaviour and Discipline.  Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</P>
        <P>My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard.  These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.  My Department, through the National Centre for Technology in Education has also developed Policy Guidelines and Advisory Notes for schools <Col N="838"/>and parents which deal with the issues of internet and mobile phone bullying.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is at present developing further guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour, as provided for under section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.  Work on the guidelines is at an advanced stage and will be informed by broad consultation. It is envisaged that implementation will commence in the next school year.</P>
        <P>Once the NEWB Guidelines are in place, my Department will through the normal consultation process with the education partners ensure that the guidelines available to schools on countering bullying are revised to fully reflect the work done by the NEWB. with bullying behaviour.  Through the combined work of the Department, the NCTE and the NEWB schools will have available to them extensive guidance to enable them fulfil their responsibilities in relation to this issue.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also be interested to know that dealing with bullying has also been incorporated in training for principals through the Leadership Development for Schools programme.  I have also stressed to the teacher unions the importance of not just having a written policy on bullying but also ensuring a climate in which it is not tolerated in any form and in which children know that if they make a teacher aware of bullying that it will be dealt with.  The Deputy will also be aware that the education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the SPHE curriculum.  SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for tackling bullying naturally falls to the level of the individual school as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established.  I am, however, anxious to support schools in tackling bullying and it is for that reason that so many supports have been put in place in recent years.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146, 168 and 211 together.</P>
        <P>I believe that standardised testing, carried out on a systematic basis, has great potential to enhance the quality of teaching and learning for our students at classroom level, and to provide valuable information for parents about their children&rsquo;s learning.  I have accepted the advice from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) that, as part of a range of assessment approached, all pupils should take standardised tests in English reading and Mathematics at the end of first class or the beginning of second class, and at the end of fourth class or the beginning of fifth class.</P>
        <P>My Department has issued a Circular Letter to primary schools requesting that they ensure that standardised testing is implemented on an annual basis in the relevant classes beginning in the calendar year 2007.  With effect from 2007/8, the results of testing will be reported to parents in respect of their own children in accordance with a broader reporting template, designed to report progress on children&rsquo;s learning to parents, being piloted at present in a number of selected schools by the NCCA.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the measure is being supported by a national programme of teacher professional development in assessment for learning.  A grant of &euro;1.65m issued to schools in December 2006 for the cost of test materials, teachers&rsquo; manuals, test scoring services or test-related software.  It is intended that the implementation of standardised testing at school level will be complemented by a separate programme of national monitoring so that national trends in different categories of school can be tracked over time.</P>
        <P>A grant of &euro;3.60 per pupil has been issued to all primary schools to cover the estimated cost of the tests materials in English reading and Mathematics, based on the overall enrolment in the school for the previous year.  The NCCA is preparing guidelines which will assist schools in developing and implementing a policy on assessment practice in classrooms and on reporting to parents.  The guidelines will also provide teachers with information on what to assess in individual subjects of the Primary School Curriculum and how to use assessment information to plan for children&rsquo;s future learning in that subject.  These will be available to schools later this year.</P>
        <P>A national report card for recording and reporting data on pupils&rsquo; attainment to parents is also being developed by the NCCA. This will be piloted in a selection of schools in the current school year.  A national professional development programme in assessment for learning will be provided for teachers over a number of years.  This will aim to support teachers in placing assessment at the heart of the teaching and learning process, supporting children&rsquo;s cognitive, creative, affective, physical and social development.  It is intended that all teachers and princi<Col N="840"/>pals will have access to the programme on a rolling basis.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 202 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware the recent priorities for investment under the ICT in Schools Programme have been developing schools internal computer network facilities and ensuring schools have broadband access.  In relation to networking, schools were invited to submit proposals for the development of their networking capability in June 2004 and grants totalling some &euro;23m have since issued to schools.</P>
        <P>The roll-out of broadband connectivity to all recognised schools is being undertaken in partnership with industry, in the context of the joint Government &mdash; IBEC &mdash; TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) three year Agreement to fund local connectivity at school level.  The broadband connectivity is being provided via a Schools National Broadband Network supported by HEAnet, in order to provide managed Internet access, email, security controls and content filtering.  A broadband support service is being managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network.  The overall costs of the Schools Broadband Access Programme, including the initial set-up and ongoing costs over the three years, are in the region of &euro;30m.</P>
        <P>This investment builds upon the earlier Government investment in schools&rsquo; ICT infrastructure.  The number of computers in our schools continues to increase as is reflected in the 2005 census of ICT infrastructure in schools published by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE).  The census was conducted during the first half of 2005 and is the fourth in a series that began in 1998.  The 2005 census shows improved pupil to computer ratios at both primary and post-primary levels, finding one computer for every 9 children at primary school and one computer for every 7 students at post-primary.</P><Col N="841"/>
        <P>The NCTE continues to provide some 10,000 training places annually to meet the specific needs of teachers in their use of ICT, including technical courses, subject specific courses, and internet, web design and digital media courses.  The NCTE also provides advice to schools on the range of issues arising with the integration of ICT into teaching and learning.  Its Scoilnet portal provides access to a range of curriculum relevant digital content and the NCTE is considering the acquisition of a range of on-line reference materials.</P>
        <P>A further &euro;25m has been provided in grants to some 500 post-primary schools to enable them to upgrade their facilities to enable them to provide the new Technology syllabus and the revised Design and Communication Graphics syllabus at Leaving Certificate level, with effect from September 2007.</P>
        <P>Considerable investment has been provided for the ICT in Schools Programme to date and the ICT facilities in our schools have improved considerably.  Nevertheless I am conscious of the need for further investment to ensure that we are realising the full potential of ICT to improve the learning experience for our young people.  To that end, I intend to publish a new ICT strategy in 2007 covering the period of the National Development Plan to 2013.  The National Development Plan contains a provision of &euro;252m for ICT in schools, the essential purpose of which is to advance the embedding of an e-Learning culture in teaching and learning in our schools.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc. Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
        <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general <Col N="846"/>rule is that there be at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes. I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2000, the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education was established to advise the Minister for Education and Science on the development of a co-ordinated framework to improve access to higher education by mature students, socio-economically disadvantaged students and communities and students with a disability.</P>
        <P>The report of the Action Group was published in 2001. One of the principal recommendations was that a single, dedicated body was necessary to develop a framework for improved access and that a National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education should be established within the Higher Education Authority.  The National Office was established as part of the HEA in late 2003 and the core functions of this office are, in close liaison with the Department of Education <Col N="847"/>and Science and other stakeholders, to co-ordinate, advise and implement policy and funding measures to improve access to and participation in higher education by the key target groups.</P>
        <P>One of the first milestones for the office was the development and publication in 2004 of a three-year Action Plan for the period 2005-2007.  There have been a number of key outcomes from this plan, including the publication last year by the office of a national framework of policies and initiatives for successful higher education access programmes.  This framework, which was developed following a process of consultation and evaluation with higher education institutions, will underpin and inform the work of the National Office and its partners in the higher education sector from 2007 onwards. Implementation and the monitoring of progress will also be linked to the strategic development and allocation of core funding, including access funding, by the HEA and the allocation of increased third level access funding through the new National Development Plan 2007-13.</P>
        <P>A number of recommendations by the Action Group on Access were also in the area of student financial support.  In 2000, further to a preliminary recommendation by the group, a special, higher rate of maintenance grant for disadvantaged students most in need was introduced.  In 2005-06 over 12,500 students were in receipt of this additional support.  The special or &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; rate of grant is part of a wider Third Level Access Measure, under which the National Office also manages the allocation of over &euro;15 million in student funding through the Fund for Students with a Disability, the Student Assistance Fund and the Millennium Partnership Fund.</P>
        <P>Since the establishment of the office there have been improvements in the timing and guidelines for the allocation of these funds and in 2006, over 2,000 students with a disability received funding from the Fund for Students with a Disability &mdash; an increase of over 330 students (20%) over the previous year.  The Action Group also made some recommendations on the administration of the higher education grants scheme.  A new Student Support Bill will be shortly brought forward which will provide for a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students in higher education. This will, I believe, provide for a more equitable and efficient grant administration system, which will facilitate consistency of application, improved accessibility to financial support for students and ensure the timely delivery of grants to those who need them most.</P>
        <P>There are clear indications that since the publication of the report of the Action Group in 2001, the combined investment of resources and measures at all levels of the education system is paying dividends and that targets for increased participation in higher education by under-rep<Col N="848"/>resented groups have been reached and indeed exceeded.  For example, participation by mature entrants in full-time higher education has grown from 4.5% in 1998 to almost 10% in 2006. Students with a disability have risen from 0.8% of the undergraduate population in 1998 to a current level of some 2.4%.  Surveys conducted by the HEA also indicate that access to higher education by young people from under-represented socioeconomic groups continues to improve.  For example, between 33% and 40% of young people nationally from the semi- and unskilled socioeconomic groups currently study in higher education, compared to only 23% in 1998.  These targets will be reviewed and new targets developed in 2007, particularly as linked to the implementation of the new National Development Plan 2007-2013.</P>

	<P>The specific information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. However, the Deputy can be assured that my Department fully recognises the key role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve PE facilities for all pupils attending primary schools.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s design guidelines include, where appropriate for PE Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts. PE facilities have been provided, where appropriate, as part of my Department&rsquo;s record school building programme which between 2000 to 2006 involved the delivery of over 7,800 projects with an investment of &euro;2.6 billion. The budget for 2007 is the first year of the rollout of the new NDP which will involve an investment of over &euro;4.5 billion in school buildings over the next 7 years. This multi-annual funding will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach to the provision of modern school accommodation including PE facilities.</P>

	<P>As part of the multi-annual school building programme my Department has invested heavily in modernising school facilities through<Col N="849"/>out the country including science facilities in post-primary schools. Typically this investment involves the provision of modern science facilities in new post-primary schools or the upgrading of science facilities in existing schools either as part of a school building project or as a dedicated investment to facilitate the teaching of science.  Additionally I have provided for class materials, basic general equipment and chemicals for practical work for the Sciences.</P>
        <P>My Department also spent in excess of &euro;13m in 2004 to facilitate the introduction of a revised Junior Science syllabus. Schools received a basic grant of &euro;3,500 per science laboratory to enable them to provide the new curriculum. Additional funding was made available to schools where other specified equipment was required. In addition, certain schools identified as needing new or refurbished science laboratories as a result of a 1998 national survey received funding. Funding continues to be available to schools that had not originally applied for the basic grant of &euro;3,500 per science laboratory and for other specified equipment to enable them to provide the new curriculum.  Schools have also received funding under my Department&rsquo;s Summer Works Scheme to enable them to get science laboratories refurbished on a devolved basis.</P>
        <P>Provision of science facilities is an intrinsic part of many school building projects at post-primary level and it is not easily possible to break down this cost in the format requested by the Deputy.  However, the Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to take a proactive approach in the provision of the necessary facilities for the teaching of science in schools.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In early 2006, I announced an implementation strategy following publication of &ldquo;School Matters&rdquo;, the Report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools, and that strategy is now well advanced. At the core of the recommendations of the Task Force was the putting in place of a National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS). This has now happened with the appointment of a National Co-ordinator and four Assistant National Co-ordinators. In addition, nine Regional Development Officers and twenty part-time Associates have been recruited to ensure the success of this significant initiative. A key feature of the composition of the National Behaviour Support Service is the assignment to it of a senior psychologist and three psychologists. These have been seconded from the National Educational Psychological Service and their presence will ensure that the team operates in a multi-disciplinary way. A full-time administrator is based in Navan Education Centre.</P>
        <P>Since their appointment, the team has been working on a number of key issues:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. The development of a Draft National Framework for Behaviour Improvement.</P>
         <P LI="1">2. The development of models of good practice for systems in schools which assist with and impact on classroom and whole school behaviour.</P>
         <P LI="1">3. On-going training for the NBSS team.</P>
         <P LI="1">4. Research into and communication with behaviour support systems in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The NBSS has commenced its engagement with schools and a series of information seminars have been organised throughout the country. Intensive work will begin with a smaller number of schools most in need of this intervention, following consideration by the NBSS of applications from schools for this service.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that this new service will work intensively with those schools initially selected for inclusion in this development. I have already announced that part of this work will see us trialling the concept of a behaviour support classroom in up to 30 schools this year. I want to emphasise however that these classrooms cannot be, in themselves, a solution to the issue of poor student behaviour. They must be one part of a holistic response which should see a school, actively supported by the Behaviour Support Team, defining for itself a pathway to improvement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware that I recently published the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  The Bill will give effect to the Task Force recommendations and set out criteria to be taken into account in the section 29 appeal process. These will include consideration of the right of the individual student to an inclusive education <Col N="851"/>as well as the right of the general body of students and the whole school community to the maintenance of a school and classroom environment which is conducive to learning. In the 2007 Estimates, I have provided &euro;8 million to support the work of the NBSS, in helping schools promote positive student behaviour at second level.</P>

	<P>The Further Education Section of my Department gives an annual grant to all Vocational Educational Committees for the provision of Adult Literacy and Community Education. This fund may be used for the teaching of English to immigrants. An additional &euro;7.4 million has been provided this year in the budget for Adult Literacy and Community Education, which allows for 3,000 additional literacy places in 2007. This will bring the total number of literacy places to 38,000 compared to 28,000 in 2002.

	<P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will <Col N="852"/>pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</P>
        <P>Currently, the NEPS service is now available to some 1,604 primary schools (representing approximately 60% of pupils) some 1,678 schools, representing 40% of pupils, therefore have access to assessment under SCPA. As a matter of information service coverage also includes 565 post-primary schools (representing approximately 77% of students). This number includes 46 schools in the City and County of Dublin Vocational Schemes, which have their own psychological service.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that the number of psychologists in the Department has increased from 43 since the establishment of NEPS in 1999 to a current figure of 127, including 4 psychologists assigned to the National Behavioural Support Service. There are also a further 16 Whole-time-equivalent educational psychologists providing service through the Dublin City and County VECs. Taken together, there are currently 143 educational psychologists working in services paid for by my Department.</P>
        <P>I announced recently in this connection my intention to expand the number of NEPS psychologists by a further 31 in 2007. This will represent a significant increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS and bring the total number of psychologists in the system to 174. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in line with the Government&rsquo;s  &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo; commitments, the number of NEPS psychologists will be increased even further in each of 2008 and 2009, to a total of 193. At this point, including the 16 psychologists in the Dublin VEC areas, it is expected that the number of educational psychologists in the system as a whole will be 209.</P>

	<P>Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The census for the current school year (2006/2007) is currently being worked on. Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc. Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P><Col N="853"/>
        <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes. I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

	<P>A key focus of the Government&rsquo;s education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups. The wide variety of measures in place for tackling educational disadvantage and social exclusion reflect these concerns. These measures range from pre-school interventions, supports for tackling children&rsquo;s literacy problems, reduced pupil teacher ratios, increased capitation grants and measures to tackle early school leaving and strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community. In addition, there are interventions in support of youth, to facilitate access to third-level and to provide &ldquo;second chance education&rdquo; for young people and adults.</P>
        <P>The total provision for educational inclusion programmes in 2007 is nearly &euro;730 million across all levels of education. This represents an increase of nearly &euro;95 million on the comparable 2006 figure. The 2007 provision includes additional funding for the implementation of measures under the DEIS action plan at pre-school, primary and second-level, additional funding for further education programmes and an increase in provision for third-level student support schemes including the full year cost of the 22% increase in the top-up grant.  My focus in addressing educational disadvantage is to concentrate resources on front-line services and supports for those most in need. In this respect, the agencies working in the education sector have a key role in promoting equality of access, participation and progression.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>

	<P>I take it the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to fees for part-time students undertaking undergraduate courses at our higher education institutions funded by the State. The HEA Eurostudent Survey 2005 found that students who are availing of part-time studies tend to do so as part of their career development (some 69% are in studies closely related to their job) and/or with employer support. Around 33% of students paying course fees received financial support from their employer. Tax relief is available for these costs.</P>
        <P>To increase the levels of workplace learning and upskilling, this Government is committed under Towards 2016 to putting in place a targeted fund to alleviate the fees in public institutions for part-time courses at third level by those at work who have not previously pursued a third level qualification. The HEA have been asked to develop and submit proposals, including estimated costs, in relation to this commitment for evaluation by my Department.</P>

	<P>My Department recognises the unique contribution of special schools to the education of children with special educational needs (SEN) in Ireland and is committed to further developing this area. For example, my announcement in November 2006 of a 30% increase in the already-enhanced capitation rates in respect of pupils attending special schools and special classes in mainstream schools, is a clear demonstration of my commitment to supporting the important role of special schools.</P>
        <P>With inclusion of pupils with SEN becoming a reality for many mainstream schools, it is essential to develop mechanisms to facilitate the shar<Col N="857"/>ing of expertise in special schools and to begin the process of creating &lsquo;learning communities of schools&rsquo;.  The development of such a resource role for the special school is an acknowledgement by my Department of the value of these schools. My Department is most anxious that the skills and expertise that these schools have accumulated in supporting children with special educational needs is utilised to best advantage in providing for such children going forward.  In addition, it will provide clear pathways towards enabling all schools within a geographical area to liaise professionally in a collaborative and co-operative fashion.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I can confirm that my Department has commenced a review of special schools and special classes attached to mainstream schools.  The initial part of the review, which commenced in 2006 and is currently being finalised, involves the gathering and collation of information and views from relevant schools in relation to special schools and classes. This was undertaken on behalf of my Department by St Patrick&rsquo;s College, Drumcondra. One of the purposes of the review is to examine how the role and potential of special schools can be optimised. The second phase of the review will be managed by the National Council for Special Education and will involve wider consultation with the schools and other partners.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 199 together.</P>
        <P>In July, 2005, the Government announced a range of measures to enhance safety and improve the school transport operations. The measures included:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The phasing out of &ldquo;3 for 2&rdquo; seating on post-primary services by end December, 2005;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The phasing out of &ldquo;3 for 2&rdquo; seating on primary services by end December, 2006;</P><Col N="858"/>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The acquisition of additional buses by Bus &Eacute;ireann and the hiring in of additional private vehicles to meet the consequential capacity shortfall; and</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The immediate fitting of seat belts on the Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus fleet and setting a target date of December, 2006 for private buses in the scheme to be fitted with approved seat belts.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My Department has been assured by Bus &Eacute;ireann, which administers the school transport scheme, that children travelling on buses in the school transport scheme now have a seat of their own and all 3,000 vehicles nominated to serve in the school transport scheme have also been equipped with seat belts. Additional vehicles were required to meet the capacity shortfall arising from the phasing out of the &ldquo;3 for 2&rdquo; seating. In that regard, Bus &Eacute;ireann hired in over 300 additional vehicles from the private sector and funding was also approved for Bus &Eacute;ireann to increase its school transport fleet by 161 buses, including 50 new school buses.  In a comprehensive review of the national network, Bus &Eacute;ireann also created additional capacity by introducing 70 extra trips using existing buses, by implementing 30 other service extensions, and by replacing some 130 small vehicles with larger capacity models.  These improvements meant that, by the end of 2006, the average age of the Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus fleet was at its lowest level since the 1980s.</P>
        <P>A safety information campaign was launched in August, 2006 to make parents and children aware that it is now the law to wear seat belts on school buses, where provided, and to encourage children to behave in a safety-conscious manner on, and in the vicinity of, school buses. These messages were conveyed by way of television, cinema and radio advertisements and through a DVD and posters which were distributed to all primary and post-primary schools. A further safety information campaign is planned for this year in co-operation with Bus &Eacute;ireann, the Road Safety Authority and other relevant authorities. It is also planned to extend the Warning Flashing Light pilot project on school buses to three areas as an additional measure intended to enhance safety in the vicinity of school buses.</P>
        <P>Other improvements that have been implemented include a formal vetting structure that is now in place for drivers of buses and taxis employed on services operating under the school transport scheme.  Also, Bus &Eacute;ireann is currently developing a training programme for the drivers of privately-owned contractors&rsquo; school buses that provide services under the school transport scheme, to enhance their driving techniques and the training that their employers give them.  It is envisaged that this programme will begin during 2007.</P>

	<P>The National Council for Special Education, through the 75 local special educational needs organisers, known as SENOs, is responsible for processing applications from primary and post-primary schools for special needs supports. These supports include resource teaching hours and SNA support for pupils with low-incidence special needs and assistive technology or equipment for pupils in either high- or low-incidence special educational needs categories. In this way pressing needs in the area of special needs supports in schools are identified early and acted upon quickly.</P>
        <P>The SENO is a focal point of contact for parents and schools. It is open to a parent to contact the local SENO directly regarding a child&rsquo;s special educational needs. Contact details for the SENO may be accessed on the NCSE website at www.ncse.ie.</P>
        <P>There has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.  At primary level, there are now over 5,500 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. At second level, over 2,300 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs with 534 of these being learning support teachers. In addition, there are in excess of 8,200 special needs assistants (SNAs) in our primary and post primary schools.</P>

	<P>Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The census for the current school year (2006/2007) is currently being worked on. Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, com<Col N="860"/>pared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
        <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school. Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there be at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class be kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes. I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

	<P>The specific information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. However, the Deputy can be assured that my Department fully recognises the key role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve PE facilities for all pupils attending primary schools. My Department&rsquo;s design guidelines include, where appropriate for PE Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts. PE facilities have been provided, where appropriate, as part of my Department&rsquo;s record school building programme which between 2000 to 2006 involved the delivery of over 7,800 projects with an investment of &euro;2.6 billion.</P>
        <P>The budget for 2007 is the first year of the rollout of the new NDP which will involve an investment of over &euro;4.5 billion in school buildings over the next 7 years.

	<P>There were some 39 recommendations in the Report of the Task Force on the Physical Sciences, with costed proposals totalling an additional &euro;244 million, of which &euro;66.3 million would be a recurring annual cost. Of the 39 recommendations, 4 are not for the education sector.

	<P>On 13 December 2005 the Government approved youth justice reforms following a review carried out by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The rationale for these changes is to provide leadership and restructuring of the delivery of the State&rsquo;s services in the area of youth justice which, up to now, were dealt with by several Departments and agencies. It is intended that these changes will result in the establishment of a modern and progressive youth justice system.</P>
        <P>These changes will result in responsibility for four of the children detention schools, other than for the provision of education services, transferring from my Department to the Irish Youth Justice Service, an executive office of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The fifth children detention school will transfer to the Health Service Executive. The transfer of responsibility will take effect from 1 March 2007.</P>
        <P>My Department will retain responsibility for the provision of education services in the schools.  The proposals provide for a change in the way education is delivered from the current primary school model to delivery by the relevant VEC.  The rationale for this is based on the Department&rsquo;s view that the VEC model is best placed to meet the needs of adolescent children. The Deputy should also note that, under the proposals approved by Government, my Department will be preparing an education strategy, the aim of which is to ensure a continuum of education and training opportunities for children in the special care and detention school sectors. It is intended that the strategy will be developed and completed during 2007.</P>

	<P>My Department gives an annual grant to all Vocational Education Committees for the provision of Adult Literacy and Community Education. This fund may be used for the teaching of English to immigrants. The cost of the literacy service delivered by VECs was over &euro;23 million in 2006. The number of students was over 35,000.  27% of these, amounting to 10,000 clients, attended English for Speakers as Other Language (ESOL) courses.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on Adult Education &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo; (2000) stated that asylum seekers would be entitled to free access to Adult Literacy, English language and mother culture supports and refugees are entitled to the same access to education and training as Irish nationals. The language needs of migrants formed part of the negotiations between social partners in drawing up the new social partnership agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;.  A prioritised action included in the agreement is that the annual student cohort availing of the general national literacy service delivered by the Vocational Education Committees will be significantly increased by the provision of an extra 7,000 places by 2009, 3,000 of which will be provided this year. There will be a particular focus on the increasing number of migrants receiving an English language service (ESOL) under the terms of the agreement.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to provide a separate funding line at this time and would be anxious to ensure that VECs would continue to have the flexibility that the present arrangement affords.  The scope of the both literacy and ESOL services is subject to limitations on overall funding.</P>

	<P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc. Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
        <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year <Col N="866"/>to reduce class sizes. As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.  A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes. I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</P>
        <P>Currently, the NEPS service is now available to some 1,604 primary schools (representing approximately 60% of pupils) and 565 post-primary schools (representing approximately 77% of students). This number includes 46 schools in the City and County of Dublin Vocational Schemes, which have their own psychological service. I can inform the Deputy that the number of psychologists in the Department has increased from 43 since the establishment of NEPS in 1999 to a current figure of 127, including 4 psychologists assigned to the National Behavioural Support Service. There are also a further 16 Whole-time-equivalent educational psychologists providing service through the Dublin City and County VECs. Taken together, there are currently 143 educational psychologists working in services paid for by my Department.</P>
        <P>I announced recently in this connection my intention to expand the number of NEPS psychologists by a further 31 in 2007. This will represent a significant increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS and bring the total number of psychologists in the system to 174. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in line with the Government&rsquo;s  &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo; commitments, the number of NEPS psychologists will be increased even further in each of 2008 and 2009, to a total of 193. At this point, including the 16 psychologists in the Dublin VEC areas, it is expected that the number of educational psychologists in the system as a whole will be 209.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 and 204 together.</P>
        <P>The achievement of high literacy standards is one of the primary goals of education. I am very conscious of the fact that high levels of literacy are fundamental prerequisites for full educational, social and economic participation, and the Government is redoubling its efforts to promote these. Schools generally have relatively low proportions of children with significant literacy difficulties as evidenced by comparatively high overall achievement levels in successive international surveys of reading of 15-year-olds under PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment). The most significant levels of literacy difficulties tend to be concentrated in school serving disadvantaged communities.</P>
        <P>One of the high-level goals under the new National Development Plan 2007-13, is to reduce the proportion of pupils with serious literacy difficulties in primary schools serving disadvantaged communities from the current level of 27-30% to less than 15% by 2016. To achieve this goal significant resources to address literacy and numeracy difficulties in schools serving disadvantaged communities are being provided through DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion. These measures include a maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes in the 190 urban/town primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities and increased access to literacy and numeracy support services and programmes for all urban/town primary schools. Additional literacy and numeracy tutors are being recruited to provide in-school support and guidance to all teachers in these schools. In addition, training in &ldquo;Reading Recovery&rdquo;, &ldquo;First Steps&rdquo; and &ldquo;Maths Recovery&rdquo; are being made available to all urban/town primary schools. The Junior Certificate School Programme&rsquo;s Demonstration Library Project is also being extended on a phased basis to second-level schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Extra resources will also be made available for intensive professional development programmes for principals and teachers in DEIS schools. A new Family Literacy Project is also being implemented. Finally, the School Development Planning service will support schools in developing their plans and policies for teaching literacy and numeracy and in setting measurable targets for the reduction of serious literacy and numeracy difficulties.</P>
        <P>I believe that these measures will equip our teachers and schools to tackle the outstanding literacy and numeracy problems in schools serving disadvantaged communities. I am confident that under the measures being provided under the DEIS action plan the goal that we have set ourselves for substantially reducing literacy problems will be achieved.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 200 together.</P>
        <P>The Department recently published the Draft Area Development Plan for north  Dublin, east Meath and south Louth on 25th January 2007.  The Commission on School Accommodation will now conduct a public consultation process on the Draft Plans and it has indicated that Oral hearings will commence on Monday 26th March.  It is not possible at this stage to determine the extent of the oral hearings, but the last study undertaken elicited 152 written submissions and 29 oral hearings. This is a considerably bigger study so a substantial response is expected to the advertisement inviting submissions and an increase in the number of orals to be heard.</P>
        <P>It is the Commission&rsquo;s intention to complete and publish the study by late May/mid June this year.  When the final plan is published, it will become the framework against which capital investment for the area will be made for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware the recent Census preliminary figures confirm the Fingal area of Dublin as the fastest growing area in the country. The Department is of the view that between primary and post primary level, some 20 new schools will be required there over the coming years. The challenge is to provide these schools in line with or ahead of demand for pupil places.</P>
        <P>The Draft Plan shows that considerable interventions have already been made by the Department to increase pupil places and these interventions are being backed up by a significant capital investment programme.  At primary level in Swords, the Department is providing three new school buildings for Swords Educate Together NS, Gaelscoil Brian Boroimhe and  Gaelscoil an Duinn&iacute;nigh. An extension is also being provided to St. Cronan&rsquo;s Senior NS, Brackenstown. The Department has a further reserved site in Swords <Col N="871"/>for primary provision and it is in discussion with the local authority for  another.</P>
        <P>In Balbriggan, the Department is providing a new 16 classroom school for an Educate Together N.S. which opened in 2005. In September 2006 the Department granted provisional recognition to Gaelscoil Bhaile Brig&iacute;n, which opened with an enrolment of 35 pupils. St. Teresa&rsquo;s NS, Balbriggan is included among the schools recently given approval for the appointment of a design team to progress an extension project.</P>
        <P>There are a further two sites reserved in Balbriggan for primary school purposes and the Department will move to acquire and develop these as the need is identified.  In Rush and Lusk  approval was recently given to Lusk NS and St. Catherine&rsquo;s NS, Kenure to appoint design teams to progress extension projects. The Rush/Lusk Educate Together NS, was recently granted permanent recognition and its temporary accommodation is grant aided by my Department.</P>
        <P>Two sites have been reserved for further primary provision in Lusk, one of which is currently being acquired under the Fingal School Model process, for the purposes of accommodating the Rush/Lusk Educate Together N.S.  In Rush a site has also been reserved for primary school development.  My Department has also reserved two sites in Skerries, one of which is currently being acquired under the Fingal School Model process.</P>
        <P>In Donabate/Portrane a new Educate Together school opened in 2002.  This school received permanent recognition from my Department in 2004.   It currently enrols two classes of Junior Infants and is accommodated in temporary classrooms which are grant aided by my Department.</P>
        <P>At post primary level, a new 1,000 pupil post primary school is being delivered in Donabate under a design and build contract. A new 1,000 pupil post primary school is also being delivered in Balbriggan under the Department&rsquo;s PPP Programme and the Loreto Secondary School, Balbriggan was among the schools included on a recent list of projects to go to tender and construction for an extension project.</P>
        <P>Officials in the School Planning Section of my Department will continue to monitor the situation in north Dublin and are in regular contact with school principals on the ground and will take all measures necessary to ensure that there will be sufficient places for all children seeking primary education in the area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my understanding that the availability of laboratory technicians has not been a universal feature of support for science teaching in second level schools and that in some countries that do provide this type of resource it is confined to certain types of schools. I am aware that the provision of technical assistants was one of some 39 recommendations in the Report of the Task Force on the Physical Sciences. However, the cost of the Task Force proposals is a total of some &euro;244m, of which &euro;66.3m would be a recurring annual cost.</P>
        <P>The proposal for the provision of technical assistants is close to 30% of this recurring annual cost. Progress has been made on implementing 25 of the Task Force recommendations and my Department continues to progress the recommendations as resources permit in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, FORFAS and industry.  As I have explained on previous occasions, I am not convinced of the value of providing laboratory assistants for schools.</P>
        <P>And there is no doubt that provision of assistants in this area would lead to demands for similar assistance across other areas of the curriculum where there is a strong practical component. So as I have said, I remain to be convinced of the necessity for them. Nonetheless, I will keep the position under review.</P>

        <P>On the Post Primary side allocations are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment. In general a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established Junior Certificate, Leaving Certificate, repeat Leaving Certificate and Transition Year Programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Post leaving Cert courses and Leaving Cert Applied.</P>
        <P>Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils&rsquo; needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation.  Significant improvements have been made in the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996/97 school year to 13.2:1 in the 2005/06 school year.  The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.</P>
        <P>But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers.

	<P>My Department considers that children with autism, in common with all children should have access to appropriate provision delivered by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where children can mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration. The preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools.</P>
        <P>My Department is committed to ensuring that all children, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders receive an education appropriate to their needs and in this regard my Department has established: 181 Special Classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools, 7 of which are in the Mayo area; 5 special Classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome; 16 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum; 14 Stand Alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology on a pilot basis, 2 of these facilities have yet to be established.</P>
        <P>Additional training supports for staff engaged in the education provision for children with special needs including autism can be accessed through the Special Education Support Service (SESS). The service will, as appropriate, consolidate, co-ordinate, develop and deliver a range of professional development initiatives and support structures to the relevant staff.</P>
        <P>An application was received from a group in the Mayo area to participate in the pilot scheme which has facilitated the establishment of the ABA-specific autism units nationwide. My officials requested that the names and the psychological assessments of the children proposing to attend the centre should be forwarded to the Department in order to progress the application further.

	<P>Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The census for the current school year (2006/2007) is currently being worked on.</P><Col N="875"/>
        <P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
        <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.  The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.</P>
        <P>But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

	<P>Over recent months, the Child Abuse Protection Programme (CAPP), which operates the &lsquo;Stay Safe&rsquo; programme, sent a questionnaire to all primary schools that sought to get the most up-to-date and accurate position about the implementation of &lsquo;Stay Safe&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>To date, 3,014 (91.5%) of the 3,292 primary schools have returned completed questionnaires.  This is a very good response rate for a survey of this kind but the CAPP, in conjunction with my Department are still seeking to achieve a full return as possible.  On the basis of the completed questionnaires, preliminary analysis shows that 2,531 (84%) of schools are teaching &lsquo;Stay Safe&rsquo; and 483 (16%) are not.  However, as 68 of the schools that did not return questionnaires are known from records to be teaching the &lsquo;Stay Safe&rsquo; Programme, it can be stated that 2,599 of schools (79% of all schools) are teaching the programme.</P>
        <P>However, it should be noted that of the 483 schools which reported that they were not teaching &lsquo;Stay Safe&rsquo;, 277 reported that child abuse prevention was covered as part of the curriculum using the other resources.  Therefore, in overall terms, 2,876 schools (87%) are either teaching the &lsquo;Stay Safe&rsquo; programme or they are teaching child abuse prevention using other resources.</P>
        <P>It should be noted, however, that while the &lsquo;Stay Safe&rsquo; Programme is not mandatory, the teaching of a personal safety Programme to ensure child protection is now an integral element of the curricular subject of Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE).  This is one of the eleven subject areas of the revised primary curriculum which is mandatory for all primary schools.</P>
        <P>The introduction of SPHE as a subject on the revised Primary School Curriculum, combined with the implementation of the national Child <Col N="878"/>Protection Guidelines, Children First, gave an additional impetus to the &lsquo;Stay Safe&rsquo; Programme. The combined impact of these developments has ensured that child protection issues remain central to teaching and learning in our schools. It also ensures that a high level of awareness and necessary skills to address child protection issues is maintained in all schools.</P>
        <P>The questionnaire responses by those schools who reported that they were neither teaching &lsquo;Stay Safe&rsquo; or covering child abuse prevention using the other resources are currently being analysed to examine the reasons for this situation.  Once this has been done, it is envisaged that the CAPP will contact these schools directly to address the matter.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that My Department has sent a Circular on Child Protection and Procedures for Primary Schools (Primary Circular 0061/2006) to the Chairpersons and Principals of all primary schools.  This draws attention to the crucial importance of schools following closely the Child Protection Guidelines and Procedures which were based on the Children First national guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Children and specifically adapted to cater for primary school settings.</P>
        <P>The main aim of these guidelines is to give direction and guidance to school management and staff in dealing with allegations or suspicions of child abuse, with the protection and well-being of the child being the most important consideration.  It is vitally important that each school has clear and effective child protection procedures in place.  One essential procedure is that schools have nominated a senior staff member, usually the Principal, as designated Liaison Person (DLP) for the school. This DLP is responsible for ensuring that the standard reporting procedures is followed so that suspected cases of child abuse are referred promptly to the Health Service Executive or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that all primary and post-primary schools have <Col N="879"/>access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</P>
        <P>Currently, the NEPS service is now available to some 1,604 primary schools (representing approximately 60% of pupils) and 565 post-primary schools (representing approximately 77% of students). This number includes 46 schools in the City and County of Dublin Vocational Schemes, which have their own psychological service.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that the number of psychologists in the Department has increased from 43 since the establishment of NEPS in 1999 to a current figure of 127, including 4 psychologists assigned to the National Behavioural Support Service. There are also a further 16 Whole-time-equivalent educational psychologists providing service through the Dublin City and County VECs. Taken together, there are currently 143 educational psychologists working in services paid for by my Department.</P>
        <P>I announced recently in this connection my intention to expand the number of NEPS psychologists by a further 31 in 2007. This will represent a significant increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS and bring the total number of psychologists in the system to 174.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in line with the Government&rsquo;s  &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo; commitments, the number of NEPS psychologists will be increased even further in each of 2008 and 2009, to a total of 193. At this point, including the 16 psychologists in the Dublin VEC areas, it is expected that the number of educational psychologists in the system as a whole will be 209.</P>

        <Quest> the level and type of additional resources and supports that are available when a child is identified with special needs; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department provides a wide range of supports and additional resources to support children who have been assessed as having special educational needs.  These services are determined by the type of special educational need but include additional teaching support where a child is fully integrated into a mainstream school, reduced pupil-teacher-ratios where the child is in <Col N="880"/>a special class attached to a mainstream school or a special school; special needs assistant support for a child who has care needs; assistive technology where this is recommended; specialist equipment such as modified desks and chairs as required; and specially adapted school buildings where necessary.  In addition enhanced levels of capitation are available to special schools and mainstream schools with special classes.</P>
        <P>The precise allocation of resources for children with special educational needs is based on the criteria set out in my Department&rsquo;s circulars.  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through the local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special needs supports such as resource teaching hours and special needs assistant (SNA) support on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. The teaching and SNA support allocated are intended to enable schools to meet the needs of pupils as outlined in psychological and other professional reports.</P>
        <P>In allocating additional teaching and SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs examine the teaching and other resources available within the individual schools. The SENO also operates within the parameters of my Department&rsquo;s criteria for the allocation of such resources.</P>
        <P>Primary schools are also supported by means of a general allocation which provides additional teaching support to enable schools to cater for pupils with high incidence special educational needs, such as dyslexia, and those with low attainments. Second level schools continue to be supported by the allocation of additional teaching hours, where appropriate, for each pupil enrolled who is assessed as having a special educational need. SNA support is allocated, as appropriate, to all schools where there are confirmed assessed care needs in respect of students.</P>

	<P>At primary level schools that opt for book rental schemes are allocated enhanced grants to encourage them to participate in such schemes.  In respect of the 2006/2007 school year primary schools not operating book rental schemes have been paid &euro;14.70 per eligible pupil in the infant classes and &euro;22.00 for each eligible pupil in the 1st to 6th classes. This compares to primary schools operating book rental schemes which have been paid &euro;28.40 in respect of each eligible pupil in the infant classes and &euro;38.10 for each eligible pupil in the 1st to 6th classes. Primary schools designated as disadvantaged and operating book rental schemes have been paid &euro;32.00 in respect of each eligible pupil in the infant classes and &euro;44.30 for each eligible pupil in the 1st to 6th classes.</P>
        <P>According to my Department&rsquo;s records, 1,917 primary schools (approximately 58% of primary schools) operate loan/rental schemes.  A total of &euro;5,350,000 &mdash; an increase of &euro;1,350,000 on the allocation for the 2005/06 school year &mdash; was allocated in respect of the school books scheme in the 2006/2007 school year. Of this amount &euro;4,775,253 (89.26%) was paid to primary schools operating loan/rental schemes. The allocation for 2006/2007 included an amount of &euro;0.5m which was made <Col N="882"/>available under the School Books Grant Scheme to primary schools in the School Support Programme (SSP) under DEIS.</P>
        <P>Schools participating in the SSP that indicated that they would operate a book/loan rental scheme in 2006/2007 received grant aid at a higher rate per eligible pupil than applied in the case of schools generally. The extra funding is aimed at supporting the establishment, development and ongoing operation of book loan/rental schemes.</P>
        <P>At second level, in addition to the provision of grants towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils, my Department also provides seed capital funding to certain schools in order to assist in the establishment of book loan/rental schemes. These would be schools designated as disadvantaged or which participate in schemes aimed at combating educational disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Under the DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, additional funding was made available in 2006 to second level schools participating in the School Support Programme (SSP) and with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  The funding was aimed primarily at supporting the establishment, development and ongoing operation of book loan/rental schemes.  One hundred second level schools were targeted under this measure in 2006 and, following an application process, 94 schools received funding to support book loan/rental schemes.  The remaining 103 DEIS schools will be targeted for funding in 2007.</P>
        <P>Expenditure on the School Books Grant Scheme in second level schools in 2006 was &euro;7.518m.  Of this amount, some &euro;0.8m was provided for book loan/rental schemes.  The 2007 allocation is &euro;7.941m, an increase of 423,000 over 2006.  My Department continues to urge the management authorities of both primary and second level schools to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools.</P>
        <P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. At the beginning of the current school year there are no less <Col N="883"/>than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
        <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>On the Post Primary side allocations are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment. In general a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established Junior Certificate, Leaving Certificate, repeat Leaving Certificate and Transition Year Programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Post leaving Cert courses and Leaving Cert Applied.</P>
        <P>Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils&rsquo; needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation. Significant improvements have been made in the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the <Col N="884"/>1996/97 school year to 13.2:1 in the 2005/06 school year.</P>
        <P>My Department has in the past operated a number of schemes to tackle educational disadvantage and reduce class sizes in schools in disadvantaged areas. These existing schemes are being integrated into the new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) which I launched in 2005, one aspect of which will be more staffing for the most disadvantaged schools. Under the plan, there has been a reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in the 190 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>School authorities have been reminded that my Department allocates adequate staffing to schools to ensure that the maximum class size guidelines under DEIS are implemented in both junior and senior classes. If schools are unable to operate within these guidelines, due for example to increased enrolments, they may make a submission on the matter to my Department for consideration.</P>
        <P>Children who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes or units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special back-up supports.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through the local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special needs supports such as resource teaching hours and special needs assistant (SNA) support on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. The teaching and SNA support allocated are intended to enable schools to meet the needs of pupils as outlined in psychological and other professional reports.</P>
        <P>Primary schools are also supported by means of a general allocation which provides additional teaching support to enable schools to cater for pupils with high incidence special educational needs, such as dyslexia, and those with low attainments. Second level schools continue to be supported by the allocation of additional teaching hours, where appropriate, for each pupil enrolled who is assessed as having a special educational need. SNA support is allocated, as appropriate, to all schools where there are confirmed assessed care needs in respect of students.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.  I assure the <Col N="885"/>Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new action plan for educational inclusion provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The DEIS plan states that as well as provision being made for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will also continue to be provided for other primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.</P>
        <P>DEIS is designed to ensure that the schools serving the most disadvantaged communities benefit from the maximum level of support available. Schools which have not qualified for inclusion in DEIS, and which are receiving additional resources under pre-existing schemes for addressing disadvantage, can be assured that they will continue to get support to enable them to maintain services for their disadvantaged pupils.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification and review processes, 873 schools have been invited to participate in the new Programme. These comprise 670 primary schools (338 urban/town schools and 332 rural schools) and 203 second-level schools.  In respect of the 2006/07 school year, grants amounting to approximately &euro;7.7 million due to the 670 Primary schools which are participating in the DEIS Initiative were lodged to their schools&rsquo; bank accounts on 17 November 2006.  This is in addition to payments totalling &euro;1 million which issued to those schools in June 2006.</P>
        <P>In the order of &euro;4.7 million was paid in the course of the 2006/2007 school year in respect of the 203 Post Primary schools participating in the initiative and 80 Post Primary Schools receiving grants under pre-existing schemes.  Also on 17 November 2006, approximately another 1,900 primary schools received some &euro;4.1 million of grant assistance to assist them with their respective levels of dispersed disadvantage.</P>
        <P>In addition to supplementary financial assistance which is provided to schools in DEIS, schools will benefit from additional measures which range from pre-school interventions, supports for tackling children&rsquo;s literacy problems, reduced pupil teacher ratios, allocation of administrative principals on lower enrolment, measures to tackle early school leaving, measures to strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community and provision of continuing professional development for teachers.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that the Government is determined to do all that we can to keep our children and vulnerable adults safe.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the number and range of persons who have access to pupils is very wide.  In my view, the determining factor in deciding whether or not such persons should be vetted is the extent to which they have unsupervised access to children. I envisage that any individual who may have unsupervised access to children would be included in this category.</P>
        <P>The critical issue here is whether the access to children is unsupervised. By unsupervised access I mean where a member of the school staff or a parent or guardian of the child is not present at all times when the person concerned has access to children.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that all new teachers have been vetted and the process of vetting new non-teaching staff is underway.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The decreasing numbers of males entering the teaching profession is an issue that is of concern to me. I believe that it is important to attract more men into teaching for a number of reasons, not least of which is the positive role models that teachers provide in children&rsquo;s lives and the desirability of having both male and female role models in our schools.</P>
        <P>I genuinely believe that teaching is an attractive profession for both men and women. Teaching is fulfilling work which makes a huge social contribution.  This Government wants to attract and reward the best teachers. In addition to increasing teachers&rsquo; salaries, we have also undertaken other initiatives to enhance the status of the profession. Not least of these is the establishment of the Teaching Council as a professional regulatory body.</P>
        <P>In November, 2005 I launched the Report of the Primary Education Committee, &lsquo;Males into Primary Teaching.&rsquo; The Primary Education Committee was established in order to examine a range of issues in relation to males entering primary teaching, and to make recommendations on short-term and long-term strategies to increase the numbers in this regard. The Report draws on the professional insight of key experts in this area as well as drawing on a number of relevant research studies.</P>
        <P>One of the key recommendations in the Committee&rsquo;s report is that a coordinated promotion campaign, which would encourage boys as well as girls to enter primary teaching, should be undertaken. This promotion campaign commenced on 24 January, 2006 and is currently ongoing. The campaign focuses on a number of key target audiences, including students, parents, teachers and guidance counsellors.</P>
        <P>The figures in relation to the number of males applying for primary education courses in 2007 are not currently available. However, I have asked my officials to obtain these figures from the CAO and I would be glad to provide this material to the Deputy once available.  These figures will be available in March, after the closing date for the &lsquo;change of mind&rsquo; option has passed.</P>

	<P>Apart from the four Restatements displayed on the Office of the Attorney General website, the former Statute Law Revision Unit in that Office in association with relevant Departments had prepared drafts of further Restatements.  However, due to pending amending legislation and other reasons, the draft Restatements were not brought to certification stage although some Departments displayed informal versions on their websites.</P>
        <P>In May 2006, the Government decided that the Law Reform Commission should prepare a Programme of Statute Law Restatement under the Statute Law (Restatement) Act, 2002.  In late September 2006, sanction for three researchers for the project was obtained from the Department of Finance and the three researchers were engaged by the Commission.  In January 2007, sanction for a project manager and an administrative support person in the Commission was obtained.</P>
        <P>Since November 2006, the Commission has considered the priorities to be given to the suggestions made during the consultation exercise and has developed draft Restatements of the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003, the Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2003 and the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975.</P>
        <P>In December 2006, the Commission team met with a legislative software engineering company to discuss the possible technological aspects to the Project.

	<P>The Criminal Law (Suicide) Act 1993 decriminalised the action of suicide. The fact that suicide is not an offence provides some small consolation to bereaved relatives and friends. However, the Act is robust and unequivocal in relation to the serious criminal offence committed by persons who assist a person to commit suicide or to attempt to commit suicide, with conviction on indictment incurring a term of up to 14 years.</P>
        <P>There is little evidence of incidents of assisted suicide either in this jurisdiction or in relation to travelling to a jurisdiction whose legal system is apparently not adverse to assisted suicide at the request of the person. It follows that there have been no prosecutions under the Act.</P>
        <P>Where appropriate, extradition proceedings can be put in train. For example, there are arrangements in place for the extradition of persons between Ireland and Switzerland under the 1957 European Convention on Extradition and a number of other international agreements to which Ireland and Switzerland are party.  I believe that the legislation provides for current requirements and I do not consider that a review is warranted at this time.</P>

The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>The personnel strength of the DMR South Division on 31 December, 1997 and 2006 (all ranks) was 471 and 595 respectively. This represents an increase of 124 (or 26.3%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date. The personnel strength of the DMR East Division on 31 December, 1997 and 2006 (all ranks) was 546 and 591 respectively. This represents an increase of 45 <Col N="893"/>(or 8.24%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed that the number of Garda&iacute; (all ranks) in each Garda station in the <Col N="894"/>Dublin Metropolitan Region South and East Divisions for each of the past five years was as set out in the table.</P><Col N="893"/>

	<P>The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides an employee vetting service in respect of selected employments involving, primarily, substantial, unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults.  This vetting service is not and does not purport to operate in respect of general employments.</P>
        <P>The Deputy would appear to be referring to disclosures issued by the GCVU in respect of applications for access to personal data made pursuant to Section 4 of the Data Protection Act 1988, as amended.  Under this provision, a person may apply for a copy of personal data maintained <Col N="897"/>on the Garda Criminal Records Database for his/her personal use only.  Such a disclosure states,<i> inter alia</i>, that the document does not constitute a &lsquo;proof of no convictions&rsquo;, &lsquo;police certificate&rsquo;, Garda &lsquo;reference&rsquo; or Garda &lsquo;clearance&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>The reason for this is that searches carried out in response to such requests are conducted solely in relation to the name, date of birth and address as provided by the applicant and not on any variants of these details.  Unlike criminal record vetting, which is available only to selected registered organisations, details of possible variant matches are not provided under the data protection search process.  This procedure reflects the purpose of data protection legislation, which is not a means of vetting but, rather, is designed to protect individuals with regard to the automatic processing of their personal data.</P>

A decision was issued to the person concerned in April 2006 in which he was informed that time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.</P>
        <P>It is open to the person concerned to re-apply for long term residency when he has completed 60 months legal residency on work permits conditions.

        <P>The Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, i.e., from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned.  On receipt of those consents (assuming they will be forthcoming), an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his continued detention here.</P>
        <P>These procedures are required under the Convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, and must be adhered to in processing each application.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that persons who fail mandatory alcohol testing (MAT) do not receive fixed charge notices and therefore, the outsourcing of fixed charge notices does not arise at present. Under section 4 of the Road Traffic Act, 2006 a person stopped at a MAT checkpoint is required to provide a preliminary breath test. A person who fails or refuses to comply with a MAT may be prosecuted and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;5,000 and/or imprisonment for up to six months.</P>
        <P>Under long standing legislation, if a Garda as a result of the test forms the opinion at the roadside that a person has consumed an intoxicant then he/she can arrest that person and bring the person back to a Garda station for the purpose of administering an evidential test. The penalty for refusal to provide an evidential test is a fine of up to &euro;5,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 6 months. If a person is charged with the offence of drink driving under road traffic legislation, the case proceeds to the courts and is dealt with under the courts system in the normal manner.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>There are plans to build a new city type Garda station at Ballincollig. A revised sketch scheme was sent to the OPW recently. The Office of Public Works (OPW) will proceed with the planning process and invitation of tenders.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Ballincollig Garda Station on 31 December, 1997 and 12 February, 2007 was 17 and 21 (all ranks) respectively. This represents an increase of 4 (or 23.5%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date. Ballincollig Garda Station is open to the public from 9am to 1pm, 2pm to 6pm and <Col N="904"/>7pm to 8pm from Monday to Friday and from 10am to 1pm and 2pm to 6pm on Saturday and Sunday. The call diversion system is in operation and linked to the District Headquarters at Gurranabraher Garda Station.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the extension of opening hours at Ballincollig Garda Station would necessitate the employment of additional personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.</P>
        <P>During the allocation of newly attested personnel, the needs of Ballincollig Garda Station will be fully considered by the Garda Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda Stations throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management take direct responsibility for missing person cases, and special investigation teams are appointed as necessary.  All missing persons are recorded on the PULSE system.  When a person is reported missing, the local Garda Superintendent  will appoint an investigation team to include any specialised unit deemed necessary, <Col N="905"/>for example, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation or the Technical Bureau.  The systems put in place by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to manage and deal with reports of missing persons are in line with best international police practice, and Garda management have assured me that they are satisfied that the systems in place are adequate to deal with any reported case of a missing person.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na interacts fully and as appropriate with all of the media outlets &mdash; print, radio and TV &mdash; in highlighting cases involving missing persons.  The services of other external agencies such as Interpol and Europol are also available to assist in the investigation.  In addition, every Garda District has a specially trained search team that is familiar with the locality.  The investigation of missing persons is a dedicated subject on the curriculum at the Garda College, Templemore, and is also a subject covered in in-service training.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities are continuously monitoring international developments in relation to investigations of missing persons in order to ensure that best practice is followed.  If their professional judgement is that some change in the existing legislation, protocols or structures would be of assistance in improving investigations, this would be considered by me. I have passed your suggestions to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for consideration.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the Missing in Ireland Support Service (MISS) has recently submitted a revised funding grant application to the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime to establish a Missing Persons Helpline.  As the closing date for receipt of grant applications has now passed the Commission will shortly be considering all grant applications received for 2007, including this application.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% <Col N="907"/>increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Fethard Garda Station on 8 February, 2007 was one Sergeant. Garda Management report that an additional member of Garda rank was allocated to Fethard Garda Station on 12 February, 2007. Fethard Garda Station forms part of the Tipperary Division. The personnel strength of the Tipperary Division on 31 December, 1997 and 2006 was 297 and 338 (all ranks) respectively. This represents an increase of 41 (or 13.8%) on the number of personnel allocated since that date.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, personnel strengths of individual stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>During the allocation of newly attested personnel the needs of Fethard Garda Station will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda Stations throughout the country.</P>

        <P>Applications for certificates of naturalisation on behalf of the latter two persons, who are minors, were received in the Citizenship Section of my Department on 15 August 2006. Applications on behalf of minors generally require less processing than standard adult applications and it is therefore usually possible to finalise them more quickly.  Based on current processing trends, it is likely that the applications on behalf of the per<Col N="908"/>sons concerned will be finalised towards the end of this year.</P>

Section 4 of the Act creates the offence of having custody or control of anything with intent to cause damage to property.  Both of these offences are punishable on summary conviction by a fine not exceeding &euro;1,270 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.  Following conviction on indictment these offences are punishable by a fine not exceeding &euro;12,697 and/or imprisonment not exceeding 10 years.</P>
        <P>Section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides that where a Garda, who is in a public place or any other place under a power of entry authorised by law or to which he or she was expressly or implicitly invited or permitted to be, finds or comes into possession of anything he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that it is evidence of, or relating to, the commission of an arrestable offence, he or she may seize and retain it for use as evidence in any criminal proceedings for such period from the date of seizure as is reasonable or, if proceedings are commenced in which it is require for use in evidence, until the conclusion of the proceedings.</P>
        <P>This section gives Garda&iacute; a power to seize spray cans from young people found in possession of them as the offences listed, contrary to sections 2 and 4 of the Criminal Damage Act 1991, are arrestable offences.</P>

	<P>Applications for certificates of naturalisation on behalf of the persons concerned, who are minors, were received in the Citizenship Section of my Department on 16 June 2006.  Applications on behalf of minors generally require less processing than standard adult applications and it is therefore usually possible to finalise them more quickly.  Based on current processing trends, it is likely that the applications on behalf of the individuals in question will be finalised towards the end of this year.  I will advise the Deputy and the applicants when I have reached a decision in the matter.</P>

	<P>Following the enactment of the Road Traffic Act 2006, the procurement procedure for the provision and operation of safety cameras by a service provider is underway.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is intended that the service provider will be required to collect and process all data on speeding obtained by the mobile and fixed safety cameras used.  The service provider will also be required to process data collected by the safety <Col N="915"/>cameras currently operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>It is also intended that the service provider will provide all resources, including personnel, for the processing of data obtained, for the purpose of verifying whether or not a speeding offence has taken place in each case and reading the licence plate of each vehicle identified as having been used to commit a speeding offence.</P>
        <P>The performance criteria to be applied will be determined by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the deployment of cameras will be focused on locations where there is an established or prospective risk of collisions.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as the traffic law enforcement agency in the State, will be responsible for the outsourcing project.</P>
        <P>Work is well advanced on the procurement procedure.  Following the call for expressions of interest, a number of candidates will shortly be awarded pre-qualification status and short-listed to proceed to the next stage.  A request for tenders will be made to the short-listed candidates, and the successful candidate will be selected on the basis of the tenders received.</P>
        <P>In parallel with this process, work is ongoing with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Roads Authority on identifying locations that either have a speed related collision history or are of a type where a higher than expected frequency of collisions may be expected to occur.  Monitoring of driver speeds by the outsourced service provider will focus on these locations.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that I attach a very high priority to outsourcing and expanding the speed camera network and to ensuring there will be no undue delay in the procurement process.  I expect that, subject to negotiations, the contract for safety cameras will be awarded and the start up phase commence as early as possible.</P>

	<P>The Deputy can be assured that there is an enormous work programme in place to progress the refurbishment or replacement of specific Garda stations in order to bring them up to the highest standard.  Between the start of 2005 to the end of 2007, the Office of Public Works will have spent approximately  &euro;112 million on a wide range of Garda building projects. In 2005 alone, that Office spent &euro;26 million on Garda Building projects such as Bantry, Ballyshannon, Roscrea, New Ross and Ballina Garda Stations. In addition, a major building programme was completed in the Garda College and recently the Board purchased 252 acres of land outside Templemore for the new tactical training centre for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>A wide range of projects are scheduled between now and the end of 2007, which include Kill-O-Grange, Claremorris and Oranmore as well  as progressing, Ballymun, Dromad, Finglas and many more.  In addition to the capital funding outlined above, a total of &euro;8.36m is provided for <Col N="918"/>maintenance of existing stations under the Garda Vote Estimate for 2007 &mdash; an increase of &euro;2.1m on last years allocation.</P>
        <P>The Garda Building Programme is progressed on the basis of agreed priorities. A number of the stations form part of an overall list of 40 to 50 Major Capital Works projects that have been prioritised and are being advanced. Others are included in planned refurbishment works and the provision of standard smaller type stations known as &ldquo;basic units&rdquo;.   It is important to note that progress on the Garda major building programme is achieved by consensus and with the cooperation and commitment of all concerned &mdash; the Garda authorities and Representative Associations and the Office of Public Works from whose Vote the capital works to Garda properties are funded.</P>
        <P>I am determined that the Garda Building Programme will be progressed as quickly as possible. Processes have been streamlined by the appointment of a new civilian Garda Accommodation Officer last year. Also, the transfer of Accounting Officer functions to the Garda Commissioner has led to greater efficiencies as functions previously split between the Garda&iacute; and my Department are now transferred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Garda Fleet is currently undergoing a major investment programme and an expansion in specific areas which will target organised crime, public order and traffic in particular.   The total spend for 2006 on the purchase of 1,378 new vehicles to upgrade the fleet was &euro;27.45 million resulting in the renewal of over half of the entire Garda fleet in just a single year. Further investment is planned for this year including the purchase of additional motorbikes which will make a significant contribution to traffic law enforcement.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 and 282 together.</P>
        <P>I am assured by the Garda Authorities that PULSE, the primary IT system for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is operating very satisfactorily.  Significant investment has been made to improve the availability and response times of the system and I am advised that as a result, over the course of the past year, there has been no unplanned downtime of the system.</P>
        <P>The functionality of the system is continually being enhanced to accommodate new business requirements, policies and procedures as well as changes in legislation.  Additional Garda stations have been added, with PULSE now available in 320 locations. Over 1,900 personal computers with Pulse are available to both Garda and civilian personnel.  Last year alone, 79 new Stations were added to the network.</P>
        <P>The deputy will also be aware that the Garda Information Services Centre, which was established last year in Castlebar, allows Garda&iacute;, who would otherwise have to return to their stations to input data into the PULSE system, to log the information with the GISC, while remaining on the beat.  Quality control and review of data is also managed by dedicated civilian staff at the GISC, thereby relieving Sergeants of this administrative task and allowing them to be deployed on more operational duties.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 283 and 284 together.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Garda Authorities that they have available to them a range of facilities for the delivery of firearms training. The Garda authorities are pursuing a number of solutions to provide enhanced and dedicated firearms training facilities. These include,  replacement of the existing firearms range at Garda Headquarters with a new facility as part of the new Forensic Science facilities and development of firearms training capabilities at the recently purchased lands outside Templemore.  The Office of Public Works are also examining proposals to develop a facility to meet the needs of the Dublin Metropolitan Region and surrounding areas.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, use is made of Military ranges, and the Garda Firearms training units together with the Garda College, maintain close liaison with their army colleagues to obtain the maximum amount of time on their ranges.  Garda management also inform me that three new Virtual Firearms Automated Training Systems (FATS) were purchased last year in order to expand the options available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I understand that training using this new equipment commenced in January in Limerick, Mullingar and at the existing indoor firing range facility in Garda Headquarters.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The cost per prisoner is based on the average daily number of offenders in custody during 2005.  The operational cost of each institution is based on actual running costs (ie pay, overtime, food, light and heat, maintenance, staffing numbers, utilities, etc).  These costs include certain fixed costs that arise irrespective of the number of offenders in custody e.g. staffing numbers, utilities, etc.  All headquarters and central service costs are allocated over the prison establishments for the purpose of calculating the cost per prisoner at each institution.  Capital expenditure is excluded from the calculation in the interest of facilitating comparison in individual institutional costs.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that in accordance with the requirements of the EU Council Directives on procurement, the purchase of fuels for the Garda fleet is organised through an open competitive tendering process. The award criteria for such tenders include location/opening hours of nominated fuel stations and the price of the fuels supplied consistent with operational requirements.  It is essential that Garda vehicles can access a network of fuel stations that provide twenty four hour coverage to meet operational requirements.  The annual cost for fuel in 2006 was &euro;8,433,812.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 291 and 292 together.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a <Col N="923"/>package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed that the number of Juvenile Liaison Officers currently in operation is 7 Sergeants and 86 Garda&iacute;. In addition to this, the National Juvenile Office has a staff of 1 Superintendent, (the Director of Diversion Programme), 1 Inspector and 3 Sergeants.</P>
        <P>I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs. Such allocations, including those of Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers, are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>

	<P>Ireland already has extensive legislation in place to tackle money laundering and the financing of terrorism activities. I intend to seek the Government&rsquo;s approval shortly to extend the current legislative provisions in this area. I am currently in the process of preparing legislation to transpose Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of Council on the prevention of the use of financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing, into Irish law. The Directive was finalised in 2005 and has a transposition date of 15 December 2007.  This Directive represents the European Union&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to tackle the international problem of money laundering and terrorist financing by implementing <Col N="925"/>the global standards produced by the Financial Action Task Force (FAFT) in 2003. My proposals will also take account of the relevant provisions of the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure, and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime and on Financing of Terrorism.</P>
        <P>Because of the complexity of the proposed legislation and its likely impact on individuals and bodies involved in specified financial transactions, the process of preparing this legislation is assisted by a Money Laundering Steering Committee, comprising organisations representing a wide range of activities and professions with a direct interest in the provisions of the proposed legislation. The Steering Committee meets under the auspices of the Department of Finance, to discuss issues surrounding the implications of the legislation and to be briefed on aspects of the legislative requirements arising in the context of the transposition of the Directive. Officials of my own Department play a central role in the Money Laundering Steering Committee&rsquo;s deliberations.</P>
        <P>The assessment of the necessary legislative changes, which will extend and strengthen the current provisions on money laundering and the drafting of a General Scheme of a Money Laundering Bill to transpose Directive 60/05/EC and to meet any FATF and Council of Europe requirements, is at an advanced stage. It is my intention to submit legislative proposals in this regard, to Government for approval shortly.</P>

	<P>My Department is currently examining the Report on Prosecution Appeals and Pre-trial Hearings which was published by the Law Reform Commission in November 2006.  I am also awaiting the Report of the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group which I established last November and which is due to report in March of this year.</P>
        <P>The issue of prosecution appeals has a number of aspects to it.  First, there is the question of whether the appeal is &lsquo;without prejudice&rsquo; to an acquittal.  There is also the question of re-opening cases where, for example, new evidence becomes available following the acquittal.  Finally, there is the question of appealing where the original sentence was considered by the DPP to have been too lenient.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission Report followed two earlier Consultation Papers, one in relation <Col N="926"/>to appeals in cases heard on indictment, the other in relation to cases heard by the District Court.</P>
        <P>The LRC noted that the Criminal Justice Act 2006 implemented its recommendations in relation to appeals on indictment, to the extent that there should be an extended &lsquo;without prejudice&rsquo; prosecution appeal which would not overturn an acquittal but would correct any legal errors for future cases.</P>
        <P>In respect of cases tried before the District Court, the LRC took the view that, in principle, prosecution appeals against unduly lenient sentences should also be permitted. However, the Commission felt more information was required on the level of sentencing and the consistency of approach taken in the District Court before proceeding to give the DPP powers to bring appeals.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the Board of the Courts Service has established a Steering Committee to plan for and provide a sentencing information system.  The Committee has reviewed such systems around the world and proposes to establish a pilot project in the Circuit Court in Dublin.  When the Steering Committee completes its work, further consideration can be given to the question of compiling a database of information on criminal sentences.</P>
        <P>The current law in relation to prosecution appeals against unduly lenient sentences is set out in section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 (as amended by section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006). It deals with cases tried on indictment.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference that I agreed for the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group, require the Group to consider the question of prosecution appeals to nullify an acquittal where there is evidence of jury or witness tampering and to look also at &lsquo;with prejudice&rsquo; appeals in the case of wrongful acquittals, including cases where new evidence emerges after an acquittal.</P>
        <P>I propose to await the report of the Review Group and to take its views, along with those of the LRC, into account before presenting proposals for further legislative changes in this area.</P>

	<P el="0">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na increased to a record 13,000 following the attestation of 299 new members on Thursday, 16 November, 2006. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda <Col N="928"/>Budget now stands at &euro;1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.</P>
        <P>There are plans to build a new city type Garda station at Ballincollig. A revised sketch scheme was sent to the OPW recently. The Office of Public Works (OPW) will proceed with the planning process and invitation of tenders.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Ballincollig Garda Station on 31 December, 1997 and 12 February, 2007 was 17 and 21 (all ranks) respectively. This represents an increase of 4 (or 23.5%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date. Ballincollig Garda Station is open to the public from 9am to 1pm, 2pm to 6pm and 7pm to 8pm from Monday to Friday and from 10am to 1pm and 2pm to 6pm on Saturday and Sunday. The call diversion system is in operation and linked to the District Headquarters at Gurranabraher Garda Station.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the extension of opening hours at Ballincollig Garda Station would necessitate the employment of additional personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.</P>
        <P>During the allocation of newly attested personnel, the needs of Ballincollig Garda Station will be fully considered by the Garda Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda Stations throughout the country.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to other goods and services. As the supply of panic alarms was not subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991 it is not possible to apply the zero rate to the supply of these goods or related services. There is no provision in EU VAT law that would allow for the abolition of VAT on the supply of panic alarms.</P>
        <P>In addition, Member States are only able to apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the EU VAT Directive. As the goods referred to by the Deputy and the associated monitoring services are not listed under Annex III it would not be possible to apply the reduced VAT rate to panic alarm systems or monitoring fees charged by service providers for socially monitored alarms. The purchase and monitoring of home security systems are therefore subject to the standard VAT rate of 21 per cent.</P>
        <P>However, I would add that under the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax)(No. 15) Order, 1981, it may be possible to obtain a VAT refund in respect of the purchase of a panic alarm system by or on behalf of a disabled person, as it may be considered a medical device for the purpose of this refund order. However, monitoring and maintenance fees are not recoverable.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Deputy may be aware of the Scheme of Community Support for Older People operated by the Department of Community, Rural &amp; Gaeltacht Affairs. The purpose of the scheme is to encourage and assist the community&rsquo;s support for older people by means of a community based grant scheme to improve the security of its older members. Funding under the scheme can be provided for small scale security equipment designed to strengthen points of entry to the dwelling; for security lighting; for smoke alarms and for the once-off cost of installing socially monitored personal alarm systems. Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with socially-monitored alarm systems are not provided for under the scheme.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On 2 February 2007 I launched the Social Finance Foundation to implement the Social Finance Initiative announced in Budget 2006. The Social Finance Foundation has been established on a not-for-profit basis to act as a wholesale supplier of social finance for on-lending by specialist social finance lenders to support social and developmental projects and social enterprise in local communities. The Foundation established under company law is governed by its members/directors. The Foundation has received seed funding of &euro;25 million from the Irish banking sector for distribution to qualifying intermediaries. These lending intermediaries are expected to comprise existing social finance lenders, as well as those that emerge as a result of the establishment of the Foundation.</P>
        <P>The Foundation&rsquo;s lending policies and procedures as well as the appointment, role and remuneration of staff are matters for the board of the Foundation. The board of the Foundation is chaired by Mr Peter Quinn. Information on the other directors of the Foundation was included in the press release issued by my Department which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.finance.gov.ie. The Chair indicated at the launch that the Foundation intends to commence its lending activities by mid-year. I see the launch of the Social Finance Foundation as a catalyst for deeper participation by private finance in the area of local and community development and social finance projects, over and above the significant seed funding contributed by the banks.</P>

	<P>A number of areas in Mayo are already designated for relief under the 2 main area based tax incentive schemes, Ballina was among the 42 towns and cities that had integrated areas designated for tax relief under the 1999 Urban Renewal Scheme, while Belmullet, Charlestown and Foxford had sub-areas and sites designated for tax relief under the Town Renewal Scheme.  Under both of these schemes tax relief has been and continues to be provided for the refurbishment and construction of certain residential, commercial and industrial buildings.</P>
        <P>Following a major review of various property and area based tax incentive schemes I announced in Budget 2006 that the various existing reliefs either had achieved the objectives set out for them or were no longer considered to be cost effective in terms of the objectives set out for them and were therefore being terminated subject to certain transitional provisions. These included the Urban Renewal and Town Renewal Schemes.   While I will continue to assess the role that time-limited tax relief schemes can play in supporting public policy objectives, there are no proposals at present to re-introduce tax incentive schemes along the lines of the ongoing Urban or Town Renewal Schemes in County Mayo.</P>

	<P>In relation to the NDP 2000-2006 the figures reported at the recent NDP/CSF Monitoring Committee meeting in December 2006 indicate that some &euro;11.7 billion of Exchequer and EU expenditure has been incurred in the BMW region by the end of June 2006.  The original Exchequer and EU forecast for the BMW region for the lifetime of the Plan is &euro;14.5 billion.  Accordingly, this is a healthy implementation rate in view of the slow start up in some areas at the very beginning, the relatively disappointing response in certain demand led schemes and the fact that Exchequer spending in relation to Structural Fund Measures for the 2000-2006 period will in fact continue up to 2008 in accordance with EU Regulations.</P>
        <P>Based on the most recent information available to me from Monitoring Committee reports including their assessments of continuing spend under the current NDP, I expect that by the end of the programme period in 2008, Exchequer and EU spending in the BMW region will be in the <Col N="933"/>region of &euro;14 billion.  It is therefore totally incorrect to contend as the Deputy continues to do, that there will be any underspend of the order of &euro;3.75 billion in the BMW region.  I can only conclude that the Deputy, with others, continues to insist on this misrepresentation for the purposes of deliberately misleading the public, and in an effort to curry some sort of favour with the electorate on a false basis.</P>
        <P>Chapter 3 of the recently launched National Development Plan 2007-2013 sets out a strong framework for the promotion of regional development with a particular focus on investment in the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) Gateway centres. In this context the Plan correctly recognises the need to promote a strong and efficient Greater Dublin Area given its central role in driving development not just in its own region but in the State as a whole. The Plan also recognises the need to promote the other Gateway centres, Hubs &mdash; including Castlebar/Ballina, county towns and rural areas.</P>
        <P>Five of the Gateway centres &mdash; Dundalk, Letterkenny/Derry, Midlands, Galway and Sligo &mdash; are in the Border, Midlands and West Region. The Plan points out that in addition to the specific Gateway projects mentioned &ldquo;there will be many additional programmes and projects funded under the Plan which will play an important role in the economic and social development of the Gateway Regions, including the Hubs, county towns and rural areas of the Regions&rdquo;. There is also a Chapter of the Plan dedicated to the Rural Economy. The projects listed are undoubtedly key ones not only for the Gateway centres but also to improve linkages within them and other regions. Finally, it can be expected that the BMW region will benefit directly from the consolidated and enhanced framework for all-island cooperation set out in the Plan.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Plan provides for the establishment of a Gateways Innovation Fund of some &euro;300 million of Exchequer funding for the period 2008-2010. The purpose of this fund is to leverage matching private and other public funding for projects that give added value to Gateway development. The Fund will of course be accessible to Gateway areas in the Border, Midlands and West Regional Authority areas.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if inheritance or other tax is due in the transfer from father to daughter of a site to build a home for herself on her father&rsquo;s lands; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The transfer of land can incur liability to tax under three tax heads; namely capital acquisitions tax (CAT) (which includes gift and inheritance tax); capital gains tax (CGT) and stamp duty.  However, there are a number of reliefs and allowances in place in respect of each of these taxes to reduce the burden of taxation with regard to the transfer of a site from a parent to a child for the purposes of building a home.</P>
        <P>The CAT code contains &ldquo;Group threshold&rdquo; exemptions, based on relationships, which provide relief from CAT on the disposal of assets between individuals.  The Group threshold applying to a gift or inheritance received by a child from her parents for 2007 is &euro;496,824. Any other gifts/inheritances that might have been received by the child from her parents since 5 December 1991 will also be taken into account when applying the threshold for the purposes of calculating the gift/inheritance tax.  In this respect, if the value of the site now being transferred plus the value of any other gifts/inheritances received by the daughter from her parents since 5 December 1991 is, in total, below &euro;496,824, no CAT will arise on the transfer.</P>
        <P>Where land is transferred upon death, no charge to CGT or stamp duty arises.  Life transfers may be liable to CGT and stamp duty in the normal manner.  However, section 603A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and section 83A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 provide an exemption from CGT and stamp duty, respectively, in the case of a transfer of a site from a parent to a child, in certain circumstances, for the purposes of building a residence.  The conditions are that (a) the site may not be greater in value than &euro;254,000,  and (b) the child must construct a dwelling house on the site and occupy it as her only or main residence for at least 3 years.  In addition, the Finance Bill 2007 contains provisions to limit the size of the site concerned in the relief to 1 acre.  A transfer by the child to her spouse will not constitute a transfer which withdraws the relief.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, that based on the information supplied, they have been unable to trace any claim by the named person under the Disabled Drivers and the Disabled Passengers (Tax Concession) Regulations, 1994.</P>
        <P>The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. To get the Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions:</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</P><Col N="939"/>
        <P LI="1">(b) be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</P>

      <P LI="1">(e) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</P>
       <P LI="1">(f) have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Senior Medical Officer (SMO) for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the SMO to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.</P>
        <P>A special Interdepartmental Review Group reviewed the operation of the Disabled Drivers Scheme.  The terms of reference of the Group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The Group&rsquo;s Report, published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme.  It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The Report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.</P>
        <P>In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration.  For this reason, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Review Group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. This consideration is undertaken on a regular basis.</P>

        <Quest> the number of persons in posts due to decentralise who have been reassigned to other positions; <Col N="940"/>if the central application system promised to facilitate those wishing to remain in Dublin has been established; the number of vacancies that have been notified to it for filling; the number of applications it has received for those posts; and the reason so little progress has been made in this dimension of redeployment. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Over ten thousand six hundred civil and public servants have applied to relocate under the Decentralisation Programme. At the end of December 2006, over 2,400 staff had been assigned to decentralising posts.  Some 700 of these are currently in place, in 15 new locations, while the remainder are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available. It is envisaged that by the end of 2007 public services will be delivered from 33 of the decentralisation towns with approximately 2,000 staff transferred. The precise numbers moving within that time frame will depend on the availability of property as well as timeframes for completion of fit out and installation of necessary ICT (information communications technology) and telecommunication cabling and equipment.</P>
        <P>The primary mechanism for placing civil servants who are in posts which are due to decentralise but wish to remain in Dublin is by way of bilateral transfer.  As staff, in organisations who are remaining in Dublin, who have applied to decentralise continue to be transferred into decentralising organisations, the posts they vacate become available to those wishing to remain in Dublin.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Public Appointments Service has commenced the operation of a system which will match Dublin based posts with people wishing to remain in Dublin.  Any decentralising organisation which anticipates that it will have staff wishing to remain in Dublin who cannot be placed within the organisation will engage with the Public Appointments Service in the placement of these individuals. Following detailed discussions with the civil service unions, the precise operation of these arrangements has recently been amended to improve their overall effectiveness. The aim is to achieve a close alignment between the assignment of staff to Dublin posts and the readiness of Departments to release staff at particular grade levels. In that context, Departments and Offices have been asked to update their returns to the Public Appointments Service. The information sought by the Deputy will be furnished as soon as that exercise is completed. Discussions are ongoing with the unions representing professional &amp; technical staff in the Civil Service on this issue.</P>
        <P>The position in relation to the State Agencies is of course more complex and further complicated by the absence of any tradition of or agreement on inter-changeability between Public Service organisations and between the Public <Col N="941"/>Service and the Civil Service.  Progress has been slower than I would have wished in advancing agreement between management and trade unions on the issues involved. It is my strong view that they can only be resolved through dialogue and negotiations and my Department is pursuing directly with ICTU proposals for getting central discussions underway on the full range of industrial relations issues relating to the decentralisation of State agencies.</P>

        <Quest> the regulations that apply under the Finance Acts or are operated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority regarding the setting up of bank accounts by persons who are unable to provide a utility bill, as gas and electricity bills are paid by the landlords and then apportioned to the individual tenants; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is nothing in tax law requiring the use of a utility bill to set up a bank account. The Deputy may have in mind the requirements of the EU Savings Directive. As the Deputy will be aware, the Savings Directive (which was transposed into Irish law as sections 898B to 898R of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997) provides for most EU Member States to exchange information on the cross border payment of interest to individuals resident in another Member State.</P>
        <P>In order to comply with the Directive, paying agents (including banks) in EU member states report to their home state details of all payments of interest made to or secured for beneficial owners who are resident in another member state. In order to identify whether or not an individual is reportable, the paying agent must establish the identity and residence of any individual who opens an account on or after 1 January 2004.  In doing this, it may be that a bank would seek sight of a utility bill in order to establish the residence of the individual but there is no obligation on them to do so and there are a range of other options available to establish such details.</P><Col N="942"/>
        <P>Section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 requires financial institutions to take reasonable measures to identify their customers. Recommended procedures for the implementation of this provision are set out in Guidance Notes issued under the aegis of the Money Laundering Steering Committee which is chaired by the Department of Finance and includes representatives of financial services industry bodies and the regulatory authorities and State Agencies, <?oasys _ch ?>including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The full text of the Money Laundering Guidance Notes for Credit Institutions is available on the Department of Finance website: http://www.finance.gov.ie/ Publications/otherpubs/monlaun.htm.</P>
        <P>Identification of a customer comprises two elements. These are name verification (typically evidenced by photograph bearing document such as passport, driving licence or other reputable source document) and address verification.  Paragraph 45 of the Guidance Notes provides for those persons who cannot reasonably be expected to produce certain forms of identification, such as a passport or driving licence and/or whose name and Irish address does not appear on a utility bill, electoral register or directory.</P>
        <P>The alternative methods of address verification set out in the Guidance Notes include:</P>
        <P>Letter/statement from a licensed employment agency that the person has recently arrived in Ireland and is commencing employment or from an employer that the person has commenced employment and in each case stating that the person is not in a position to produce a utility bill or other document which shows an Irish address.  In addition, in such cases the prospective customer should be required to submit follow-up documentation (e.g. utility bill) confirming Irish address in due course.</P>
        <P>Letter/statement from a person in a position of responsibility (e.g. a solicitor, accountant, doctor, minister of religion, teacher, social worker, community employment scheme supervisor) who is in a position to confirm the person&rsquo;s address to the credit institution. In such instances the person providing the letter/statement must present themselves to the relevant credit institution providing proof of their own identity and verifying their status to the credit institution.</P>
        <P>Documentation/cards issued by a Government Department showing the address of the person.</P>
        <P>Normally difficulties arising at account opening are resolved by an approach from the prospective customer to the branch management or to the bank&rsquo;s customer service department. I should stress that it is a matter for each institution to ensure that its procedures satisfy the legal requirement under the Criminal Justice Act 1994 that financial institutions take reasonable measures to identify their customers. The Financial Regulator has also included in its Consumer Protection Code a requirement that any measures adopted in relation to identification of customers <Col N="943"/>should not deny a person access to financial services solely on the grounds that they do not possess certain specified identification documentation.</P>

        <P>The National Development Plan (2007-2013) is a strategic document setting out a broad investment framework and investment priorities, together with indicative financial allocations, for the next seven years.  It does not contain a list of all projects to be undertaken in 2007 and/or over the period of the Plan, although certain Chapters, including those on Regional Development, Economic Infrastructure and Social Infrastructure, refer to projects scheduled for delivery or progression between now and the end of 2013.   I understand that other Ministers will be replying in respect of their own areas of responsibility.</P>
        <P>In the case of my own Department, most of the investment, including any relevant large scale infrastructural projects, to be made under the NDP will be made by the Office of Public Works (OPW).

        <P>Aside from the above, the only other relevant expenditure under the aegis of my Department concerns PEACE III.  However, no expenditure is expected to be required under PEACE III until 2008 as it takes time to establish the programme.  There will be expenditure of some &euro;2m related to projects commenced before 2007 under PEACE II that will be completed in 2007/08.</P>

	<P>The foster care allowance can only be paid in respect of children who are taken into the care of the Health Service Executive and placed in foster care or relative care in accordance with the Child Care Regulations, 1995.</P>
        <P>In 1998 the then Minister of State in the Department of Health set up a Working Group on Foster Care.  The task of the Working Group was to make recommendations on all aspects of foster care.  The issue of relative care was dealt with in detail in the 2001 Report of the Working Group entitled &lsquo;Foster Care &mdash; A Child Centred Partnership&rsquo;.  The Report sets out a number of basic principles that should guide placements with relatives.  These are:</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />That the best interests of the child are paramount</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />That the child should be placed only in an appropriate, safe, healthy and stable environment</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />That the standard of care must be equivalent to that provided in a traditional foster care arrangement</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />That relative placements should only be made where a secure attachment exists or <Col N="947"/>has the potential to  develop between the child and the relative concerned</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />That a partnership approach should be used in developing skills and supports for relatives providing foster care</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />That placements should not be made as a means to provide income support.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Working Group considered the possibility that some children are placed in the care of the Health Service Executive in order to provide income support for the family in relation to the child.  The Group was strongly of the view that such a practice would be highly inappropriate.  Income support is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs and those in need of such support should contact that Department.  The Working Group stated that children should only be brought into the care of the Health Service Executive if they meet the criteria regarding the need for care and protection set out in the Child Care Act.  In addition, the choice of placement of any child in the care system should be based on the particular child&rsquo;s individual best interests.</P>
        <P>Under the current legislation, the Health Service Executive must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers, and draw up a child care plan.  The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives.  The Foster Care Allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children.</P>

        <Quest> if the model of care for children&rsquo;s services in County Galway arising out of the implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 has yet to be implemented; the nature of that plan; when she anticipates its full implementation; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government launched the National Disability Strategy, in 2004, as a framework of positive action measures to support the participation of people with disabilities in Irish society. Two new pieces of legislation &mdash; the Education for Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 and the Disability Act, 2005 form an integral part of this Strategy, along with the suite of six sectoral plans, launched in 2006.</P>
        <P>One of the most important aspects of my Department&rsquo;s sectoral plan is the arrangements for commencing Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, which provides a statutory entitlement to &mdash; an independent assessment of health and education needs; a statement of the services (Service Statement) which it is proposed to provide; and the right to pursue a complaint through an independent redress mechanism if there is a failure to provide these entitlements.</P><Col N="949"/>
        <P>Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 will be commenced on a national basis (including Galway) in respect of persons of different ages as follows: for children aged less than 5 years &mdash; with effect from 1, June 2007; for children aged 5 years to 18 years  &mdash; in tandem with the implementation of the EPSEN Act 2004; and for persons aged over 18 years &mdash; as soon as possible but no later than 31 December 2011.</P>
        <P>Services for adults and children will continue to be enhanced progressively over the next number of years. The commitment by the Government to provide a Multiannual Investment programme of some &euro;900m over the period 2006-2009 for disability support services recognises the need to build capacity in the health services to deliver on these obligations. The bulk of this funding, around &euro;720m, is being spent in the health services.  I have allocated &euro;100m in 2006 and a further &euro;100m in 2007 for the continuing development of services for people with a disability.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The development of radiation oncology at Waterford Regional Hospital (WRH) is an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s National Plan for Radiation Oncology.  This will be part of a major oncology development at WRH, including the provision of a 20 bed oncology day ward.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised that it is not intended to provide this development under its co-location initiative at the hospital.</P>
        <P>It is my objective and that of the HSE to see the earliest delivery of the Plan in the best interests of cancer patients throughout the country.  In December last year I met with the Chairman and Chief Executive of the HSE and discussed the timelines for the delivery of the National Plan.    The HSE is examining options to speed up the pace of delivery and will make recommendations to me shortly.   In the interim, a service level agreement was signed on 1 February between the HSE and the University of Pitts<Col N="950"/>burgh Medical Centre Whitfield Clinic in County Waterford.  This will support the referral of public patients for radiation oncology treatment pending the commissioning of the radiation oncology centre at WRH.</P>

        <P>Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, including responsibility for the collection of data on hospital activity, is a matter for the Health Service Executive.  My Department has, therefore, requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the specific information requested.</P>
        <P>Improving the delivery of Accident and Emergency services is the Government&rsquo;s top priority in health.  Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in A &amp; E and do not require admission.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive continues to report significant improvements in the number of patients in A &amp; E departments who are awaiting admission to an acute bed as compared with the same period last year.  The average number of <Col N="951"/>patients awaiting admission during December/January was more than 50% lower than the equivalent period twelve months ago.</P>
        <P>Last year the HSE introduced a target of 24 hours within which all patients should be admitted, following the decision to admit.  This target is being achieved by the vast majority of hospitals.  The HSE is working closely with the small number of hospitals who are continuing to experience difficulties to assist them in reaching this target.  The HSE has announced that it will be introducing a revised target of 12 hours within which a patient should be admitted, following the decision to admit.  The HSE will also shortly be introducing a monitoring system to record the total time patients spend in A &amp; E departments, from the time they arrive to the time they are either discharged or admitted.</P>

	<P>The Medical Council is the statutory body charged with responsibility for, inter alia, the governance of the practice of medical practitioners.  Policy guidelines in respect of the issue raised by the Deputy are set out in the Medical Council &ldquo;Guide to Ethical Conduct and Behaviour of Medical Practitioners&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The relevant extract from the Ethical Guide states as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">For the seriously ill patient who is unable to communicate or understand, it is desirable that the doctor discusses management with the next of kin or the legal guardians prior to the doctor reaching a decision particularly about the use or non-use of treatments which will not contribute to recovery from the primary illness.  In <Col N="952"/>the event of a dispute between the doctor and relatives, a second opinion should be sought from a suitably qualified and independent medical practitioner.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Access to nutrition and hydration remain one of the basic needs of human beings, and all reasonable and practical efforts should be made to maintain both.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Where death is imminent, it is the responsibility of the doctor to take care that the sick person dies with dignity, in comfort, and with as little suffering as possible. In these circumstances a doctor is not obliged to initiate or maintain a treatment which is futile or disproportionately burdensome. Deliberately causing the death of a patient is professional misconduct.</P>

	<P>The assessment of eligibility to medical cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants. The Health Act 1970 provides that medical cards may be granted, under Section 45(1)(a), to adult persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. Furthermore, medical cards are also provided, under Section 45(1)(b) of the Act, to dependants of the adult persons referred to in Section 45(1)(a).</P>
        <P>Section 58 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, provides that  GP visit cards may be granted to adult persons with limited eligibility for whom, in the opinion of the HSE, and notwithstanding that they do not qualify for a medical card, it would be unduly burdensome to arrange GP medical  and surgical services for themselves and their dependants, and also to the dependants of such adult persons. Persons aged 70 and over are statutorily entitled to a medical card, regardless of income. In all other cases an assessment of means is undertaken.</P>
        <P>In assessing eligibility, the HSE use guidelines based on people&rsquo;s means, which includes their <Col N="957"/>income, certain allowable outgoings and the effect of  other factors which may impact on people&rsquo;s ability to meet the cost of GP services.  These guidelines are not statutorily binding. A decision to refuse an application or renewal of a medical card may be appealed to the Executive for further consideration.</P>
        <P>The HSE has indicated that in a case where particular circumstances are confined to an individual or individuals within a family, the matter may be dealt with by approving a medical card, under section 45(7) of the Health Act, 1970,  for the family member(s) involved. The question of extending full eligibility to dependants of such persons is considered according to the merits of each case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Social Care Workers (formerly known as assistant house parents) work in intellectual disability services and also work in residential and community childcare services.  Social care staff provide care, protection, support, welfare and advocacy for vulnerable and dependent users of the services.  In 2000 the Expert Group on Various Health Professions recommended that childcare workers be afforded formal professional status. A Joint Committee on Childcare Workers was established and it agreed interim restructuring arrangements in the context of the decision to introduce formal professional status in the area.</P>
        <P>The pay of the grades in the area was significantly improved and all future entrants were required to hold a professional qualification. In 2002 the Report of the Joint Committee on Social Care Professionals recommended that equivalent grades in the intellectual disability sector should be professionalised in the same manner as colleagues in childcare services. In June 2002 the Public Service Benchmarking Body reported and recommended that social care workers in the intellectual disability services should receive the increases that had been granted to their counterparts in childcare services.</P>
        <P>This increase which the social care workers received meant that their basic pay was now at a higher level than staff nurses who work in the Intellectual Disability sector. Approximately 6% of nurses are employed in intellectual disability services. This differential in favour of social care workers caused a sense of grievance among their nurse colleagues and in October 2002 nurses in the ID sector voted for industrial action.</P>
        <P>In September 2003 a conciliation conference was held under the auspices of the Labour Relation Commission. Agreement was reached <Col N="958"/>between health service employers and the Nursing Alliance (Irish Nurses Organisation, Psychiatric Nurses Association, SIPTU and IMPACT) on a mechanism for dealing with the nurses&rsquo; grievances. It was agreed between employers and the Nursing Alliance that any future benchmarking exercise would be the appropriate forum to examine the full position of the Registered Mental Handicap Nurses grade vis-a-vis other Social Care Professionals. The Nursing Alliance subsequently informed employers that a ballot of nurses in the ID sector had resulted in a rejection of the agreement reached in the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue was referred to the Labour Court which issued its Recommendation (LCR17805) in April 2004. The Labour Court was satisfied that a formal pay &ldquo;differential&rdquo; did not exist between Childcare Workers and Registered Nurses working in the Intellectual Disability sector. The Court noted that in the understanding reached between the parties at the conciliation conference on 3rd September 2003 both sides accepted that the report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body severed all pay links and established new absolute levels of pay for benchmarked grades. There was also an acceptance that any future benchmarking exercise (or whatever subsequent arrangements are put in place for determining public service pay) would be the appropriate forum to examine the full position of the Registered Mental Handicap Nurse grade vis-&agrave;-vis other social care professionals. The Court was of the view that the claim could not be dealt with outside of the established agreements and could see no other way in which the claim could be pursued other than in accordance with the terms of the understanding reached at the conciliation conference. The Court recommended that the matter be dealt with in accordance with the understanding reached between the parties at the conciliation conference on 3rd September 2003 and that it be given priority in this Benchmarking exercise.</P>
        <P>The second Public Service Benchmarking Body as provided for under Sustaining Progress was established in January 2006. The terms of reference were agreed with the Public Services Committee of ICTU. The terms of reference specifically state that the Benchmarking Body should consider any issues arising from any third party recommendations concerning benchmarking and any group since the Body&rsquo;s first report, including, specifically, Labour Court Recommendation 17805 which dealt with the pay &lsquo;anomaly&rsquo; between nurses and social care workers. The INO and PNA decided not to participate in the Benchmarking exercise. The unions failed to make a written submission on behalf of their members and did not attend the oral hearings on nurses pay held on 16 October 2006. SIPTU and IMPACT who represent a minority of nurses did make submissions to the Benchmarking Body on the pay &lsquo;anomaly&rsquo; between social care workers <Col N="959"/>and nurses. The Report of the Benchmarking Body will be published in the latter half of 2007.</P>
        <P>Instead of participating in the agreed process for determining public service pay the INO and PNA lodged eight cost increasing claims in December 2005,  including a claim with retrospection for a 10.6% increase across all nursing and midwifery grades to place nurses&rsquo; salaries at a higher level than those of social care workers. It is estimated that this claim would add &euro;225m to annual nurses pay bill.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court examined the eight claims in June 2006 and issued a comprehensive recommendation (LCR 18763) in November 2006. In relation to the pay &lsquo;anomaly&rsquo; between nurses and social care workers, the Court noted that it had previously issued a recommendation on the issue and that this recommendation is specifically referred to in the terms of reference of the Benchmarking Body. The Court also noted that the current claim was &ldquo;considerably broader in scope and encompasses the totality of nursing and midwifery grades&rdquo;. It was the court&rsquo;s view that &ldquo;such a claim could only be processed through Benchmarking&rdquo;. In these circumstances the Court did &ldquo;not recommend concession of this claim at this time&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This is a complex issue and I am conscious of the strongly held views of the nursing unions in relation to the pay differential that exists between social care workers and nurses in the ID sector. The agreement reached in the Labour Relations Commission in 2003 provided a framework for dealing with this matter. The Labour Court has examined this claim on two occasions and recommended that the unions concerned process this claim through Benchmarking as previously agreed. It remains the Government&rsquo;s view that this is the appropriate mechanism to resolve this contentious issue. I would ask the INO and PNA to give further consideration to the Recommendation of the Labour Court and to make the case on behalf of their members before the Benchmarking Body.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, which was launched in January 2006, provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over the next seven to ten years.  The Government has accepted the Report as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.</P>
        <P>In March 2006, I appointed an independent monitoring group to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;.  The group will monitor and assess progress on the implementation of all the recommendations including those which fall under the responsibility of the HSE, government departments and other relevant agencies.  The Group is to submit its first annual report in mid 2007.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the individual recommendations of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; is a matter primarily for the HSE.  The HSE established an implementation group in July 2006 to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; a reality.  I have been informed by the HSE that they plan to publish a Progress Report and outline the proposed implementation programme over the 10 year life of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; in the near future.  Both of these groups will play an important role in ensuring that the recommendations are implemented in a co-ordinated and timely manner.</P>
        <P>In 2006, a sum of  &euro;26.2 million was provided for the development of our mental health services in line with &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;.  A further sum of &euro;25 million has been allocated for 2007 to continue this development.</P>

	<P>An effective national cervical screening programme will result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer.  It is my objective to have such a programme rolled out, beginning late this year, based on an affordable model.  For that purpose, on 1 January 2007, I established a National Cancer Screening Service which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme.  This will maximise the expertise in both programmes, ensure improved efficiency <Col N="966"/>and develop a single governance model for cancer screening.</P>
        <P>I have allocated additional funding of &euro;5m for 2007 to the Service to commence roll out of the Cervical Screening Programme.  The total allocation to the new Service is &euro;33m; this is a 71% increase in the 2006 allocation to the Programmes.  Significant preparatory work is well underway involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register.  The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service.</P>
        <P>Statistics in relation to cancer incidence are collated by the National Cancer Registry.  My Department has asked the Director of the Registry to examine these matters and to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>In making arrangements for the provision of publicly funded GP services, under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme, an agreement was negotiated between the Department of Health and Children and the GP representative body, the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO).  The provisions of this agreement took the form of the current GMS GP Capitation Contract.  This contract is a treatment based contract and gives effect to the statutory requirement to provide free GP medical and surgical services to eligible people which includes people aged 70 and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card.  The contract stipulates that the fees paid to GMS GPs are not made in respect of certain certificates which may be required for example &lsquo;under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences&rsquo;.  As these non-treatment type services are outside of the GMS GP contract it is a matter between the GP and the person seeking the particular services to agree a fee.</P>
        <P>While certificates for driving licence applications are provided by medical practitioners they are not a medical treatment service and are not considered a core aspect of public health service provision.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Central to the concept of food labelling is that the consumer should not be misled.  In addition, consumers should be provided with sufficient clear information to allow them to make food consumption choices which best suit their circumstances and preferences: an appropriate labelling system is a key element to enable these informed choices to be made.</P>
        <P>Food labelling, by its nature, covers a wide range of issues and, against this background, officials of my Department are in regular contact with officials in other Government Departments and agencies and they participate at various fora with a view to ensuring a balanced and co-ordinated approach to labelling issues &mdash; both nationally and internationally.</P>
        <P>The intention of the &lsquo;traffic light&rsquo; nutrition labelling system is to provide a clear and simple means to allow consumers to select healthier foods to support a healthier diet.  However, at present, there are some concerns that such signposting information, which is essentially summary information, may be used selectively and the information provided may not reflect the full nutritional value of the product.  My Department is also aware that providing such summary information on the front of pack may in fact discourage consumers from reading the full nutrition information in the nutrition panel.</P>
        <P>There would also appear to be a profusion of front of pack labelling schemes in addition to the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) &lsquo;traffic light&rsquo; system.  The principal basis of alternative schemes is the use of Guideline Daily Amounts (GDAs).  However, there are many different presentations of the GDA approach on products available on the Irish market &mdash; some with traffic light colour coding and others where colour is not relevant in interpreting the GDA information provided.  Consequently, there is a concern that rather than providing clarity to consumers, current front of <Col N="972"/>pack labelling may actually be adding to consumer confusion.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, it is my Department&rsquo;s view that clarity in food labelling needs to be achieved through the development of a consumer-friendly, EU wide approach to nutrition labelling.  My Department and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI)  are focusing efforts on the nutrition labelling reform process currently underway in the European Union, where front of pack labelling will be examined.  Pending the outcome of this process, I have no plans to initiate research into food labelling.</P>

	<P>Pandemic Influenza Preparedness for Ireland &mdash; Advice of the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group was published as a consultative document on 15th January 2007.  Following a three month consultation period, which will end on 30th April 2007, a final version will be published.</P>
        <P>The Expert Group reviewed the non-pharmaceutical public health interventions recommended by the World Health Organisation and recommendations are made on the interventions that would be appropriate to implement in Ireland, by pandemic phase.</P>
        <P>The World Health Organisation does not recommend the closing of international borders at any pandemic phase.  This is supported by modelling work by Ferguson et al published in Nature magazine in 2006 which showed that border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread by more than 2-3 weeks unless more than 99% effective.</P>
        <P>The Expert Group advises the following measures from the World Health Organisation Pandemic Phase 4 onwards at borders for inter<Col N="973"/>national travellers coming from or going to affected areas:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. Health Alert notices should be provided to all travellers</P>
        <P LI="1">2. Travellers to and from affected areas should be advised to self-report if they have illness.</P>
        <P LI="1">3. Exit screening for at-risk travellers &mdash; identified via health questionnaires or declaration notices &mdash; should be implemented.</P>
       <P LI="1">4.  All intending passengers who are ill should be recommended to postpone travel.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Expert Group advice has been brought to the attention of relevant Government Departments through the Inter-Departmental Committee on Public Health Emergency Planning.</P>
        <P>The Expert Group considers that entry screening such as screening for symptoms (visual detection of systems), health screening questionnaires, thermal screening, and medical examination should not be necessary.  However, if there is evidence that exit screening at the point of embarkation does not meet the standards expected, it may be considered following consultation with WHO and EU colleagues.  Discussions are ongoing at European level on potential public health interventions to limit the spread of an influenza pandemic.</P>

	<P>The Inquiry into peripartum hysterectomy at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda chaired by Judge Maureen Harding Clark S.C. was established by the Government in 2004 following the decision of the Medical Council to remove Dr. Michael Neary from the Register of Medical Practitioners after finding him guilty of professional misconduct.</P>
        <P>Following the publication of the Inquiry Report in February 2006, Judge Clark was requested by the Government to advise on an appropriate scheme of redress arising from the findings of the Report.  Judge Clark was also requested to advise on a mechanism for ensuring maximum recoupment from wrongdoers and indemnifiers of any monies payable under an agreed redress scheme; including the estimated cost of the scheme.  Judge Clark is finalising her proposals and I expect to receive her report <Col N="974"/>shortly.  The proposals will then be brought to the Government for consideration and decision.</P>

	<P>The report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, entitled &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, was launched in January 2006.  It provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over the next 7 to 10 years.  &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; recommends that child and adolescent mental health services should provide mental health services to all aged 0-18 years.</P><Col N="975"/>
        <P>Transitional arrangements to facilitate the expansion of current service provision pending the provision of new child and adolescent units were considered and planned by a HSE forum on Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Inpatient Capacity.  The forum&rsquo;s report was published in September 2006 and has been accepted by the board of the HSE.  It recommended, as an interim measure pending the development of child and adolescent in-patient units, the provision of an additional 24-32 dedicated adolescent psychiatric beds, primarily for the 16 and 17 year age group, across the four HSE administrative areas.  Dedicated child and adolescent multidisciplinary teams will be provided for these additional beds and training will be provided for staff in the identified units.  In addition, a further 12 beds will be provided at existing child psychiatric units (6 in St Anne&rsquo;s, Galway and 6 in Warrenstown House, Dublin) for the under 16 age group.</P>
        <P>The Mental Health Commission acknowledges that the admission of children to adult units is undesirable, however, in situations where there is no available alternative, such admissions may be necessary.  The Commission has issued a code of practice relating to the admission of children under the Mental Health Act 2001 to ensure that the best interests of children are protected at all times.</P>
        <P>In addition to the transitional arrangements outlined above, planning for four 20-bed child and adolescent inpatient units in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick is underway.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 386 and 387 together.</P>
        <P>The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, which was launched in January 2006, provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over the next seven to ten years.  The Government has accepted the Report as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.</P>
        <P>In March 2006, I appointed an independent monitoring group to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;.  The group will monitor and assess progress on the implementation of all the recommendations including those which fall under the responsibility of the HSE, government <Col N="977"/>departments and other relevant agencies.  The Group is to submit its first annual report in mid 2007.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the individual recommendations of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; is a matter primarily for the HSE.  The HSE established an implementation group in July 2006 to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; a reality.  I have been informed by the HSE that they plan to publish a Progress Report and outline the proposed implementation programme over the 10 year life of &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; in the near future.</P>
        <P>Both of these groups will play an important role in ensuring that the recommendations are implemented in a co-ordinated and timely manner.  In 2006, a sum of &euro;26.2 million was provided for the development of our mental health services in line with &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;.  A further sum of &euro;25 million has been allocated for 2007 to continue this development.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Nurses Organisation (INO) and the Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA) are pursuing a number of cost increasing claims in respect of pay and conditions of nurses and midwives. </P>
        <P>The claims were heard by the Labour Court on 20 June 2006 and a recommendation (LCR 18763) issued on 9 November 2006.  In its recommendation the Labour Court noted that the social partnership agreements have brought significant benefits to workers, employers and to the economy overall and they provide a fair mechanism within an agreed framework by which workers can obtain improvements in pay and conditions of employment.  The Court did not recommend concession of the major cost increasing pay claims.  Instead the Court urged the Unions concerned to reconsider their position with regard to Benchmarking so as to have their pay claims examined through that process.</P>
        <P>In relation to the claim for a reduction in working hours from 39 to 35 hours per week, the Court stated that concession of this claim at this time would have profound consequences for both health care delivery and costs unless effective countervailing measures could be put in place.  The Court did recommend that the parties should jointly explore the possibility of initiating an appropriate process aimed at achieving major reorganisation of working arrangements and practices within the health service generally.  The Court also stated that such an initiative should take account of and support existing development involving other groups. It held the view that if such a programme of change could be successfully implemented, the efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits accruing may allow this claim to be processed within a reasonable timeframe to be agreed between the parties.</P>
        <P>I would emphasise that the Labour Court Recommendation has been accepted by the Health Service Employers but regrettably the Unions have stated that they neither accept or reject the Labour Court Recommendation.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Health and Children I would like to place on record that I hold the nursing and midwifery professions in high esteem and view the care they provide to patients as a critical component of our health services.  The Government has agreed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions a basis on which pay and conditions for the public service as a whole should be managed and the Benchmarking Body has been established to provide an objective means of assessing the appropriate pay for particular groups or professions.  The Benchmarking Body is due to report in the second half of the year and is in a position to review the issues that the nursing unions feel strongly about. I believe that a sol<Col N="980"/>ution to the current dispute can be found within the context of the Labour Court Recommendation and the prevailing national agreements.  In this regard I arranged for exploratory discussions to be held between all the parties concerned at the offices of the HSE-Employers Agency on 19 January 2007.  While I understand the discussions provided clarity as to the respective positions of the parties the meeting adjourned without agreement on the way forward.</P>
        <P>On 2 February 2007, in accordance with &ldquo;A Framework for Dispute Resolution in the Health Services&rdquo;, the INO and PNA served twenty one days notice of industrial action to the Health Service Executive and related agencies. I am disappointed that the Unions concerned have resorted to the industrial action contained in that notice.</P>
        <P>I would urge the Unions to give further consideration to the course of action and the proposals contained in the Labour Court Recommendation. I believe that this is the most appropriate means by which the nurses claims can be addressed.</P>
        <P>I remain hopeful that a resolution to this dispute can still be found. I firmly believe that the Labour Court&rsquo;s Recommendation in respect of the reduction in working hours should be followed.  I also believe it remains open to the INO and PNA to enter the Benchmarking process and have their claims for pay increases processed through this forum. Two other unions, SIPTU and IMPACT, which also represent nurses are currently participating in the Benchmarking process and have made a submission for improvements in pay and conditions on behalf of their members.</P>
        <P>In addition the INO and PNA could also decide to accept the national agreement, Towards 2016. If they accept this agreement their members would be eligible for pay increases of 10% as provided for in that agreement.</P>

	<P>The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 in keeping with Section 53 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges may be levied.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Class 1</i></P>
        <P>Class 1 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises.  In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;120 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;35, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Class 2</i></P>
        <P>Class 2 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;90, or the weekly income of that person less &euro;55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person. The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo;. Under Section 1 (b) of the Health (Amendment) Act, 2005, the HSE can examine a person&rsquo;s overall financial situation in view of the person&rsquo;s reasonable expenditure in relation to themselves or their dependants, if any.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the HSE, based on its own legal advice and taking into account the individual circumstances as well as the service being provided, to make a decision on any charges levied. <Col N="983"/>It is not my intention to issue any instruction to the HSE in this matter.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, entitled &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo;, was launched in January 2006.  It provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over the next 7 to 10 years.  &ldquo;A Vision for Change&rdquo; acknowledges gaps in the current provision of services for people with eating disorders and makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services. </P>
        <P>Recommendations include support for health promotion initiatives that encourage greater community and family awareness of eating disorders,  the further development of primary and community care services and  the provision of a full multidisciplinary team in a National Centre for Eating Disorders for complex cases that cannot be managed by local child and adolescent community mental health teams.  Responsibility for the implementation of these recommendations rests with the HSE.  In 2006, &euro;26.2 million was allocated for the development of mental health services in line with &ldquo;A Vision for change&rdquo;.  An additional &euro;25 million has been provided in 2007 to continue this development. &euro;0.75 million of this additional funding in 2007 is for the initial development of a dedicated eating disorder service in each area through a combination of reconfiguring existing services and commissioning services from agencies.</P>

	<P>Asthma is not a notifiable disease and consequently, detailed information on its incidence in the general population is not routinely available.  From the research available in this country, however, asthma is a common childhood condition with approximately 10% having experienced an attack of asthma.  Similar to other European countries, the level of asthma has increased and is now approximately 20% in young teenagers.  </P>
        <P>Information on the number of hospital admissions due to asthma, and asthma mortality, is available. The provisional data relating to asthma mortality indicated that in 2005 there were 59 deaths due to asthma. The number of admissions to hospital in 2005 with a principal diagnosis of asthma was 3887. Of these, 714 were categorised as status asthmaticus which is the more severe form of this condition.</P>

        <P>The National Development Plan 2007-13 is a strategic document setting out a broad investment framework and priorities, together with indicative funding, for the next seven years.  It does not contain a list of all projects to be undertaken in 2007 or for the remainder of the Plan, although certain chapters including those on Regional Development, Economic Infrastructure and Social Infrastructure refer to projects to be progressed by 2013.</P>
        <P>The total capital provision for the health service under the new Plan amounts to some &euro;5 billion.  My Department has funding under the NDP to meet the capital requirements of the Office of the Minister for Children and the agencies directly funded by the Department. Specific project proposals have, in the main, yet to be agreed for the period of the NDP.  Projects currently underway include the national roll-out of the Breastcheck programme of the National Cancer Screening Service and a range of initiatives within the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>
        <P>The bulk of the capital funding for healthcare under the NDP is being provided through the Health Service Executive. The Government&rsquo;s sustained high level of investment in healthcare will enable the completion and commissioning of numerous new facilities in both the Acute and  Primary Community and Continuing Care sectors over the period of the Plan.</P>
        <P>The HSE has responsibility for the planning and management of capital projects in the health sector, including a number of  large scale infrastructure projects. My Department has asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to provide the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the initiatives being undertaken by the Executive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The future provision of postal services delivery and the post office network will be, in the first instance, a matter for An Post and other service providers.  As set out clearly in the Programme for Government, this Government and the Board of An Post continue to be committed to the objective of ensuring a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network into the future.  With this in mind, I have asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long-term viability of the post office network and it is in this context that the Government recently gave its approval for An Post to enter into a joint venture agreement with Belgian Bank, Fortis to set up a retail banking business. </P>
        <P>With respect to mail services, I believe that there will continue to be a key national role for An Post in delivery of mails and parcels. However, over the coming years, competition can be expected to increase in these sectors, whether from the privately owned express sector, from the large European public operators now looking for international business or from electronic substitution.</P>
        <P>Liberalisation of the mail market in Ireland has already commenced and the Commission&rsquo;s draft third Postal Directive proposes that the postal sector is to fully liberalise across the EU on 1 January 2009 subject to political agreement.  The draft directive is currently being discussed at Council.  Therefore, in terms of dealing with the challenges facing An Post in the coming years, company management in conjunction with the trade unions, must deliver on restructuring agreements particularly in the mails area.</P>
        <P>The development of the postal market requires the availability of competitive, high quality prod<Col N="989"/>ucts.  The current level of market opening has introduced new players with offerings that meet consumer needs and further market opening will provide further opportunities for new and existing players.  The development of further competition allied with a modernised and customer-focused An Post will provide the basis for the further development of the postal sector here.  I have no plans, at this stage, to publish a green paper in the above regard.</P>

	<P>I have no function in relation to international gas prices, which are set by global commodity markets.  With regard to the prices charged by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002, sole responsibility for the regulation of these prices lies with the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  The prices charged by independent suppliers in the Irish gas market are not regulated.  The question of measures to assist older people is a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, who secured an increase in the rate of the National Fuel Scheme from &euro;14 to &euro;18 per week in the recent Budget.   </P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). </P>
        <P>My priority remains that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  I am aware, despite Government and private investment in broadband, that there are areas of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  To this end, I recently announced a new scheme which will aim to provide a broadband service to these areas.  This National Broadband Scheme (NBS) will replace the Group Broadband <Col N="991"/>Scheme (GBS) and will, when it is fully rolled out, ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met.  A Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently considering all elements of the proposed scheme and work on the design of an appropriate tender will commence in the coming weeks.  This scheme will be confined to areas of the country that are not yet served by any broadband service provider, currently thought to be 10-15% of the population.  Accordingly, there will not be any new call for proposals under the Group Broadband Scheme.</P>

I am aware that, despite Government and private investment in broadband, there are areas of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  Accordingly, I recently announced a new scheme which will aim to provide a broadband service to these areas.  This Scheme, which will supersede the Group Broadband Scheme, will, when it is fully rolled out, ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in rural areas are met.  A Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently considering all elements of the proposed scheme and work on the design of an appropriate tender will commence in the coming weeks.  This scheme will be confined to areas of the country that are not yet served by <Col N="994"/>any broadband service provider, currently thought to be 10-15% of the population.</P>
        <P>My decision to supersede the GBS with the new National Broadband Scheme (NBS) was based on the following factors:</P>
        <P>Firstly, rollout of a GBS project depended on the local community taking the initiative.  Without local initiative, a project could not proceed.  Under the NBS, the selected Service Provider(s) will be required to meet all reasonable requests for broadband by a specified date;</P>
        <P>Additionally, the NBS will deliver a service in all areas that are currently unserved, provided the cost of meeting the request is reasonable.  It would not be appropriate to implement competing schemes targeting unserved areas;</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the uptake of the GBS was less than anticipated.  Just over 7,200 subscribers out of a possible 90,000 subscribers actually availed of a GBS broadband service.  The population covered by the GBS schemes is estimated to be around 400,000 people.  While most of the GBS projects that were rolled out were very effective the relatively low number of subscribers did not meet expectations and a more effective scheme is now required.</P>
        <P>Finally, if both schemes were allowed to run simultaneously each could undermine the effectiveness of the other.  Simultaneous running of both schemes could also give rise to double subsidisation.</P>
        <P>For these reasons, I decided to proceed with the NBS.  Accordingly, there will not be any new call for proposals under the GBS.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will know, the issue of a bridge at Narrow Water has been mooted for many decades.  I am delighted to inform the Deputy that in the National Development Plan for the period 2007 to 2013, the Government proposed, for the first time, significant investment in projects and initiatives for mutual benefit, North and South.  The Government wishes to agree and implement these with the British Government and a restored Northern Ireland Executive at an early date. </P>
        <P>One of the key priorities is improved access along the Eastern corridor, including links between Co. Louth and Co Down.  The development of Narrow Water Bridge would obviously be an important element of that proposal.  I am, and have been for a long time, very supportive of this project which has the potential to benefit significantly both tourism and economic development generally in this border area.  Obviously, agreement with our Northern counterparts would be required and I am working to secure early agreement on the package of proposals, including the Narrow Water Bridge, with the British Government and the incoming Northern Ireland Executive.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 425 to 429, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Universal access to reproductive health is one of the goals of the Programme of Action agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994. The Government is committed to action in support of this goal, which is essential to reducing maternal and infant mortality rates and tackling HIV and AIDS. Limited progress has been made since the Cairo conference in 1994. Reproductive health problems account for 18% of the total global burden of disease and, tragically, half a million women die every year from complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Underlying this tragedy is the lack of access by women, especially in developing countries, to good quality maternal and reproductive health services, including family planning. The Government welcomes the new UN target under Millennium Development Goal 5 to achieve universal access to reproductive health. This will provide much-needed impetus to international action to improve women&rsquo;s health and reduce maternal illness and death.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on Irish Aid outlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting the specific health needs of women within our overall approach to health in developing countries. It states that &lsquo;addressing women&rsquo;s health needs, particularly in the areas of basic health care and maternal and reproductive health must lie at the heart of an effective overall response to improving health in developing countries&rsquo;. This approach is also central to how Ireland&rsquo;s response to HIV/AIDS might better address the needs of women. A strategy document setting out Irish Aid&rsquo;s policy on health is being finalised. It will <Col N="999"/>address the issues of maternal mortality and the unmet need for contraception. Through its country programmes and support for international organisations, Irish Aid will continue to promote the particular health needs of women, emphasising reproductive health services.</P>
        <P>Maternal health is a priority of Irish Aid support for health through bilateral programmes. Funding is provided to support Governments in Ireland&rsquo;s priority countries in sub-Saharan Africa to deliver a package of basic health care, including reproductive health services. Additional support is granted for specific initiatives on maternal health, such as the new midwifery school in Northern Province, Zambia which opened in 2006. Another example is our commitment of &euro;2.3 million in 2006 to a four-year project in Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawi, which aims to improve the provision of maternal health services by mid-level health workers. The Government recognises that local non-governmental organisations play a vital role in the provision of reproductive health services in developing countries, especially in reaching geographically-remote communities and marginalised groups. Irish Aid provides funding to NGOs to complement its support to government programmes. For example, the Government is funding the Lesotho Planned Parenthood Association, which has been successful in the delivery of quality reproductive health services. Our support has enabled this non-governmental organisation to provide voluntary counselling and testing for HIV/AIDS.</P>
        <P>In addition to funding through country programmes, Irish Aid works through several partner agencies in the UN system to address maternal health issues and the unmet need for contraception. One of the main barriers to achieving universal access to reproductive health is the lack of empowerment of women in developing countries. These issues form the core mandate of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), with which Irish Aid has a close relationship. In light of its important mandate, the Government has increased core funding to UNFPA in the last five years from &euro;1.8m in 2002 to &euro;3.1m in 2006. Additionally, in 2006 the Government made a contribution of &euro;500,000 to the newly established UNFPA Trust Fund for Global Reproductive Health Commodities Security, which aims to ensure that Governments have a constant supply of reproductive health commodities. While the 2007 contribution to UNFPA has yet to be finalised, it is likely it will increase further, in keeping with the overall growth in the Programme budget. Decisions on funding to UN funds, programmes and agencies are based on the priorities outlined in the White Paper, as well as the individual organisation&rsquo;s record in the areas of efficiency, coherence and commitment to reform.</P><Col N="1000"/>
        <P Just="Left">Cancer of the cervix is a leading cause of cancer deaths in women and 90% of cases occur in developing countries. Through its support for reproductive health, the Government assists in widening women&rsquo;s access to services that prevent, detect and manage cancer of the cervix. Effective vaccines have recently been developed for human papillomavirus, which causes 70% of cervical cancers. In December 2006, the Government co-sponsored an international event in London that brought together pharmaceutical companies, UN bodies, non-governmental organisations and donors to examine how best to introduce these new vaccines into developing countries. The vaccines remain expensive ($360 per course) and we will continue to work with other partners to accelerate introduction of the vaccine and make it widely accessible to women in developing countries.</P>

Applications for funding under the 2007 programme were invited through advertisements in the Press on October 15 and 16 last. The closing date for receipt of applications was November 24 2006. The organisation in question did not submit an application under the 2007 sports capital programme. </P>
        <P>For the Deputy&rsquo;s further information, section 847a of the Taxes Consolidation Act provides for a scheme for tax relief for relevant donations to approved sports bodies towards the funding of sports capital projects.  Approved sports status can be awarded by my Department for suitable capital projects, allowing for tax relief to be claimed by a club on donations towards the project that exceed the minimum qualifying threshold of &euro;250 per annum.  This scheme does allow for donations to be raised towards the cost of the purchase of land to be used by the approved sports body in the provision of sporting or recreation facilities.</P>
        <P>Full details of the tax relief scheme are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.dast.gov.ie.  Finally, the Deputy should also note that, under the Finance Bill 2007 published last week, a new exemption on stamp duty has been introduced for sporting bodies in relation to purchases of land for the purposes of promoting sports.</P>

	<P>The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, is the primary means of providing funding to sporting and community organisations towards the provision of sporting facilities at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis. Payments in respect of allocations under the sports capital programme and of other sports capital grants such as other grants towards the establishment of key regional and national facilities and to national governing bodies of sport are made from the national lottery-funded C1 subhead of my Department&rsquo;s Vote.</P>
        <P>I have not yet allocated any funding to date in 2007 in respect of sporting and recreational facilities.

All applications received before the deadline are currently being evaluated against the programme&rsquo;s assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.  I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>
        <P>In relation to allocations in previous years, records in my Department indicate that sports capital funding from the proceeds of the National Lottery commenced in 1988 and that sports capital funding allocated for the period 1988-2006 totalled &euro;650 million. I would add, for the Deputy&rsquo;s information, that my Department has also allocated additional funding totalling &euro;519 million, not categorised as national lottery funding, towards the provision of the National Aquatic Centre and Sports Campus development at Abbotstown, the 50-metre swimming pool at the University of Limerick, the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road, the redevelopment of Croke Park for the hosting of the 2003 Special Olympics World Games and the provision, since 2000 of swimming pools throughout the country under the local authority swimming pool programme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 439 and 440 together.</P>
        <P>General details on the funding available from my Department, and the bodies operating under its aegis, under the new National Development Plan (2007-2013) are set out in a number of press releases issued on the announcement of the new NDP. These can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s <Col N="1005"/>website www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie. As can be seen from the press releases there are a number of major infrastructural projects which will be funded under the new NDP in the areas of Arts, Culture, Sports and Tourism.  These include a new National Concert Hall on the Earlsfort Terrace site,  the new Abbey Theatre, redevelopment of the Wexford Theatre Royal, major projects at the National Museum and National Library, the development of a state-of-the-art Sports Campus at Abbotstown, the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road Stadium and the National Conference Centre.  As the Deputy will appreciate the major projects being funded under the NDP are at different stages of development. Some are already being progressed including the new Abbey Theatre,  the Lansdowne Road Stadium and the National Conference Centre and will be further developed during 2007. In the case of  other projects that still have to be commenced, the objective is that at least the initial preparatory work will be advanced in 2007. It is intended that all the major projects being funded under the NDP for which my Department has responsibility will be completed within the lifetime of the Plan but it is too early at this stage to be definitive about completion dates.</P>

	<P>There were ten IDA sponsored visits by overseas investors to Navan in 2005 and one in 2006. There have been no site visits so far in 2007, although this may change as the year progresses. Ultimately it is a matter for potential investors to decide where to locate, including what areas to visit as potential locations.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is actively marketing Navan Business Park for additional investment. The targeted sectors are Financial Services, International Services, and ICT. There are six IDA supported companies already located on the Park.  To enhance the potential of Navan for new investment the Agency, in partnership with the private sector, has converted Athlumney House, and its adjoining courtyard, in Navan for use as office space.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland are appropriate in terms of maximizing additional overseas investment and jobs for the people of Navan and the county of Meath.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 448 to 451, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 the Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with overall responsibility for enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are a function of the Authority.  In accordance with its Programmes of Work for 2006 and 2007 the Authority is continuing work relating to the potential exposure of workers in hospitals to biohazards that might adversely affect their safety, health or welfare. Employers in the healthcare sector have a duty under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to ensure that workers who treat MRSA infected patients are protected by adherence to good hygiene practices, by adequate risk assessment and where appropriate isolation of infected patients, and adequate infection controls.</P>
        <P>The Health Safety Authority focuses on the existence and implementation of comprehensive infection control policies as part of the overall safety management system of workplaces where there may be a risk of workers&rsquo; exposure to biological agents. Such infection control policies must take account of all biological agents that may be present and, in particular, focus on those organisms that are of primary concern including, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (&ldquo;MRSA&rdquo;), Legionella, Hepatitis B, HIV, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (&ldquo;TB&rdquo;) and Streptococcus pyrogenes.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority is also aware that the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Corporate Safety Statement deals with the obligation to protect its workers from blood borne disease exposure and the need to provide health surveillance of workers considered to be at risk.  The Health and Safety Authority as part of this work, in 2006, requested the HSE to identify those hospitals, if any, under its control that were not in possession of a written site-specific risk assessment for exposure to biological agents at work and the associated safety management system (including prevention and control measures).</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Health and Safety Authority that any hospitals that were so identified were subject to inspection by its inspectors and, where necessary, appropriate enforcement action was taken. In relation to other hospitals that the Health Service Executive considered compliant, a sample was also subject to inspection in line with the Authority&rsquo;s policy of dealing with this prioritised area.  In 2006 the Health and Safety Auth<Col N="1009"/>ority carried out a total of 148 inspections in the Healthcare sector. As part of these inspections, 13 hospitals were targeted nation-wide, focusing on the spread of MRSA, and enforcement action was taken in 12 instances.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s overall objective in relation to the Healthcare Sector in its Programme of Work for 2007 is to improve health and safety management systems and practices in the sector. In this regard, the Authority is committed to carrying out a programme of 200 inspections focusing on worker protection in hospitals, nursing homes and psychiatric institutions, concentrating on risk assessments for work activities, maintenance and cleaning procedures, security and violence procedures, manual handling and biological agents control. In addition the Inspectors of the Authority are following up on last year&rsquo;s inspections.</P>

        <P>European Regional Development Fund (ERDF): Three measures within the Productive Sector Operational Programme were funded under the ERDF in the 2000-2006 period. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was allocated funding for the Industry RTDI measure and technical assistance.

        <P>As ERDF funding was allocated across a number of different Operational Programmes and my Department does not have overall responsibility for ERDF funds, I am not in a position to state the percentage allocations made to this Department.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume that the Deputy&rsquo;s question is intended to refer to the proposal of the company concerned to impose an additional charge on customers who pay their bills by means other than direct debit. I would have to advise the Deputy that this practice would not be in breach of consumer law. I do, however, share the concerns expressed in a number of quarters that the introduction of this charge could impact dis<Col N="1012"/>proportionately on certain groups of vulnerable consumers.</P>
        <P>In this regard I am aware that the Director of Consumer Affairs whose Office has received a considerable number of complaints in relation to this practice has had a number of discussions with the company referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question. I understand that arising from these discussions the company concerned will review the imposition of the charge on customers who are pensioners or who have special needs and that it will communicate its intentions in this regard before the introduction of the charge on 1st April 2007. I am also advised by the Director that the charge which the company concerned introduced in respect of customers who pay their bills late will only be applied following a written reminder to the customer and notification of the application of the charge should the customer&rsquo;s bill not be cleared within a specified timeframe.  The Director has advised me that her Office will continue to monitor the manner in which these charges are imposed on customers, particularly those who are vulnerable customers.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), I am providing the information requested in relation <Col N="1013"/>to the seven of the eight Irish Aid programme countries which are taking part in the EPA negotiations, namely Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Timor-Leste.</P>
        <P>These seven Irish Aid programme countries are all Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and, therefore, benefit from the European Council Regulation of 1st March 2001. That Regulation amended the EU&rsquo;s Generalised Scheme of Preferences so as to extend duty and quota free access to all products, except arms and ammunition, originating in LDCs (known as the Everything but Arms Initiative (EBA). Notwithstanding this initiative, tariffs continue to be levied for the sensitive products of rice and sugar. Rice is due to be fully liberalised by September 2009 and sugar is scheduled to be fully liberalised by July 2009.  For the moment, therefore, quotas remain in place for rice and sugar although these increase each year as the dates for full liberalisation approach. Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia did export sugar cane to the EU in 2005, but the amounts concerned were not sufficient to go over the quota and therefore attract a tariff.</P>
        <P>All of the statistical information required by the Deputy is not immediately available from the European Commission. The best available information is as follows:</P>
<P LI="1">Ethiopia: Ethiopia exported &euro; 282,841 worth of goods to the EU in 2005, which represented 0.02% of the EU&rsquo;s total imports. These goods were categorised under 18 tariff lines.</P>
       <P LI="1">Lesotho: Lesotho exported &euro;52,791 worth of goods to the EU in 2005, which represented only just over 0% of the EU&rsquo;s total imports. These goods were categorised under 3 tariff lines.</P>
        <P LI="1">Mozambique: Mozambique exported  &euro;1,004,907 worth of goods to the EU in 2005, which represented 0.09% of the EU&rsquo;s total imports. These goods were categorised under 6 tariff lines.</P>
       <P LI="1">Tanzania: Tanzania exported &euro;318,482 worth of goods to the EU in 2005, which represented 0.03% of the EU&rsquo;s total imports. These goods were categorised under 21 tariff lines.</P>
        <P LI="1">Timor-Leste: Timor-Leste exported &euro;1,490 worth of goods to the EU in 2005, which represented just over 0% of the EU&rsquo;s total imports. These goods were categorised under 10 tariff lines.</P>
      <P LI="1">Uganda: Uganda exported &euro;301,016 worth of goods to the EU in 2005, which represented 0.03% of the EU&rsquo;s total imports. These goods were categorised under 13 tariff lines.</P>
       <P LI="1">Zambia: Zambia exported &euro;185,240 worth of goods to the EU in 2005, which represented 0.02% of the EU&rsquo;s total imports. These goods were categorised under 11 tariff lines.</P><Col N="1014"/>
        <P FLI="0">The value of the revenue collected from the EU&rsquo;s trade with these countries is not immediately available from the European Commission).  With regard to new tariff lines being reduced to 0% tax under the EPAs, as mentioned above, the Irish Aid programme countries involved in the negotiations are all LDCs and therefore already benefit from the quota and duty free scheme of the Everything but Arms initiative (EBA).  In taking part in the EPA negotiations African Pacific Caribbean LDCs can build on their EBA access by exploiting the potential of being part of a larger market through the regional integration that the EPAs offer.</P>
        <P>Ireland is following the EPA negotiations closely, in particular with regard to our Irish Aid Programme Countries, and will continue to urge that the negotiations result in agreements that are supportive of ACP countries&rsquo; development needs and their poverty reduction efforts.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 455 and 456 together.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan (2007-2013) is a strategic document setting out a broad investment framework and investment priorities, together with indicative financial allocations, for the next seven years.  It does not contain a list of all projects to be undertaken in 2007 over the period of the Plan, although certain Chapters, including those on Regional Development, Economic Infrastructure and Social Infrastructure, refer to projects scheduled for delivery or progression between now and the end of 2013.</P>
        <P>In the case of my own Department the Plan includes a number of programmes, rather than projects, to be delivered by the agencies under my Department over the lifetime of the Plan. These programmes are designed to further promote enterprise development, research and development, the upskilling of the workforce and the improvement of  the employment and participation rates of groups who are experiencing barriers to access and progression in the labour market.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The case to which the Deputy refers, relates to Directive 80/987/EEC which provides for the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer. The High Court in the U.K. referred a case to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling on whether Article 8 of this Directive requires &ldquo;Member States to ensure, by whatever means necessary, that employees&rsquo; accrued rights under supplementary company or inter-company final salary pension schemes are fully funded by Member States in the event that the employees&rsquo; private employer becomes insolvent and the assets are insufficient to fund those benefits&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Article 8 of the Directive requires that &ldquo;Member States shall ensure that the necessary measures are taken to protect the interests of employees and of persons having already left the employer&rsquo;s undertaking or business at the date of the employer&rsquo;s insolvency in respect of the rights conferring upon them immediate or prospective entitlement to old-age benefits, including survivors&rsquo; benefits, under supplementary company or inter-company pension schemes outside the national statutory social security schemes.&rdquo; However, under article 4(3), the Directive elsewhere allows Member States to limit the liability of the guarantee institutions.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, Article 8 of the Directive was implemented by Section 7 of the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984. This provides that in the event of an employer&rsquo;s insolvency, any contributions deducted from any employee in the 12 months prior to insolvency and which remain unpaid, and any contributions due to be paid by the employer into the scheme in the 12 months prior to the insolvency (unless a lesser amount would discharge the liabilities) may be paid from the Social Insurance Fund into the occupational pension scheme.</P>
        <P>In addition to the measures taken to implement this Directive, existing provisions are in place under the Pensions Act 1990 to protect members&rsquo; benefits under occupational pension schemes. Part IV of the Pensions Act 1990 sets out a minimum funding standard for defined benefit pension schemes. This is a wind-up standard, based on the benefits a scheme is obliged to provide should the scheme be wound up. In addition, having sufficient assets to meet the liabilities of the scheme is now also a requirement under EU Directive 2003/41/EC, which my Department implemented in September 2005.</P><Col N="1016"/>
        <P>The issues arising from this particular case relate to two Government Departments &mdash; the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has responsibility for the Insolvency Payments Scheme and which, under the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984, administers the implementation of all of the provisions of the Directive, and my Department, which has responsibility for pension issues and the Social Insurance Fund, from which insolvency payments under the above Insolvency Payments Scheme are made.</P>
        <P>Given the similarity in pension systems it is no surprise to note that the UK implemented Article 8 of the Directive in much the same manner as Ireland. A report from the European Commission on 15 June 1995 analysing national laws transposing the Directive found that in the case of Ireland, there was no cause for objection.</P>
        <P>In the context of this case Member States were invited by the European Court to submit statements of case or written observations to the Court of Justice by the 25th October 2005. Arising from this invitation, I and my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment arranged for the Attorney General to submit observations. The observations were submitted having regard to the potential implications for Ireland of an adverse finding in this case and in order to ensure that the Irish position was fully presented.</P>
        <P>An oral hearing in this case was subsequently held on June 1st 2006 at which Ireland was represented by the Chief State Solicitors Office. Following the hearing, the Advocate General delivered her opinion on the 13th July 2006 in advance of the final ruling of the European Court of Justice.</P>
        <P>The final ruling was delivered by the European Court of Justice on the 25th January 2007 and my Department has sought the advice of the Office of the Attorney General on the ruling. When this is received discussions will then take place with the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment and the Pensions Board. It would be premature to consider any possible implications of this ruling in advance of these discussions.</P>

These recipients also qualify for Respite Care Grant. Support of carers has been a priority of Government since 1997.  Payments to carers have been greatly improved over that period and qualifying conditions for carers allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carers benefit and the respite care payment have been introduced. The further development of support for carers continues to be a priority for me and for Government as reflected in recent Budget changes.  In addition, 10,052 people who are not in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit were paid the Respite Care Grant in 2006. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 461 and 462 together.</P><Col N="1018"/>
        <P>My Department has received funding in the new National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013 under the Social Inclusion Priority of the Plan.  The funding provided is mainly for four programmes as follows:</P>
        <P>The Activation Sub-Programme, aims to promote participation and social inclusion through engaging with people of working age on social welfare payments at the initial claim stage, in order to facilitate progression to employment, training, education and other opportunities as appropriate.   It is intended to invest &euro;50 million under this Sub-Programme over the lifetime of the NDP.  The Back to Work Sub-Programme aims to encourage the long term unemployed and other social welfare customers to take up employment or self-employment opportunities by enabling them to retain a proportion of their social welfare payment over a number of years.  In addition funding is available to programmes run by third parties to assist welfare recipients and members of their families in availing of education, training and development opportunities.  Some &euro;591 million will be made available under this Sub-Programme over the lifetime of the NDP.</P>
        <P>The Back to Education Sub-Programme is designed to help people in receipt of social welfare improve their employability and job-readiness by giving them the opportunity to improve their qualifications and education.  Some &euro;519 million will be made available under this Sub-Programme over the lifetime of the NDP.</P>
        <P>The Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme is administered by the Family Support Agency.  It aims to help combat disadvantage by improving the function of the family unit.  Family Resource Centres empower disadvantaged people by involving them in decisions which affect them and enabling them to use and develop their own skills, knowledge and experience.  Funding will continue under the NDP with priority given to centres which serve those areas where communities are contending with multiple disadvantage.  Some &euro;187 million is being provided for this programme to expand the number of centres from its current 100 to 142 over the lifetime of the plan.  There are no large scale infrastructure projects included in the funding provided to my Department under the NDP.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The legal framework to regulate fast powered craft including jet skis, pro<Col N="1019"/>vided for in the Maritime Safety Act 2005 arose from the Report of the Action Group on Small Powered Recreational Craft (including personal watercraft) in 2000 which concluded that the primary public policy response to regulating such craft should be the use of local bye-laws. </P>
        <P>Conditions and issues vary in different parts of the country and it makes sense that those closest to the issues and with local knowledge should regulate for the particular circumstances.</P>
        <P>Section 6 of the Maritime Safety Act 2005, provides that bye-laws may be made regulating or controlling the operation of specified craft, including jet skis, by Local Authorities, harbour authorities and Waterways Ireland in waters under their control or management or in their functional area. The prohibition or restriction of such craft will be for the purposes of safety to persons, prevention of nuisance or injury, damage to watercraft or property and to protect national heritage areas and protected monuments.</P>
        <P>The Maritime Safety Directorate (MSD) of my Department has prepared and issued guidelines to the relevant authorities on the powers available to them to regulate craft under the 2005 Act. These guidelines assist them on issues relating to <Col N="1020"/>the design, implementation and management of bye-laws.  It is a matter for individual bye-law making authorities to assess the particular circumstances in their area and decide the appropriate response, having regard to the guidelines issued by the MSD and consulting with interested parties.</P>

	<P>It is my policy to support the development of park and ride facilities in the Greater Dublin Area, and funding is available under Transport 21 for the development of such facilities.  As I have made clear before in relation to such developments, I am open to receive proposals for funding from local authorities in the GDA. Any such proposals will be evaluated for funding according to their <Col N="1021"/>business cases and on a first-come, first-served basis.  </P>
        <P>Irish Rail, which has already conducted a feasibility study into prioritising a programme of car park extensions throughout their network of railway stations, will soon be commencing a similar study looking at further stations not covered in the original study.  As part of this new study, they will examine the feasibility of extending the number of car parking spaces at Enfield railway station by 150 extra spaces (there are currently 15 car parking spaces there).</P>
        <P>I have not been approached regarding a possible park and ride facility at Enfield by any of the other organisations referred to by the Deputy.  The development and implementation of traffic management measures in general and measures aimed at improving the priority of public transport and encouraging modal shift is a matter for the local authority and transport service providers concerned.  My role as Minister for Transport is to set the broad policy framework within which such measures can best be taken and to provide the necessary funding.</P>

        <P>As I have stated in previous replies to the House, the red zones were formally established at the State Airports in 1968.  I understand that in the late 1960&rsquo;s in the context of drafting a county development plan a scheme showing restrictions that were considered necessary for the purposes of air safety was forwarded to Clare County Council.  The subsequent incorporation of such areas into County Development Plans as well as planning policy regarding development therein was and is a matter for the relevant local authority. I understand that it is normal practice for the planning authorities to consult the public about any changes to development plans.</P>
        <P>As the schemes outlining these restrictions were an input to the planning process there was no legal requirement for the then Department of Transport and Power to carry out consultations or notifications. The Department would have relied on the public consultation requirements of the Planning system to take account of public concerns. The Department of Transport did not then, and does not now have the power to compel planning authorities to apply its recommendations in relation to red zones.</P>

	<P>The Department of Transport has made &euro;40m available in 2007 to the DTO Traffic Management Committee for deployment on traffic management projects.  Applying earlier decisions of the DTO Steering Committee, some &euro;34m or 85% of this will be available for bus priority projects, with the balance available for other traffic management projects within the region.  At the January meeting of the DTO Traffic Management Grants Committee, some &euro;681,000 was approved to extend existing bus priority measures on the north city quays as follows:- St. John&rsquo;s Road (Military Road to Steeven&rsquo;s Lane), Parkgate Street, Wolfe Tone Quay to Arran Quay (junction with Church Street).  I understand that the three schemes described above will be implemented following the completion of work on the water mains at Kilmainham Lane and Bow Lane.   </P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary purpose of bus lanes is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport. Regulations, which have national application, generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists also. Having regard to the role of taxis in providing an on-street immediate hire service, an exemption to the restriction relating to the use of with-flow bus lanes is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business. My Department is also currently considering the issue of access by motorcylists to bus lanes on the grounds of safety.</P>
        <P>Many representations have been made to my Department seeking to extend access to bus lanes in relation to a wide range of other road users including cash in transit vans.  A review of the access issue was carried in consultation with the relevant agencies that took account of the physical characteristics of the vehicles seeking access. The result of that review was to maintain the existing position with regard to access. That remains the current position.</P>

	<P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads, including the M50, is vested in the National Roads Authority (NRA) under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000).  </P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, in January of last year, the NRA decided to replace the West-Link toll on the M50 by a single-point barrier free toll in 2008.  The installation of barrier free tolling is a crucial element of the M50 upgrade which is underway at present.  In that context, the NRA have initiated a tender competition for the provision of free flow tolling services with the objective of having free flow tolling arrangements operational on the M50 by mid 2008.</P>

        <P>Transport 21 projects which, subject to compliance with the relevant statutory procedures, are also expected to be completed during the lifetime of the new National Development Plan include the five major inter-urban motorways linking Dublin with the Border, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, Metro North, Western Rail Corridor (Phase 2) (Athenry to Tuam), Navan Rail Line (Phase 1), the Citywest and Liffey Junction extensions of the Luas and the Lucan Luas Line.</P>
        <P>A number of other significant national road schemes will also be completed within the lifetime of the new NDP but formal construction and completion dates have yet to be finalized by the National Roads Authority which is responsible, under the Roads Act, 1993, for the implementation of the National Roads Programme element <Col N="1028"/>of the new National Development Plan.  In particular there will be substantial progress on the development of the Atlantic Road Corridor, facilitated by the decision announced in the NDP to bring forward funding for that corridor.  Projects to benefit from this include the N18 Oranmore to Gort and Gort to Crusheen Bypass.</P>
        <P>Substantial progress will also be made on other projects in the NDP period, which are scheduled for completion within the Transport 21 timeframe.

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>At my request, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) and the National Drug Strategy Team (NDST) recently prepared a joint briefing paper on cocaine, based on existing data in Ireland.  The paper, which is due to be published in early March, concluded that all data sources indicated an upward trend in cocaine use.  A number of recommendations are made in the paper, principally in regard to treatment, but also covering supply, prevention and research.  </P>
        <P>The paper and its recommendations were discussed at the Inter-departmental Group (IDG) Meeting on Drugs in December last and will be further discussed at the next IDG Meeting in March.  A key conclusion of the report is that treatment, primarily in the form of counselling, can and does work and, in this context, the provision of some cocaine specific clinics in areas where cocaine problems are more acute will be considered.  However, in the broader context, I am of the view that we should work towards having drug services that can cater for the individual problem drug user, regardless of the drugs they use.</P>
        <P>Another key recommendation relates to the training of frontline personnel to deal with cocaine issues.  I have already funded a training initiative in this regard, as well as four pilot cocaine treatment projects to examine different methods of treatment for cocaine use. The outcomes of those projects which have been completed are being examined at present to see to what extent they can inform the way forward.  Furthermore, the NDST along with the Drug Task Forces, will continue to review the needs in communities.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, the Deputy should note that work on the second all-island Drugs Prevalence Survey is in progress and it is expected that a first report of national prevalence figures and trends will be available in the latter part of this year.  This will give much greater clarity on the overall prevalence of cocaine.</P>
        <P>With regard to funding, any additional allocations for cocaine specific initiatives will be considered in the context of the overall provision for drug-related services when the Revised Estimates Volume is published in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The challenges posed by cocaine use are significant but I am confident that we can meet these challenges through a co-ordinated approach utilising the structures of the National Drugs Strategy.</P>

This application has been processed and is eligible for consolidation. However, only 27.35 hectares of the total shortfall of 41.71 hectares can be accounted for as the land farmed during the reference period is now no longer available due to an expired rental agreement. A letter issued to the person named on 8 February, 2007 explaining the position and requesting him to confirm whether or not he wishes to proceed with his consolidation application.</P>
        <P>This confirmation is necessary because if the consolidation application is accepted, 14.36 of consolidated entitlements in respect of the shortfall in the number of hectares declared on the 2006 Single Payment application will immediately revert permanently to the National Reserve.

        <P>The closing date for receipt of applications under the 2006 Single Payment Scheme was originally Monday April 24th 2006. This date was subsequently extended to Monday May 15th 2006. The initial deadline was clearly highlighted in the SPS application packs, including an application form with pre printed information entered by applicants on their 2005 SPS application, sent to all farmers with SPS entitlements towards the end of March 2006. Both the initial and revised deadlines were widely publicised by advertising in the Local and National media.</P>
        <P>The relevant EU Regulations provide for a 25-day period, after May 15th 2006, in which late applications could be accepted. However, a 1% penalty per working day (not calendar day) is imposed on late applications received during this period. The closing date for this period was Friday June 9th 2006. Applications submitted after this period had ended i.e. after June 9th 2006, are subject to a total 100% loss of payments.  Accordingly, my Department could not accept an application from the person named on or after 28th November 2006 without the provision of adequate evidence that there were exceptional circumstances/force majeure for not submitting the application within the deadline.</P>
        <P>The person named lodged an appeal with my Department but the required evidence was deemed not to have been provided. It was confirmed in writing to the person named that a late application could not be accepted, and that a further appeal could be made to the Agricultural Appeals Office.

        <P>The Single Payment Scheme is applicable to farmers who actively farmed during all or any of the three reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002, who were paid Livestock Premia and/or Arable <Col N="1039"/>Aid payments in one or more of those years and who continued to farm in 2005.</P>
        <P>The late mother of the person named did not actively farm during the reference period 2000-2002 and, therefore she could not be considered under the Force Majeure measure of the Single Payment Scheme.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Ombudsman has also examined this case and has agreed with the findings of my Department.  The person named has now exhausted all review mechanisms within my Department in relation to the decision on the Force Majeure application.  In addition, the person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Categories A and D.</P>
        <P>Category A caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May, 2005 and who had leased out his/her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000 to 2002.</P>
        <P>Category D caters for farmers who inherited or purchased land and who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.</P>
        <P>The person named was deemed unsuccessful under both categories as he did not declare any lands for which he applied to the National Reserve on his 2005 Single Payment Scheme application.  The person named submitted an appeal against this decision.  This appeal was forwarded to the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee who have completed their review and they have upheld my Department&rsquo;s decision.  A letter outlining the decision of the Committee has issued to the person named.</P>

	<P>If the Deputy is referring to funds allocated for early childhood education under DEIS- the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, the amount allocated includes provision for support for the Early Start Programme, the Rutland Street project and Traveller pre-schools.  The DEIS action plan aims to concentrate early education actions on those children, aged from three up to school enrolment, who will subsequently attend urban/town primary schools participating in the School Support Programme and serving the most disadvantaged communities.  An analysis of feeder pre-schools for Band 1 DEIS schools showed that there was a significant number of infants attending Primary schools who had previously attended pre-schools; of these feeder preschools some had been funded under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP).</P>
        <P>The National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 is the successor to the EOCP Programme and will incorporate a number of key objectives.  These are to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Increase the supply and improve the quality of early childhood care and education services, part-time and full day care, school age childcare and childminding,</P><Col N="1043"/>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Support families to break the cycle of poverty and disadvantage,</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Support a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of childcare, which is centred, on the needs of the child.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The provision of childcare places  has been devolved to City and County Childcare Committees which have been established in 33 counties or cities to develop and implement co-ordinated strategic plans for childcare provision within their local area.   The following services are eligible for support &mdash; those providing care for babies, full day care, part time places, pre-school places, school age childcare including &ldquo;wrap around&rdquo; childcare places and childminding.   Expression of interest forms should be completed and sent to the relevant County/City Childcare Committee.</P>
        <P>In regard to educational inclusion, my Department is currently carrying out an audit of pre-school provision in the Band 1 DEIS schools to determine how further investment would add value to existing provision.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 509 and 572 together.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputies that I am most anxious that the autism unit at the school in question becomes operational without further delay.  It is difficult, however, to progress matters without the full co-operation of the school authorities.</P>
        <P>These classes are typically established with an initial staff of one teacher and two special needs assistants for every six pupils. Additional SNA <Col N="1044"/>support may be provided on the basis of the assessed needs of individual pupils.  One of the issues delaying opening these classes is that the school is seeking a level of staffing in excess of that normally sanctioned.</P>
        <P>I have requested that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) formally submit to my Department an up to date report on the situation concerning the school in question with recommendations on how to proceed. It is expected that this report will be received in my Department shortly.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism receive an education appropriate to their needs, preferably through the primary and post primary school network. In this regard my Department has established:</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />181 special classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools, 17 of which are in the Kildare area.</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />5 special classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome.</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />16 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />14 Stand Alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology on a pilot basis, 1 of these facilities is based in the Kildare area; 2 of these facilities have yet to be established.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As the Deputies are aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is now operational. A specific function of the NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is to identify appropriate educational placement for all children with special educational needs. The SENO is a focal point of contact for parents and schools. It is open to the parent to contact the SENO directly regarding the child&rsquo;s needs. Alternatively, these details may be accessed on the NCSE website at www.ncse.ie.</P>
        <P>With regard to the request for information in respect of the number of children who are awaiting placement in the unit, I can confirm that this is a matter for the schools authorities and my Department does not retain waiting lists of children to be enrolled.  Consequently, the information sought regarding the number of children in receipt of home tuition on an interim basis while awaiting placement in the unit and the cost of same is not readily available in my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
        <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
        <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.</P>
        <P>But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on <Col N="1046"/>measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

	<P>My Department estimates that there are in the region of 28,000 students in our schools whose first language is not English or Irish. In order to meet their language needs, additional support is given to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of posts.</P>
        <P>The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled.</P>
        <P>The additional language support to an individual pupil is generally given for a period of two years.</P>
        <P>Schools with between 3 and 13 eligible pupils receive grant assistance towards the cost of employing part-time teachers. Schools with 3 to 8 such pupils receive a grant of over &euro;6,300, while schools with between 10 and 13 such pupils receive over &euro;9,500. Over &euro;4 million is being provided for such grants in 2007.</P>
        <P>Schools with 14 or more such pupils are entitled to one or more language support teachers, the number of which has increased dramatically in recent years. There are now approximately 1,250 language support teachers in our schools. More than 400 of these teachers have been allocated in the current school year alone. As I announced last November, 200 extra posts were approved by the Government for 2007, bringing to 1,450 the number of language teachers that will be working in our schools this year. This compares with just 262 posts in the 2001/02 school year.</P>
        <P>In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitments under the &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo; partnership agreement, a further 350 language support teachers will be provided between 2008 and 2009.</P>
        <P>In allocating additional teachers, I will be addressing in particular the position of those schools catering for significant numbers of such children.</P>
        <P>Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive strategy is currently being finalised which will ensure that the extra investment in this area is being used to the best effect, and that it is underpinned by the right support and training for teachers.</P>

        <P>Two proposals were submitted to my Department with a view to drawing down part of this funding to facilitate community use of five of the halls, one of which was a proposal from County Dublin VEC that it will manage and operate three of the halls attached to schools in the South County Dublin area, including the school referred to by the Deputy, on behalf of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>Government agreement was given on Tuesday 23rd January to the drawdown of Dormant Accounts funding for both of these proposals amounting to &euro;1.75 million or &euro;350,000 per sports hall.</P>
     
        <P>My Department has informed County Dublin VEC of this decision and given approval for appropriate staffing of the halls to facilitate their use by the community.</P>

	<P>Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The census for the current school year (2006/2007) is currently being worked on.</P>
        <P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
        <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than <Col N="1048"/>ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
        <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.</P>
        <P>But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

	<P>The compulsory school starting age in a National School is 6 years of age.</P>
        <P>Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools, including decisions on criteria for enrolment and details of waiting lists for entry to primary schools. My Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</P>
        <P>Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to my Department. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, my Department may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of. The existence of an appeals procedure serves to ensure that schools abide by their enrolment policies.</P>
        <P>Details on appealing decisions on enrolment under section 29 of the Education Act are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to waiting lists is not available in my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is committed to ensuring that all children get the necessary support that they need to do well at school. In order to ensure that children whose first language is not English can fully participate at school, my Department is providing extensive training in teaching English as a foreign language for primary teachers specifically assigned to teach children whose first language is not English.</P>
        <P>Integrate Ireland Language and Training (IILT), a campus company of Trinity College Dublin, is funded by my Department to provide training and resource materials to assist schools in meeting the needs of pupils for whom English is a second language. A wide range of teaching resources has been developed by IILT which are available on their website at www.iilt.ie or directly from IILT.</P>
        <P>Since September 2005, 15 teachers from the Dublin South East region have attended the IILT in-service seminars. 4 of these teachers attended the most recent seminars, which were held in December 2006.    Recent years have seen a significant rise in the number of language support posts being provided by my Department. In the current school year, 879 whole-time equivalent language support teachers are in place at primary level. This compares with 562 in place at primary level in the previous school year and 149 language support teachers in the school year 2001/02. Thus, there has been over a five-fold increase in language support teachers at primary level in just 5 years.</P>
        <P>The 2007 Estimates provided for 200 extra language support teachers. The new posts will mainly be for primary schools and will go to the schools with the highest number of foreign national children and are part of the 550 extra language teachers promised under the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.</P><Col N="1051"/>
        <P>So the Government is increasing resources in this area in line with rising demand. However, it is still a relatively new area which is rapidly expanding and as such must be kept under review to ensure that children are getting the support that they need and that this support is proving effective in helping them to make the most of their time at school.</P>

	<P>The National Educational Psychological Service of my Department provides psychological services to schools and does not exert any control over clinical services. Psychologists often work in close collaboration with clinical agencies in regard to children with the conditions cited by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>However, the provision of clinical services is a matter for the HSE.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psycho<Col N="1052"/>logical Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that the number of psychologists in the Department has increased from 43 since the establishment of NEPS in 1999 to a current figure of 127, including 4 psychologists assigned to the National Behavioural Support Service. There are also a further 16 Whole-time-equivalent educational psychologists providing service through the Dublin City and County VECs. Taken together, there are currently 143 educational psychologists working in services paid for by my Department.</P>
        <P>I announced recently in this connection my intention to expand the number of NEPS psychologists by a further 31 in 2007. This will represent a significant increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS and bring the total number of psychologists in the system to 174.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in line with the Government&rsquo;s  &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo; commitments, the number of NEPS psychologists will be increased even further in each of 2008 and 2009, to a total of 193. At this point, including the 16 psychologists in the Dublin VEC areas, it is expected that the number of educational psychologists in the system as a whole will be 209.</P>

	<P>My Department provides a wide range of supports and additional resources to support children who have been assessed as having special educational needs, including autism. These services are determined by the type of special educational need but include additional teaching support where a child is fully integrated into a mainstream school, reduced pupil-teacher-ratios where the child is in a special class attached to a mainstream school or a special school; special needs assistant support for a child who has care needs; assistive technology where this is recommended; specialist equipment such as modified desks and chairs as required; and specially adapted school buildings where necessary. In addition enhanced levels of capitation are available to special schools and mainstream schools with special classes.</P>
        <P>My Department is of the view that children with autism, in common with all children should have access to appropriate provision delivered by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where children can mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration. The preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools, a view that is supported by the findings of the Task Force Report on Autism. My Department&rsquo;s ongoing commitment is to ensuring that all children, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders, receive an education appropriate to their needs.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is now operational. A specific function of the NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is to identify appropriate educational placement for all children with special educational needs. The SENO is a focal point of contact for parents and schools. It is open to the parent to contact the SENO directly regarding the child&rsquo;s needs. Contact details for the SENO may be sourced from the NCSE at (046) 9486400. Alternatively, these details may be accessed on the NCSE website at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Officials in my Department will arrange to have the information regarding the number of classes on the northside of Dublin City and in Fingal County sent directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The vast majority of support for childcare, including pre-school education, is not provided by my Department, but rather by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP).</P>
        <P>This Government has provided unprecedented levels of funding for childcare in recent years. &euro;499.3 million was allocated to the EOCP 2000-2006 and some 41,000 places will have been created by the time the programme finishes.</P>
        <P>Going forward, childcare provision will continue to attract substantial investment under the new National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010.  &euro;575m has been allocated to the new programme, which will be administered by the Office of the Minister for Children and aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality childcare services by supporting the creation of an additional 50,000 places. 20% of these places will be for pre-school children.</P><Col N="1059"/>
        <P>In relation to my Department&rsquo;s involvement in pre-school education in County Clare, this is limited to one pre-school for Traveller children in which there are currently 20 children enrolled and funding for four pre-school children diagnosed with autism under the home tuition scheme.

	<P>Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The census for the current school year (2006/2007) is currently being worked on.</P>
        <P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.  Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
        <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.  All primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.  The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.  We will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

        <Quest> the circumstances in which her Department has recently initiated a review of the equivalence relationship between the leaving certificate and the European Baccalaureate for the purposes of matriculation and entry to universities here, notwithstanding the acceptance of that qualification immediately subsequent to Ireland&rsquo;s <Col N="1064"/>accession to the European Economic Community and its successor organisation the European Union; the status of that review; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the European Schools is a group of thirteen co-educational schools established at various locations in the EU to serve the needs of children whose parents are officials of the EU Commission, European Parliament and other official European organisations.  The schools have been established by an intergovernmental treaty &mdash; the Convention of the European Schools &mdash; to which Ireland is a signatory.  In accordance with this Convention, Irish universities recognise the European Baccalaureate for the purposes of admission to their courses and programmes.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that issues have been raised with my Department, by the parents of students attending the European Schools, regarding the equivalence of the European Baccalaureate qualification with the Leaving Certificate for the purposes of entry to university courses in Ireland.  Issues in relation to admission to university and the evaluation of the qualifications of prospective students are matters that are determined by the universities, not by my Department.  In accordance with this, the issues raised in the correspondence from the parents have been referred to the Irish Universities Association (IUA).  The IUA is the representative body of the Heads of the seven Irish universities and is the appropriate authority to respond to the issues as they relate to the collective policies of the Irish university sector regarding admission requirements.</P>
        <P>My officials wrote to the IUA asking that the matter be reviewed in full and have also met with the IUA on a number of occasions. My Department has also liaised with the Bureau of the European Schools in Brussels so that any relevant material regarding the European Baccalaureate examination and certification required by the IUA, for the purposes of the review, could be provided.</P>
        <P>A table was received from the IUA on Monday, 12 February 2007 which presents their initial conclusion that it is difficult to argue that holders of the European Baccalaureate are not given equitable treatment regarding entry to Irish universities.  The table of comparison between the European Baccalaureate and Irish Leaving Certificate results provided by the IUA is set out below.  The IUA has advised my officials that a fuller report will be made available on the matter in due course.</P>
        <P>Comparison of available data between European Baccalaureat and Irish Leaving Certificate results during the period 2003-2005 shows that a greater overall proportion of EB students achieve grades of 90% or above than LC students (A1 <Col N="1065"/>and A2 grades), and significantly greater proportions of EB students achieve grades of 75% or above.  Furthermore, given the additional weighting of 6.25% applied by the NUI universit<Col N="1066"/>ies and DCU to all EB scores of 90% and above, it is difficult to argue that EB holders are not being given equitable treatment regarding entry to Irish universities.</P><Col N="1065"/>

        <Quest> the average class sizes in both primary and post-primary schools in County Wexford; if she is satisfied with these current class sizes; the measures she will take to address class sizes; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[4853/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools.  The census for the current school year, 2006-2007, is currently being worked on.  The average class size at post-primary level is not readily available in my Department.</P>
        <P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  At the beginning of the current school year there are no less <Col N="1070"/>than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.  Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>All primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment).  In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the cur<Col N="1071"/>rent school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>On the post-primary side allocations are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment.  In general a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established Junior Certificate, Leaving Certificate, repeat Leaving Certificate and Transition Year Programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Post Leaving Certificate courses and Leaving Certificate Applied.</P>
        <P>Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils&rsquo; needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation.  Significant improvements have been made in the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years.  The ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996/97 school year to 13.2:1 in the 2005/06  school year.  The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.</P>
        <P>But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers.  About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.  I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

        <Quest> the number of schools in County Wexford without access to the services provided by the National Educational Psychological Service; the plans in place to provide this service where it is not currently available; the way many schools avail of the service; if they have unlimited access to the service; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[4854/07]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychol<Col N="1072"/>ogists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</P>
        <P>Under the NEPS service it is the usual practice for the Psychologist and the Principal to meet at the beginning of each year to discuss and agree the NEPS service for that year.  Currently, in respect of County Wexford the NEPS service is now available to some 55 of 85 primary schools (representing approximately 65% of pupils) and 18 of 20 post-primary schools (representing approximately 93% of students).</P>
        <P>The number of psychologists in the Department has increased from 43 since the establishment of NEPS in 1999 to a current figure of 127, including 4 psychologists assigned to the National Behavioural Support Service.  There are also a further 16 Whole-time-equivalent educational psychologists providing service through the Dublin City and County VECs.  Taken together, there are currently 143 educational psychologists working in services paid for by my Department.</P>
        <P>I announced recently in this connection my intention to expand the number of NEPS psychologists by a further 31 in 2007.  This will represent a significant increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS and bring the total number of psychologists in the system to 174.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in line with the Government&rsquo;s Towards 2016 commitments, the number of NEPS psychologists will be increased even further in each of 2008 and 2009, to a total of 193.  At this point, including the 16 psychologists in the Dublin VEC areas, it is expected that the number of educational psychologists in the system as a whole will be 209.</P>

	<P>Bus &Eacute;ireann operates the school transport service on behalf of my Department.  Over 134,000 children are carried each day on school transport to primary and post-primary schools.  It is a major logistical <Col N="1073"/>operation which involves the planning of bus routes in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, eligible pupils have a reasonable level of service while, at the same time, ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in an efficient and effective manner.</P>
        <P>In general, at primary school level, school transport services are organised to ensure the maximum travel and waiting time does not exceed 1.5 hours.  Bus &Eacute;ireann place special emphasis on safety and, to this end, have a wide range of checking procedures in place to ensure that a safe and reliable service is provided.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 558 and 559 together.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements are being made in regard to the provision of suitable high-quality textbooks and teaching materials specifically for use in Gaeltacht and other all-Irish schools through the work of An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta.  In 2006, my Department allocated &euro;831,000 to An Chomhairle of which &euro;400,000 was specifically designated to the provision of textbooks and other resources to support teaching and learning.</P>
        <P>A newly developed resource to cover all aspects of the revised Junior Certificate Science syllabus has recently been made available to students.  This was developed by practising teachers who worked in collaboration with An Chomhairle and with funding from my Department.  An accompanying teacher resource with a <Col N="1076"/>CD is also available.  The website <i>www.ingeniousireland.ie</i> covers many aspects of the Junior Certificate science syllabus and it is available in Irish.  Again, An Chomhairle was a main player in developing this, with funding from my Department.</P>
        <P>For the senior cycle sciences, An G&uacute;m is currently developing resources for Leaving Certificate biology, physics and chemistry.  I have met with An Chomhairle to discuss how the provision of high quality education through the medium of Irish can be further supported.</P>

	<P>My Department estimates that there are in the region of 28,000 students in our schools whose first language is not English or Irish.  In order to meet their language needs, additional support is given to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of posts.</P>
        <P>The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled.  The additional language support to an individual pupil is generally given for a period of two years.  The school referred to by the Deputy has been allocated three language support posts in the current year.</P>
        <P>Schools with between 3 and 13 eligible pupils receive grant assistance towards the cost of employing part-time teachers.  Schools with 3 to 8 such pupils receive a grant of over &euro;6,300, while schools with between 10 and 13 such pupils receive over &euro;9,500.  Over &euro;4 million is being provided for such grants in 2007.</P>
        <P>Schools with 14 or more such pupils are entitled to one or more language support teachers, the number of which has increased dramatically in recent years.  There are now approximately 1,250 language support teachers in our schools.  More than 400 of these teachers have been allocated in the current school year alone.</P>
        <P>As I announced last November, 200 extra posts were approved by the Government for 2007, bringing to 1,450 the number of language teachers that will be working in our schools this year.  This compares with just 262 posts in the 2001/02 school year.  In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitments <Col N="1077"/>under the Towards 2016 partnership agreement, a further 350 language support teachers will be provided between 2008 and 2009.  In allocating additional teachers, I will be addressing in particular the position of those schools catering for significant numbers of such children.</P>
        <P>Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive strategy is currently being finalised which will ensure that the extra investment in this area is being used to the best effect, and that it is underpinned by the right support and training for teachers.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 561 and 562 together.</P>
        <P>On 17 January last my Department invited applications under the Dormant Accounts (Educational Disadvantage) and RAPID Leverage Fund &mdash; Small Scale Capital Grant Scheme for Schools. A total of &euro;18 million has been made available to my Department from the Dormant Accounts Fund and the RAPID Leverage Fund to fund projects under the scheme that aim to counteract educational disadvantage.  The scheme will provide capital grants for both the enhancement of existing and the provision of new outdoor play areas, school libraries, dining areas and parent rooms. Eligible schools include schools participating in my Department&rsquo;s DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) Programme, schools in or serving RAPID areas and Special Schools.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the Dining Areas measure of the scheme, the measure primarily provides for the enhancement of school dining areas via either the upgrading of existing facilities or the development of new dining areas. The measure also provides for small grants of up to &euro;5,000 for eligible school participating or proposing to participate in the Department of Social and Family Affairs&rsquo; School Meals Schemes. Eligible activities under this sub-measure are restricted to the provision of certain items of catering equipment such as fridges and other ambient storage units, work surfaces, cutlery and delph.</P><Col N="1078"/>
        <P>An indicative amount of &euro;6 million will be made available to fund the Dining Area measure. In the event that the measure is oversubscribed by projects that meet the qualifying criteria these projects will be ranked having regard to the strength of their application, the Department&rsquo;s desire to maximise the use of the RAPID Leverage funding and the level of relative disadvantage pertaining to each school.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 570 and 589 together.</P>
        <P>This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their full potential and participate fully in education.</P>
        <P>Steps designed to improve school attendance include the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board in 2002, under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, with a remit to monitor school attendance, help parents to get a school place for their child and run promotional campaigns on the importance of attendance and finishing school. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2007 include a provision of &euro;9.8 million for the National Educational Welfare Board. This represents an increase of 20% on the 2006 allocation and of 50% on the 2004 level. This substantial increase in funding is a clear indication of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk. The increase in funding for the Board will allow it to expand its services further and increase staffing.</P>
        <P>The Board operates through 5 regional teams, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. A service is provided from 26 locations nationwide. Staff are deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. In addition, the Board follows up on urgent cases <Col N="1082"/>nationally where children are not currently receiving an education. Educational Welfare Officers monitor school attendance and work to improve it. They also help parents that are experiencing a difficulty with getting a school place for their child.</P>
        <P>In keeping with the government commitment under the terms of the partnership agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;, my Department will be increasing the authorised staffing complement of the Board in 2007.</P>
        <P>Under the 1st Phase of the agreement, an additional 15 staff will be allocated to the NEWB this year.  Since January 2004, 20,000 cases involving students with reported school attendance difficulties have been dealt with by the Board. The NEWB has also written to every family with children of school going age advising them of their rights and responsibilities in relation to education and school attendance and where they can get help.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, one of the functions of the Board is to conduct and commission research into the reasons for non-attendance on the part of students and into the strategies and programmes designed to prevent it. Ongoing activities of the Board include the development of a Code of Behaviour and Attendance Strategies for Schools. One research project currently underway will inform guidelines for schools on developing strategies on attendance and these will include the issue of truancy.</P>
        <P>The first national data on school attendance has also been collected and is being used to inform the Board&rsquo;s work. In relation to the effectiveness of the service, it is encouraging to note research findings that attendance at school in the areas where EWOs are working intensively improved in 2004/05 compared with the previous year.</P>
        <P>So, while the NEWB was set up just three years ago, a lot has already been achieved by the service and the Government is committed to strengthening its role even further.</P>
        <P>It should, however, be remembered that the Board is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to improve school attendance and encourage more young people to finish school. In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and services such as breakfast clubs and homework clubs.</P>
        <P>Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central to DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, which is being implemented at present in 873 schools comprising 670 primary schools (338 urban/town schools and <Col N="1083"/>332 rural schools) and 203 second-level schools. A key objective of this action plan is to enhance integration and partnership working, both within the education sector itself and between all other relevant Government departments, agencies, organisations and groups. Under DEIS, my Department, through the network of ten regional offices is enhancing its capacity to work in partnership with locally based agencies and individuals promoting social inclusion measures.</P>
        <P>Measures under DEIS range from pre-school interventions, supports for tackling children&rsquo;s literacy problems, reduced pupil teacher ratios, increased capitation grants, measures to tackle attendance and early school leaving and strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community.</P>
        <P>A key component of my Department&rsquo;s strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving is the School Completion Programme. This programme was implemented to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and in line with current thinking favours an integrated cross-community and cross-sectoral approach based on the development of local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people aged 4-18, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.</P>
        <P>In early 2006, I announced an implementation strategy following publication of &ldquo;School Matters&rdquo; the Report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools, and that strategy is now well advanced.</P>
        <P>At the core of the recommendations of the Task Force was the putting in place of a National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS). This has now happened with the appointment of a National Co-ordinator and four Assistant National Co-ordinators. In addition, nine Regional Development Officers and twenty part-time Associates have been recruited to ensure the success of this significant initiative. A key feature of the composition of the National Behaviour Support Service is the assignment to it of a senior psychologist and three psychologists. These have been seconded from the National Educational Psychological Service and their presence will ensure that the team operates in a multi-disciplinary way.</P>
        <P>Since their appointment, the team has been working on a number of key issues:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. The development of a Draft National Framework for Behaviour Improvement.</P>
       <P LI="1">2. The development of models of good practice for systems in schools which assist with and <Col N="1084"/>impact on classroom and whole school behaviour.</P>
       <P LI="1">3. On-going training for the NBSS team.</P>
      <P LI="1">4. Research into and communication with behaviour support systems in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently some 490 staff within the education sector with a role in school attendance. Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, in working with parents, promote school attendance and its importance for success in school. School attendance is a central objective of School Completion Programme with attendance tracking a core feature and one of its preventative strategies. Access to these services is being increased under DEIS. My Department is anxious to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from these substantial personnel resources. Consequently work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration and to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed including NEWB resources.</P>
        <P>In relation to the deputy&rsquo;s specific question regarding the number of service delivery staff deployed on a county basis, I wish to stress that the NEWB, is an independent statutory agency established  under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 and the deployment of staff is an operational matter for the Board to determine.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. </P>
        <P>At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.</P>
        <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
        <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to <Col N="1085"/>providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.</P>
        <P>On the Post Primary side allocations are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment.  In general a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established Junior Certificate, Leaving Certificate, repeat Leaving Certificate and Transition Year Programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Post Leaving Certificate courses and Leaving Certificate Applied.</P>
        <P>Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils&rsquo; needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation. Significant improvements have been made in the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996/97 school year to 13.2:1 in the 2005/06 school year.</P>
        <P>The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on <Col N="1086"/>measures to improve the quality of education in our schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</P>

	<P>The White Paper on Adult Education &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo; (2000) stated that asylum seekers would be entitled to free access to Adult Literacy, English language and mother culture supports and refugees are entitled to the same access to education and training as Irish nationals.</P>
        <P>My Department gives an annual grant to all Vocational Education Committees for the provision of Adult Literacy and Community Education. This fund may be used for the teaching of English to immigrants.  The cost of the literacy service delivered by VECs was over &euro;23 million in 2006.  The number of students was over 35,000. 27% of these, amounting to 10,000 clients, attended English for Speakers as Other Language (ESOL) courses.</P>
        <P>The language needs of migrants formed part of the negotiations between social partners in drawing up the new social partnership agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;.  A prioritised action included in the agreement is that the annual student cohort availing of the general national literacy service delivered by the Vocational Education Committees will be significantly increased by the provision of an extra 7,000 places by 2009, 3,000 of which will be provided this year.  There will be a particular focus on the increasing number of migrants receiving an English language service (ESOL) under the terms of the agreement.</P>
        <P>Co. Wexford VEC sought funding of &euro;1.273m from my Department to provide a dedicated <Col N="1090"/>ESOL programme over the years 2006-2010.  This was on a larger scale than normal and would have involved the employment of a number of new personnel and other significant costs.

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational <Col N="1092"/>inclusion provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  The new plan is the outcome of the first full review of all programmes for tackling educational disadvantage that have been put in place over the past twenty years.</P>
        <P>The new action plan represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multi-faceted and more integrated approach.  This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for 3-18 year olds in this country.</P>
        <P>The key principle of early intervention underpins the early childhood education measure, the literacy and numeracy measures and those for tackling early school leaving being adopted under the action plan.</P>
        <P>Also central to the success of the action plan will be an increased emphasis on planning at school and school cluster level, target-setting and measurement of progress and outcomes to ensure that the increased investment is matched by an improvement in educational outcomes for the children and young people concerned.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification and review processes, 873 schools have been invited to participate in the new Programme.  These comprise 670 primary schools (338 urban/town schools and 332 rural schools) and 203 second-level schools.</P>
        <P>In respect of the 2006/07 school year, grants amounting to approximately &euro;7.7 million due to the 670 Primary schools which are participating in the DEIS Initiative were lodged to their schools&rsquo; bank accounts on 17 November 2006.  This is in addition to payments totalling &euro;1 million which issued to those schools in June 2006.</P>
        <P>In the order of &euro;4.7 million was paid in the course of the 2006/2007 school year in respect of the 203 Post Primary schools participating in the initiative and 80 Post Primary Schools receiving grants under pre-existing schemes.  Also on 17 November 2006, approximately another 1,900 primary schools received some &euro;4.1 million of grant assistance to assist them with their respective levels of dispersed disadvantage.</P>
        <P>In addition to supplementary financial assistance which is provided to schools in DEIS, the following measures have been rolled out under the action plan in the current school year 2006/07.  Urban/town primary schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage were targeted to benefit from maximum class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes.  Administrative principals were allocated on lower enrolment and staffing figures than apply in primary schools generally to all urban primary schools.  The Reading Recovery Programme has been extended to schools in Cork, Limerick and Galway.  Rollout <Col N="1093"/>is underway of Home/School/Community Liaison (HSCL) and School Completion Programme services for urban primary and second level schools not already in receipt of these services.  Additional funding has been provided under the School Books Grant Scheme to support schools with the establishment, development and ongoing operation of book loan/rental schemes. Access to the Department of Social and Family Affairs&rsquo; School Meals Programme is being extended for all schools not already benefiting from the programme.</P>
        <P>Planning and preparatory work are also underway in the following key areas: targeted early childhood education provision for urban primary school communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage; school planning, target-setting and ongoing review processes, including the putting in place of templates for the development of three-year action plans at school level; establishing the new sabbatical leave scheme and enhanced professional development for principals and teachers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 591 and 592 together.</P>
        <P>The National Development Plan (2007-2013) is a strategic document setting out a broad investment framework and investment priorities, together with indicative financial allocations, for the next seven years.  It does not contain a list of all projects to be undertaken in 2007 and/or over the period of the Plan, although certain Chapters, including those on Regional Development, Economic Infrastructure and Social Infrastructure, refer to projects scheduled for delivery or progression between now and the end of 2013.</P>
        <P>Under the life time of the National Development Plan almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in school buildings.  This is made up of almost &euro;4 billion of direct Exchequer voted capital together with &euro;540m for projects being delivered through the public private partnership process. In addition, a sum of &euro;70 million is being made <Col N="1094"/>available for investment in ICT in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment in the schools sector which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post primary schools.</P>
        <P>Initially, the main focus will be on the provision of the required extra 100,000 pupil places in primary schools.  The first roll-out of these places will be in 2007 with over &euro;300m being invested in large-scale school building projects concentrated mainly in the provision of school accommodation in rapidly developing areas.  This level of funding will facilitate construction work on over 150 large-scale projects which will deliver over 15,000 additional permanent places in new schools and the extension and modernisation of facilities in existing schools for over 45,000 pupils.  These projects are expected to be completed during 2007 and 2008.</P>
        <P>The NDP investment will also allow other high priority projects to move through the design process and ultimately on to tender and construction.  It will enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme again, with the focus being on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.  The balance will be used to fund the other elements of the school building programme such the Summer Works Scheme, the Small Schools Scheme and the Permanent Accommodation Scheme etc. In total, over 1,500 projects will be delivered in 2007.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the policy and objective of the Department of Defence to ensure the safety of air traffic, present and future, en route to and from Casement Aerodrome.  The current safety policy, a copy of which was forwarded to South Dublin County Council in 2000, reflects best international practice in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organisation standards and recommendations and provides for military training in the area.  The achievement of this policy and objective necessitates, inter alia, restrictions on building developments in the environs of the Aerodrome.</P>
        <P>As I indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 139, 140, 141 and 142 on 15 June, 2004, red safety areas are essentially two-dimensional surfaces on the ground originating 60 metres beyond the runway thresholds, have a width of 300 metres and diverge at a rate of 15% at each side to a width of 700 metres and have an overall length of 1370 metres long in the case of each runway.  The Department&rsquo;s policy approach is that no new developments should be allowed within red safety areas.  However, extensions to existing domestic dwellings are acceptable in certain circumstances.  The runway approach surfaces are three dimensional areas which extend outwards from the same start point as the red safety areas.  Their bases rise above the ground at a rate of 1:50 for the first 3,000 metres and then at a rate of 1:40 for 3,600 metres to a maximum height of 150 metres above the start point to a total distance of 15,000 metres from the start point.  The Department&rsquo;s policy approach is that height restrictions are applicable to all developments under the runway approach surfaces beyond the red safety areas by reference to the datum level of the Aerodrome which is fixed at 86.6 metres Ordnance Datum.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for planning and development in the vicinity of Casement Aerodrome rests with the Planning Department of South Dublin County Council.  The practice down the years has been for the Local Planning Authority to consult the Department of Defence in respect of planning applications for proposed developments which may affect Casement Aerodrome.  Such consultations have taken place and continue to take place on a regular basis.</P>

	<P>The European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006, which I signed into law on 19 December 2006, provide for the introduction of <Col N="1098"/>Building Energy Rating on a phased basis, as follows:new dwellings, with effect from 1 January 2007; new non-domestic buildings, with effect from 1 July 2008; and all existing buildings when sold or let, with effect from 1 January 2009.</P>
        <P>The implementation deadlines set out in the regulations are in line with those published in Ireland&rsquo;s implementation Action Plan, save for a change in the transitional exemption period for new dwellings for which planning permission had been applied for before the end of December 2006.  The exemption ceases as originally intended at 30 June 2008 unless substantial work has been completed.  All new dwellings are covered from 30 June 2008; this date has not changed.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland has primary responsibility for practical implementation of this Directive and the change to the transitional provision enables the roll out of a substantial number of trained and registered BER Assessors in the first half of 2007 and allows Sustainable Energy Ireland to complete the setting up a system for the smooth and efficient administration and oversight of the BER certification system.</P>

	<P>The Independent Review of Implementation of Homeless Strategies, published last year, examined the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s Integrated and Preventative Homeless Strategies and concluded that they should be amalgamated and updated.  The Government have accepted the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Review and work is underway on the preparation of a revised and <Col N="1100"/>updated Strategy on Homelessness, which will be published later this year. </P>
        <P>As part of this process, a National Homeless Consultative Committee is being established under the aegis of the Housing Forum which was set up under the social partnership process.  The Consultative Committee, including representatives from the providers of local homeless services, will provide input into the development of the revised homeless strategy and ongoing Government policy on addressing homelessness.  Nominations for membership of the Committee will be sought shortly and I anticipate that the first meeting of the Committee will be held next month.  While the initial task of the Committee will be to provide input into the finalisation of the revised homeless strategy which will be published later this year, I anticipate that the Committee will continue to meet periodically thereafter, in order to provide an ongoing input into the development and monitoring of Government policy on homelessness.</P>

	<P>There are a number of schemes currently in operation under which grant aid is available for the replacement of windows in private houses.  </P>
        <P>The essential repairs grant scheme enables people in houses, which cannot be made habitable in all respects at a reasonable cost, to have basic works, including the replacement of windows, carried out to them.  The scheme is directed primarily at older persons living in poor housing conditions.  The effective maximum grant under the scheme is &euro;9,523 and may cover up to 100% of the cost of works.  My Department funds 2/3 of the cost of the grant, with the local authority funding the remainder.</P>
        <P>Aid is also available under the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly scheme, which is operated by the Health Service Executive, for necessary repairs to make a dwelling habitable for the lifetime of the occupant.  Funding for the scheme is provided through the National Lottery.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>To address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic, designated facilities are being provided on a temporary, once-off basis by local authorities where <Col N="1104"/>farmers may deposit stockpiled farm film plastic and silage wrap.  This arrangement operated on a pilot basis in the first instance in counties Galway, Clare, Mayo, Offaly and Waterford during June and July of last year.   This service is free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities is being made available from my Department through the Environment Fund.</P>
        <P>The collections were well supported by farmers in the counties participating in the pilot phase, leading to large quantities of plastic being deposited at designated sites. A significant finding from the pilot scheme is that it is not possible to operate collections in a large number of counties at the same time due to capacity constraints on the part of recovery operators.  Accordingly, it was necessary to roll out the scheme to other areas on a staggered basis.  Arising from a comprehensive examination of the information available, I approved further collections of waste silage / bale wrap by Leitrim, Roscommon, Carlow, Longford, North Tipperary and Wicklow County Councils which recently concluded.   Announcements regarding further extensions of collections to other areas, including South Tipperary, will follow a review of this second phase of the scheme.</P>

	<P>My Department has implemented a number of the important recommendations of the report Review of Fire Safety and Fire Services in Ireland.  These include in particular the enactment of the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003, which addressed a number of legislative changes called for in the Review.  In addition, a new Framework for Major Emergency Management, on which local authority, Health Service Executive and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Major Emergency Plans are based, has been issued and this will be implemented over the next two years in accordance with a programme approved by the Government.

This Programme sets out the strategy for the future development of the fire service and includes measures addressing the development of community fire safety programmes, the development of a risk based approach to the determination of fire cover standards, the introduction of a competency-based approach to recruitment, retention and career progression in the fire service and the enhancement of health, safety and welfare programmes within the fire service.  Work on the Change Programme is being carried out by a dedicated Project Team and is progressing satisfactorily.

	<P>Safety issues, <Col N="1109"/>including fire safety, within the home are a matter for the owner/occupier.  My Department actively encourages fire safety in the home as part of its ongoing fire safety education and publicity campaigns. A Fire Safety in the Home leaflet available from my Department and through the local authorities outlines the importance of having fire safety equipment in the kitchen. I have arranged to have copies of this leaflet placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 627 and 628 together.</P>
        <P>As the National Development Plan is a high-level strategic document setting out a broad investment framework and investment priorities together with indicative financial allocations for the next seven years, it does not contain a definitive list of all projects with commencement dates scheduled for delivery or progression during the years 2007-2013.</P>
        <P>However, the major areas of expenditure by my Department under the NDP 2007-2013 are as follows.  Over the course of the NDP, &euro;21 billion will be invested, funding the provision of over 60,000 new housing units and a further 40,000 households will benefit from affordable housing supports.  In addition, a further 40,000 households will benefit under contractual arrangements with landlords for existing properties transferring from the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Rent Supplement Scheme to the Rental Accommodation Scheme, from vacancies in existing housing stock and from improved conditions in existing housing.  During 2007 work will continue on the Ballymun Regeneration project, involving the provision of some 2,300 social and affordable housing units to replace all existing flat blocks structures together with civic and social amenities.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged around &euro;4.7 billion will be invested in water services over the duration of the NDP.  Major projects will include the Belmullet/Foxford Sewerage Scheme in County Mayo, the Greater Dublin Strategic Drainage Scheme and the Cork Strategic Water Study.   Examples of projects to proceed in 2007 include Ashbourne/Ratoath Kilbride Sewerage Scheme, Shanganagh/Bray wastewater treatment plant, Boherboy, Co. Dublin reservoir and Mullingar wastewater treatment plant.</P><Col N="1111"/>
        <P>The NDP provides that &euro;753 million will be invested in waste management.  This will fund necessary rehabilitation of local authority landfills, and the further rollout of recycling centres.</P>
        <P>The investment of &euro;4.3 billion in non-national roads will be primarily aimed at improvement and maintenance of the non-national road network and on strategic non-national roads, with a particular focus on roads in the National Spatial Strategy Gateway areas.  Examples of projects being commenced in 2007 include Waterford Air<Col N="1112"/>port Road, Mulroy Bay Bridge in Donegal, Midleton Northern Relief Road, Ballyboden Road to Grange Road in Dublin, Wicklow Town Relief Road and Port Access Road, the Moyross Access Road in Limerick and the Clonmore Link Road in Mullingar.</P>
        <P>An investment of the order of &euro;373 million will fund expenditure on major capital projects on heritage sites of national and international importance in State ownership and will also fund amongst other things the ongoing National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH).</P>
