      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is in a position to state what action the Government propose to take in view of the recent import levies imposed by the British Government on exports from this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the announcement of the measures to be adopted by the British Government to rectify their balance of payments situation, including the temporary import charges on industrial imports, I requested an opportunity of early discussions with the British Prime Minister.  These discussions will take place on Thursday next in London.</P>
      <P>In his message to me the British Prime Minister assured me that it was with reluctance that his Government took the decision that they did and faced the necessity of measures which conflicted with their obligations under existing agreements; they felt obliged to impose the charges on imports of selected goods from all sources and there was, therefore, an immense difficulty in making a special exception for goods from Ireland.</P>
      <P>In seeking early discussions with the British Government I had in mind the desirability of securing, if possible, clarification of their intentions regarding the scope and duration of the import charges and of their views regarding future trading relations with this country.  While the British Government recognise that the new temporary charges are in contravention of the 1938 Trade Agreement between the two countries, it is not clear that there was full advertence to the pattern of trade between our two countries or to the fact that the impact of these charges on Irish trade with Britain in industrial products is relatively much more severe than on the trade of other countries.</P>
      <P>These are some of the matters which I hope to discuss with the British Prime Minister.</P>
      <P>The Government have under consideration measures to minimise damage to Irish industrial interests, if this situation should persist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these measures, it will be our aim to seek permanent advantages to industry and to contribute to its greater efficiency and competitiveness. So far as practicable, these measures will be directed to the assistance of firms which show that they are doing everything within their own power to solve their own problems and to increase their capacity to expand their <Col N="4" /> export business when these temporary impediments come to an end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the situation now existing, I do not think it is expedient at this time unduly to press the Taoiseach as to the arguments he may advance during these discussions except, perhaps, to ask him (1), would he undertake to make a full statement to Dáil Éireann on Tuesday of next week when the Dáil reassembles after his return from London and (2), will he be then in a position to invite employers and trade unions to meet the Government to consider what joint action may seem desirable to meet the new situation for whatever period it may endure, with special reference to the preservation of employment and production until such time as normal trade relations can be resumed with Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say whether or not there were discussions between the two Governments prior to the imposition of the surcharge or was it merely notification by the British Government to the Irish Government that such a surcharge was being imposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say straight away that there was no prior discussion, or notification of the intention of the British Government to impose these special charges.  I am prepared to make a statement to the Dáil next week and, indeed, if there is a desire to discuss the situation as it then is, I am prepared to facilitate a discussion, if not on Tuesday then at some time during the week.  As regards the measures we should adopt to help to reduce the impact of these charges on Irish industrial development, I should prefer to await a later opportunity of making a fuller statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is proposed to provide funds for the encouragement and development of athletics; and, if so, how much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, Sir, to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have not formulated any plans in relation to the promotion of athletics as they consider that, in keeping with our amateur tradition, this is a matter best left to the athletic organisations.  If, however, agreed proposals as to how the Government could further help the development of athletics should be submitted by these organisations, they will be carefully considered.</P>
      <P>Concrete encouragement for athletics has been, and will continue to be, given by the Government.  For instance, substantial grants have been made out of the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote towards the cost of the Eamonn Ceannt Athletic Stadium in Sundrive Park, Dublin. The Department of Education make provision for physical education and sport in the National, Secondary and Vocational Schools' systems and it may be stated that a very high standard of performance is reached at the annual Schools and Colleges Athletic Championships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, it may be mentioned that the Department of Local Government is empowered to subsidise borrowing by sanitary authorities to provide swimming pools and to give grants for works of public amenity carried out by local authorities, local development associations, <i>et cetera</i>.  Also, the Department of the Gaeltacht, under their scheme of grants for amenities in the Gaeltacht, have already assisted in <Col N="6" /> the provision of a swimming pool, a handball alley, tennis courts and playing pitches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference to the Taoiseach's statement that if agreed proposals are put forward by the organisations concerned they will receive consideration, is not the Taoiseach well aware that these groups and organisations do not agree at all among themselves?  In view of the necessity for promoting athletics properly, will the Taoiseach not consider initiating proposals to bring these groups together to try to get them to agree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware there are certain disagreements. These constitute a factor inhibiting the Government from taking a more positive policy in this respect.  As to the possibility of promoting a measure of agreement between them, I understand that steps to that end have been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there exists on the records of the House a statement by a former Minister of a previous Fianna Fáil Government to the effect that there was a provision in a Budget for some £25,000 to be allocated for the encouragement of athletics, particularly amongst very young people, and that this amount was cut out by the action of a subsequent inter-Party Government? If that be so, and if it be the case, then, that the Taoiseach's Party were committed to that kind of expenditure, would he not think that now, some years later, the time is opportune to do something about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I welcome at once this change of attitude of the Labour Party but the position of the Government is that if we can get some measure of agreement which will permit of Government action, we are certainly prepared to consider what we can do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that a survey carried out by a team of newspaper reporters in Dublin, Belfast and London on the 28th August, 1964, revealed that essential <Col N="7" /> foodstuffs in Dublin are about eighteen per cent dearer than in Belfast and thirteen per cent dearer than in London; and if he will make a statement explaining the reasons for such differential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the newspaper report referred to by the Deputy and I am satisfied that neither the prices quoted nor the calculations based on them give a fair representation of the position in regard to the relative prices of foodstuffs in the cities in question.</P>
      <P>Comparing the price levels of different countries is an extremely difficult operation, involving very exact specifications of the items priced so as to ensure their strict comparability in the different centres.  Furthermore, since there is normally quite a considerable variability in the retail prices of any particular commodity in different retail outlets even in a single city, it is essential when comparing price levels in different places to ensure that the prices used are obtained from a wide and representative sample of shops in each place, so that the averages obtained may be fully representative of the average prices paid by consumers. There is no evidence that either of these conditions was fulfilled in the collection of the figures referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only one reasonably adequate inquiry into relative prices in Dublin and Belfast appears to have been made. This was carried out in August, 1954 and the results published in a paper by Carter and Robson in the 1954-55 Journal of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland.  The inquiry showed that, at the time, food prices in Belfast were 2.5 per cent higher than in Dublin.  If one can apply to these <Col N="8" /> data the changes in food prices as shown by the Consumer Price Index for Ireland and the Retail Price Index for Britain, in the interval August, 1954 to August, 1964, this would indicate that at the latter date, Belfast food prices were on average about 1 per cent higher than in Dublin.</P>
    <P>As regards comparison of food prices with those in Britain, no adequately controlled inquiry has been made. However, that country does supply to the International Labour Office the average retail prices of selected consumer goods in seven towns.  Taking such prices in respect of food items at August, 1964, together with the national average retail prices of similarly described items as returned at the mid-August Consumer Price Index inquiry in Ireland, and weighting the two series of prices by the appropriate Consumer Price Index weights, it would appear that the average prices of such items in Ireland were 1 per cent above those prevailing in the seven British towns at that time, though the comparison depends on the assumption that similarly described items were in fact identical commodities.</P>
    <P>While undue weight should not be attached to either of these calculations, they indicate that differences in average prices of foods of the order mentioned in the newspaper report do not prevail.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Central Statistics Office or any other relevant body has carried out any recent survey as to the pattern of expenditure on food, housing, fuel, and other commodities by old age pensioners and other persons dependent on social welfare payments; and, if not, whether he will ensure that such a survey is carried out in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No inquiry of the type mentioned by the Deputy has been carried out recently by the Central Statistics Office or, as far as is known, by any other body.</P>
      <P>The Household Budget Inquiry, which the Central Statistics Office had hoped to have completed by now, has been delayed by unavailability of the technical staff which was needed for the planning stages.  However, considerable preliminary work has been done on the project and it is expected that the inquiry proper will start in the spring of next year.</P>
      <P>It is intended to include in the sample of households investigated those households containing old age pensioners and other persons dependent on social welfare payments in the proportion in which such households occur in all town areas in the State. It is, however, very doubtful whether it will be possible, because of the limited size of the total sample, to produce separately data on the expenditure of such households, distinguishing those for which payments of the kind in question constitute the only source of income.  Separate information on expenditure patterns will, however, be given for households at different income levels.</P>

      <P>As regards the estimated number of people reaching the retirement age, it is assumed that this age is 65 years.  The estimated number of persons attaining 65 years of age was 11,800 in 1961, 11,400 in 1962, 11,200 in 1963 and 11,200 in 1964.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to estimate the number of people leaving &ldquo;rural Ireland&rdquo; annually and in fact such estimates are feasible only for inter-censal periods.  Neither is it possible at present to give figures for the annual numbers leaving whole time education at the primary and vocational stages, though it is hoped that some estimates in this connection will be available as a result of the OECD Study on Investment in Education, at least for a particular year.</P>
      <P>The average numbers of persons on the Live Register at the Local Offices of the Department of Social Welfare on the last Saturday of each month were: 46,782 in 1961; 46,519 in 1962; 50,202 in 1963 and 48,278 in the first nine months of 1964.</P>

The persons who occupy these beds are in varying stages of incapacity: they range from persons who are completely bed-fast and incapable of looking after themselves to some who are reasonably active.  In addition, there are 822 elderly persons who are patients in psychiatric hospitals maintained by the Health Authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the remarks of the Dublin Chief Medical Officer which appeared in his Annual Report for 1963 in which he indicated that he would like to see housing accommodation, specially designed for those over 70 years of age, provided and a certain amount of supervision and assistance of the elderly occupants also provided as part of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The provision of housing is of course a matter for the housing authority which, in the case of Dublin, is the Dublin Corporation.  The health authority could provide such supportive medical, nursing and ancillary services as would make it possible for the old people concerned to remain in the community as long as possible. I would like to emphasise that the provision of such supportive services by the health authority would receive my full support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the Chief Medical Officer's Report preliminary discussions took place between officers of the Dublin Health Authority and officers of the Dublin Corporation.  Due to the housing emergency which arose in <Col N="35" /> Dublin city, it is understood that further consideration of the precise recommendation of the Chief Medical Officer has necessarily been deferred for the time being but it will be appreciated that the housing authority have been giving special attention to the housing of the aged and they have been specially provided for in a number of schemes completed in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of the abatement of Infectious Diseases Maintenance Allowances by income from other sources, including Social Welfare payments, is not dealt with in statutory regulations made by me.  I would, however, refer the Deputy to the reply given on 2nd June last to a similar question by him, when I informed him that the rates of these allowances specified in the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1964 are maximum weekly amounts and that abatement is not mandatory.  I explained that health authorities were advised by circular letter that, subject to their discretion in individual cases of undue hardship, Infectious Diseases Maintenance Allowances should in general be abated by income from other sources, including Social Welfare benefits.  This maintenance allowance is not a &ldquo;welfare allowance&rdquo; in the ordinary sense and hence it does not necessarily follow that because a person is suffering from an infectious disease he is thereby entitled to an allowance or to an allowance at the maximum rate permitted by the Regulations. As I indicated to the Deputy in my previous reply, I cannot accept that there is a case for singling out payments under the Social Welfare code from other forms of income for <Col N="36" /> exceptional treatment in the matter of abatement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>An itinerant who can show that he is in what is commonly referred to as the lower income group (and it is likely that practically all itinerants can show this) is entitled to a comprehensive range of health services, without charge, for himself and his dependants.  These include the General Medical Service provided through district medical officers, the General Institutional and Specialist Services and the Maternity and Infant Care Service.  Partly to cater for the special circumstances of itinerants, there is special provision in the Regulations on the provision of general medical services for the issue of temporary authorisations for obtaining these services, as a supplement to the normal issue of medical cards.</P>
      <P>Records are not kept specifying instances where itinerants use the services and I am therefore not in a position to give the information requested in the second part of the question.</P>
      <P>I should perhaps draw attention to a recent statement issued by the Minister for Local Government in which it was indicated that, among the immediate steps to be taken to meet the main recommendations in the Report of the Commission on Itinerancy, local authorities will be exhorted to acquaint itinerants of the health services available to them, to encourage them to avail of these services as much as possible and to arrange for regular visiting of their encampments by health personnel.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>It will be seen from the accounts of Shipping Finance Corporation which were presented to the Dáil in January, 1964, as part of the accounts of the Industrial Credit Company, that the amount of loans advanced by the Corporation as at 31st October, 1963, was £2,304,450 and the mortgage debenture loan advanced to the Corporation by the Industrial Credit Company at the same date amounted to £2,357,800.  I understand that the corresponding figures for 31st October, 1964, are not yet available.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice to disclose the further information sought by the Deputy.  This information relates to individual transactions between the Corporation and its clients and I do not consider that the disclosure by me of such information would be in the public interest or that of the Corporation and its clients.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The engineering survey of the Maigue Catchment which comprises 260,000 acres and which lies in counties Limerick and Tipperary was completed in 1963.  Some 38 miles of main river channel and 580 miles of tributaries (the principal tributaries being the Loobagh, Morning Star and Camoge rivers) were covered in the survey.  The preparation of a suitable drainage scheme is now in hands.  This work will take a number of years and some time will then be needed for the local exhibition of the scheme, the receipt and consideration of observations from the local authorities and other interested parties and consultation with other Government Departments, as required by the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  I cannot, at this stage, give a firm date for the commencement of works, but it is unlikely that a start can be made before 1968. Precise details as to the scope of the scheme are, of course, not yet available, but it is expected that the works will cost about £3,000,000, at present prices, and will benefit over 33,000 acres of land.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that the embankments at the outfall section of the River Maigue below Adare are at present being dealt with in conjunction with the repair of the Shannon Estuary embankments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey of the Mulcaire River commenced in July, 1963.  The catchment comprises some 163,000 acres and about 200 miles of main and tributary channels.  To date, the survey <Col N="51" /> of the main Mulcaire channel from its outfall at the River Shannon below Annacotty to its source above Cappamore, County Limerick&mdash;a distance of about 20 miles&mdash;has been completed; as has also the survey of the main channels of the Dead River and its tributaries, the Cauteen and Pope's Rivers and the Killeenagarriff River and its tributaries, the Annagh and Newport Rivers.  In all, some 78 miles of tributaries have been surveyed so far, leaving about 100 miles of channel still to be done.  The survey should be completed in 1966.</P>
    <P>When the survey has been completed, a number of years will be required for the design of a scheme, and, as for the Maigue, the statutory requirements will have to be complied with.  I have suggested that works could commence in 1970 or 1971, but, at this early stage, this is a very tentative estimate.</P>
    <P>From available information (but without the benefit of the survey data), it is expected that the works required in the catchment would cost about £1 million, at present day prices, and that from 10,000 to 12,000 acres of land would be improved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB require special service charges only in respect of the relatively small number of premises which are located in comparatively isolated situations where the normal fixed charge does not yield sufficient revenue to permit connection on an economic basis even after taking account of State subsidy.  The removal of special service charges could be achieved only by the payment of an <Col N="53" /> inordinately high level of subsidy which I would not be prepared to recommend to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The ESB is precluded by law from giving preferential treatment in the fixing of charges to any consumer or group of consumers within the same area of supply and there could, therefore, be no question of treating occupiers of new county council cottages on a different basis to occupiers of other houses.  I would suggest that the county councils should have special regard to the desirability of siting new cottages convenient to electricity supply so as to avoid or mitigate special service charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I also made it clear to the House that the ESB are losing some £900,000 on the service of electricity in rural areas and which is paid for by the urban consumers.  If the Deputy's suggestion were adopted and the special charges abolished, there would be a further loss of £350,000 per annum which would be passed as a burden on to the urban consumer.  If we were to make this special exception, we would have also to provide for all the 12,000 consumers living in remote areas to <Col N="54" /> whom I have referred.  That would involve the ESB in a further loss of £330,000 per annum, and the Government have at least made a sufficient contribution to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if in view of (1) the monopoly created by the amalgamation of the different fertiliser manufacturers and the resultant steep increase in the cost of fertilisers and</P>
      <P>(2) the absolute necessity for the availability of cheap fertilisers to the farming community anxious to carry out their part in the programme of economic expansion, he will remove all obstacles to the unrestricted importation of fertilisers to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The steep increase in fertiliser costs referred to in this Question has taken place in the prices of fertilisers, or raw materials therefor, which are subject to no import restrictions whatsoever.  For example, in the case of granular beet compound in which the Deputy has a particular interest, the increase of £2 7s. 6d. mentioned recently in the press must be attributed, in the main, to increases in the import costs of the principal ingredients, viz. sulphate of ammonia and muriate of potash, as also mentioned in the press.  In addition, there has been an increase in the import price of phosphate rock, also used in the compound.  There are no tariff or quota restrictions on any of these commodities and the question of the removal of any obstacles to their unrestricted importation does not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a subsidy on imported fertiliser?  If there is no subsidy available on imported fertiliser and there is on the home-manufactured product, then of course it makes it impossible financially.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is mistaken in saying that phosphate rock is a constituent of compound beet fertiliser?  Superphosphate manufactured from phosphate rock is a constituent of such a compound and on that there is a tariff levied.  Is that not so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Superphosphate is the ingredient certainly.  The portion of the £2 7s. 6d. increase per ton <Col N="58" /> accounted for by the superphosphate is 5s. 11d.  That is a factor without any doubt.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Recess, we were all shocked by the sudden death of Deputy Michael Donnellan. Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
      <P>The late Deputy's interest in national affairs began at an early age. While still a very young man he joined the Irish Volunteers and during the War of Independence he took part in several actions with the East Galway Brigade.  He was active in local affairs for many years, first as a member of Glenamaddy Rural District Council and later of Galway County Council, on which he served until 1948 when he relinquished his membership on his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The late Deputy was first returned to the Dáil in the General Election of 1943 and was successful at each General Election since.  From 1948 to 1951, and again from 1954 to 1957, he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> Deputy Donnellan represented his native county and province on the football field and he will long be remembered by his fellow countymen as a great sportsman.</P>
    <P>Of a genial disposition, well liked as a personality by all Parties, he was a worthy public representative.  Concerned always for the interests of the farming community, his contributions to our debates were forceful and well-informed and revealed his zest for political life.  He will be sadly missed by all members of the House and by his constituents in whose interests he worked so tirelessly.</P>
    <P>I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to his widow and family the deepest sympathy of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given notice to you, Sir, that I propose to raise on behalf of the Fine Gael Party what we consider to be a breach of the privileges of the House in relation to two statements made in Seanad Éireann on 15th July, 1964.  In the first statement the Minister for Transport and Power described speeches made in this House as &ldquo;screaming nonsense.&rdquo;  The reference is at column 1618 of the Official Report.  At column 1651 the Minister for Local Government indicated that what was discussed in this House was not debated but just &ldquo;drawn out&rdquo;. That, I suggest, is a criticism of you, in so far as it implies that the rules of order were not complied with.  In regard to both criticisms of the discussions in this House, it is well settled that it is not permitted for one House to criticise the proceedings of the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me notice of what he proposed to raise.  In my view, the matter raised is not a breach of privilege. It is the usual practice that no Member of either House may reflect on the actions of either House.  The matter is solely one for the House in which the statement is made, and the Chair in each Houses intervenes where he considers that a statement is contrary to practice.  In regard to the suggestion that there was criticism of the Chair of the Dáil, I may say that I examined the reference given by the Member and I do not accept that there was such an implication.</P>

      <P>Before moving the motion on the Order Paper, I beg leave <Col N="93" /> to state, for the information of the Dáil, that Deputy Patrick Smith having placed in my hands, for submission to the President, his resignation from office as a member of the Government, the President, on my advice, accepted the resignation with effect from 8th October, 1964.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith's resignation as a member of the Government automatically terminated the assignment to him of the Department of Agriculture, and on the same date, I terminated the former assignment of the Department of Justice to Deputy Charles Haughey and assigned the Department of Agriculture to him.  I assigned the Department of Justice to myself as a temporary arrangement.</P>
      <P>On the same date, the Government appointed Deputy Brian Joseph Lenihan, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, to the office of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice, and, on 20th October, 1964, they appointed Deputy George Colley to the office of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, with responsibility for Fisheries, in succession to Deputy Lenihan, with effect from 21st October, 1964.</P>

      <P>I now move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Brian Joseph Lenihan for appointment by the President to be a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>I may say, for the information of the House, that I propose, if this motion is approved, to assign the Department of Justice to Deputy Lenihan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no part of my interests or intentions to comment at length on such measures as the Taoiseach may think it expedient to take to paper over the cracks in his own administration.  He tells us the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, placed his resignation in his hands.  Certainly, if we are to judge from the newspapers and radio, Deputy Smith seems to have been constrained to place it in the hands of everyone else in the country before he could persuade the Taoiseach to admit it had been placed in his. <Col N="94" /> However, that is their affair and I do not propose to pursue it further, but when I hear that the Taoiseach proposes to replace Deputy Smith in the Department of Agriculture with a TD for North East Dublin and to replace Deputy Lenihan in the Fisheries Branch with another TD for North East Dublin, I then come to the proposed appointment of Deputy Lenihan as Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>Now it has long been the custom in this House to wish any new entrant on ministerial responsibility good luck in the administration of the duties of his office.  This event will be no exception to the general rule.  But I am bound to direct the attention of the Taoiseach to certain facts in connection with this appointment and to invite his reassurance that his appointee to the Ministry of Justice will pull up his socks and show some greater sense of responsibility than heretofore we have been led to believe he is capable of showing.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach will remember that since the House last met there was a by-election in Roscommon.  I think it is in the interests of us all to maintain in our public life a vigorous and energetic contest both within this House and on the hustings.  That is a healthy thing. But we ought to be circumspect that we make no allegation against one another or against the Parties representative of our own people calculated to reflect upon them unless we have the gravest reasons for doing so.  This is particularly true of a Party which keeps its own private &ldquo;Pravda&rdquo; in circulation.  The issue of Wednesday, 8th July, of our Irish &ldquo;Pravda&rdquo; which is the official organ of the Fianna Fáil Party, published flare headings &ldquo;Forged Letters Sent to F.F. Supporters&rdquo;. These allegations were made on the authority of the Minister for Local Government and Deputy Lenihan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to read what &ldquo;Pravda&rdquo; says.  It is a sign.  If Deputy <Col N="95" /> Lenihan begins his career by repudiating the Minister for Local Government, this is a high recommendation to me. The man who does that shows some fitness for the post of Minister for Justice.  I must quote the evidence of the printed word.  I admit that on the occasion of this remarkable transaction Deputy Lenihan was cast very much in the role of second fiddle but he did not fail to squeak under his master's bow.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blaney, the Minister for Local Government, led off:</P>
      <P>There was a surprise development in the Roscommon by-election last evening when Mr. Blaney, Minister for Local Government, called a special meeting of Fianna Fáil election workers in Boyle and strongly condemned the circulation of forged letters purporting to have been sent to voters by Mr. Brian Lenihan...</P>
      <P>Mr. Blaney said that a large number of these letters had been delivered through the post.  They were post marked in Dublin...</P>
      <P>The House can picture Deputy Blaney, knee-deep in these letters, picking up an odd envelope here and there out of the pile and discovering that they were &ldquo;franked with a 3d. postal machine stamp, and dated&rdquo;&mdash;all of them&mdash;&ldquo;July 1.  He wanted to warn the voters not to be gulled by this trickery.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mr. Blaney continued:</P>
      <P>When Fine Gael could not win one way they tried to win another way. This last minute effort to catch votes is the lowest form of electioneering I have ever heard of; the worst type of vote-catching ever tried in any part of the country.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I can only describe this new low as an indication that Fine Gael have found the ground slipping from under them in the past few weeks. They have pulled this dirty trick out of the bag at the eleventh hour to try and recover what they have lost. I hope the intelligent people of Roscommon and Leitrim will not be misled by this despicable form of political trickery.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> Mr. Blaney then read a letter which he said was one of those referred to.</P>
    <P>There was no doubt in anybody's mind that the poor man was smothered in this mountain of letters and that here he was picking up one of them to read. The report in &ldquo;Pravda&rdquo; continues:</P>
    <P>It was delivered to a voter in Kilmore area, near Carrick-on-Shannon...</P>
    <P>The letter, read by Mr. Blaney, was written in pen and ink and the Minister said that an effort had been made to imitate Mr. Lenihan's handwriting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The report continues:</P>
      <P>During the election campaign, Mr. Lenihan wrote personal letters to his constituents appealing for support for Dr. Hugh Gibbons, the Fianna Fáil candidate.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the letter last night&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;here comes in the second fiddle squeaking under the appropriate bow and here is the squeak&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Mr. Lenihan said that he repudiated it as a fake and the lowest thing ever prepetrated in Irish politics.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is so contemptible,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I feel no further comment from me is necessary.</P>
      <P>I think of this picture of the pair of them, draped in a snowy white robe, standing in the midst of this mountain of forged correspondence from which the Minister was picking a sample at random&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Wait a moment.  I must <Col N="97" /> call the attention of the Taoiseach to the innocence and unsophistication of his new nominee.  He says indignantly: &ldquo;I was not there when it was done.&rdquo; God knows, he ought to know his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, well enough, even in the short time he has been in public life.</P>
      <P>There was a sequel to this distressing incident.  We now discover from official sources the dimensions of the mountain of forged correspondence in which the Minister for Local Government was floundering and in regard to which the nominee, the Minister for Justice, expressed his pained dismay.  As reported in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of November 1st last, the following statement was issued by Garda Headquarters:</P>
      <P>In reply to an inquiry at Garda Headquarters, a Garda spokesman said that the police investigations in the matter of the election letter in County Roscommon were completed. The investigating officers were satisfied that there was only one letter and that it was forged by a local individual in the Carrick-on-Shannon area as a practical joke and that criminal proceedings were not warranted.</P>
      <P>Let us recall the heading <i>Forged Letter Sent to F.F. Supporters</i> described by Mr. Blaney when he read the letter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I can understand the exertions of the Minister for Local Government, anxious to vindicate the reputation of those he was proud to describe as his &ldquo;Donegal Mafia&rdquo;.

      <P>To the proposal to appoint Deputy Lenihan as Minister for Justice the Labour Party have no objection and I can, on behalf of my Party say, that as an individual we wish him well.  We cannot divorce this proposal, however, from the circumstances in which it became necessary to nominate Deputy Lenihan to be Minister for Justice.  The Taoiseach at the beginning of his short speech referred to the resignation of Deputy Smith, formerly Minister for Agriculture. I think he must have been appalled as many people in the country were, at the hysterical outburst that Deputy Smith made against the trade <Col N="101" /> union movement.  I should like to get an assurance from the Taoiseach that he does not share these views&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into this in detail.  I wish to be as brief as the Taoiseach was in referring to Deputy Smith.  I should merely like to protest against his hysterical outburst. I may say that rather than attack the trade union movement the members of any Government in this country over the past 40 years should, on the other hand, pay tribute to the tremendous work that has been done by trade unions in the country and by their leaders.  Every Government must recognise that the Irish trade union movement, represented particularly by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, has played a very prominent part in the development of the economy, apart from what they have done for the workers of the country in regard to wages, conditions of employment and such matters.  I should therefore like to have an assurance&mdash;I presume the acceptance by the Taoiseach of Deputy Smith's resignation is in itself a repudiation of his views&mdash;that such is the case.  I also want to put on record that I, on behalf of the Labour Party, protest against these hysterical allegations and ask the Taoiseach to repudiate what Deputy Smith said in the past three or four weeks.</P>

Deputy Dillon has chosen to occupy the time of the Dáil with certain trivialities with which I do not propose to deal.  I can say, however, that we are all glad to see that he has recovered from his illness during the Summer Recess and is as happily irresponsible as ever.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We were dealing some time before the Summer Recess with section 13 of the Bill.  I have been wondering, in view of the fact that the Government have adopted the sensible views of the Opposition in relation to other matters, whether, at this stage, the Minister for Lands is prepared to withdraw this dangerous and undesirable section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be noted with particular interest, all during the long Summer Recess, particularly in the speeches made up and down the country by members of the Government, that there was no reference whatever to the Land Bill, or to any individual section thereof, by the Minister.  That led me to hope that when the Dáil reassembled, we would have heard from the Minister his decision to withdraw <Col N="103" /> this Bill or, at least, his decision to amend suitably the objectionable sections, such as section 13, with which we are now dealing.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Minister for Agriculture saw fit to make a speech dealing with this Land Bill quite recently.  I have been wondering whether the Minister for Lands, without wasting the time of the House any further, would be prepared to indicate now at this very late stage whether he, like the Minister for Agriculture, and like other Ministers, has been in recent weeks converted to common sense and intelligence in legislation.  This objectionable section is one which I consider to be very dictatorial and one which has been opposed by the agricultural community.  It has been opposed by all sections of the people in rural Ireland and by all rural organisations.</P>
    <P>The section as it stands, without amendment, will, in my opinion, have very disastrous effects when one considers that it is an interference with the right of ownership of land.  It is an interference with the right of any man to do with his land as he wishes, without any outside interference, whether from a Government Department or anyone else.  The Fine Gael Party have, and always will maintain their belief in the free right of ownership to one's own land without any interference whatever.  Section 13 of this Bill prohibits the sale, transfer, letting or subletting of certain lands without the consent of the Land Commission. More serious still, all dealings in respect of any farm, after inspection by an officer of the Land Commission at the instigation of the Minister, may be frozen for a considerable period. This is where the greatest possible objection must arise, because it is a very drastic interference, an interference with ownership of property, and more particularly, with ownership of land.</P>
    <P>God knows, we in this country have a very long tradition of fighting, and fighting successfully, for the right of ownership of land.  It is a disastrous and very retrograde step that, having achieved the right of ownership of <Col N="104" /> land and having got for ourselves the right of free rent, fixity of tenure and free sale, by the adoption of section 13 of this Bill, we are now to surrender all that was fought for and won over many long years of struggle.  A very serious battle was fought by our forefathers against the landlords in this country.  The right of the landlord to the ownership of his tenant's land was challenged and our people became owners of their own land.  We now find, under this section, and under other provisions of this Bill, that what was dearly won with great sacrifice in the past is now being surrendered completely and taken from our people.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of our people in rural Ireland do not realise the very serious effect which this section will have on the ownership of their property. That is why I feel this House should be generous in the amount of time they give to a very important problem of this nature.  Views have been expressed by very responsible organisations who have protested in the strongest manner against section 13 and have made pleas to the Government Party and to the Minister to have it withdrawn.  The fact that a senior inspector of the Land Commission can freeze all dealings for one year in very objectionable and, in my opinion, this House should reject this section.</P>
    <P>We in the Fine Gael Party propose to fight this section tooth and nail and we propose to divide on it.  That is why I say this is too serious a matter for the people of this country, for those who live on the land and particularly those who respect ownership of property to allow to go through without very serious thought.  I am sure there must be Fianna Fáil Deputies supporting the Minister in this House on this issue who must know from their experience and from the experience of their constituents that this is a section which is regarded as disastrous.</P>
    <P>I want to place this on record: section 13 is objectionable; it is, in my opinion, a section which can be described as ill-advised and ill-conceived. We in the Fine Gael Party propose, after the next general election, to amend the objectionable sections of <Col N="105" /> this Bill should it pass in its present form.  It is well that the people should know, and be reinforced in the knowledge, that if the Minister passes this section as it stands, after the next general election, the serious provisions of this and other objectionable sections will be suitably amended so as to give an assurance to the land owners of Ireland that we believe in the rights of the people of Ireland to the ownership of their own property, without any interference from the Minister for Lands or anybody else.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will debate at great length the many objections and the serious degree of opposition which come from all sections of the community in regard to this matter.  I hope the Minister will accept the commonsense view of those who have advised him against the inclusion of this section in the Bill, that he will see the light and have this disastrous section removed from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already spoken on this section.  Having listened to Deputy Flanagan this evening, I must say that he is not a bit logical if his statement just now made in the House is compared with statements he has already made about the Land Commission allowing foreigners to buy land and then talking about free sale when a foreigner comes in and buys land through an agent, auctioneer or solicitor. They come in here under the 1950 Act.  There is free sale and no Minister has any power over the sale of land in this country at the present time because there is no legislation.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly about section 13. I come from the land, from a family, I suppose, that had to struggle for an existence on the land.  I have had private discussions with the Minister on this section.  The Minister will at no time interfere with the right of any ordinary individual who in an effort to do something to improve his own economy, at some lean time or other has let his land for a time.  Those are not the people with whom we are concerned, but we are concerned with people who have let their lands and left the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a rural problem, <Col N="106" /> a very serious national rural problem. I have heard members of the Opposition speak in this House about how denuded rural Ireland has become. Throughout the country the first thing you will be told is about a house closed here and another closed there, the people having left the country.  If we are to do anything at all in this matter, we must try to bring holdings up to an economic standard, so that a man, woman, or family, as the case may be, will be able to live on the land.  Surely nobody believes that in a democratic country a Minister who has to face his own people&mdash;and indeed the present Minister comes from a constituency in which there are a number of uneconomic holdings&mdash;will do a thing which will be detrimental to his own people. We had no legislation to deal with this problem, this cancer of the old rental system which should have been settled years ago, and the Minister is very courageous in coming along to grapple with it.</P>
    <P>It is all right talking about this, that and the other, but if John Jones wishes to go to America or Australia and leaves his land and does not bother coming back to it, the land is not being used and is let to someone else. Another man, a neighbour of his, will do the same thing.  There is a man in the centre with two or three acres who is trying to eke out an existence with conacre land and carry on in this way. This is a national problem.  I hold that for a man in this country to survive, and if rural Ireland is to survive, if the country is not to be depopulated altogether, we will have to face up to this position.  I have discussed this matter in great detail with the Minister and I am assured that the ordinary decent man or woman who, because of some unforeseen circumstances let his or her land, will not be interfered with.</P>
    <P>I know rural Ireland and I know rural county Dublin.  In this section we are giving the Minister power to deal with a national problem.  I can assure the House that under the amendment to the Land Bill which was introduced here in 1950, no power whatever is given to the Minister to deal with this problem, unless he is prepared to go <Col N="107" /> into limited farms, especially in my area where land is £300, £400 or £500 an acre.  How can the Minister deal with that?  I am deeply concerned for the welfare of every section of our people, irrespective of class or creed.  I would be the first to go to the Minister if he were doing any injustice.  I feel section 13 is fair in dealing with the national problem we have to deal with and I ask the Dáil to face up to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always amused to hear the concern of Deputy Burke for his people.  I am always amused also to see how the Deputy always leaves after having almost wept bitter tears.  Deputy Burke and the Minister would have been better advised to shed some of their tears last summer when in discussing an amendment to this section, put down by Deputy Hogan (<i>South Tipperary</i>), we put forward from these benches exactly that which the Minister for Agriculture announced in Loughrea in East Galway last Sunday. I was interested to notice, too, that it was the Minister for Agriculture who made the announcement about the Land Bill, and not the Minister for Lands.  It was something to salve the <i>amour propre</i> of the Minister for Agriculture because the new Minister for Justice, appointed today, was slashing the Succession Bill to bits.</P>
      <P>The statement in relation to the Succession Bill in some respects was pretty vague, but when Deputy Hogan of South Tipperary put down an amendment in the summer to the effect that every purchase of an agricultural holding by an alien should be subject to the consent of the Land Commission, the Minister for Lands said it was utterly unthinkable anybody should do such a thing, that it was merely some deep-laid Fine Gael plot to put him in a jam, some deep-laid Fine Gael plot to do away with free sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the Minister himself is the person best capable of doing away with that.  The fact is that now the Government have come around to the point of view we have been advocating from these benches for a considerable time.  The tragedy is&mdash;and everybody in Kildare knows just how serious a <Col N="108" /> tragedy&mdash;that he is, to an enormous extent, locking the stable door after the horse has gone.  The amount of land in Irish hands in my constituency which has now been sold to people who are accustomed to the land values of the continent and were in a position to outbid any Irish person wanting to settle a farm on his son would shock anyone who takes the trouble to go around County Kildare.</P>
    <P>One always welcomes a conversion at any time but was there anything significant in the fact that it was the ex-Minister for Justice, now the Minister for Agriculture and lately the promoter of the fragmentation of the Succession Bill, who made the announcement rather than the Minister for Lands, the man in charge of this Bill?  It will be rather interesting to find on the Report Stage that we shall have Deputy Michael Moran, the Minister for Lands, introducing a provision diametrically opposed to what Deputy Michael Moran said on the Committee Stage of the same sections.  We are used to Fianna Fáil turning around and jumping around, but the drafting of the Minister's introductory statement on the Report Stage amendment will be a matter that will require all the delicacy at the command of those accustomed to couching such phrases in Departmental ways and means.</P>
    <P>Apart from all that, this section, taken in conjunction with section 27, puts into the hands of a political Minister the possibility of political tyranny in such a way that it should certainly not be enacted.  This section leaves a landowner open to the gravest injustice because even admitting, which I do not, that the Minister was right in what he wanted, the section was so badly drafted in relation to the protection of all landowners concerned that there is grave fear of real injustices being done.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with the political end first of all.  Anybody who has any experience of land sales in rural Ireland knows very well that the moment any place goes up for auction and it goes out that the Land Commission have inspected it or are about to inspect it an owner has no hope of <Col N="109" /> selling that farm.  The price drops by at least 25 per cent of what its value is the moment the story goes out that the farm has been or is about to be inspected by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he has any doubt about what I am saying he should ask all the solicitors practising in County Kildare, all the auctioneers practising in County Kildare, because naturally one speaks here of the area with which one has the most experience.  I put it to an auctioneer today that the drop in value was 25 per cent and he told me I was very much underestimating it, that the difficulty would be it might be impossible to get a purchaser at all.  If the Land Commission stepped in and purchased the farm afterwards, of course the stamp duty and the costs would be all thrown away because they would not be paid.</P>
    <P>Even after a threat of Land Commission proceedings, the position heretofore was one of which the Judicial Commissioner would have to take judicial or semi-judicial notice.  What is happening?  For the first time since 1923 when we established our own institutions, when the Land Bill of 1923 was passed, the Minister for Lands, a political Minister, is taking to himself the right to decide whether an inspector of the Land Commission shall go in and shall inspect Farm A and Farm B but shall not go in and shall not inspect Farm C.  That has always been something reserved to the Lay Commissioners, people who are appointed with rights properly appertaining to semi-judicial appointments, people whose permanency of office gives them rights to make decisions above those of a political Minister.</P>
    <P>A political Minister is given the right for the first time to say who will go in on whose land and make an inspection.  That is a right being taken away from the Land Commissioners.  It is being taken by the Minister to himself. I agree, of course, that the Minister himself will not walk down and go in.  That can be done only by a person not below the rank of a senior inspector, <Col N="110" /> but a senior inspector is a servant of the Minister and is bound by the terms of his office, by the terms of his appointment as a civil servant, to carry out the directives given by the Minister to him.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly obvious that any Minister could in those circumstances, under section 27, arrange for the commencement of proceedings for the purpose of victimisation, if he wishes, of political opponents.  Apart from that, it will be extremely difficult in the future for a political Minister to disregard directions that may come to him from a cumann or other group of his political organisation in a constituency when they say: &ldquo;Go and get so-and-so's land inspected.&rdquo;  Immediately that is done, the owner concerned virtually cannot sell.  It is the beginning of Land Commission proceedings; it is the prerequisite of section 13 coming into operation.</P>
    <P>That is a wrong power to give to any Minister.  It is the beginning of political segregation as between one citizen and another.  Except in cases of emergency, it is a type of thing democracy requires should not be done except by those vested with judicial or semi-judicial tenure of office, people who are entitled and able to exercise their judicial or semi-judicial discretion, free and unfettered, on the merits of each individual case.</P>
    <P>What happens when the Minister has set out on his progress and says: &ldquo;There is a list which my senior inspector is to have inspected in that county&rdquo;?  The next thing is that a report is made and a determination reached that proceedings shall be pushed a step further.  I do not want to mislead anybody.  Pushing all the proceedings a stage further is a matter for the Lay Commissioners but it is obvious, after all that has been done, that the damage to the man's property has already been done and that he has not been able to sell.  I believe the purpose of this is to provide that having had the damage done in the way I have indicated, with, then, the threat of the action under section 13, with the freezing of his land for a long period, it <Col N="111" /> will mean that the Land Commission will be able to get that man's farm at substantially less than the value.  I believe that will be the effect and I believe it is the designed effect of the joint operation of these sections.</P>
    <P>What happens?  An order is made under subsection (2) of section 40 of the Land Act, 1923, that the farm at a certain place is one that is going to vest in the Land Commission unless in pursuance of a valid objection.  That is done pretty regularly and in what one might call the balance of cases, so that the objection can come up for full hearing and be decided upon.  But the damage is done.  It is going to be frozen for a year.</P>
    <P>Let me take a case I meet pretty often in the course of my profession, a case which, I am sure, the Minister has met pretty often in the course of his profession.  A man has a farm, shall we say, of 100 acres.  For one reason or another&mdash;some type of misfortune&mdash; he has found himself in the position of being substantially in debt.  His creditors are pressing him all round. He decides that the best way of meeting his obligations is to sell his 100 acres, and having sold it, pay his creditors and then buy a farm of 50 acres and establish himself on that and have adequate working capital for the 50 acres.</P>
    <P>Now, under this section, he will not be allowed to do it.  Once section 13 comes into operation, he cannot sell. He cannot sell for the period initially introduced in the Bill, for a year, but there is nothing in the Bill to provide that his creditors cannot make him a bankrupt in that year.  Although the man desires and is anxious in an honourable way to meet his obligation to pay his debts, to clear them out of the way and to go into a smaller farm and set himself up, there is nothing in this Bill that prevents his creditors, be it a bank or anybody else, from making him a bankrupt and casting upon him all the expenses of that bankruptcy.  He is not allowed to realise his assets for the purpose of meeting his debts but there is nothing anywhere to say that the person to whom he owes money is not bound to <Col N="112" /> stop taking him by the throat and there is nothing to say that because the assets cannot be readily realised, in fact he is not to be made a bankrupt and not to be made to suffer all the expenses that might be involved in a court judgment, a judgment mortgage or perhaps even an equity suit to realise a judgment mortgage.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that any solicitor who examines this section and the manner in which it is drawn and the effect it will have will say that under this section and its operation, many people who are really solvent are nevertheless going to be made bankrupts and have all the costs of such bankruptcy put upon them, even though at the end of the period, when the freezing comes off, and the land is acquired by the Land Commission, on the one hand, or when the Land Commission say they do not want it, on the other hand, and he is able to sell it, it is found that he has quite ample funds to meet his obligations.</P>
    <P>That is a real danger and one that will undoubtedly arise if this section goes through with its existing provisions and it is one that creates a type of injustice which should not be permitted.</P>
    <P>There is another type of injustice which is perpetrated by this section. Once a notice has been given under section 40, subsection (2) of the Land Act 1923, which is the basis for section 13, a person is not allowed even to transfer the farm to his son.  The son may be willing and anxious to get married, may have found a suitable girl, may have decided that he wants to set up home on that farm and the owner concerned may be perfectly happy to give it to him, to set him up in it.  But, under this section, during the freezing period provided by the section, the wedding bells cannot ring and nothing can be done to set up that member of the farmer's family on a farm of his own.  What justification can there be for that?  The Minister alleges that it is because by transferring a farm to his son a man would be dodging proceedings. That can perfectly well be dealt with in another way, as the Minister knows very well.</P>
    <P>This is just the soft, easy way of the <Col N="113" /> administrative bureaucrat, the soft, easy way, administratively, to get everything, as the Land Commission want, in their own maw, regardless of the injustice it may create, regardless of the fact that the procedure they are adumbrating and introducing can be used as political tyranny, regardless of the fact that it may and will result in certain people, inherently solvent, being forced into the bankruptcy court or into taking an arrangement of creditors under the bankruptcy rules because the Minister has frozen their assets and at the same time the debts that are due by them are not frozen.</P>
    <P>When the Land Acts were introduced, there was wise and proper drafting then.  A mortgagee was not entitled to take the owner of the land through the courts during the course of the Land Commission proceedings. The mortgagee was going to be paid out of the lands.  There is no such provision here to save a man being hounded in costs through the courts because the Land Commission&mdash;not he &mdash;have decided that they want to take the easy way of freezing administratively this land so that they can take their own time about deciding what they want to do.  That is obviously unjust.  It is obviously unfair when you ally it with the powers the Minister is taking to himself for the first time in section 27 to ensure that there will not be a sale in practice, not in theory, but in practice as everyone knows in the country.  Then, the joint operation of these is tyranny which should be resisted.</P>

      <P>Before the Dáil recessed, this section was being discussed and I think at that time I made it clear that as far as the Labour Party were concerned we had not the same point of view on this section as Fine Gael.  There are, I suppose, dangers in practically every section of every Bill that goes through a House if they are incorrectly used, but the position about this section is that I understand it has been introduced to stop something which those of us who have been in close touch with the rural community are aware is a grave abuse, that is, the <Col N="114" /> action of people who as soon as they hear that a Land Commission inspector has appeared in the district immediately rush to sell their land.  If this section does successfully deal with that type of person, then it will have the support of the Labour Party in this House.</P>
      <P>There are dangers, perhaps, in it.  It may be that the Minister is attempting to crush a nut with a steamroller but it does appear as if even the NFA who are opposed to it can see the necessity to do something about this particular principle.  There are not very many big farms in any constituency that are likely to pass into the hands of either the Land Commission or a foreigner at the present time&mdash;the foreigners have collected most of them already&mdash;but it is true that of those farms that are likely to be sold, if the Land Commission inspect the farm, this section will not interfere with the normal working of the farm.  If there is a reason why it must be urgently disposed of, this section gives the Land Commission the right to deal with this matter urgently.  Personally, I have not been convinced by the arguments put forward by Fine Gael that a wrong is being done in including this.  Far from it.  I honestly believe it is high time some Government introduced a section in a Bill which would prevent this racket of selling farms immediately the Land Commission appear and thereby making it much more difficult for the Land Commission to acquire the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman referred to the person whose land would be devalued because of this action by the Land Commission.  I assume&mdash;and some of his colleagues can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;he is talking about the fellow I have just been describing, the fellow who when he sees the Land Commission inspectors around, decides to sell his farm.  Naturally, it will be devalued if the person who is buying it knows the Land Commission inspector is likely to come and take it off him subsequently, but is there anything wrong with that?  If the Land Commission desire to take over a farm, they have the right to do so.  It is a most important thing that land should be made available to the Land Commission <Col N="115" /> when it is not being properly used and that it should be given to those who will use it properly.  That is the big difference between the approach of Fine Gael and the approach of the Labour Party on this section.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has changed his mind but the Government seem to have changed their minds and the Minister for Agriculture has made it clear he has changed his mind about the question of foreigners buying land.  Let me say, however, that the original amendment which was put in by members of the Labour Party was defeated after a very strong speech by the Minister.  In fact when the amendment was put in, it included the three points which I understand are at present being considered by the Government in their amendment: the purchase of land by non-nationals, the right of the non-national to keep some land around a big house which he purchases, and the right of a non-national to get arable land for the purpose of starting an industry.</P>
    <P>I do not mind who brings in the amendment.  If the Minister brings it in and therefore ensures that Government support is behind it, I shall be glad to see him do so.  I am glad that even at the eleventh hour, the Government realise that a terrible wrong has been done to the people through the number of non-nationals who have been allowed to secure the best land in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully, when speaking on this amendment, deplored the depopulation of rural Ireland that is taking place under this Government and he held the view that if section 13 went through as it stands, this trend would likely be reversed or at least that it would enable the Government to keep more people in rural Ireland. My view is that if this section goes through in its present form, there will be more people leaving rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things that keep people in their holdings is the pride of absolute ownership.  No worthwhile case has been made for section 13.  I should like to ask Deputy Tully if the owner of an industry or a factory was not <Col N="116" /> using the industry or the factory to the satisfaction of some people, would he say that industry or factory should be taken over or is there any legislation proposed to do it?  It is property the same as land and it can very often give much more employment than land and a great deal of production.  However, we are here deliberately discriminating against the owners of land.</P>
    <P>One of the points made in favour of this section is that it was intended to prevent the purchase of land by foreigners.  We know that is a matter that can be dealt with in the way suggested by the Minister for Agriculture when he made his recent announcement in Galway.  The Minister for Lands would be well advised to follow his example at least in one respect, that is, to listen to what the rural community have to say about this section.  It is not wanted by the people in rural Ireland.  The volume of opinion is definitely against it.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister where has the demand come from or where does the necessity arise for this section.  If the proposal mentioned is put through as announced by the new Minister for Agriculture, as seems now to be the intention of the Government, then where is the necessity for section 13?  It is unnecessary and an unwanted piece of legislation which is opposed by everybody I meet in rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>Without section 13, this Bill would be completely useless.  Section 13 is an enabling section for the Land Commission to take urgent action when required.  I do not quite understand the Fine Gael attitude on this section as expressed by Deputy Sweetman.  When they talk about congested areas, I should like to know whether it is purely lip service for public show because section 13 is one of the effective ways, the most effective way I can devise, at all events, to deal with this problem and to give the Land Commission the necessary legal teeth to take quick action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no Deputy I know of representing a rural constituency who has not come across all these cases where <Col N="117" /> the vulnerable owner jumps the gun immediately the Land Commission under their present procedure serve what we call a section 40 notice.  That owner immediately proceeds to get rid of his land before the Land Commission have the opportunity of acquiring it for the relief of congestion.  It is to deal with that problem, the problem with which Deputy Tully is obviously familiar, that this section is there.</P>
    <P>In connection with the provision of 12 months under this section, I want to repeat what I said previously in discussing this section and the amendments before the House, that is, that I am not tied to the 12 months as the period for freezing.  I have already indicated that, in my view, that could be reduced, but this is designed to meet the wishes of Deputies.  Anything less would, I think, possibly make the section ineffective.  I am, however, considering reducing the freezing period before the Report Stage.  If it were reduced to six instead of 12 months, I think it would be a reasonable provision.</P>
    <P>Deputies speak here about being concerned for the rural community and state there is no demand for this section.  I suggest these Deputies are out of touch with the rural community. The NFA said in a recent letter to me : &ldquo;We appreciate the necessity of empowering the Land Commission to take prompt and effective action in certain circumstances but we consider that the Land Commission prohibition under this section on transfer letting and subletting should be limited to one month.&rdquo;  I can understand differences of opinion in relation to the time limit.  That is a debatable matter but anyone who professes to be concerned for the relief of congestion must accept this section; otherwise, we are simply wasting our time discussing this Bill since this section is designed to enable the Land Commission to take effective action.</P>
    <P>In every debate here on Land Commission affairs, Deputies have always complained about the slowness of the Land Commission, their failure to operate satisfactorily and their failure to come in quickly where there are lands for sale and acquire those lands <Col N="118" /> for the relief of congestion.  Since I became Minister, I have heard that complaint made.  As a Deputy, I, on many occasions, complained about the failure of the Land Commission to take effective action.  Here, we are giving the Land Commission the necessary powers to take effective action, to move in quickly where lands are needed for the relief of congestion. If we are really concerned here to deal effectively with this problem, then section 13 is a must, in my view, in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>With regard to the allegations about the devaluation of land by Deputy Sweetman, this section does not prohibit sales of land.  Its purpose is to enable the Land Commission to control undesirable sales.  The law provides, as Deputy Sweetman well knows, that the market value of the land must be paid.  If the bankrupt owner about whom Deputy Sweetman talked is dissatisfied, he has his appeal to the Appeal Tribunal and he is entitled to get what the court decides is the full market value of his holding.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that this section is designed to enable the Land Commission to get cheap land is obviously incorrect. After the passage of this Bill, the price of land will be determined in the same way as it has been determined up to the enactment of this piece of legislation.  I would ask Deputies to keep that fact in mind and, keeping it in mind, I ask what is wrong with the Land Commission having the power to take over land that is for sale, land that is needed for the relief of congestion, so long as the owner gets the full market value?  I see nothing wrong with that proposition.  I cannot understand the objection of Fine Gael Deputies to this section.  I am quite satisfied there is no hope of making an effective inroad in order to relieve congestion unless the Land Commission get powers of this kind, power to move in quickly and power to acquire the land so badly needed to remedy this grave social problem.</P>
    <P>Since this debate started, I have dealt in detail with the other subsections. Since 1923 it has been the law that where a letting is made for a period of over one year, such a letting <Col N="119" /> is void without the consent of the Land Commission.  The provision in this section is not, therefore, new.  The other provisions are necessary to stop fragmentation of land by subdivision without the consent of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the intention of the Government to add an additional section dealing with the sale of land to non-nationals.  When we come to that, I shall deal with it specifically, but I should like to point out now that, contrary to what Deputy Sweetman has said, I have on many occasions informed the House that sales to non-nationals are under very close official scrutiny.  We have this register for the purpose of keeping track of these sales.  Should it appear at any time that further action ought to be taken, the Government will take it.  As the Minister for Agriculture has said, while we have all heard different stories and rumours about the law being evaded, we have not got any official proof that that is so.  I have invited Deputies from time to time, if they knew of any cases in which the 25 per cent stamp duty was being evaded, to get in touch with me.  I have no official proof that the law is being evaded.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me by different bodies, including the NFA, that it would be more desirable if there were direct control on the sale of land by the Land Commission instead of a control by the Revenue Commissioners. It may be that some have found a method of evading the law.  It may be that, notwithstanding the penal provisions in the Finance Act, some are prepared to risk imprisonment even by making false declarations.  I have no proof that this is so but it has been alleged by many Deputies in this House &mdash;although, as I said, they have not given me any specific case to show that the law is being evaded.  At all events, the amendment the Government have decided to introduce in this Bill will for the future put the Land Commission in the position of giving or refusing their consent to the sale of land to non-nationals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman talks about the depreciation in the value of land by <Col N="120" /> virtue of the Land Commission, as he suggests, coming in and inspecting it. I do not know what he will have to say on the new provision that I propose to introduce.  At all events, I do not accept the suggestion that land is devalued by virtue of the fact that the Land Commission look at it in this day and age.  There was considerable opposition from solicitors and auctioneers dealing with the Land Commission up to a year or two ago when the rules were changed and auctioneers were allowed the commission they would get in the course of their business from other people.  The opposition to the Land Commission acquiring land on a voluntary basis has largely disappeared since that particular rule has been changed.  Since then, from the experience I have had, I can say that we are receiving much more co-operation in getting land on a voluntary basis from auctioneers in the course of their business.</P>
    <P>There was, too, the feeling amongst the legal profession that if the Land Commission got involved in taking over a holding, or in the sale of a holding, it was very difficult to get matters concluded with them.  That has largely disappeared because we have new rules that will enable solicitors in rural Ireland to deal effectively with the Land Commission without employing agents or others in this city to operate for them.  As a result of both changes we can expect to get more co-operation from those concerned when dealing with land throughout the country.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of making an effective impact in relation to the relief of congestion this section is essential if we are to eliminate all the complaints we have had from time to time from Deputies about the slowness of the Land Commission in taking over land that is for sale.  I shall deal with section 27 when the House reaches it but, indeed, without this section, and without section 27, this Bill would simply be useless.  I am satisfied that with this section we are closing a gap that was wide open as far as landowners who were vulnerable were concerned.  This section, and, indeed, all the other sections in the <Col N="121" /> Bill, have to be wide in their scope if we are to deal with the problem as we see it.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy knows quite well that most of these powers are not designed to deal with the ordinary landowner at all.  They are designed to deal with what I call the vulnerable owner, that is, the man who has either gone away altogether from his land or is not using the proper methods of husbandry.  It is very seldom in these days that we have an appeal in the Land Commission on anything except a question of price.  The vast majority of appeals are mainly concerned with the question of land values and it is now very rarely that a case is brought on the basis that the owner wants to hold his land.  This in turn is an indication of the type of place that the Land Commission are endeavouring to acquire for the relief of congestion.  Invariably they are cases where the owner is either a non-resident or such a bad land user that he does not consider that under the existing law he would have a hope of beating the Land Commission in the courts.  That is the type of person with which this section is designed to deal and, as I stated, unless we have this section we will make no more progress than has been made in dealing with the very urgent land slum problem which we have in the congested areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not refer to Deputy Sweetman's fear of giving civil servants, who are responsible to the Minister, the power of inspection and deciding on land that should be acquired.  That is a very dangerous provision in this section and one on which I should like to hear the Minister comment.  Many people will not feel safe on their holdings unless they happen to be very well known supporters of the Government in power at the time.  That is something that should be removed from this most undesirable section.  The Minister referred again to the fact that land is not devalued by reason of the Land Commission's interest in its acquisition. If that is so, why do so many people run away from the Land Commission as possible buyers of their holdings?  Why <Col N="122" /> are they rushing to sell as secretly as they can?  The Land Commission's money should be as good as the money from any other purchaser.  I think that the Land Commission pays in cash or if they do not pay in cash, their bonds are now of some value, which they were not heretofore.</P>
      <P>It is still true, however, to say that if the owner of the land has a choice the last customer he wants is the Land Commission and, therefore, he must be convinced that the Land Commission are the worst possible buyers.  If the Land Commission were competitor purchasers of land, and if that could be proved, there would be no difficulty whatever in getting voluntary offers of land.  As purchasers, the Land Commission are as free to go into the market to buy land as anybody else. If they eliminate the foreign competition&mdash;that is something I believe should be eliminated and for which we should have introduced legislation long ago&mdash;then if they are not going to give less than the market value of the farm they should be able to go in and purchase it.  If a man has a holding, he should be entitled to get the real market value of that holding, which is what it can fetch on the open market.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I was very pleased to hear that the difficulties between the Bar Association and the Land Commission, whether technical or monetary, have been resolved to the satisfaction of the Minister.  I am sure the Minister is even more pleased than I am.  He tells us this section is of paramount importance to the Bill&mdash;that, in fact, it will not be a Bill without it.  He says this is an enabling section to allow speedy action by the Land Commission, the speedy action he maintains is essential to counteract the action of certain land owners who, in his words, are prepared to &ldquo;jump the gun&rdquo; once they get any intimation that the Land Commission are likely to move in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Land Commission are prepared to give the market value for land, why are these people so anxious to &ldquo;jump the gun&rdquo;?  Surely there must be some difficulty?  Is it because they are compelled to take all or a large <Col N="123" /> amount of Land Bonds instead of cash? If that is the reason, it should be rectified.  There is no point pretending they are getting the market value for land if they feel they are being paid in a form of currency which, to them, is unpalatable or something they do not like.  I cannot understand why the Land Commission could not be as good a customer as anybody else.  If we accept the notion, in practice as well as in theory, that land owners are entitled to get the market value of their land, surely they are entitled to get it in the currency which they would get if they would put the land up for public auction?</P>
    <P>Obviously there is some difficulty. I suggest to the Minister that, if he would address himself to correcting that difficulty in the farmers' minds&mdash; and which apparently had been in the minds of the auctioneers and lawyers but which now has been smoothed out &mdash;he might make his avowed purpose of acquiring land to deal with congestion a little more easy.  Deputy Clinton put his finger on it when he said that if we eliminated the foreign buyer, to whom, in most cases, the 25 per cent means nothing, and let the Land Commission go in as an open competitor the same as any other buyer, we would overcome some of the difficulties of land owners who fear the Land Commission and who are prepared, as the Minister says, to &ldquo;jump the gun&rdquo; to avoid them.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted the NFA leaflet in which the NFA recognise the necessity of the Land Commission taking over land in certain circumstances. While we on this side listen to the Minister's specious arguments, we are worried about what the &ldquo;certain circumstances&rdquo; may be.  The Minister told us of two of them.  He told us this appeal is addressed to the bad farmer and the absent farmer.  Because of the operation of section 13 with section 27, we are worried that it might also be extended to the Fine Gael farmer, in view of the unusual powers the Minister is taking under section 27 by which one of his officers may move in. We feel these two sections place in the hands of the Minister an instrument <Col N="124" /> which may operate like a pincer for political purposes.  I am sure the Minister will reject any suggestion of this nature, but he cannot blame us and he cannot blame the many land owners throughout the country if they feel some such movement may be put into operation against them.  Even when it is not done, it will be suspected in many cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken a very regressive step in departing from established land practice and introducing section 27.  It is that section which makes section 13 so particularly objectionable.  It is not so much section 13 itself as when it is considered in the context of section 27.  I would ask the Minister to tell us why he thinks farmers are so prepared to &ldquo;jump the gun&rdquo; if everything is as perfect as he would give us to understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to say a great deal, except that it appears to me that the speakers immediately before me have an outlook completely different from mine. Fine Gael are either interested in the relief of congestion or they are not.  If they are interested in relieving congestion, they should look at my part of the country where congestion is so acute.  I do not accept that Deputy Clinton and Deputy Hogan from their constituencies have any real, practical knowledge of what actually happens in areas such as mine.  Furthermore, they are doing a disservice to the public by continuing to spread around the idea that the Land Commission is not a good buyer.  Because Land Bonds nowadays achieve parity with cash, the average person in the west of Ireland is not now anything like as reluctant to offer his land to the Commission as he was a couple of years ago.  It is doing a public disservice to spread it abroad that the Land Commission's money is not now as good as that of anybody else, because in fact it is.  I would hope and believe that in future whatever Government are here will take steps to ensure that Land Bonds represent their actual market value.  It is on the basis that that does happen now and will continue to happen <Col N="125" /> in the future that I base my argument that Deputy Hogan and Deputy Clinton are doing a disservice to the public by adopting their present approach.</P>
      <P>I can say from my experience as a practising lawyer in a congested area that the number of holdings of land which I offer to the Land Commission for voluntary acquisition has increased ten-fold in the past few years, since the owners realised that the Land Commission were paying the equivalent of cash.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that considerable progress has been made in these directions by making concessions to the auctioneers, or, to rephrase that, by giving the auctioneers the fees to which they are entitled.  Some progress has also been made towards streamlining the legal process.  I do not accept that there is not still room for improvement in regard to the latter item, and I still think some simpler formula could be adopted.  There is still some unnecessary delay but it is not unreasonable delay, and it is not such as would make any practical difference between the length of time it takes to investigate and pass a title in an ordinary private transaction and one between an individual and the legal department of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, if Fine Gael would like to see congestion cured, or at least alleviated, in the west of Ireland, and if they do not accept that you must step in quickly when land becomes available, by what other means do Fine Gael suggest that the Land Commission can effectively speed up the relief of congestion?  If we have a state of affairs where certain districts are left not much better off in 1964 than they were in 1934, by what method would they suggest that position should be remedied?  It is still a fact that a large number of congested areas&mdash;mostly on the west coast of Ireland&mdash;are not much better off now than they were in 1934 in the matter of relief of congestion.  Some are better off as a result of emigration &mdash;forced emigration and voluntary emigration&mdash;but they are not a great deal better off through the activities <Col N="126" /> of the Land Commission, because the Land Commission have found it impossible in many instances to obtain enough land to put through any practical relief arrangements, and because in other cases the Land Commission have not been able to acquire the land they wanted in those areas by reason of the fact that when the owners put land up for sale they sold it by private treaty and sold it to persons who already had too much land.  That is the sort of thing that must be stopped if any effective system of relief of congestion is ever to be attained in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must remember that while Deputies from the richer parts of the country are speaking at length here, more and more land which might otherwise be acquired by the Land Commission is going into the hands of the bigger and better-off people.  If Deputies want to do a real service to the people they will implement this Bill, and this section in particular, as quickly as they can and give us who live on a valuation of £1, £2 or £3 a chance, rather than standing up here and, from the lofty eminence of enormous holdings and vast riches, telling us in the poorer areas how we should behave ourselves and what steps should be taken to see that the people have a proper way of living.  Most of the speeches were made by people who have a proper way of living and I suggest we have heard enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three questions which I want seriously to ask the Minister relating to the points raised by Deputy Sweetman.  I do not know whether the Minister tactfully avoided answering Deputy Sweetman or whether it was too embarrassing for him to go into detail. Every Deputy on this side of the House knows that congestion is a great problem and that it is a great problem in the west, in the south and in many pockets in the midlands.  We know there is a problem of congestion in counties like Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.  It is the intention, the ambition and the desire of Fine Gael to contribute in no small way towards the solution of that problem in a commonsense <Col N="127" /> manner and not by resorting to a law which will deprive the people of the rights of ownership of land. There are many ways in which the Land Commission can acquire large pools of land for the relief of congestion without resorting to the prohibition of sale, the prohibition of lettings and the prohibition of transfer of land.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman very correctly pointed out the difficulties and the distresses this section will cause in years to come.  If this section is passed there is nothing to prevent the Minister from linking it with section 27 which gives him the authority&mdash;not the Land Commissioners, not the Lay Commissioners but the Minister as the political head of the Department&mdash;to send an officer to inspect any holding.  I put it to the Minister that assuming any group of supporters of the Minister's Party, or of any Minister's Party, desire to make a petition for reasons known only locally that their neighbour's land be inspected and frozen for a period of 12 months&mdash;which the Minister has generously agreed to reduce to six months&mdash;the market value of that land will be reduced overnight. When a Land Commission inspector walks a farm it is generally expected that they are about to acquire it for division, and no one will be encouraged to enter into the public market to purchase it, with the result that the Land Commission can take it at their own price.  They can take it at their own price if there is no competition in the local market for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If section 27 is passed&mdash;and it goes hand in hand with section 13 which we are now debating&mdash;I venture to say that the Minister, or any Minister occupying that office, will be faced with the distasteful problem of having to receive deputations and carry out inspections of land at the instance of political pressure groups.  That is a power which no Minister and no Party should have.  It should be left to an independent decision as it is now.  The Land Commission should have the same right to administer the land laws as the courts have to administer our <Col N="128" /> laws.  Here we are saying for the first time that the Minister, or any Minister, can use this section to further his own political Party interests.  He can comply with the wishes and requests of his own political Party organisation by carrying out inspections <i>ad lib.</i> on every farm he wants to and I venture to say, knowing the Fianna Fáil Party as I do, that if they get this power they will concentrate on inspecting the farms of Fine Gael supporters and others who disagree with them.  That is why I am afraid of vesting this power in the hands of any Fianna Fáil Minster. He has not made any effort to deal with the possible abuse by any Minister of the powers which he has taken upon himself in this section.  It is something which will not have an easy passage in so far as this side of the House is concerned.</P>
    <P>In the course of his address this afternoon, the Minister pointed out that the Minister for Agriculture spoke in Loughrea last Sunday.  Before the Summer Recess the Minister for Lands did not open his mouth about this new section and gave no inkling of its introduction. On the contrary, he spoke in this House before the Summer Recess and said that the purchase of land by aliens and non-nationals was not a problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It is a very short Bill consisting only of three sections.  Its purpose is contained in the brief section 2 which reads:</P>
      <P>The Board shall not, in the exercise of their powers and functions, demolish Georgian houses in the city of Dublin unless authorised in writing by the Minister to do so, after a resolution so authorising the Minister has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill relates to what I can only describe as the vandal plan of the ESB to level an historic street of houses in <Col N="129" /> the city of Dublin.  The Bill seeks to curb the swollen arrogance of semi-anonymous rulers by decree and to make one of their major activities subject to the scrutiny and approval of Dáil Éireann.  It affords me personally the opportunity of condemning the impudence of a State body&mdash;there is nothing &ldquo;semi&rdquo; about this body: it can be described as a State body practically in the full sense of the word&mdash; in seeking to destroy repairable and liveable houses at a time of severe housing shortage which affects many thousands of Dubliners.  The Bill also is an attempt to save a handsome part of Dublin for the continued use and enjoyment of Dubliners, of the nation and, indeed, of the world.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister, as the Departmental head responsible for the activities of the ESB, this question : What compelling need is there for the headquarters of the ESB to be concentrated in this district at all?  Are we not all only too keenly aware of the undesirable concentration of large-scale business activity in central city areas which entails the office employment of large numbers of people?  Are we not all only too well aware that this trend, which has gone unchecked, to concentrate large-scale business activity in central city areas, for no arguable reason, is having a very serious effect on our economy generally and also upon the traffic problem as it relates to the centre of Dublin?  What interests have been consulted in this matter apart from the convenience of the members of the Board of the ESB?</P>
    <P>I want to know why the ESB will not build their new headquarters outside the city area in a suburban district or even in a county area such as Santry or Clondalkin or Lucan or Blanchardstown or, indeed, any other city fringe district where there is ample room for extension and development and where there is obvious need for the introduction of this kind of large scale employment in order to help the economy of the villages or towns or districts concerned in the urban or suburban area.  Why have the ESB chosen, in their autocratic fashion and in defiance of the expressed wishes, I would say, of the vast majority of the <Col N="130" /> citizens of Dublin and in spite of the objections of the elected representatives of the people in the City Hall&mdash; the Corporation&mdash;to defy public opinion in this matter and to proceed now in collaboration with the Minister for Local Government with their proposal to raze to the ground 18 or 19 houses in Fitzwilliam Street?  I am not an architect and I profess to have no knowledge of architecture, unlike some of the so-called architects going around.  However, not being an architect, these houses appear to me to be perfectly sound, at least from the outside. In fact, they have been the subject of expert scrutiny within recent years by a highly qualified world authority on this kind of architecture and the houses have been pronounced capable of preservation.</P>
    <P>It may be asked why we bother to preserve these houses.  The first point is the housing need.  If these houses were made available for ordinary occupancy by people who need places to live in there would be 100 applications for every vacancy in these houses in this city immediately and economic rents would be forthcoming for them. Another consideration is that those of us who are Dubliners or, let us say, naturalised Dubliners&mdash;those of us who have lived most of our lives in Dublin&mdash;may be said to have a sentimental attachment to this city and its topography and its appearance but we also have a very sincere regard for it.</P>
    <P>If you walk on a Sunday morning from Holles Street Hospital towards the top of that Georgian prospect and see the Dublin mountains at the end, if the sun is right, you cannot but feel that what you are looking at here is Dublin, uniquely Dublin, and that Dublin is a unique city; that you are looking at the city, not of George II or George I&mdash;if they were ever here, I do not know&mdash;but at the city of Grattan, of Napper Tandy, of Theobald Wolfe Tone and Robert Emmet and, coming down to later days, of mighty literary figures, Irish people who went out and stormed the literary citadels of the world and made us proud of the name of this city.  That is the kind of thing you think, or at <Col N="131" /> least the average intelligent Dubliner &mdash;and that applies to 99 per cent of the population of Dublin&mdash;thinks when he walks in the shadow of these houses.</P>
    <P>Houses have been falling as we know, houses which I suppose could be described as Georgian; but these are houses of a different character from those we are discussing here. The houses that have been falling with such disastrous results in parts of the city because their life span has obviously come to an end are houses which were acquired by some landlords in many cases one hundred or more years ago for exploitation and for letting to the working people of the city who lived in such houses in conditions which, as we know, were not only appalling but which, according to the inquiry into the housing of Dublin working classes in 1913, were comparable only with the conditions of the natives of Calcutta, India, and no other city in the world had such overcrowding, squalor and poverty.</P>
    <P>That was at the time, as we know, of the great James Larkin and the other gentleman who opposed him, whose name I do not consider worthy to mention here.  These were houses of a different kind from those I am discussing now.  It could be said that literally armies of tenants and families lived out their lifetimes and passed through these houses, that the houses were neglected by the owners, that no money was spent on them and they were allowed to run down, to become rotten and rat-infested in every sense of the word.</P>
    <P>The other houses, those in Fitzwilliam Street have been occupied for almost the past 40 years by the ESB who have maintained the houses as State companies must maintain their property.  Before that, these houses were occupied by a few&mdash;possibly one or two&mdash;families since they were built. They were at all times well maintained and were in no way comparable with the ratpits of houses we now see falling and which come under the heading of Georgian.  The Fitzwilliam Street houses seem to me to be perfectly capable of being put into such condition <Col N="132" /> that they will afford accommodation to people urgently needing it.</P>
    <P>If there is any doubt about the housing crisis in Dublin at present I think one facet of it can be brought clearly before the Dáil by an extract which I shall give from the <i>Irish Times</i> of Tuesday, October 7th, on page 7.  In columns 9 and 10, there appears the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">ENTRANCE TO HADES</P>
    <P>Late last week as gangs of workmen put up the first strings of coloured lights in Grafton Street a fire was lit in the cavernous room at Griffith Barracks where some 25 mothers and their children eat three times a day.  It was the first fire to be lit there this winter.  This part of the barracks, opened about a year ago to provide emergency accommodation for homeless families, is segregated from the Army's quarters by a substantial wire fence. As well as the canteen block (which also serves as a recreation room), there is a dormitory block.  This is clean and centrally heated but undeniably crowded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not.  The Minister would like to have it declared out of date.  It is a wonder the Chair does <Col N="135" /> not oblige the Minister.  Nobody at the time the Bill was lodged envisaged the possibility that the Minister for Local Government would say here in this House that, in so far as town planning is concerned, he would be guided by the wishes of local authorities.  He said that no later than the occasion of the last Town Planning Act.  He said on that occasion that he would be guided in his decision affecting town planning &mdash;and this is a case in point&mdash;by officials of local authorities.  Yet, he decided to flout the expressed opinion of Dublin Corporation in this matter, to defy them and to allow the appeal to this group of people who want to knock down these houses.</P>
      <P>There is substance in the worthy suggestion of Deputy Byrne in these circumstances, if not tonight, certainly during the course of this debate as it develops, possibly tomorrow evening or next week if it goes to that time, that the Minister for Local Government might come in and give us the benefit of his views.  I have a feeling about the business of the Custom House <i>vis-á-vis</i> Dublin city and the country.  I have had experience of Ministers of all kinds.  When I say &ldquo;all kinds&rdquo;, I mean all political kinds in residence in the Custom House. I hope I will be forgiven by many of my rural colleagues for mentioning this but I have sensed a kind of communal slight or bias against Dublin on the part of nearly all of them.  That should not apply on the part of Ministers.  It is true and there are members of the Government Party in this House who are just as aware of it as I am.  That should not be the case.  There is no real reason why that should be so.  We have all a common interest.  We are all living in one country and none of us should fall into the trap of forgetting himself and trying to create bad feeling between the country and the city.  It is Smithish-Goldwaterism as expressed here in this country but it is there and the Minister for Local Government might come in and give us the benefit of his views as to why he chose to defy the Dublin Corporation in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is wrong.  Dublin Corporation did not give permission and I shall prove it now.  In a letter dated 5th February, 1962, the Principal Officer of the Engineering and Town Planning Department said as follows:</P>
      <P>In a letter dated 5th December, 1961, the Electricity Supply Board indicated their intention to build as soon as possible at Lower Fitzwilliam Street and made formal application to proceed under the Town Planning Acts.  In response to an inquiry from the Corporation the Board stated that what they sought was General Permission in respect of the site on which houses 13/28 Lower Fitzwilliam Street stand.  An Order was made on 17th <i>ultimo</i> granting permission in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>General Permission granted under the Town and Regional Planning Acts, 1934 and 1939 subject to the condition that the Board submits for the Corporation's consideration detailed plans illustrating their proposals before any work of a constructional nature is put in hands.</P>
      <P>It says &ldquo;before any work of a constructional nature is put in hands&rdquo;. Mr. Doran, the engineer of Town Planning in the Corporation, elicited the following definitions:</P>
      <P>I refer to your letter of the 9th <i>ultimo</i> requesting clarification of the terms of the permission granted to the Electricity Supply Board in respect of the above premises.</P>
      <P>(a)  The &ldquo;Corporation's consideration&rdquo; means a decision by the Corporation as to the grant (conditional or unconditional) or refusal of a Special Permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  In the definition both of a &ldquo;general permission&rdquo; and a &ldquo;special permission&rdquo; the words &ldquo;construction&rdquo; and &ldquo;demolition&rdquo; are, <i>inter alia,</i> included as separate and distinct types of work, and ordinarily &ldquo;work of a constructional nature&rdquo;<Col N="137" /> would not include demolition as an isolated act in itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister is wrong when he says Dublin Corporation gave the ESB permission to demolish houses.  Subsequently, as the Minister is aware, when the plans were submitted they were considered by the Corporation and the ESB was specifically notified by the City Manager that the Corporation did not propose to give permission for the destruction of these houses.  If that were so and if the Minister was right in what he said, what is the point of appealing to the Minister for Local Government? When the Corporation turned down the application by the ESB to destroy these houses the ESB then proceeded to appeal, under the Town Planning Act, to the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>My major concern in this matter is to prevent houses being destroyed when they are urgently needed for living accommodation in Dublin.  This other feeling which is abroad amongst large numbers of people who are not in need of houses is an aesthetic sense which prompts them to try to prevent what they consider to be things of beauty and of age being destroyed. Mind you, it is not confined to any small section of the population.  A former President of Ireland was a signatory to the main petition presented on behalf of the people who were protesting against the proposed demolition. He was a very eminent and very much respected former President of this country.  Members of the Government Party, and leading supporters of the Government, are among the long list of people who have publicly expressed themselves as saying that at least there should be an impartial investigation of this matter by some kind of unbiased commission, and the question of the destruction or demolition of the houses should not be left to be dealt with by a small group of people consisting of the ESB directorate and the Minister for Local Government and his advisers, but that some efforts should be made to meet the wishes of the ordinary Dubliners in this matter.</P>
    <P>This letter was sent to the Taoiseach <Col N="138" /> in connection therewith in May of this year.  The letter reads :</P>
    <P>Sir, The widespread public interest in the future of the facades of the ESB houses in Lower Fitzwilliam St., Dublin, the sustained controversy, the existence of widely differing points of view, all suggest that the solution of this problem is a matter of national concern.</P>
    <P>We the undersigned are convinced that the best hope of arriving at the right solution would be the setting up by you of an <i>ad hoc</i> Commission which would consider the matter impartially, take evidence and report on every aspect of the case : the practical needs of the ESB, the historical, the cultural, economic, tourist and civic aspects, and finally in its relation to European civilisation.</P>
    <P>We wish to emphasise that in making this proposal we, as individuals, do not necessarily hold the same or indeed any definite views on the final solution of the problem.  We are all agreed, however, that the setting up of such a Commission is warranted and is the best procedure in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Might we hope that you would consider the suggestion that the Commission be presided over by the Chief Justice if he would consent to act, and if not, by another member of the judiciary?</P>
    <P>Where would you meet with a more reasonable submission than that? But it was met with, as I have described before, the impudence and the insolence of office.  That is not my phrase but somebody else's.  It was a familiar one.  This act of the ESB, to my mind, is just another example of the ever-increasing incidence of the theft of the rights and privileges of Dáil Éireann, which is the only barrier the citizen has against the creeping and often brazen contempt which some far from civil public servants are frequently seen to develop in relation to the ordinary citizen.  That matter, as I say, was couched in language which could not hurt the susceptibilities of the most <i>jejune</i> member of a Party.</P>

      <P>I want to draw attention to the fact that this proposal was examined by the Dublin City Architect, who no doubt made a report on it.  It has not been possible for the ordinary citizen to get a copy of his report.  No doubt this matter was also made the subject of a report, or reports, by the Minister's departmental advisers.  I am talking about the present Minister and the departmental advisers of the Minister for Local Government.  These reports have not become available for public inspection.  They are the preserve of the Civil Service, where apparently the ordinary human being is not permitted to intrude.  I should like to have them placed on the Table of the Dáil for inspection because we have a right to do this.  That is what we are here for.  I want to know what reports these people made and on what basis decisions were taken by the Minister for Local Government&mdash;no doubt with the collusion of the Minister for Transport and Power and of the Government.  On what basis did they decide to proceed with what they intend to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask, too, whether it is not a fact that the ESB had the option of a separate site adequate for their needs at Donnybrook, and that they maintained their rights to that option until they received the order from the Minister for Local Government intimating his decision to let them go ahead with their vandalism. That option was relinquished only after they heard of the Minister's decision.  I should like to ask why that option was not made use of? Donnybrook is congested enough, I will admit, so far as traffic is concerned, but it does not present anything like the problems that arise in and about <Col N="140" /> the streets at the back of the House, going beyond Merrion Square and out towards the canal.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that if you want to park around that area, it is impossible. You just cannot get parking. You take a chance and park and go into an office and then you find that some of the very efficient gardaí have taken action.  There is no immunity for members of the Dáil, despite what many people imagine.  In fact, the reverse is the case, especially with the younger gardaí.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the condition of these houses and that they were falling asunder from dry rot. That is strange because they were all completely re-roofed in 1950&mdash;the whole lot of them.  There was an army of carpenters employed on the job. The slates were stripped off completely and all the timber work was replaced in that whole street on all the houses concerned at that time.  I do not know how fast woodworm is supposed to work, but it must have done a lot of work in 14 years on those houses because all that timber was new then. Whether it works fast or slow, we all know now&mdash;and all those engaged in the business of building and reconstruction know much more than I do&mdash; woodworm is not beyond treatment if it is attended to before it does too much damage.</P>
    <P>I am told the amount of dry rot was not such as would prevent preservation and I am also told, and I accept it because I have had a look for myself, that there is at the back of these houses space upon which the ESB could build if they set their minds to it.  There were suggestions as to how that might be done by no less a person than Sir Albert Richardson who was invited here by interested parties, who should have been invited by the Government. He is a far more capable person, it seems to those who know him, than the man the ESB brought over, and I am not to be taken as decrying that gentleman's ability.</P>
    <P>Sir Albert Richardson is known as perhaps the outstanding authority in these islands on restoration generally but particularly on restoration of <Col N="141" /> houses of this age.  He came here and in the course of an address to a meeting in Dublin, had a number of pertinent things to say on the Fitzwilliam Street houses.  I should like to say that Sir Albert has been coming to Dublin for 60 years, whereas Sir John Summerson, invited by the ESB, had come for the first time.  Sir Albert had this, among other things, to say:</P>
    <P>Many will think that this is not the occasion to describe the public buildings of Dublin which, beginning with the Parliament House, give the capital a style of its own.  I feel that it is important to give credit to the men who designed these fine works because they established the crafts of building as never before. The outcome of this was the existence of Lower Fitzwilliam Street. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Dublin rivalled other capital cities in Europe.</P>
    <P>He goes on to describe the Irish craftsman and his ability.  Anyone who goes around these houses can see the evidence for himself.  This House would be nearly contemporaneous with those houses but does anybody seriously suggest we should level this House?  There is serious need of accommodation here.  If we were to have sufficient accommodation for Deputies, Senators, staff and visitors, we would have a building extending from Kildare Street out to the far railings in Merrion Square and it would still hardly be big enough.  But does anybody suggest that we knock down Leinster House?</P>
    <P>Is not the logical end of this precedent sought by the ESB that we would give way to the Philistines, that we would build into the sea in Dublin and have an exact replica of some American city, a mass of concrete, glass and chrome?  On all sides our architectural societies would be delighted about our utilitarian skyline but the historical feeling the rest of us have for our city would not be there any more.  I am not now to be taken as being against modern architecture, modern development.  What I am against is the unnecessary and useless destruction of buildings which are <Col N="142" /> perfectly viable.  I am sorry to have to use that word but it is the only one convenient to my train of thought.</P>
    <P>Sir Albert Richardson also had this to say, and I trust I shall be forgiven for quoting him again.  I should, at this point, say something about his qualifications.  He has done very considerable work in post-war Britain on the reconstruction of houses which suffered bomb damage.  He is a practising architect whereas Sir John Summerson, who came here at the invitation of the ESB and whose expenses were no doubt paid by the ESB, is not a practising architect.  He is, in fact, the curator of a museum. The man I am about to quote is an architect of international reputation. He quotes Michaelangelo: &ldquo;Trifles make perfection and perfection is no trifle,&rdquo; and then goes on:</P>
    <P>This is a truism most fully borne out by the compelling vista of Lower Fitzwilliam Street.  The various facades are unified by their individual simplicity and slight differences of fenestration.  Take, for example, the skyline of the whole range, slightly varied in level and punctuated by chimney stacks just where they are required.  The stone quoins at the two salient angles of the first house bond the whole perspective sequence of brickwork. Then you have the circular headed doorways with their gracious fanlights, entrances of charm peculiar to Dublin alone.  Another compelling note is the subtle stepping of the first group of two with the adjoining group of six; then there is the steadying effect of the remaining group of eight.  But above everything else there is the benevolent appearance of the sashed windows denoting the importance and subordination of the interior apartments at certain levels.</P>
    <P>He goes on to observe:</P>
    <P>It was the stone masons, the bricklayers, the carpenters and the glaziers of the Dublin of the grand period who endowed the terraced houses of Lower Fitzwilliam Street with such aristocratic expression.  If you allow these houses to go you <Col N="143" /> will banish the spirit of a great age forever.  Those familiar with Malton's aquatinted views of the eighteenth century buildings and streets of the Dublin familiar to Wolfe Tone and Napper Tandy realise how much has survived.</P>
    <P>If the ESB and the Minister get their way, very little will survive.  Sir Albert also says that the threat to demolish the 16 houses is indicative of the modern tendency to destroy without thought.  How true that is.  One suggestion with which most of the citizens agree is that the ESB should move outside the city and the question is asked : why do they not go out there where there is plenty of room for them? Answer came there none.  I do not suppose we will get one to it.</P>
    <P>I shall not try to sum up what Sir Albert Richardson had to say after he had inspected these houses.  Let me emphasise once again that Sir Albert Richardson is a far greater authority than others who may have been consulted in matters such as this and is a specialist.  He said that there is sufficient space at the rear of the ESB premises in Lower Fitzwilliam Street to erect a building to meet requirements. Sir Albert praised the modern office block built by the ESB some years ago and said that there was no need to vacate the site, that the requirements could be provided by the erection of an octagonal or hexagonal tower building with light on all sides and lift shafts in the centre, all being linked to the office block by bridges.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, in all the most recently built corporation schemes of flats, that very idea is carried out. Instead of the old type staircase running around in terraces, they have towers which afford entry to the upper flats.  Obviously, Sir Albert had something similar in mind here.  He pointed out that this building could be modern and high as desired.  He suggests that it might be topped by a gilded statue of Mercury or such, which would glisten in the sun and could be illuminated at night and seen from all over the city.  In my view, every exposure of the ESB tends to make our citizens more and <Col N="144" /> more irate.  They would not be wise to draw more attention to themselves. That is already being done by their so-called competitive charges.</P>
    <P>Sir Albert said that the Lower Fitzwilliam Street houses are in a reasonable state of repair, that signs of dry rot are few and that the houses have been well cared for.  He stated categorically that there is no need to demolish them.  He made the comment that the ESB might use one or two of the houses in Lower Fitzwilliam Street while at the same time building at the back of the existing houses on sites which they already have.  He says that the remaining houses should be returned to their former use&mdash; private dwellings and consulting rooms. Apparently these were the purposes for which they privately used before they were acquired by the ESB. Incidentally, it is said that all these houses were acquired by the ESB in 1927 for something like £4,000.  That gives an idea of the change in values. Sir Albert says that in his view these houses could be converted and repaired at a sum of approximately £6,000 per house.  He suggested that each house should be converted vertically; the ground floor planned as a residential flat, private office or consulting rooms, and the first and second floors planned as one flat or maisonette with its own internal staircase; that the top floors throughout could be flats which could be made available at lower rates to the many thousands of applicants that can be found for them.</P>
    <P>What had Sir John Summerson to say?  He is the man who is curator of a museum.  He said it was just one damned house after another.  He described them as rubbish, a sloppy uneven series.  A sloppy, uneven series? If that is not symmetry, I do not know what is.</P>

      <P>Let me turn to the general question of the preservation of old houses and of portions of cities such as this.  A picture I have here of Washington shows the layout of the White House with Lafayette Square at the rear of it, in direct relationship to, as if it were planned on, Merrion Square.  Is the White House patterned on this building, or is it <i>vice versa?</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Lafayette Square presented a problem also.  Consider how the Americans dealt with it. There are pictures here that anyone can see which show that in an artistic way they preserved the old houses which existed there, which are about the same age as the Georgian houses in Dublin, and at the same time built at the rear office blocks and similar buildings which were required, maintaining architectural harmony throughout.</P>
      <P>The Administrator of the General Services in Washington, speaking on this question of the preservation of buildings, referred to the desirability of preserving areas such as that, which are visited annually by thousands upon thousands of people.  Thousands of Americans come here every year and I am informed and have every reason to believe from my own observations that the line of Georgian houses seen from the Holles Street end of Merrion Square is the longest and best preserved prospect of Georgian houses in the world.  Many thousands of people have come here to see and to photograph this view.  My information is that Bord Fáilte, for which the Minister is responsible, is strongly against this demolition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, everybody who has been asked about it is against it.  I would nearly say that if the Minister were to express a completely independent and personal view, he would agree that the thing is a scandalous <Col N="146" /> carry-on.  The mechanics of Government administration are often such that people find themselves in unenviable positions, having to defend situations in which they do not believe. Certain gentlemen would make out that thereby they are liars but I would not take that view.  They may have had to bow to majority decisions taken democratically within their own Parties, as we all have had to do at some time or other.</P>
      <P>However, whether that is true or not of the Minister, the fact of the matter is that the late, great, never to be forgotten Irishman, John Kennedy, had something to say about the preservation of buildings.  In a letter which he wrote to Mr. Bernard L. Boutin, Administrator of General Services, in connection with the preservation of an area surrounding Lafayette Square and Pennsylvania Avenue, which has the same relationship to the White House as these buildings and these streets have to Leinster House, the late John Kennedy said:</P>
      <P>I have been reflecting on the significance of this work, not only in the terms of the importance of it to the environs of the White House and our capital, but to what it means in a broader sense to other cities and communities throughout America.</P>
      <P>He might well have said the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As you know, I am fully cognisant of the progress made by American Architects and Planners in their contribution to our country in contemporary design.  This coupled with equal progress made in our cities by their respective governing bodies in forging ahead with vast programmes of urban renewal and redevelopment leads me to comment on the manner in which these plans are actually carried out.  There are throughout our land specific areas and specific buildings of historical significance or architectural excellence that are threatened by this onward march of progress.  I believe that the importance of Lafayette Square lies in the fact that we were not willing to destroy our cultural and historic heritage but that we were willing to find means of preserving <Col N="147" /> it while still meeting the requirements of growth in government. I hope that the same can be done in other parts of our country.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that in this case you and the architects were able to express in the new buildings the architecture of our times in a contemporary manner that harmonises with the historic buildings.</P>
    <P>What he meant is amply illustrated in the photographs which I have here and which show that the old houses, like those in Fitzwilliam Street, which occupy Pennslyvania Avenue and the surrounding areas of the White House were in fact preserved, while new office accommodation was provided behind them and in such a manner as to create a complete artistic plan which would not be offensive in any way.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of thought which I would imagine should be developed in this country in so far as building is concerned instead of destruction.  Such native genius as we have in this direction should be applied to the preservation of what is there and the creation of something new; the mind should be exercised in the creation of something which will inspire, at which people can look and say : &ldquo;That is something which shows imagination, which shows that the people in this line of activity are very much alive to modern needs and at the same time are not blind to the influences of history.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We do not see much evidence of that.  Recent modern buildings do not inspire.  Some of them depress.  They do not seem to call for any more than drawing a square box, filling in lots of glass and lots of concrete, lifts going at a thousand miles an hour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of my colleagues and I were in lifts in some of these buildings on the continent and they certainly did not go at ten miles an hour.  The suggestion made by Sir Albert Richardson that there should be vertical as opposed to horizontal development seems to be sound.  There must be a lot of time lost and <Col N="148" /> efficiency dissipated by virtue of the traffic from one office to another when it entails going through quite a number of houses from one end to the other.  Vertical development in office structure, apart from its aesthetic value and looked at purely from its use value, has been seen to be more efficient for inter-office communication than horizontal development.  However, that is a point I shall leave to the architect.</P>
      <P>The Arts Council were likewise against this destruction.  They submitted:</P>
      <P>That the space behind a number of houses in Upper Mount St., immediately adjoining the ESB property should be acquired or made available for the erection of a new office block, linked by bridges over East James's St. to the existing modern office block at the rere of the Fitzwilliam Street houses, and that this block should be built on piers to make the maximum site area available for parking.  A number of the houses in Upper Mount St. referred to already belonged to Government or semi-state organisations.</P>
      <P>Which should make their acquisition, if not easy, certainly less difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the burden of my case as to why the ESB should not be permitted to go ahead with this destruction without the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas and thereafter the approval of the Minister, the approval of the Minister being dependent upon the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have tried to approach this matter in as temperate a manner as I can, despite all the provocative observations made earlier.  I feel very strongly about this.  Particularly do I feel strongly about the whole notion of knocking down houses which appear to be perfectly capable of being lived in while people are clamouring for houses. Every member of Dublin Corporation of Dublin County Council who is a representative in the Dáil has countless applications for houses.  The thing is abhorrent and it should not happen. It is a perfect example of bureaucratic vandalism with complete disregard for <Col N="149" /> the people just for the sake of convenience for a few gentlemen.</P>
    <P>It is hard to be temperate about this but I am going to ask the Minister and the Leader of the main Opposition Party to permit a free vote on this issue, on which defeat or victory will not rock the Government to their foundations, or indeed impinge very greatly upon their policies.  However, it is one of principle as far as the citizens of Dublin are concerned and certainly as far as I am concerned.  I urge most strongly that consideration be given to that.  Let us show we are a democracy.  Let us show that we can act in a mature manner, that we can come in here and argue sensibly, finally deciding in a free, democratic manner the way in which we will vote, without having the Whips running here and there in order to put down Deputy Dunne's or anybody else's Bill. Let us behave with maturity.  It is for the sake of maturity that I ask for a free vote.  I have nothing further to say at the moment but I am sure more will occur to me when the time comes to reply to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the excellent way in which Deputy Dunne introduced this Bill.  He has introduced it so thoroughly that there is not a great deal left for anyone else to say.  He has been very moderate in his language. He has gone to an immense amount of trouble to gather his facts.  However, that does not mean that the rest of us, who support the views he expressed as strongly as he does himself, have just nothing to say. Even if we should repeat what Deputy Dunne has said, it is for the sole purpose of emphasising the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel very strongly in this matter. This is something that is taking place in the very heart of my own constituency. As a Dubliner, I am against this proposed demolition on many grounds, but there are three principal grounds for objection.  The first is aesthetic because of the beauty of these particular buildings.  At first view, these building look almost severe but, then, a great deal of <Col N="150" /> Georgian and 18th century building has that severity until one takes into account the exquisite proportions and the detail which enlightens the whole structure.  These buildings are very typical of their kind.  They show these features in a very marked degree.  They are an integral part of 18th century Dublin.  I hope that we have long since passed beyond being worried about names, though I find some people who seem to be worried by the use of the word &ldquo;Georgian&rdquo;.  These buildings, as Deputy Dunne pointed out, had nothing to do with the different Georges, I, II, III and IV.  They were built during the reign of one of them but they were designed by Irishmen and they were carried into effect by Irish workmen and generations have paid tribute to the work of those Irishmen.</P>
    <P>The view from Holles Street, referred to by the previous speaker, is one of the most famous views in Europe because it is the last of the 18th century views.  I remember during the war years, when there were almost no motor cars on the road; if one stood with one's back to Holles Street Hospital and looked up Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Street right on to the mountains, had a sedan chair suddenly come around the corner, it would have been in perfect harmony with the buildings.  Happily, that view is still there, but it is being threatened by this proposed demolition.  Now, if that style of architecture ceases to remain a feature of the Dublin landscape in that particular area, Dublin will cease to be the finest 18th century capital in the world.</P>
    <P>The aesthetic objections are linked with the fact that our Georgian city, which is the only Georgian capital in the world, is a tremendous tourist attraction.  We could make far more of the beauties of these 18th century buildings.  I am afraid we shall not have many of them for very long more because many of them have fallen into a state of decay which renders it impracticable to repair them.  But these particular buildings are easily repairable. It is not true to say that they are far gone.  They are not far <Col N="151" /> gone.  The roofs were repaired very thoroughly at considerable expense in the last few years.  Money was spent on the interiors.</P>
    <P>Those of us who cherish these Georgian buildings feel that the ESB could go elsewhere and build there something worthy of the ESB instead of trying to fit in an appropriate building in this very cramped space.  If these houses are pulled down, and that is the idea apparently, all one can erect in their place is a building limited to the site.  The site is not a particularly big one.  It is long but it is not deep.  At best, all one could erect is a long, narrow building.  It is not an ideal site for a modern building. An architect will be hemmed in on every side.  I like modern buildings and I know that this site would not give an architect a real opportunity of showing his skill, the sort of opportunity he would have in the suburbs where he would have ample room to design a building of a shape and size sufficient to house ESB workers in the way that modern business demands.</P>
    <P>These are some of the objections. Another reason on what I call practical grounds is that those houses could be turned into flats and certainly could be made pay.  The ESB are certainly not short of capital and they could very easily maintain the old facade and transform the whole building at the back into flats, and make money from them in the process.  The ideal solution would be to erect a building, perfectly designed, outside Dublin and which would not, as Deputy Dunne pointed out, add to the congestion in the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>Those are the aesthetic, practical grounds.  The argument in regard to tourist attraction&mdash;the last one I come to&mdash;is that Dublin is quite unique as an 18th century city.  It attracts people who come here not because they want to see our modern buildings but because they want to see our older and 18th century buildings.  If we leave ourselves with none of these buildings, we may find that our tourist trade will be hit very much.  Mark you, the face of Dublin is going to change very much <Col N="152" /> inside the next five to ten years. Already we can see around the Christ Church Cathedral area that the houses are coming down very rapidly.  None of the people who objected on aesthetic grounds to the demolition of the Fitzwilliam Street houses objected to the demolition of houses which is taking place around Christ Church Place, roughly in an area on the south bank of the Liffey.  Nobody objected because those buildings have long ceased to live their lives and many of them are dangerous.</P>
    <P>I should like both the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Local Government to realise and to remember that Dublin Corporation will rapidly be altering the appearance of Dublin and old areas will become very precious to us.  Inevitably Dublin will be altered out of all recognition by the eradication of rat-infested areas and slum areas.  All those areas have to go.  Some of them indeed were once as beautiful as and perhaps more beautiful than Fitzwilliam Street but there is no hope of saving them and it would not be practicable to save them.  However, it is practicable to save these houses in Lower Fitzwilliam Street and they will become doubly precious to us because at the end of this demolition period, we will have only very small areas of the Dublin which we knew and admired so much in the past.</P>
    <P>So much for the south side.  On the north side of the city, I would remind the House that one of the great estates is falling to Dublin Corporation and in three or four years, Dublin Corporation will be the owners of a great deal of property on the north side of the Liffey, roughly between Capel Street and O'Connell Street.  It is a vast area and a great deal of it consists of a very poor type of property.  All of that property will have to come down and modern buildings will go up so that our architects will have ample scope for their designs, without having to turn to an area which could be preserved, and indeed should be preserved from many points of view.</P>
    <P>When speaking about the ESB Deputy Dunne referred to Dublin Corporation <Col N="153" /> and, very rightly, to the City Architect who, after all, is the chief architect for the whole of the Corporation. As far as we can judge, he was against the demolition of these houses on aesthetic and, perhaps, practical grounds.  The Town Planning Section of Dublin Corporation was also against it.  A tremendous amount of feeling was engendered and the ESB, who are a semi-State body, who have enjoyed a great deal of help, and indeed were founded by the State and owe their whole being to various Acts which this House has enacted both in the matter of finance and of giving it power to provide light and heat as cheaply as possible for the citizens of the country&mdash;and they are certainly doing a very fine job even though we may complain about the prices we have to pay, as we complain about coal and gas or anything else&mdash;were not given their powers in order to demolish buildings which in the opinion of many people should be maintained.</P>
    <P>When I say &ldquo;many people&rdquo;, the fact is that you will find very few people among the artistic or literary sections in Dublin&mdash;in other words, among people who value the beauty of Dublin&mdash;who do not feel strongly on this question of maintaining the past and maintaining beauty.  I do not for a moment mean that the proposed building would not in itself be a good building but certainly it could not be a building which would fit in with its surroundings.  No matter how it was designed, it would only at best be a sort of fake 18th century building, or if it were not that, it would blatantly be a new building in a setting of 18th century houses and therefore would be bound to be somewhat incongruous. I see that the Taoiseach has come in now and I trust he is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I was endeavouring to point out the serious consequences this section will have for the owners of land and the agricultural community generally.  I pointed out that Deputy Sweetman referred to certain aspects of this section but the Minister in his reply completely ignored them.  The Minister and Fianna Fáil seem to be using this section as an excuse for the introduction of the entire Bill.  We are told there is a great problem of congestion, that it cannot be solved without the passing of this Bill and that the main provision of the Bill is section 13, to which this Party strongly object on principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In days gone by, landlords held sway over the land of this country and, <Col N="155" /> through the efforts and leadership of such men as Davitt, Parnell, Dillon and others, the right of ownership of land for the farmers of Ireland was secured.  My objection to this section is that it takes away the right these men won.  I ask the Minister, and I address the same query to any Deputy: what is the difference between the landlords and the head landlord now to be established under the title of Minister for Lands?  This section is establishing the Minister as head landlord of this country.  While we had good landlords, we also had bad landlords.  It has been said that if there were good Lord Lucans, there were very bad Lord Lucans.  If we had good Ministers for Lands we may have bad Ministers for Lands, who may abuse section 13.  The great danger is the use of section 13 coupled with section 27.  Under section 27 the Minister will have the right to cause an inspection.  Used along with section 13, this means that any Minister for Lands who desires to do so may avail of this section for Party and political purposes, may put the hand of fear on his neighbours and intimidate them at election time or at any other time.</P>
    <P>The Minister may order his inspector to stand on a man's lands whereupon, if the farmer is thinking of disposing of them, they at once fall in value. Every auctioneer knows that the moment an inspector walks out on to a farm, it is the general opinion for ten miles around that that farm will be divided.  No man anxious to live in friendship with his neighbours will purchase that farm if it is inspected by the Land Commission.  There is clear evidence in the Land Commission that the moment an inspection takes place, unless the Land Commission buy at their own price, whether it is the full market price or otherwise, there is no hope of any private purchaser and the farm falls in value overnight.</P>
    <P>It has happened that, as a result of Land Commission inspection, there has been no other purchaser and the owner has been compelled to sell to the Land Commission.  If the Minister so desires, he can use this section as blackmail <Col N="156" /> against his political opponents.  It is a dangerous power for the House to invest in any Minister, no matter to which Party he belongs.  The big danger is the abuse of this section, and knowing Fianna Fáil as I know them over the years, I do not trust them on section 13.  Anyone familiar with their record in relation to land acquisition and division and the manner in which certain people have been intimidated over the years cannot possibly trust them with section 13.</P>
    <P>Earlier today we heard the Minister make a most apologetic speech, contrary to every speech he made on this Bill in relation to the purchase of land by non-nationals and aliens.  Recently, when Deputy Hogan had an amendment down asking that the Land Commission control the purchase of land by non-nationals and aliens and a little over 12 months ago when Deputy Dillon introduced a Private Member's Bill asking that a register of aliens be kept and that the Land Commission keep an eye on the purchase of land by non-nationals and aliens, the Minister said it was not a very serious problem and that the only lands purchased by them were lands we were glad to see go, lands that nobody else would purchase.  In addition, we were told that Fine Gael and the Labour Party were giving an exaggerated picture of the position.  The Minister held those views strongly even on the last day the House met.  But now he tells us the Government have come to the conclusion that there is a serious problem.  They must have decided that since the last day the House met.</P>

      <P>Last week the Minister for Agriculture went down to Loughrea and announced what the Government were going to do about this matter, but there was not a word from the Minister for Lands.  He made no speech on the Land Bill since the last day the House met.  This is a matter which calls for close inquiry. I have here a cutting from the <i>Irish Independent,</i> page 8, column 7, of New Year's Day, 1964.  The heading is <Col N="157" />&ldquo;Curbing Land Sale to Aliens&rdquo;.  I quote :</P>
      <P>A Bill which would shortly be introduced would, it was hoped, defeat misuse of land division and would have a definite effect in preventing foreigners from buying up vast tracts of Irish land&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Says who?</P>
      <P>&mdash;said Mr. Childers, Minister for Transport and Power, at a meeting of the National Farmers' Association in Castleblayney.</P>
      <P>A special register on vacated farms was being compiled by the Land Commission, he added.</P>
      <P>The Minister was accompanied by Mr. P. Mooney, T.D, and Senator J.J. Brennan.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Agriculture seem to know more about what is going on in the Land Commission, and in land legislation, than the Minister for Lands who is responsible to this House for them.  We are told that the Government have decided at long last that the purchase of land by aliens is a serious matter and a grave problem&mdash;</P>

      <P>Again on section 13, the Minister comes here tonight and endeavours to convey to the House that the NFA are in agreement with him in relation to section 13, and proceeds to quote from a letter which was recently addressed to him by the NFA.  I presume I have the same letter as the letter from which the Minister was quoting, and if I have he left out certain portions to suit his own purposes, because the NFA do not agree with section 13 of this Bill. Because of the fact that the Minister is on record as having quoted what the NFA wrote to him conveying to the House that they were in agreement with section 13, I want to point out what the NFA gave as their considered opinion from 27 Earlsfort Terrace. The heading is &ldquo;Observations of National Council on Land Bill, 1963&rdquo; and it is dated October, 1964.  They state:</P>
      <P>Section 13 prohibits any sale, transfer, letting or subletting (except by consent of the Land Commission) of land in respect of which the Land Commission has instituted or propose to institute proceedings for acquisition or resumption.</P>
      <P>Where proceedings have been instituted, the control period runs until the termination of these proceedings. Where notice of inspection with a view to possible acquisition has been served, the control period runs for one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regard as a drastic interference with the rights of ownership the proposal that by simply serving a notice of inspection, a Land Commission officer of Senior Inspector or higher rank, can &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; all dealings in a holding for one year.  We appreciate the necessity of empowering the Land Commission to take prompt and effective action in certain circumstances but we consider the Land Commission prohibition under this section, of transfer, letting and sub-letting should be limited to one month.  Sales of land should not be prohibited but instead <Col N="159" /> should be dealt with in the following manner.</P>
    <P>Mark this: They make it very clear that sales of land should not be prohibited and then the Minister tries to convey to us that the NFA are in agreement with him on section 13. They go on to recommend:</P>
    <P>(a)  Before any sale of land could be completed the Land Commission would have to be given an opportunity of buying the land at a price not less than that agreed in the draft contract of sale.  It is important that payment be made in cash for land purchased by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>(b)  If the Land Commission does not buy within one month, the original deal would go through.</P>
    <P>(c)  If the Land Commission buys, the land should be distributed speedily in accordance with the following set of priorities:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to make the existing uneconomic holdings of Irish farmers into viable units;</P>
    <P>(ii)  to provide viable holdings for Irish farmers willing to give up their existing holdings in congested areas;</P>
    <P>(iii)  to provide viable holdings for suitably qualified Irishmen who are at present landless.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael subscribe very generously to that important recommendation. Those are the recommendations which have been made in connection with this section.  They go on to say :</P>
    <P>Since section 13 as drafted appears to provide the means of controlling the sale of land to non-nationals, we feel that any further sales of land to non-nationals for agricultural purposes ... should be specifically prohibited in the Bill.</P>
    <P>That is the considered opinion of the NFA in relation to this section.  My reading of it is that on the whole they object to the provisions of section 13, and that no matter what line the Minister may take to suit himself, it is the general considered opinion of the <Col N="160" /> National Council that it is an undesirable section.  Whether the Minister is in the section of the Government that is for the Bill, or the section of the Government that is against the Bill, I do not know, but it should be made clear that this provision has been hatched by Fianna Fáil for their own purpose, and whether it is the purpose of blackmailing people to contribute generously to the funds, or for their votes, it is ill-conceived and ill-advised and it will have very evil consequences. That is why we are so bitterly opposed to any Minister getting the powers which this section would give.</P>
    <P>For the record I want to repeat what I said before the Summer Recess in order to give an assurance to the landowners of this country in regard to the chains of section 13 which will bind them very severely if this section is passed in its present form&mdash;and this assurance was also given by the Leader of the Opposition.  As soon as a change of Government takes place after the next general election we will loosen those chains.  This ill-conceived and ill-advised section will be suitably amended.  We guarantee to the landowners that in the future they will enjoy, as they now enjoy before the provisions of this Bill are passed, the right of free sale, fair rent and fixity of tenure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there might be any misunderstanding, I do not propose to deal with the provisions of section 27 until the House comes to section 27.  There is nothing else I have to say except this: It has been alleged that there is something extraordinary in any member of the Government making an announcement about any matter except that concerning his own particular Department.  It would appear that Deputy O. J. Flanagan has never heard of the constitutional rule about collective responsibility. What, in fact, the Minister for Agriculture said in this connection is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure you have all heard references made from time to time about the amount of land being bought by foreigners.  I want to let <Col N="161" /> you know that the Government have recently reviewed the general position and that they have come to the conclusion that it is now advisable to introduce tighter control over these transactions.  We have taken this decision calmly, after careful examination of all the facts, and without regard to the often misleading statements which were sometimes made about this subject.</P>
    <P>We have been maintaining a close watch on the number and size of agricultural properties purchased by non-nationals and the total amount involved.  The Minister for Lands has periodically reported to the Government on the position and it was always our intention that, if ever it appeared that the 25 per cent special stamp duty was inadequate as a protective device, we would adopt more stringent measures.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to suggest that there has been any widespread evasion of the existing heavy stamp duty or that any large areas of land have been sold to non-nationals. There is some reason to think, however, that a few Irishmen have found ways to facilitate the purchase of farms by non-nationals, using legal subterfuges which enabled the purchasers to evade the special duty. In short, loopholes have been found &mdash;and we have decided that they must be closed before any general harm is done.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions I informed the House that this subject was kept under very close scrutiny and that should it appear to the Government at any time that other action was necessary such action would be taken &mdash;and that is exactly what has happened.  While, as I have said earlier on this section, we have heard vague rumours as to devices being adopted to evade the existing law under the Finance Act, we have no proof of it.  Neither I nor my colleagues have any proof of it.  I invited members of the House to let me know of any particular case where it was suspected that the law was being evaded but we have had no response <Col N="162" /> from any member of the House in that connection.</P>
    <P>At all events, this suggestion that control would be effected in this way on sales to non-nationals has come through different bodies including the National Farmers Association.  It has been suggested that the Land Commission are the proper body to deal with this matter rather than the Revenue Commissioners as is the position under the Finance Act.  There is substance in that suggestion.  I think the Land Commission are probably better geared to find out than are the Revenue Commissioners whether much land would be concerned in transactions of this kind and they are in a better position to ascertain whether the law is being broken or evaded.</P>
    <P>I think there have been certain administrative objections by the Department of Finance in trying to deal with this problem in the way that was provided under the Finance Act.  I feel that this provision in the Land Bill will be a more effective method of dealing with any alleged abuses.  That does not mean to say that we have evidence that there is any widespread evasion of the law or that there are the abuses that have been suggested loosely from time to time by different people speaking on this problem.</P>
    <P>As far as section 13 is concerned, I repeat that this Bill would be completely ineffective without it.  It is essential so as to enable the Land Commission to make an impact on the relief of congestion.  I agree that the National Farmers Association have stated that they are opposed to the section.  What I did quote from their letter was their appreciation of the necessity to empower the Land Commission to take prompt and effective action in certain circumstances.  How these people who are concerned with the relief of congestion suggest that the Land Commission can effectively deal with the problem without some such powers as these is beyond my comprehension. It is very easy to talk about fixity of tenure and free sale, and at the same time, to suggest that the Land Commission can get land and deal with the congestion problem but it does not make sense to me.  We have seen <Col N="163" /> holdings being sold in these congested counties, week in and week out, that should have come into the hands of the Land Commission but, due to the deficiency in the legal machinery of the Land Commission, they have been unable to take action in time.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, before this Bill was introduced, the Land Commission could take land for the relief of congestion, where there was congestion in the immediate vicinity of that land and irrespective of how that land was used or worked.  That power was already there.  It is, therefore, not correct to state that every landowner is quite free to sell his land to whomsoever he wishes.  This other power was there, for the Land Commission to take land in a congested area, before ever this Bill was brought in.  I suggest to Deputies who are concerned with this problem that this section is essential to the Bill and that the Bill would be unworkable without it.  I therefore ask the House to accept it as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>If one listened to the Minister in the past ten minutes, and had no knowledge of the fact that there is within the ambit of the Land Commission a pool of land which they have been letting year after year, one could readily understand his reference to the urgency attached to embracing thousands more of holdings in the country so that he would meet the demand upon him to divide land.  If the situation was reached that the land which was already in the possession of the Land Commission and which was being let year after year has been disposed of, then one could understand, although not agree with, the drastic measures proposed in this Bill.  Surely it blows the Minister's case sky high when one realises the fact that he has in his Department land that has been let for a period as long as ten years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not true that the Land Commission have been letting lands which they acquired a decade ago and are still letting them?  What explanation can be offered by the Minister for this?  What would he regard as an <Col N="164" /> ordinary time within which the land should be redistributed?  Would he regard two or three or four years as normal?  Or does he think, in a situation such as this, five or six or up to ten years would be involved?  Do we not all know how many auctioneers are registered by the Department of Lands for the purpose of letting lands in the possession of the Land Commission year after year?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred a few moments ago to the difficulty encountered on the legal side: there are no legal difficulties in regard to the lands.  All the legal aspects have been resolved and, therefore, the Minister's reasons are not sustained for a moment that it is necessary in this measure to destroy what was won, God knows with what loss of life and limb, by our forebears in securing fixity of tenure for people living on the land.  He must provide this House and the country with extraordinary reasons before he can get people to accept from him that it is either necessary or desirable to accept this section of the Bill giving such extraordinary powers.  I suggest the Minister might at this stage explain what is preventing the Land Commission from redistributing the land already in their possession and which they are letting over such long periods, if that situation exists.</P>

Every auctioneer and everybody associated with them is now organising against the Bill.  A certain section of newspapermen carries on the same kind of propaganda but I see no reason why the Minister should be dictated to by newspapermen, some of whom do not know their own religion but who have the audacity to dictate to us and to the Minister.  If the Minister does not now take the steps he has decided to take and which are badly needed, somebody else will have to take the same steps when it is too late. I do not intend to hold up the House for many minutes but some steps must be taken to ensure that in the near <Col N="165" /> future there should be an equitable distribution of the land of this country. Such steps are overdue and I ask the Minister to make it quite clear to the House now that he is not going to be dictated to by minions of the newspapers or by political eunuchs of the main Opposition Party here.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I approach this section in a slightly different way from that of my colleagues.  Knowing the history of Fianna Fáil, it reminds me of my youth.  In Longford, some 60 or 70 years ago, we had a famous election known as the Martyn-Greville election. Greville was the landlord and he demanded that every one of his tenants should vote for him and anybody who voted against him&mdash;unfortunately at that time there was open voting: a man had to put up his hand in the market square to say how he was voting&mdash; had his notice to quit the next day. I fear that this power being taken into the hands of an Executive that has been fairly ruthless in their threats&mdash; they did not always carry them out because unfortunately people gave way to their wishes&mdash;is a menace likely to recreate the Greville situation of 70 or 80 years ago.</P>
      <P>I have a clear knowledge of one farmer who, not wishing to lose his land at that time decided to lie in bed and be &ldquo;sick&rdquo;.  He was made to get up and when he was in Granard and asked to whom he was giving his vote, he said he was voting for honest John Martyn.  He was nearly killed for saying so and next day he got notice to quit and his farm was divided into three parts, like all Gaul, and in that area from that day to this there are three congested holdings.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon, Sir; I shall listen to the Chair. Before any sale of land can be completed and when the land has been inspected or notice of intention to inspect is served, it can neither be set. let nor put up for sale, nor, in my opinion, bequeathed by the farmer.  I think that this fits in with the whole system being thought out at the moment by the Government.  Why, I do not know, unless it is for the reasons I am trying to adduce.  I assert that if there is a proper, affiliated branch of Fianna Fáil in the area and a man is a member of it, he will have no difficulty whatever in bequeathing, selling, letting or subletting his holding.  That is why I respectfully submit I am in order in drawing attention to this particular aspect of the affair as I see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met representatives of the farmers' association, not at my request, but at theirs.  They were amazed that any one of us would even for a second consider agreeing to section 13.  When I see what the national body has produced I must say it is very mild compared with what they said to me.  I wish to goodness they would have the courage to use the same language to the Minister as they used to me.  Apparently they think that this is a gentle way of impressing the Minister.  It is quite clear that the Minister is not impressed because he considers that the Bill would be more effective with this section, although the next moment he <Col N="167" /> admits that the Land Commission have power to acquire land, no matter where it is and no matter who owns it, provided it is for the relief of congestion and there is congestion in the area.</P>
    <P>What constitutes an area?  Dear knows, the country is small enough. The whole country from Cork to Donegal and from Mayo to Dublin is an area, and that is all it is.  There may be some legal interpretation of the word &ldquo;area&rdquo; but I doubt it very much. Therefore, the Land Commission have statutory power to acquire land but there are certain obligations on them when they do so.  They must either give an alternative or provide ample compensation.  Surely that is just.  If it is going to be argued that land can be taken at a knock-down price where is the equity in that?  I should like any Fianna Fáil farmer Deputy listening to me to consider for a moment if he were in our position if we brought in a Bill such as this.  I respectfully suggest that the Fianna Fáil farmer Deputies would rake the House and that they would not in any circumstances allow us to put such a measure through.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission, when they serve notice, can freeze land under this section.  I know there have been occasions on which the Land Commission did serve the notice to inspect and did inspect.  The Minister for Transport and Power, when he was Minister for Lands, knows one of the cases I have in mind in which a 300 acre farm was inspected.  Then there was the agitation for its division and I mentioned it here some years ago, but it was not divided.  There was no buyer for it because the Land Commission had served notice of intention to inspect.  I want to assert here and now that a very prominent Fianna Fáil supporter in the area bought that farm for a song and he has it ever since.  There was no notice of intention to inspect from that day to this.</P>
    <P>There was another farm of land where notice of intention to inspect was served.  There was nobody to buy it.  The late Deputy Victory and myself attended a meeting to urge the Land Commission to acquire it.  When <Col N="168" /> I went there I was greeted with the remark that they did not expect I would attend.  I said it was the first Fianna Fáil group meeting I ever attended but then I had pleasure in attending it.  They had the list made out as to who was to get the land. There was no buyer for the land. That family could not sell it.  No matter what effort was made nobody would buy it.  Again, after a short time, the secretary of the Fianna Fáil group bought the farm.  There was no intention to inspect it.</P>
    <P>This constitutes a threat to the lives of the people of the country. It is something I would appeal to the Minister, and appeal to the Government, as an ordinary plain Deputy, to think twice about before they go on with these provisions. Never mind the National Farmers Association.  Never mind the auctioneer nor the pressmen.  That does not arise.  The only question that arises is whether it is fair or equitable to any farmer?  Let any one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies sitting opposite me who has a farm of land which he wants to sell, consider whether it is mean because a Fine Gael or Labour member has agreed that if he applies to the Land Commission to have it inspected the Land Commission can send out notice of intention to inspect it.  Is it fair that the Fianna Fáil farmer would be held up for 12 months?  I do not care how bad a Fianna Fáil fellow he was.  There are decent men there as well as anywhere else but that temptation should not be put in the way and the ill-will and the bad practice of the Martyn-Greville election will be repeated every time this section is operated&mdash;not perhaps every time but in a great number of cases.  Therefore, before the Government proceeds with this, I would ask the Minister to reconsider it and withdraw section 13 altogether and recommit it with the reduction of the period, if it has to be inspected, to one month, which is a reasonable time. Then if it was for sale after the Land Commission failed to purchase it at the contract price, or if they did not do it within one month then the person selling the land is entitled to sell it freely.</P>

In so far as the distribution of acquired land by the Land Commission in my constituency is concerned I have found it fair.  I should like to put that on record.  I also know that at the moment there are suggestions abroad that there is political influence in what has come up.  I hope it is not true that political influence overrides the decisions of the local Land Commission officers, whether they be in Mayo, Leitrim, Sligo or anywhere else.  That idea is gaining ground.  I do not believe in it. It is not correct in my county.  I have not seen it since I became a member of this House and I hope it is not true and will not be true, in so far as my county in concerned anyway.

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister is very anxious to push this section through with a view to dealing with congestion.  Deputy O'Sullivan has mentioned the question of large pools of land lying in the hands of the Land Commission for many years.  If my memory is correct, it was a colleague of the Minister, Deputy Seán Flanagan, who mentioned land being in the hands of the Land Commission for a period of 30 years. It is strange now that the same Deputy who asked originally about that on the Estimate now comes along and is most eager to ask for more land for the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister be able to give us any information as to how <Col N="170" /> much abuse actually arises.  He mentioned &ldquo;jumping the gun&rdquo;.  I should imagine that where landowners try to forestall the Land Commission as regards sales, it would be impossible by private sale.  Has the Minister any figures in the Department of the amount of land sold here by public auction and the amount sold by private treaty?  If an extensive racket is going on&mdash;if I may use the word&mdash; to sidetrack the Land Commission, surely we should have some figures available to us to show how often this has occurred and what acreage of land has been affected by this method of private treaty sales which we gather from the Minister, seems to be pretty widespread through the country.  So far, he has given us no indication as to the amount of land transferred by that means.</P>
    <P>Have the Land Commission any figures available to show whether we were stopped acquiring ten per cent of the land sold in this country by some manoeuvre in the past 12 months, by private treaty sales or otherwise.  If such figures are available, I would like the Minister to give them to us, to give us some indication as to whether the Land Commission are really being by-passed to such a degree as to make their work in the field of land division less effective than it would be when this Bill is passed. The Minister tells us that there has been, as far as he knows, widespread evasion of the 25 per cent duty on purchase of land by aliens.  There has been considerable difference of opinion on the question in this House on the amount of land purchased by aliens. The figures given by the Minister, under legislation which he set up a few years ago, do not tally at all with those submitted by other organisations, particularly the NFA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I maintain that this question of the evasion of the 25 per cent duty is really a very small matter.  To most of those people buying land here, <Col N="171" /> 25 per cent duty means very little. I submitted an amendment before the Summer Recess in which I asked the Minister to make provision that where an alien bought land, the purchase should not be sanctioned without the prior consent of the Land Commission. The Minister completely derided the suggestion.  It was wrongly drafted according to him.  I am not a lawyer, of course, and the Minister is.  It was wrongly drafted and he was perturbed at the interference it would entail between a solicitor and his client.</P>
      <P>Now I find in the newspapers a couple of days ago the new Minister for Agriculture has practically adopted that suggestion and has told us that the necessary legal enactments will be introduced shortly to carry out in essence the suggestion I made at that time.  It is extraordinary how his colleague changed the Minister's mind. The Minister has not done anything about it yet but apparently he will tell us the details later on.  He has told us also that he does not want us to discuss section 27 at this stage.  Whether it is discussed with section 13 or not, all of us must correlate these two sections in our minds.  I would suggest to all Deputies that when they read section 13, they should also read section 27, as they hang together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been amazed at the silence of Deputies on the far side of the House all through the discussion on this Bill.  So far as I can recall, only two Fianna Fáil members have spoken on it.  One was Deputy Burke who is an innocent man and probably does not know much about land at all.  The other is the Minister's colleague, Deputy Seán Flanagan from Ballyhaunis, who is a very active and energetic solicitor and has been dealing substantially in a professional capacity with sales, division and buying and selling of land all his life.  I am very taken aback by the fact that, apart from these two, there have been no speeches whatever from the rural Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Rural Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party have spoken outside this House on this Bill.  I was present when a member of the Party opposite <Col N="172" /> stood up and, thinking it would be a palatable thing to say, admitted he was opposed to certain sections of the Bill.  Of course the Deputy will be as silent as a mouse in this House.  I would ask the Minister to allow an open vote on certain sections of the Bill.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> It is a specific section and I am asking the Minister to do a specific thing with it&mdash;put it to an open vote.  Certain sections in this important Bill should not be made narrow Party issues.  They affect everybody.  They affect Deputies over there as well as here.  If Deputies on the Government benches were allowed to express themselves openly, without a Party Whip being imposed on them, I am quite certain many of them would express agreement with our attitude to many sections, including section 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish also to appeal to the Minister to reconsider the provisions in this section 13.  The Minister has probably seen the wisdom of not taking up too rigid an attitude in regard to matters such as this.  I am sure he does not regard the announcement made by the Minister for Agriculture the other day as a surrender on his part but rather as meeting a point of view put forward seriously and, when considered by the Government, found to have considerable merit.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that his approach to this section might be on the same lines.  It is undoubtedly true that one of the most treasured possessions of anyone, particularly in an agricultural country&mdash;and the good Lord did make this an agricultural country, whether we like to admit it or not&mdash;is the right to own land and by the right to own land, I mean the right to full ownership of that land.  It is a natural right.  It is a right which presupposes the right of free sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not need any reminding, nor does any Deputy, of the <Col N="173" /> fight waged in this country in days gone by to secure for our people the right of free sale as one of the three F's.  The right of free sale is now challenged in a very definite manner by the Minister and the Government in the Bill we are considering.  One of the sections which throws out the strongest challenge to the right of full ownership and of free sale is section 13.</P>
    <P>Many arguments have been advanced as to why the Minister should not continue to travel along the lines he has set himself in this section.  If he were to sit down seriously to consider these arguments as genuine and constructive and not in the light of regarding them as political arguments, he would find there is very considerable merit in them.  The arguments advanced from these benches represent the views of this Party and the views of those who sent the Deputies of this Party to the House to represent their wishes.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, and must be evident to the Minister as well as to the Deputies sitting behind him who represent rural constituencies, that quite apart from the members of the Fine Gael Party, there is a large volume of opinion, not political opinion, in the country which expresses the gravest doubts and fears with regard to the measures the Minister proposes, particularly in sections 12 and 13 of this Bill.  I am quite sure those views have been made known to the Minister and to the Deputies sitting behind him.</P>
    <P>The views of which I am now speaking are not those of a political Party but of people concerned for the welfare of this country and of the individuals in it.  If he persists in insisting that section 13 of the Bill will be carried by a guillotine vote in this House, by a counting of heads, by the exercise of the Party Whip, the Minister will certainly not be doing justice or a good day's work for the people of this country, even for those on whose behalf he speaks&mdash;the people who require genuinely a division of land in order to put themselves on some kind of economic basis.</P>
    <P>One of the fears held in connection <Col N="174" /> with this section&mdash;I should not like the Minister to misunderstand me: I am not referring to him personally or to anyone in any personal way because it could be true to-day, tomorrow or right down through the years&mdash;is on the danger of abuse, that if the section as it stands is passed into law, it is open to the very gravest of abuses.  It is open to political abuse and to what I might call private abuse arising out of greed or envy in any locality.  I am quite sure the Minister does not intend that the section should operate in that way but he is here inviting the House to lay the groundwork which would set up the machinery to open the measure to abuses of the gravest sort. We must remember that the Minister, his political Party or this political Party will not live forever: others will take our places on all benches in this House and we do not know what kind of inheritance we shall leave them if we open the door to the types of abuse that could become rampant if this section becomes law.</P>
    <P>On the score of political abuse, the danger is that if this section becomes law and if it rests consequently with the Minister to press the button and decide what land will be subject to inspection and what land will not, it is straight away quite clear there will be a political temptation and that political abuse may follow if a future Minister is not strong enough to resist the temptation in the days to come.  Once the Minister gets this power, the owner's right of free sale is negatived, or is at least frozen for 12 months, by which time the market may have disappeared.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin pointed out how, even under existing legislation, that could happen.  How much more will that be the case when it is known&mdash; and this section has been the subject of public controversy for many months &mdash;that simply on the Minister pressing a button and ordering an inspection a person's ability not alone to sell his land but even to let or sublet it may be taken away from him for at least 12 months?  His whole income may go simply because the Minister decides on an inspection.  That is the type of <Col N="175" /> political abuse to which this section is open.</P>
    <P>No matter how worthy the motives are, is it worth the Minister's while to insist on pushing through the House a section that is open to that kind of abuse, a section that will be held by the people of this country in horror and dread, a section that has already aroused the fears of the people on whom ultimately all of us in this country depend, the working farmer of Ireland?  As I say, no matter how good the motives or the intentions of the Minister, I do not believe that it is worth while stirring up all the fears and opening the door to the type of abuse that may exist, as the Minister will be doing if he insists on pushing through this section.</P>
    <P>I would appeal very strongly to the Minister to have second thoughts about this.  I think the section is bad no matter how you look at it.  I do not think it would be properly remedying the position to reduce the period for which the land is frozen to six months or one month.  I think what the Minister should do is to scrap the section completely.  If he does that we can give him this undertaking that we will not regard it as a sign of weakness, that we will regard it as a sign of commonsense and of courage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can claim tonight to speak with some authority on this section and, indeed, other sections of the Land Bill because the Minister for Lands thought fit during the by-election in Roscommon to quote at length a speech I made in this House some time ago on the Land Bill.  He was quite justified in quoting my speech but I might tell the Minister that, while he quoted me accurately, I was rather surprised on arriving at a church gate in Roscommon one Sunday morning to hear some of his lieutenants who are not members of this House misconstrue what I said in this House in regard to the Land Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I preface my remarks tonight by saying that my mind is no more changed tonight than it was some months ago?  I said then in this House <Col N="176" /> that I approved of any Land Bill designed to do something to relieve the congestion that exists in my county and in other areas in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>When a Deputy is honest enough to make an honest approach to a real problem it is only fair that no individual or body of individuals in this House or outside it should use a rather unsuitable occasion to misconstrue the genuine, sincere views expressed by such a Deputy in this House.  I would go further and say that the Fine Gael Party in general approve of the Land Bill.  The Fine Gael Party in general realise the great need there is for the introduction of a Land Bill but at no time did I say that I would accept <i>in toto</i> the many implications of the various sections contained in this Bill.  As a Mayo man, I want to protest in the strongest terms possible to section 13.  Michael Davitt, a Mayo man, and the Land Leaguers struggled all their lives so that the three &ldquo;Fs&rdquo;&mdash;fair rent, free sale and fixity of tenure&mdash;might prevail for all landholders in future generations. Section 13 of this Bill, as I see it, takes away free sale.</P>
    <P>I have had considerable experience of dealing for the Land Commission in sales.  I have had considerable experience of dealing against the Land Commission in sales.  I have had considerable experience in dealing with the Land Commission in Land Commission courts.  I know for a fact that as a result of the policy advocated by the Land Commission for years with regard to compulsory acquisition of land, a bitter taste is left as a result of the section providing for compulsory acquisition.  That fact is known to everybody who has any knowledge of land.  In the years gone by more progress would have been made as between the Land Commission and the public in general were it not for the fact that compulsory acquisition left the people with the feeling that they were no longer secure in their own lands.</P>
    <P>My interpretation of what the Minister is asking us to enact is that if I own land and I feel that due to financial or other circumstances beyond my <Col N="177" /> control it is necessary to let portion of my lands or all of my lands I must first get the consent of the Land Commission to do that.  In fact, what I must do is publicly to acknowledge to the Land Commission that they should take notice of my lands for compulsory acquisition.  Before making the final decision as to whether or not their financial circumstances might compel them to dispose of their lands by public auction or private contract or in whatever form they considered most remunerative to themselves, owners must realise that under section 16 of this Bill they will be drawing the attention of the Land Commission to the fact that it may compulsorily acquire the land, in effect creating the risk that if they decide that it may be necessary to sell the farm in the following year they will not be entitled to free sale.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there are many sections in this Bill which I commend. The Ceann Comhairle&mdash;I always bow to his ruling&mdash;may not permit me to say this.  I know that one of the main problems the Land Commission will find in the operation of this Bill is in connection with land bonds.  In my capacity as an auctioneer I have at all times persuaded vendors who have entrusted me with their business to sell to whoever gives the best price, whether it be the Land Commission or an individual but I must say that to date I have failed to convince the public that the sale of their lands for payment in land bonds is satisfactory.  Within the past few months I have had the experience, not alone of one bank, but of two banks, refusing vendors who had entered into a contract with the Land Commission for the sale of their property&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir.  I shall avail of another opportunity. I should like to conclude by making an appeal to the Minister. Coming from the constituency of South Mayo and as a man who has had considerable experience of land sales in the west of Ireland, he must realise that section 13 is a prohibitive <Col N="178" /> section.  As Deputy O'Higgins rightly said, even at this eleventh hour if he changed his mind nobody would charge him with running away from the section or running away from the Bill in general.  They would appreciate that he was making an effort to get rid of an unsuitable section in a very necessary Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have tried to make it quite clear from this side of the House that we believe this section of the Land Bill should be totally rejected. We feel it is undesirable and unnecessary, that it represents a craving for more power over the lives and liberties of the people and that it puts a further weapon in the hands of politicians, a weapon of intimidation they should not hold.  In the course of this debate the Minister referred to the recommendations of the National Farmers Association.  I should like to hear from the Minister how far he is prepared to go with those recommendations. The National Farmers Association have expressed anxiety and disapproval in regard to the idea of putting into the hands of civil servants the right to inspect a holding and freeze it for 12 months.  They feel that the question of land acquisition should have been left with the Lay Commissioners and that this is an extremely dangerous provision.  They further suggest that the freeze for 12 months is completely unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he is prepared to bend this condition and that he would now feel it should be reduced to six months.  Could the Minister not agree to go that bit further to meet the wishes of rural organisations in general and the National Farmers Association in particular by reducing this period to one month?  Why does he feel it is not possible for the Land Commission to transact their business within that reasonable period?  Other purchasers of land have to make up their minds as soon as notice of the auction appears in the papers, or if a place comes up for sale by private treaty they also must make up their minds. They must provide the necessary money to purchase the land and make <Col N="179" /> arrangements about it within a reasonable time and certainly the place must change hands within a month.</P>
    <P>It is hard to see, with the machinery available to the Land Commission, why they cannot transact their business with similar speed.  It is definitely an interference with the rights of an owner of land if he cannot sell his land and get the money or the bulk of it into his pocket within a month.  It is also interference with his property, the property which he probably purchased with his own money and which he is not allowed to sell in the free market.</P>
    <P>We have insisted, and rightly insisted, that the only competition that should be eliminated is the competition brought about by the purchase of land in this country by foreigners.  We have in these benches been insisting for quite a considerable period that this competition should be eliminated, that the sale of land to foreigners should be ended for all time and that we should have legislation to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he is satisfied there was no widespread purchase of land.  I wish I could get the Minister into a car for two hours and I would cover some areas of land purchased by foreigners in Counties Dublin, Kildare and Meath, an area that would have provided economic holdings for many of our people. However, there is no anxiety or desire on the part of the Government to end this purchase of land by foreigners and so provide land that is badly needed by the Irish people but they are concerned to get the land they require by interfering seriously with the existing rights of landowners.  We will oppose this as long as it is possible to oppose it.  We will oppose it in the House and we will use every platform outside the House to inform the people that this should be opposed in every way possible.</P>

The Deputies who have been stating the contrary <Col N="180" /> either have misinformed themselves or are making these statements for their own purposes.  It is true the Land Commission inspector may inspect but he must report to the Commissioners and if action is to be taken for the acquisition of that land, it is the Commissioners who make that decision.</P>

      <P>When they serve the notice.  Those who say they are concerned with the relief of congestion, that they want to help the Land Commission in their plans and at the same time refuse to provide the necessary legal machinery for the acquisition of that land, are not just being candid with the people or with those in the House.</P>
      <P>Let me make it clear, in view of what Deputy MacEoin has said, that the Land Commission must pay full market value for any land they acquire, that landowners are entitled to full market value under the law as it exists, and that law and that right is not being interfered with in any way.  There was a time during which landowners did not have the right to market value.  The system of assessing what they should get was in a section that provided the price should be fair from the owner's point of view and fair from the Land Commission's point of view.  Therefore in those days landowners on many occasions did not get what was the then market value.  The law as it exists now is to the effect that they are entitled to market value and if they are dissatisfied with the offer made by the Land Commission, they have the right to go to the land court, to give evidence as to the market value of their land, and the judge fixes the market value for them.</P>

    <P>It is not correct to state, as has <Col N="181" /> been stated by some Deputies, that there is a large amount of land in the hands of the Land Commission for anything up to 30 years without being dealt with; there are some exceptional residues of land in the hands of the Land Commission because of some special difficulties.  The general rule is that the Land Commission deal with the land within a period of three years. I do not know that there is any other point that has not already been dealt with on a number of occasions either in the course of the discussion on this section or on the original amendments to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that the Minister is not himself aware of the fundamental principle underlying our opposition to this section.  I happen to know that the attitude which this Party have adopted to this section, and its implementation, is shared by certain Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I know that certain Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party themselves realise that to give the political head of the Department the power to direct an examination of land with a view to acquisition, which brings this section into operation, is wholly wrong.</P>
      <P>Now, we cannot discuss this section divorced from section 27 which gives the Minister the power to initiate inspection proceedings.  I know that certain experienced Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party themselves realise that such a proposal constitutes a revolutionary departure from the whole land code.  All Deputies who, personally or vicariously, have experience of the whole foundation of land tenure in this country know that the whole social pattern of rural Ireland is founded on the principle of fixity of tenure and it is for that reason that, at every stage of the country's history, from the time of the first Land Act back in 1881, the whole question of the acquisition of land was removed from the sphere of authority of the political head of any British or Irish Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we set up the State that now exists, it was universally recognised in Dáil Éireann, and has never been <Col N="182" /> challenged over 40 years by successive Governments&mdash;Cumann na nGaedheal, Fianna Fáil, inter-Party, Fianna Fáil, inter-Party and then Fianna Fáil again &mdash;until Deputy Moran, the present Minister for Lands, took office, that the question of acquiring land must be divorced from the political head of the Department of Lands.  The most extreme precautions were taken, even under the British administration, to establish the Land Commissioners in a quasi-judicial position so that their discretion could not be influenced by pressure brought to bear upon them from any quarter and so that they would be answerable to nobody for their decision on the merits as to whether land should be acquired or inspected with a view to acquisition.</P>
    <P>I have said repeatedly on public platforms throughout the country that the great danger of this Land Bill is that there are provisions in it which are excellent but, concealed behind those provisions, there are damnable principles which threaten the whole social pattern of rural Ireland.  The Minister will say in refutation of my argument that he is not claiming the right to determine whether any farmer's land should be acquired or not and he knows that that is the kind of specious plea which it is very difficult to counter when arguing with people who are not themselves steeped in the land code of this country.  Those of us who live in rural Ireland know perfectly well that the decision to inspect land with a view to acquisition was always a very formidable decision and the experience of the farmer, large or small, who was called upon to receive the Land Commission inspector, was one of considerable anxiety and distress.</P>
    <P>That anxiety is now being doubled, trebled and quadrupled by the proposed provision in section 13 which says that the moment the inspector enters on the land, all dealings in it are prohibited for a period of 12 months without the permission of the Land Commission.  You cannot convey it to your own son; you cannot make a lease of it; you cannot sell it to a neighbour; you cannot sell it to any purchaser.  Mark you, I think a <Col N="183" /> case could be made for that if the matter of inspection still remained a reserved function of the Land Commission, to be decided by the Commissioners, and utterly divorced from any influence which operates in politics; but that is no longer the case.  The owner of land now has to face not only the anxiety of inspection but all the obligations of section 13, plus the knowledge that the inspector is now being sent not by the Land Commissioners in their quasi-judicial capacity but by the political head of the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>We all read in the papers a few days ago a letter over the name of Deputy Cormac Breslin.  There was some proposal for some development plan on Arranmore Island and all the interested parties were meant to come together on Arranmore to promote this mutual interest.  A letter is published in the daily paper by the senior Fianna Fáil Deputy for west Donegal in which he says: &ldquo;Look; I cannot very well refuse to come to this but it would be much better if we started a parallel agitation through the Fianna Fáil cumann&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>He wanted to take over the baby into the Fianna Fáil cumann's hands.  My friend, Deputy Mooney, is over there and I suppose there is not a farm in the whole of Monaghan that Deputy Mooney has not divided and subdivided at some cumann meeting or other.  I freely admit that heretofore Deputy Mooney has only been in a position to say, when he summoned the cumann, that he would make representations to the Land Commission and he has only been in the position to go back to the cumann and say: &ldquo;I wrought wonderful.  I went to Deputy Moran and I begged him to have this land inspected, but the Minister told me that is a reserved function and he could not help me, but he would pass on my recommendation to the Land Commissioners but they are quite independent of him.&rdquo;  It was a complete alibi for Deputy Mooney to go back to the cumann and say: &ldquo;I was not able to get this land inspected. <Col N="184" /> I know the Minister passed on my recommendation but the Land Commission said no and he has no power to make them inspect it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to put this to Deputy Mooney as a reasonable man, and any other Deputy who knows rural Ireland.  He goes to a meeting of his local branch and they say: &ldquo;You should inspect so-and-so's land for acquisition&rdquo; and he says: &ldquo;Well, I do not know, that fellow is working the land&rdquo; or maybe it is a case of a widow who has young children growing up, and they say: &ldquo;If you are any good, you will have that land inspected.  We hear there is some fellow coming in to buy it and the auctioneer has it on his books.&rdquo; If these sections pass into law, can Deputy Mooney or any other Deputy say to his constituents: &ldquo;I will certainly make your views known to the Minister and I will ask him to pass them on to the Commissioners but he has no power to acquire land.&rdquo;  Will he not see himself, once this section and section 27 have been passed, in the position of saying: &ldquo;Well, now boys, I could not do that, I would not care to ask to have this widow's land inspected,&rdquo; and will they not say to him: &ldquo;What is the use of going out roaring and bawling for Fianna Fáil if you have not got that much pull with the Minister for Lands that you cannot get that place inspected?  What good are you?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What can Deputy Mooney say?  He must say one of two things.  He must either say: &ldquo;I think you are all wrong; you should not ask for that land to be inspected&rdquo;, or he can say &ldquo;I will go and see the Minister and ask him to have the land inspected.&rdquo;  Will he not find himself, if he goes back to his supporters in any particular district in Monaghan, up braided when he says: &ldquo;I went to the Minister and said that you all wanted this land inspected and I thought the land should be inspected and he told me that I could go and take a running jump at myself and that he would not send an inspector to inspect it.&rdquo;  I ask Deputy Mooney, who is an auctioneer, who is a farmer and who lives in rural Ireland, does he want that power?  Does he want to be put in the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> his own <Col N="185" /> neighbours, that he has either got to say: &ldquo;You are all wrong and I will not ask him, and although you all worked for me and supported me in this area, I will not ask&rdquo; or go to the Land Commission and be told by the Minister to take a running jump at himself, that he will not carry out an inspection although Deputy Mooney, representing his supporters in County Monaghan, has certified that his local supporters want it and he thinks it should be done?</P>
    <P>I put it to Deputy Mooney, to Deputy Millar, to Deputy Allen and to every Fianna Fáil Deputy on those benches: do they want this power?  Do they want to be put in the position of being torn to pieces by their own people?</P>

      <P>I know the meaning of fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale. I know the precautions that we and those who went before us took to preserve those things.  I know the meaning of fixity of tenure.  Fixity of tenure never meant in this country that in no circumstances could the Land Commission acquire land.  Fixity of tenure meant that anyone who owned land should not have it taken from him arbitrarily, at the whim of a landlord or a politician, but that a quasi-judicial body, holding their office by judicial tenure, irremovable except by a two-thirds majority of this House, would judge each case on its merits. We all have experience of submitting cases to the Land Commission.  We do it every day and we get the reply that the Land Commission have considered the matter and that they have <Col N="186" /> determined that there are certain circumstances surrounding that tenant purchaser's conditions which entitle him to a year or two years, or maybe five years, to see how he will turn out, before the Land Commission are prepared to consider compulsory acquisition.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to confuse this issue, to represent to the House that the Minister is seeking power to determine the question of acquisition in this Bill, because he is not.  The only power he is seeking is to send in the inspector for the purpose of making an inspection, and there is the danger of this.  Talk to the poor Minister for Agriculture from north-east Dublin and tell him that the Minister proposes to take this power and what does the poor fellow who lives up in Raheny know about it?  His inclination is to say: &ldquo;That is perfectly reasonable; what harm would that be? You could get corporation inspectors to inspect your house and what about it?&rdquo;  He does not understand.  How could it hurt the man in rural Ireland to have the inspector come in and inspect his land?  It always meant before that there was imminent danger of the Land Commission being persuaded compulsorily to acquire it.  It now means much more, that the day the arrangement is made for the land to be inspected, all dealings in that land are suspended and that there is a danger that your home will be taken away, but paramount, above all these dangers, is the knowledge that this is a procedure no longer ordained by people in a judicial position with a long and intimate history of dealing with land and supported by a body of permanent officials who understand all the delicacy of fixity of tenure and that all that that means is the very fabric of our society.  This power is now put into the hands of a politician.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proud to be a politician, proud to be the son of a politician and proud to be the grandson of a politician.  I do not want to appear to sound as if I looked upon being a politician as anything but the highest vocation, next to the priesthood, in the life of any man, but all of us in politics are aware of <Col N="187" /> the difficulties with which we have to contend as well as the magnitude of the job we undertake to do and we ought try to the limit of our ability to make ourselves independent of pressure which might betray us into doing an injustice to the individual under pressure that politically we are unable to withstand.</P>
    <P>I put it plainly to this House: there are three Deputies in Monaghan&mdash;and I do not think Deputy Mooney will misunderstand me if I put it this way&mdash; there are three seats in County Monaghan&mdash;Deputy Mooney has one, I have the other and the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, scrambled into the third.  Pressure is brought to bear on Deputy Mooney that he is to get so-and-so's land inspected. He is familiar with the whole background of that particular parcel of land and in his heart believes it is not just to inspect that parcel, that there is nothing concerned in that parcel of land which would ever justify the Land Commission compulsorily acquiring it, at this time in any case.  He says to his supporters: &ldquo;I do not think we ought to get that land inspected.  There is no justification for the Land Commission inspecting that land.  Go and ask the man would he care to sell it to the Land Commission.  If he would, I shall be glad to introduce him to the Land Commission and see if they can reach mutual agreement but compulsorily to acquire the land, no.&rdquo;  He finds himself confronted with the irrational, passionate agitation of his own supporters, who say: &ldquo;We have said we are going to ask Paddy Mooney about it and he will get the land inspected. Do you want to make us look foolish among our neighbours?&rdquo; He says: &ldquo;Do you want me to do what I think is not right?&rdquo;  They reply: &ldquo;Look, it is politically necessary to get that land inspected.  That fellow was out bawling for Dillon at the last election.  He has the biggest holding in that area and there are a lot of smallholders there.  Why not get it inspected? What harm will that do? If you put a blister on him for 12 months, he will keep his mouth shut <Col N="188" /> the next time.  Even if the Land Commission decide they do not want to take it, you will have taught him a lesson.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What can Deputy Mooney say? He has only two courses open to him. One is to say: &ldquo;No, I will not do it&rdquo;, and the alternative is to say: &ldquo;Very well; I represent you.  If that is what you think is right and proper to do, I shall see Deputy Moran, the Minister for Lands.&rdquo;  If Deputy Moran says &ldquo;No.  I will not inspect that land&rdquo;, Deputy Mooney has to come back to Monaghan and say &ldquo;I went to Deputy Moran and made this case to him but he kicked me out and told me he would not touch it.&rdquo;  I ask any reasonable Deputy on any side of the House: do you want to create such a situation in this country?</P>
    <P>I want to say most categorically&mdash; let us be clear as crystal on this&mdash; you may do it today, but we shall repeal it the moment we get the power to do so.  If I were Minister for Lands in the next Government, the first Bill I would bring in to this House is a Bill to divest myself of the power to order the inspection of my neighbours' land.  I am convinced that every experienced Deputy on the Fianna Fáil side who really understands the foundations of the whole rural economy of Ireland is in his heart opposed to this proposal.  It is such a useless proposal.  The justification advanced for it is that it will save time.  That is all.  My gracious me it has been truly said that democracy is the worst system of Government in the world, except all the others.  Look at what is going on. Here we are passing a simple piece of legislation.  There are weeks and weeks of discussion.  It is a slow, tedious, inefficient, difficult way to get laws passed; but it has this redeeming feature: it preserves every man's right to be free within the law.</P>
    <P>Of course, it takes more time to get lands inspected if the inspection can be done only on the orders of an utterly independent quasi-judicial body.  I admit that at once.  Of course, land acquisition can be expedited if the Minister has the right to direct inspection; but you can expedite it far <Col N="189" /> more if you give the Minister the right to determine acquisition.  Why have the whole paraphernalia of the Land Commission at all?  Why do you not wipe it out?  Why do you not do away with the whole system of the land courts? For the very simple reason that most of us here were born very close to the land and we know what fixity of tenure means.</P>
    <P>If you go down west of the Shannon, or into Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, Clare or Kerry, can you imagine the unfortunate Minister for Agriculture, who knows no more of rural Ireland than he has seen from the back of a horse hunting with the Ward Hounds, asking himself the question: why would they stay here on 20 acres in Monaghan, Cavan, Mayo, Galway or any other part of the west or south-west or Donegal?  Of course, they do not understand what it means to be born on the land, to have your home on the land, to belong to the land just as much as the land belongs to you. It does not occur to them.  They cannot understand that, even though the public good demands that that absolute right of the ownership of land must on occasion be abridged, such abridgement must be hedged around by every conceivable protection.  Just as before we send a man to jail in this country we give him the right of trial by jury &mdash;it is a most inefficient way of trying any man, but we found it preserves individual liberty&mdash;so in regard to fixity of tenure we have provided, in our wisdom, that no one should touch it or abridge it except those immune from pressure outside.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister for Lands: is it worth making himself responsible for something like this out of pure obstinacy?  What will he get out of it?  What benefit will he confer upon anybody?  Does he not know in his heart, whether he agrees with it or not, that there are a number of his colleagues in his own Party, quite apart from the members of this and other Parties, who feel, and feel deeply, that such limitations as these in section 13 are not to be set in motion by the initiative of the political head of the Department of Lands?</P>
    <P>That is the issue joined between us <Col N="190" /> here.  I put it to Deputies, on whatever side of the House they may sit: who positively believes in the necessity, apart from the desirability, of this grave abridgement of the fixity of tenure of every farmer in this country, large or small?  I warn you it is madness.  I warn you it cannot long obtain.  I promise solemnly the first opportunity I get it will be repealed and I put it to you that in the meantime bitter wrong may be done.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to remember this. We passed a Land Act in this House in 1933.  I saw a widow woman in comfortable circumstances but carrying a burden of debt left by her husband. But she had about 87 acres of land. She had a young family, none of them old enough to work on the land.  She was selling the land.  Those were the angry days of the early 30's and the machinery of the Land Act of 1933 was set in motion against her.  They compulsorily acquired her holding.  By the time they had discharged the annuity on that land, which was then the practice, I think the Land Commission gave her £18 11s. 7d. and put her on the road.  That was in West Tipperary or East Limerick.  The bitterness of those memories will remain in the hearts of many families who were treated in that way for generations.</P>
    <P>When we came into office, we prescribed that a farmer whose land was acquired should get the market value of the land.  I am quite prepared to make the case in the country at any time that 99 per cent of the old horror of compulsory land acquisition has vanished because the Land Commission are as good a buyer as anyone else.  They are required by law to give the market value of the land and the land judge is there set above them. If a tenant thinks the Land Commission are offering less than the value of his land, he has the right to go to a judge of the High Court and quite frequently the land judge says the Land Commission are offering too little and fixes a price.  The Land Commission then withdraw and say: &ldquo;We cannot afford it,&rdquo; and the man is confirmed in his ownership of the land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> I do not believe there is a Fianna Fáil Deputy who knows rural Ireland who wants to go back to the old evil of virtually confiscating a farmer's holding, which obtained from 1936 until the Land Act, which guaranteed a full market price.  It was done in anger and grave injustices were perpetrated as a result of the operation of that law.  That iniquitous proceeding was put to an end and everyone heaved a sigh of relief and was glad when that black period was over.  Why in heaven's name should we want to start another period of resentment, bitterness and hatred which will be precipitated in rural Ireland?</P>
    <P>I do not want to be put in the position when I go down to Chapelrock or Scotshouse in Monaghan of being put up against the wall by my constituents and told to ask the Minister for Lands to do something.  So long as I am in opposition, I have at least the alibi of saying: &ldquo;Deputy Moran will not do what I ask him to do.  The fact that I want it done will not commend it to his favourable consideration.&rdquo;  If we had an inter-Party Government and Deputy Blowick was Minister for Lands, I would be appalled at the situation in which I might find myself every time I went to Monaghan having to battle with my own constituents.  I have said a thousand times since I became a Deputy for Monaghan that everyone knows simple people who will come to you in rural Ireland and ask you to get them a bit of this or that holding.  I have always said: &ldquo;I am not able to do it; I cannot do it; but I can and will send in an application to the Land Commission and if I know the circumstances to be deserving, I will recommend them to the Land Commission for favourable consideration but I cannot acquire land and I cannot make the Land Commission acquire it.  When I was Minister for Agriculture, I could not do it nor could my colleague, Deputy Blowick, when he was Minister for Lands.&rdquo; Does any responsible Deputy want to change that position?</P>
    <P>Surely argument and reason have some place in our deliberations.  Has anyone in this House made the case <Col N="192" /> that it is a good thing that the political head of the Department of Lands should have power to inspect rather than the Land Commission.  Has anyone made that case?  I cannot understand how anyone could make that case.  I do not believe that Deputy Allen could make it and I do not believe Deputy Millar could make it. Deputy Allen comes from Wexford and may have heard of the evictions at Coolgreany from his father.  Deputy Millar may know of the evictions on the Clanrickarde estate which is not far from where he was born.  Deputy Mooney knows of the evictions near St. Mary's.  Does anyone want that ghost to be raised again?  Does anyone want again to create a situation in which the ownership of land could be abridged by the caprice of an individual? Do we not all infinitely prefer to stand firm on the principle that the acquisition of land should be the function of a quasi-judicial body, immune from outside pressure and irremovable except for the exceptional processes prescribed under the land code of this country?  I hope and pray that before this business is disposed of, we will have some evidence of understanding on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Recently we had a Succession Bill which we were told was the law of the Medes and Persians and the fruit of protracted reflection by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It has been blown away and most of it has gone down the drain.  We are not asking that the bulk of this Land Bill should go down the drain.  There are some quite good provisions in it.  What we want to remove are the bad parts and we would sooner do it now.  We shall certainly do it hereafter but in the meantime injustices may be done and rancour and ill-will may be precipitated and neighbour set against neighbour by its provisions.  I do not believe that Deputy Mooney wants it. I certainly do not want it in respect of the small farmers in Monaghan.  We both know in our hearts that such provisions can only create bad feeling and hatred in rural Ireland that neither he nor I wish to be part of.  I do not believe that the efficient working of the land code will be in the least undone <Col N="193" /> by the preservation of the principle that has been sacrosanct for 80 years&mdash; 40 years under the British Government and 40 years under four or five different Governments of our own election. If reason continues to have any force in this House, I put it to Deputies that we should change the provision the Minister has brought before us and if reason does not prevail now, it will hereafter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am compelled to come in here and speak against section 13 because of a few important happenings on a few Sundays.  In various parts of my constituency I have been approached by people I knew were my own supporters and also by people who were supporters of the Government and well-known supporters of the Government, mainly young hardworking farmers.  I am amazed at the enormous number of copies of the Bill which seem to be in circulation because a great many of these young men seem to have copies.</P>
      <P>In discussing this, I am compelled to ask the Minister this question.  Let us assume that the Minister will put this through.  If the Land Commission then serve notice on some people whose farm is in durance vile for a year, what will the position be?  There are many contrary people in this country.  The owners of the farm might decide to sell it to a neighbour.  If the neighbour goes into possession of the farm before the year is out, what steps will the Minister take against him?  It was put to me that if the man joined a Fianna Fáil cumann nothing further would happen about it.  It has happened before and happened in many cases where the Land Commission had proceedings to take over land that the unfortunate people who owned it were in the position that nobody would buy from them when it became known, to use the local idiom, that the Land Commission were &ldquo;about the place&rdquo;. It has been put to me, however, that when some officer of the Fianna Fáil Party buys such a farm there are many cases on record that there were no more inspections that nothing else ever happened and that they were left on the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> If the neighbour were the type of man who preferred to act according to his conscience and was not prepared to offer subservience to a cumann and bought one of these farms, what proceedings would the Land Commission take?  I should like to ask the Minister that question.  What would the Land Commission do?  Would they or the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are listening to me evict him?  Are they prepared to walk up these steps and give the Minister the power to send the crowbar brigade again on the road? I have been speaking to many members of Fianna Fáil about this.  Such is the discipline of the Fianna Fáil Party that none of them has answered me yet.  I often wonder when it will come to pass that some great heart will get up and say what is in his mind and will not sit there, grinning maybe or laughing.</P>
    <P>I am old enough to remember people being forcibly put out of their places.  I am old enough to remember bailiffs going around and putting people out.  I am old enough to remember escorts bringing what I would call now the successors of the yeomen, the Broy Harriers, into farmers' places to take possession of a farmer's chattels. Is this the kind of power the Land Commission are looking for now?  I know that in the hard, official way of looking at things, many farms are not run as well as some of the experts and maybe some of the crackpots would like them to be run.  Such farms would belong to old people or to poor people. But these farms were where generations of these people were born and reared and people should not be evicted from these farms.  No such power should be given to a Minister whether an Irish Minister or a Minister from another country and no such power should be given to any official.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has ever been interested or who had people belonging to them in this country whose interest had been in the great fight that was made here for the land during the time of the Land League could never have imagined that when an Irish Government would be formed an Irish Minister would bring in a Bill to take such powers.  Such are these powers <Col N="195" /> that any Irishman could get hot under the collar when thinking of them&mdash;to think that people could be thrown out on the road at the wish of a Minister or of a Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>Too much of this kind of legislation has been brought into the House and stood over by Fianna Fáil Ministers. We have had it in other Bills here that Ministers were rigid and would not give way about certain sections even though they knew there were members of their own Party who were not with them and even though they knew that the Opposition were against them and that, if everything were counted up, there would be a solid majority against them&mdash;sections and types of legislation brought in here especially during the past few years.  This is something that will have to be stopped in Dáil Éireann.  It is a negation of democracy.  The prohibition of the sale, transfer, letting or subletting of certain lands without the consent of the Land Commission is a dreadful thing and is a terrible power to put into anybody's hands.</P>
    <P>We are legislating all our powers away in this House.  We gave certain powers to other Ministers and the other Ministers have the brass to come in here and to say: &ldquo;We have no authority in this now.  It is the Department&rdquo;. The Minister says he is responsible for his Department but that he cannot stop his Department from doing anything. If this legislation goes through &mdash;I hope it does not: I hope the Minister will change his mind about this section&mdash;I can see that in the near future people will be coming in here and appealing to the Minister maybe on behalf of his own constituents because the Land Commission are about to do certain things.  I can foresee the Minister following in the footsteps of the Minister for Transport and Power and other Ministers who come here and say: &ldquo;I have no authority in this matter.  The Dáil passed a Bill and gave the authority to my officers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is well that the Land Commission have the power to take over a lot of these very big estates but it is not good that the Land Commission are now getting down to taking power to take <Col N="196" /> over small farms.  That is what this section actually says.  It will only be necessary for any group in the area to cast its eye on one or two small farms and say: &ldquo;We need those&rdquo; and start an agitation.  There is no regard for the owners of the farm.  Also if this section goes through, farms will be sold to the Land Commission at a fraction of their worth.</P>
    <P>I have not expressed myself as forcibly as I should like but I appeal to the Minister to amend section 13. It is well numbered, an unlucky section, and it will be an unlucky day for the people of rural Ireland when a section such as this is passed in Dáil Éireann. My Party will challenge a division and I tell the Fianna Fáil Party that I shall watch with interest the names of the people in that Party who will vote for such legislation.  It will be a mark that can be used against them for whatever time they remain in politics.</P>

      <P>Earlier, on this section, I made the position of the Labour Party pretty clear.  We do not agree with the interpretation given to the section by Fine Gael nor that this section is intended to injure the small farmers or any type of farmer.  We believe it was necessary, if this Bill was to be any good, to have some teeth in it and we believe this section provides the teeth.  We are entirely opposed to the view expressed here for the past couple of hours by Fine Gael speakers and I want to make that very clear because of Deputy Lynch's concluding remarks, about challenging a division, so that nobody will be in any doubt as to why the Labour Party are not opposing the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe it is necessary to ensure that people who, up to now and the type that up to now, have been able to run to the nearest auctioneer and sell their land when they knew the Land Commission proposed to take it over, would be prevented from doing that. Such people are not on the 20, 30, 40 or 50 acre farms but are those with big farms, people getting rid of their land because they are not able to use it.  They are not, in my opinion, of much use to the country.  I do not <Col N="197" /> think there should be so much crocodile tears shed over them here.  It is only fair that these things should be made clear.</P>
    <P>The question of whether or not the Minister or the Land Commission should have the right to direct an inspector has no bearing on the matter because the final acquisition of the land will be decided by the Lay Commissioners and it is most dishonest to suggest that this Bill is intended to give the Minister the right to decide whose land will or will not be taken over.  Every Deputy who has anything to do with the question of land knows that, time and again, a genuine effort is made to have acquired for division among deserving applicants farm lands which are not being used properly.  The rumour goes out that perhaps the lands will be sold to a foreigner as so many of them have been.  But when a report is sent to the Land Commission, unfortunately, it takes months before a decision can be given to inspect the land and by the time inspection has taken place the ownership of the land has changed. In many cases the people who have acquired the land are in a better position to hold off the Land Commission for various reasons or by excuses than the original owner.  In those circumstances I think it right that every effort should be made to ensure that land can be inspected with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister has agreed&mdash;most of us put a good deal of pressure on him before the Recess&mdash;that 12 months was a long time and he said here this afternoon that he is prepared to consider reducing the period to six months.  I do not think it will be such a great hardship.  I do not believe the Land Commission would be able to acquire land for half the value.  That has not been the experience so far: indeed, the latest situation &mdash; this should be well known to those familiar with the position&mdash;is that land bought by the Land Commission often appears to be bought much more dearly than it would be in the open market.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the Land Bonds but that can be straightened out. If the land bonds are not value for <Col N="198" /> what they purport to be, if they are sold quickly, that can surely be put right.  Apart from that, I do not think the arguments made here are valid.  I think it is a good idea that the Minister should have responsibility because he may then be asked questions in this House about such matters and he cannot say that it is a matter for the Land Commission as he and his predecessors have been able to say so often before.</P>
    <P>I want to make clear that the Labour Party are not in agreement with the point of view put here and do not want to be put in a false position by anybody inside or outside the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true of all Deputies, I think, except those from city areas, that they get many representations from people who want land.  A very old friend of mine, the late Deputy McMenamin, God rest him, used say that if you went into a country public house where there were ten people present you might be certain that six or seven of them had applied for land.  I would also be certain that five of that number probably applied in the first instance by going to his local Deputy and asking him to take up the matter with the Land Commission. Whether the Deputy was a member of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or the Labour Party&mdash;I include myself in this&mdash;we are all political animals whether in or out of power and if we are in power we have recourse to the Minister who was a Deputy with us and a friend and colleague.  We can go and talk to him and exercise the influence of a friend and colleague upon him as to whether he should decide to have the land inspected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was absent on other political business in Drogheda Corporation and did not know what Deputy Tully has stated, that the Minister was prepared to reduce the waiting period from twelve to six months, but the moment the inspection of land takes place, is it not true that the number of customers for that land, apart from the Land Commission, is reduced?  Is it not true that nobody wants to buy land on which the Commission has put <Col N="199" /> its finger?  This has been the experience through the years.  The fact that there have been instances&mdash;I think this is what Deputy Tully adverted to&mdash;of the Land Commission going to a public auction or buying land by private treaty at dear prices is no proof that land inspected by the Land Commission does not lose value.  Anything that loses a number of customers loses value and I believe there is not the slightest doubt about it.  My experience has shown this to me, that when the Commission inspect land it loses value.  Land is property and if we want a private enterprise economy, should it not be the position that if property is required for the common good the decision on whether or not it is taken over should be the decision, not of a political person, but of a judicial person?  In many cases of local authority work this can be the county manager. In such cases there is always an appeal for the citizen.  In many cases it can be adjudged.  In many cases it can be arbitrated.  Here we are starting off the first machinery of land acquisition through political persons.  Some three weeks ago a political columnist in a Sunday newspaper produced what was, in fact, a duplicate application form for land, which is normally sent out through the Land Commission except that at the bottom of it it said that it was issued through the local Fianna Fáil cumann. Perhaps in the Fine Gael organisation there is some smart secretary who would think up the same thing if he happened to see a Land Commission application form for land.</P>
    <P>Does this not point to the fact that these political applications&mdash;I have written to the Land Commission as often as any other person&mdash;are wrong? Does it not point to the fact that if the Minister has the right to send in an inspector then the person who has broken bread with the Minister can exert undue influence?  In the past the four Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission had the status of high court judges whether a person's land was taken over.  I went with my own parish priest to the Land Commission <Col N="200" /> court to stop the taking over of land and we succeeded.  If this is so what is to happen if the Minister becomes the political landlord?  He will have the local Fianna Fáil cumann on his doorstep.  It is not democracy if the Minister can start up acquisition proceedings by the time six or 12 months have elapsed.  There is not an auctioneer who will find a customer ready to buy land which the Land Commission has put its finger on.</P>
    <P>It is land which was in the forefront of the national struggle for 700 years. Every war until 1916 was a land war and the people who were in the forefront of those wars were people on the land.  Now we are going to say one political party can start acquisition proceedings by sending in an inspector. We are throwing away our entire heritage and yet nobody seems to think there is anything wrong about it.  I cannot see why the Minister should decide to take unto himself this particular power.  It would be far better that we should leave it in the judicial hands of the four Lay Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In regard to the deteriorated value, I am certain that that deterioration would be more than the 25 per cent mentioned by Deputy Sweetman here today.  I believe something of the order of 50 per cent would be nearer the truth.  Who wants to buy land which will be acquired some time in the following 12 months?  Who is the person who should decide whether there is need for land in a particular area and, if there is, which land should be taken?  I do not want to mention individual cases because that would be quite wrong and it might, in the present circumstances, if this Bill goes through, influence people.  I could mention cases in my own area where there is a question mark over which parcel of land should be taken for land division and there is a very big question mark over whether there is any land for division at all.</P>
    <P>If this Bill goes through the Minister will have Deputies from the Fianna Fáil cumann on his doorstep within a week or two.  I put it to the whole Fianna Fáil Party that they are throwing democracy overboard.  They are <Col N="201" /> invading the rights of the individual and they are doing something which is quite wrong.  It is also a fact that undue pressure can be put on the Minister.  With regard to this question of whether or not land is taken over by the Land Commission, I found the Lay Commissioners very fair in the past.  There have been individual instances of hardship and individual instances of injustice.  I do not say this injustice was deliberate.  If you have a farmer in Ireland today whose family have farmed the land for generation after generation, and this farmer who is now 75 or 80 years of age wishes to leave his entitlement to the parcel of land to a nephew simply and solely because he has no boy of his own, is it right that his occupancy for a short period of ten years should be refused?  His family may have farmed that land for hundreds of years. Is it right that somebody should come along and not give him the right to pass his land on to a relative to carry on the same sort of farming as has been carried on there in the past?</P>
    <P>I believe if the Minister is under pressure it will not be as easy for him as it was for the Lay Commissioners to say that if the land is being farmed as it should be farmed for five or seven years time they will not touch it; that they will allow five or seven years because a nephew will come in then. They will decide whether what was said was in good faith or not.  Will it be as easy for the Minister, with the local Fianna Fáil cumann or the Fine Gael Deputies, if there is a Fine Gael Minister on his doorstep?  We will repeal it if we get into power.  That will not be so long as things are going at present.  I should like to know how the Minister will resist this pressure and how he will decide, with the local representatives of the Fianna Fáil cumann before him, that the matter should be left over for five or seven years, that this family carried on good farming on the farm and now they want five or seven years in which to retire when they will give the land over to a nephew or niece.  It would be quite unwise for the Fianna Fáil Party to put this measure through.  We are going to vote against it and I am <Col N="202" /> sorry the Labour Party are not voting against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make just one comment on the contribution by Deputy Tully.  Deputy Tully has given the impression that he is dealing with the large farmers of 300 or 400 acres.  This section applies to the 20, 25, 30 or 40 acre farmer and if there is a farmer in County Longford who is working a farm which has belonged to his family for generations and somebody gets the inspection notice sent out that farmer will find that his land can then be divided and his right to it taken away.  That is a complete invasion of the rights of the small farmer.  I am not referring to the 200 acre farmer about whom Deputy Tully speaks.  He comes from a county of large farms.  I do not blame him for the way he looks at it. He said he was not going to vote against this section because these large farms were sold and somebody else was about to get them.  If that is Deputy Tully's thinking it is a good job he is in Meath.  He could not make that speech in Longford, in the parish of Columcille, where demand is being sent daily to the Land Commission to inspect even a 25-acre farm because the owner of it at the moment happens to be unable to live on it and had to go to England.  He had to put the lock on the door for a year or two in order to earn a few pounds to set himself back.  According to this section, the sale of that farm would be held up if the man wanted to sell it.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether it is not a fact that in the County Longford the Land Commission has applications to inspect several small holdings, even as small as 15 acres.  Therefore, I cannot for the life of me see how the Labour Party could say there is no difference between the 300, 200, 50, 40, 30 or 15-acre farms.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Party seem to be losing sight of the fact that it is not the Minister who will decide whether or not the farm is taken over. All he can do is have it inspected.  He cannot decide to take it over or do anything further about it.  God knows <Col N="203" /> every Deputy in this House has made representations up to now to the Land Commission about farms and asked to have them taken over whether they be big or small.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt in the world but that the implications of the enactment of the particular section we are discussing tonight plays down to the basic feelings of greed and avarice.  In that respect we are aware of the deterioration in the normal neighbourly relations among people working on the land over the last year or two, when this thing was mooted.  That is a fact.  I know it and I have resisted it where demands have been made by people to have farms acquired for division merely because the owners, through an act of Providence or because of ill-health, were not in a position to work their farms as one would wish them worked, or just because there was an appearance&mdash;temporary it is to be hoped&mdash; of a set-back in a particular family circumstances.  We had at one time the glorious tradition of neighbours flocking around to help a neighbour or friend out of whatever difficulty he or she was in at a particular time. <Col N="204" /> Now when a person runs into difficulty we find he is not helped out, but what he has is to be taken from him and divided among his neighbours.</P>
      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that I, too, have made submissions to the Land Commission, even within the past five days, to have a large sized farm purchased and acquired by the Land Commission.  I would hope if they had done so they would not let it year after year.  I would say to Deputy Tully that we would require an adequate pool of land to be divided and re-allocated among those people who have uneconomic holdings at this moment.  I want to know what answer the Minister has in relation to the land which is already in the possession of the Land Commission year after year and which has been let for other purposes and not sub-divided.  If that were disposed of then the Minister could say he was not bereft of any pool of land to divide among those who were deserving at all times.  Until this is decided, this section stinks for those people who have dearly won the right of fixity of tenure to live on their holdings to this moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with Questions Nos. 178 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>The five media specifically referred to by the Deputy in Question No. 179 have not so far been used to bring this matter of smoking and health to public notice.  I feel strongly that the most effective and productive propaganda regarding the dangers of smoking must be that addressed directly to young people who, if they have not already formed the smoking habit, are entering the environment where they will meet strong temptation to do so.  To this end, over the last few years, several hundred thousand copies of my Department's leaflet &ldquo;Starting to Smoke?&rdquo; have been issued to children in their final year at school.  This distribution will be continued.  Furthermore the reverend editor of &ldquo;Our Boys&rdquo; and &ldquo;An Gael Og&rdquo; is very kindly providing some space free of charge in these publications each month for advertisements which were specially prepared by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year my Department published a summary of surveys of the evidence to date on smoking in relation to health.  Copies of this summary are being distributed to teachers, clergy, <Col N="68" /> members of local authorities, doctors, dentists and others in a position to influence public thinking on this subject. If it appears to me that other advertising media could effectively be used in this propaganda campaign I will, of course, make use of them.</P>
    <P>As regards the cost of this publicity campaign I would draw the Deputy's attention to the reply given on my behalf to a question on the same lines which he put down on 21st March, 1962 (Dáil Debates, Volume 194, Columns 173 and 174).  As it has been the practice, where health propaganda material generally is concerned, to have it prepared and published by my Department, no expenditure by local authorities is incurred specifically on the preparation of such material and such expenditure as the authorities may incur in distributing it is part of their general administrative expenses.</P>

      <P>(a) The total receipts from tobacco are shown in the column 2 of the following table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards (b) the bulk of the revenue is obtained from raw leaf imported for manufacture into cigarettes, pipe tobaccos and other products.  The duties on the leaf are collected without reference to end use and, accordingly, accurate statistics of the receipts from leaf used in the manufacture of cigarettes are not available.  However, the <Col N="71" /> figures in column (4) of the table indicate broadly the percentage of the receipts from raw leaf derived from leaf used in the manufacture of cigarettes.  The great bulk of the balance <Col N="72" /> of the receipts from raw leaf would be derived from leaf used in the production of pipe tobacco with comparatively insignificant receipts coming from leaf used in the manufacture of snuff and cigars.</P>
